TOKYO — Japan still faces deep structural problems. Its population is aging and dwindling. China has stepped up its manufacturing game. Corporate stalwarts like Toshiba and Kobe Steel have stumbled.

Investors appear to be looking at the bright side.

Japan’s main stock index rose to its highest level in almost 21 years on Wednesday, buoyed by a broad rally in global markets as well as growing optimism about the Japanese economy. The surge came despite the continuing problems at Kobe Steel, a Japanese stock market stalwart. Its shares sank sharply for a second day after revelations that it had falsified data about the quality of aluminum and copper products shipped to hundreds of customers.

In large part, Japan’s stronger stock market is part of a global rise in optimism. Stock market measures in the United States have also hit new highs in recent weeks, while stocks in South Korea also hit a record on Wednesday. Markets have been lifted by robust global growth and expanding corporate profits, as the world finally appears to be shrugging off years of crises and sluggish growth.

But Japan has some of its own good news to share.

Japan’s gross domestic product has expanded for six consecutive quarters, the first time it has gone that long without a contraction in 11 years. Unemployment is at multidecade lows, and corporations are experiencing a surge in profits. Even Japan’s longtime economic bugbear — persistent wage and price deflation — has eased, with both consumer prices and incomes showing modest gains.

“We expected that there might be processes happening over thousands of years preceding the eruption,” said Christy Till, a geologist at Arizona State, and Ms. Shamloo’s dissertation adviser. Instead, the outer rims of the crystals revealed a clear uptick in temperature and a change in composition that occurred on a rapid time scale.

The time scale is the blink of an eye, geologically speaking. It’s even shorter than a previous study that found that another ancient supervolcano beneath California’s Long Valley caldera awoke hundreds of years before its eruption. As such, scientists are just now starting to realize that the conditions that lead to supereruptions might emerge within a human lifetime.

“It’s shocking how little time is required to take a volcanic system from being quiet and sitting there to the edge of an eruption,” said Ms. Shamloo, though she warned that there’s more work to do before scientists can verify a precise time scale.

Dr. Kari Cooper, a geochemist at the University of California, Davis who was not involved in the research, said Ms. Shamloo and Dr. Till’s research offered more insights into the time frames of supereruptions, although she is not yet convinced that scientists can pin down the precise trigger of the last Yellowstone event. Geologists must now figure out what kick-starts the rapid movements leading up to supereruptions.

“It’s one thing to think about this slow gradual buildup — it’s another thing to think about how you mobilize 1,000 cubic kilometers of magma in a decade,” she said.

As the research advances, scientists hope they will be able to spot future supereruptions in the making. The odds of Yellowstone, or any other supervolcano, erupting anytime soon are small. But understanding the largest eruptions can only help scientists better understand, and therefore forecast, the entire spectrum of volcanic eruptions — something that Dr. Cooper thinks will be possible in a matter of decades.",A Surprise From the Supervolcano Under Yellowstone,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/science/yellowstone-volcano-eruption.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Last November, news of the “Mud Men” chat spread like wildfire.

Students started noticing the racist chat on the morning of Nov. 11 when freshmen who were targeted posted screenshots of the threats on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, forcing students inside the Penn bubble — and plenty outside of it — to pay attention. Black organizations sent a barrage of emails and texts to their constituencies about the situation and began to plan for an emergency town hall. By the afternoon, the news had been picked up by national civil rights activists, including Shaun King and DeRay Mckesson. The news was trending on Twitter for hours before the school issued an official response.

There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of Penn’s black freshmen and in turn, Penn’s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.

The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on Penn’s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.

That problem is not exclusive to the University of Pennsylvania: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.

Don’t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat’s existence. I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.

Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the Penn administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.

Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.

The racist chat appeared to have been created in Oklahoma, but for the creator to have known so many members of the black freshman class, he or she would have to have been at Penn. So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus. There were multiple individuals who were taunting students on this chat, and all were anonymized by pseudonyms. So the big questions were: How many people were involved? Would they act on their covert threats? How much of the population of the school did they speak for? The chats also included a racial taunt that invoked the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, some chapters of which have been shut down at other campuses for racist behavior. (The Penn S.A.E. chapter immediately denounced the online attacks.)

Working with the F.B.I., the administration was able to identify the creator of the GroupMe chat within a few weeks — a student at the University of Oklahoma who had been accepted to Penn but chose not to attend. The student was suspended, and both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Oklahoma issued condemnations of his actions. Ultimately, the investigation found that no Penn students were involved in the chat. But these kinds of incidents make black and brown students increasingly wary.

GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It’s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.

An anonymous attack on GroupMe doesn’t feel that different from racist propaganda in “real life.” Just a few months ago, someone put up neo-Nazi recruitment fliers around campus. They were promptly removed, but the incident had an important thing in common with the GroupMe disaster: anonymity.

The creator of the GroupMe and the people who hung the fliers hid their names and faces, putting the students they were targeting in the precarious position of questioning who to trust.

Like “Do No Harm,” “Admissions” is wandering and ruminative, an overland trek through the doctor’s anxieties and private shames. Once again, he recounts his miscalculations and surgical catastrophes, citing the French doctor René Leriche’s observation that all surgeons carry cemeteries within themselves of the patients whose lives they’ve lost. Once again, he rails against the constraints of an increasingly depersonalized British health care system, which mummifies its doctors in spools of red tape. Once again, he describes his operating theater in all of its Grand Guignol splendor, with brains swelling beyond their skulls and suction devices “slurping obscenely” as tumors evade his reach.

Some of the procedures are surprisingly crude. They’re basically carpentry with blood. (Carpentry, the old-fashioned kind, is actually one of Marsh’s most passionate hobbies.)

But in this book, Marsh has retired, which means he’s taking a thorough inventory of his life. His reflections and recollections make “Admissions” an even more introspective memoir than his first, if such a thing is possible. And because he’s getting older, his own mortality has become a central preoccupation — if his brain were a pie chart, death would be a fairly substantial slice.

Much of “Admissions” also takes place abroad, because Marsh spends the first phase of his retirement in Nepal, working alongside his friend Dev, who has set up a private hospital for neurosurgery in Kathmandu. Marsh has thus been turned into a foreign correspondent, reporting on how medicine is practiced in this poor, polyethnic country, recently ravaged by civil war. Among his most sobering observations: “Only in America have I seen so much treatment devoted to so many people with such little chance of making a useful recovery.”

Yet the reasons are different. The patients Dev treats don’t feel entitled to these operations so much as dazzled by them, with an “exaggerated faith” in their success. “They have no conception of brain damage,” Dev tells Marsh. “They think that if the patient is alive they might recover.” Many patients (or their families) refuse to accept it when Dev tells them that an operation is not worth it or too dangerous.

It’s a tragedy. The results of a superfluous brain surgery — or a botched one — are grim, and if Dev’s procedures go awry, the angriest families don’t just complain or sue, as they do in England. They threaten violence. Dev’s daughter was once kidnapped at gunpoint for a ransom.

“Admissions” contains other cross-cultural musings. Marsh riffs on the excesses of American medicine, which continue to amaze him. Shortly before retiring, he visited the Texas Medical Center in Houston, where he was shown an electric screwdriver for securing titanium plates into the skull. It was state-of-the-art, likely expensive; he estimated it would save five seconds over a manual one. He was similarly shocked (and spooked) when he saw trainees practicing surgery on a severed head — where did they get it? No one had a clue. When Marsh returned to England two weeks later, he told a colleague about it.

“Only one?” the colleague replied. “I had 15 heads, freeze-dried, flown in from the U.S. for my skull base workshop last year.”

The most startling aspect of “Admissions,” however, has nothing to do with medicine. It’s how Marsh portrays himself. As a young man, he writes, he was close to suicidal and spent time in a psychiatric hospital. At the same time, he adds, he “always was a tremendous show-off.”

He also struggled with aggression and he continues to do so — he’s competitive and impatient and has a bad temper. He had an adulterous affair at some point, and at another went through a bitter divorce. He ended his career in an almost vaudevillian gesture of ignominy, tweaking the nose of a male nurse who refused to remove a patient’s nasogastric tube.

He also ended a long, meaningful friendship with a Ukrainian surgeon he had annually visited and assisted. Though he probably did so for the right reasons. The particulars are best left to be read.

Marsh’s retirement is busy but anxious. For the first time, he feels a real kinship with his patients. The older he gets, the more likely it becomes that he’ll have to face the same irresolvable dilemmas they did about prolonging life. “We have to choose between probabilities, not certainties, and that is difficult,” he writes. “How probable is it that we will gain how many extra years of life, and what might the quality of those years be?”

He’s terrified of dying in a hospital, cared for by fleets of indifferent strangers. He opens “Admissions” by telling us he’s acquired a suicide kit, in case his death is painful and slow, and he closes with a civilized discussion of euthanasia. But he confesses he doesn’t know if he’d ever have the courage to hasten his own death. Which may be his most profound admission of all.","A Surgeon Not Afraid to Face His Mistakes, In and Out of the Operating Room",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/books/review-admissions-life-as-brain-surgeon-henry-marsh.html

And it gave us another reminder that Mr. Trump is hellbent on abdicating the leadership on climate change Mr. Obama worked so hard to achieve — first with a suite of regulatory measures and then by making an emissions-reduction pledge at the 2015 Paris climate summit meeting strong enough to induce 194 other nations to sign on to what had all the makings of a historic global agreement.

Under that agreement, nations submitted voluntary pledges to curb their emissions in the near term and to ratchet up their efforts in the future; the idea was to limit the rise in global warming to well below two degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. To that end, Mr. Obama promised that the United States, which accounts for one-fifth of the world’s emissions, would lower its emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The administration later published a report sketching out various technological pathways to cutting emissions 80 percent or more by 2050.

Then along came Mr. Trump, who in March ordered the destruction or delay of nearly every building block that supported Mr. Obama’s pledge — rules aimed at increasing fuel efficiency of cars and trucks; rules aimed at limiting emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from oil and gas wells; rules aimed at increasing the energy efficiency of appliances; and most important of all, the Clean Power Plan. Not long afterward, Mr. Trump commanded his secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke, to reverse Mr. Obama’s efforts to limit oil and gas exploration in Arctic waters and on sensitive federal lands, a task to which Mr. Zinke has fallen with great enthusiasm and which, if successful, will further increase the carbon emissions the world is trying to limit.

Given all these orders, Mr. Trump’s decision in June to withdraw from the Paris agreement, though deeply demoralizing to the entire world, seemed in practical terms almost superfluous.

Some experts say that all is not lost, that it is still possible for the United States to hit its Paris targets. Aggressive state and local policies as well as market forces and technological improvements have already reduced emissions about 12 percent below 2005 levels. These include a huge switch to gas from coal, which once supplied more than half the country’s electricity and now supplies only a third; the steadily dropping cost of wind and solar energy; and more efficient vehicles, buildings and appliances. Further progress along these lines, without any federal help, could yield a total emissions reduction of 15 to 19 percent. One particularly bright note is that many states, including California and New York, are already moving ahead of the targets set by the Clean Power Plan.

Those same experts, however, also concede that federal help is crucial, both in limiting emissions from existing sources and in promoting alternative fuels and new technologies. This administration shows no interest in either. Mr. Pruitt, in fact, used the occasion of his triumphant dismissal of the Clean Power Plan to say he would love to get rid of the federal subsidies that have been and remain vital to the development of wind and solar power, while saying nary a word about the lavish subsidies for the oil industry.

Like some of Mr. Trump’s other rollbacks, the power plant decision will be fought in court by some states and by environmental groups. The E.P.A. is required by law to regulate carbon dioxide emissions in some fashion, but so far Mr. Pruitt has not proposed a substitute plan. The betting is that if he does, it won’t amount to much, surely not the closing of any coal-fired plants.

No deaths or safety incidents have been attributed to Kobe Steel.
All of Japan’s major carmakers — Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota — are looking into their use of Kobe Steel materials.
The improperly certified metals had been shipped to about 200 companies, but Kobe Steel declined to reveal their names.","Last week, Nissan Motor said unqualified staff members had carried out inspections at its factories, prompting the carmaker to recall 1.2 million vehicles, though it was not clear if the quality of the vehicles had been affected. Mitsubishi Motors and Suzuki Motor both admitted last year that they had been exaggerating the fuel economy of their vehicles by cheating on tests.

Perhaps the biggest blow to Japan’s reputation for quality has come from Takata, the airbag maker that was at the center of the largest auto safety recall in history, involving tens of millions of vehicles. Its faulty airbags have been blamed for more than a dozen deaths. Takata declared bankruptcy in June.

Toshiaki Oguchi, director of Governance for Owners Japan, a corporate watchdog, said that Japanese companies were generally diligent about quality, but that when cheating occurred — because of competitive pressure or other factors — it could too easily go unchecked. Japanese companies, he said, tend to discourage thorough examination or criticism, either from employees or from independent outsiders.

“When something goes wrong, companies always hire a committee of outsiders to examine what happened,” Mr. Oguchi said. “But why not be proactive? Why not have people reviewing procedures all the time?”

The extent of the problems at Kobe Steel are still unfolding.

Kobe Steel said on Sunday that employees at four of its factories had altered inspection certificates on aluminum and copper products from September 2016 to August this year. The changes, it said, made it look as if the products met manufacturing specifications required by customers — including for vital qualities like tensile strength, a measure of stiffness — when they did not.

On Wednesday, the company said it was investigating possible data falsification involving another product, powdered steel, which is used mostly to make gears. The company said the powdered steel it was examining had been sold to one customer it did not name.

Kobe Steel added that it was examining other possible episodes of data falsification going back 10 years. The company did not provide significant details on the discrepancies, making it difficult to immediately determine if they posed a safety threat. No deaths or safety incidents have been attributed to Kobe Steel.

The company’s share price dropped sharply on Tuesday, the first day of trading after a holiday, and as of Wednesday morning in Tokyo had lost about one-third of its value since last week.

“The falsification problem has become an issue that could destroy international faith in Japanese manufacturing,” the Japanese financial newspaper Nikkei said in an article on Tuesday.

Even as Japan has given up its lead in technologies like televisions, cellphones and computers, it still excels in highly valued products used behind the scenes, including precision machinery, specialty chemicals, sensors and cameras.

Quality helps Japan preserve its markets overseas despite intense competition. Although China is the world’s largest steel maker, Japan still exports large amounts of iron and steel there.

One of the products at the center of the scandal, rolled aluminum, is widely used in the transportation industry because it is light. The lighter a car, train or airplane, the less fuel required to propel it.

Global manufacturers are now trying to assess their exposure, as they dig through an extensive supply chain.

A big car company like G.M. buys millions of tons of steel a year from a dozen or two dozen producers, in a variety of grades and forms. Steel can be sourced from different mills and shipped to any number of plants worldwide. G.M., for example, has 12 vehicle assembly plants and six stamping plants in the United States alone, all of which take deliveries of steel from many different producers.

All of Japan’s major carmakers — Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota — are looking into their use of Kobe Steel materials. Toyota called the data falsification a “grave issue” and said it was looking into the problem and considering how best to respond, a statement echoed by other carmakers. Ford and General Motors are trying to determine whether they have used the company’s products.

Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which makes equipment for Shinkansen high-speed trains in Japan, said it was investigating. JR Tokai, a railway company that operates the busiest Shinkansen route in Japan, between Tokyo and Osaka, said that the data discrepancies “do not present a problem in terms of design standards,” but that it was nonetheless considering whether to replace certain train components.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries uses aluminum from Kobe Steel in a midsize aircraft it is developing, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, as well as aircraft components it supplies to Boeing.

Boeing said in a statement, “Nothing in our review to date leads us to conclude that this issue presents a safety concern, and we will continue to work diligently with our suppliers to complete our investigation.”

Kobe Steel’s problem points to “a common organization issue,” said Shin Ushijima, a lawyer who serves as president of the Japan Corporate Governance Network. He drew parallels between Kobe Steel and Takata and Mitsubishi, as well as with financial-reporting improprieties at Toshiba, which admitted to overstating profit in 2015.

“Boards aren’t doing their jobs,” he said. “This isn’t an issue that can be solved by the president resigning. There needs to be wholesale change.”

He added, “The Kobe Steel case is a test of whether we’ve learned anything from Toshiba and these other issues.”

Kobe Steel said it had confirmed data falsification affecting roughly 19,300 tons of flat-rolled and extruded aluminum products, 19,400 units of aluminum casting and forgings, and 2,200 tons of copper products. The amount was about 4 percent of the company’s output of those products from September 2016 to August.

The company said that it had received no reports from customers of problems with the affected products, and that the falsification had been discovered during an internal review. The improperly certified metals had been shipped to about 200 companies, but Kobe Steel declined to reveal their names.

It said “tens” of employees and managers had been directly involved in the falsification, although no penalties against the employees were immediately announced. The company is still investigating.",Kobe Steel’s Falsified Data Is Another Blow to Japan’s Reputation,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/business/kobe-steel-japan.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

In labeling Mr. Corker “liddle,” the president was evidently returning to a theme. He considered Mr. Corker for secretary of state during the transition after last year’s election but was reported to have told associates that Mr. Corker, at 5-foot-7, was too short to be the nation’s top diplomat. Instead, Mr. Trump picked Rex W. Tillerson, who is several inches taller but whose own relationship with the president has deteriorated to the point that he was said to have called Mr. Trump a “moron.”

Mr. Tillerson initially did not deny it, but later he had a spokeswoman insist that he did not say it. Mr. Trump chose to believe the denial, or at least said he did, but in an interview published Tuesday, he insisted that even if it was true, he could prove that he was actually smarter than his secretary of state.

“I think it’s fake news,” Mr. Trump told Forbes magazine. “But if he did that, I guess we’ll have to compare I.Q. tests. And I can tell you who is going to win.”

Mr. Trump later denied that he had demeaned his secretary of state. “I didn’t undercut anybody. I don’t believe in undercutting people,” he told reporters, in a comment that must have amused the many people he has undercut since taking office. Asked if he still had confidence in Mr. Tillerson, Mr. Trump said simply, “Yes.”

At the time, Mr. Trump was sitting next to Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state who happened to be visiting the Oval Office on Tuesday. To be sure, Mr. Kissinger would hardly tower over Mr. Corker on the basketball court, but Mr. Trump, perhaps wisely, did not risk challenging the former diplomat to an I.Q. contest.

After the meeting with Mr. Kissinger, the president headed to a lunch with Mr. Tillerson, who was joined by a mediator, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said they “had a great visit” and denied that Mr. Trump was serious about the I.Q. test. “He made a joke, nothing more than that,” she said.

Mr. Trump was not joking when he took a shot earlier in the day at Jemele Hill, the ESPN host who has called him a white supremacist and was suspended on Monday for suggesting a boycott of the Dallas Cowboys’ advertisers if the team punished players who protested racial injustice by kneeling during the national anthem.

“With Jemele Hill at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have ‘tanked,’ in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.

He made no mention of the other dust-up in his household. In an interview aired on Monday to promote her new memoir, Ivana Trump, his first wife, told ABC News that “I’m basically first Trump wife, O.K.? I’m first lady, O.K.?”

That did not sit well with Melania Trump, his third wife and the actual first lady, who issued a retort through a spokeswoman dismissing what she called “attention-seeking and self-serving noise.”

Andy Cohen, the creator of the “Real Housewives” reality television show franchise, found that too rich. “This is actually happening,” he wrote on Twitter. “All the wives are fighting. Even I AM SPEECHLESS.”

Mr. Trump’s gibe at Mr. Corker echoed his name calling during the presidential campaign when he labeled Senator Marco Rubio of Florida “Little Marco,” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas “Lyin’ Ted” and Hillary Clinton “Crooked Hillary.” He has used belittling nicknames to diminish political foes since taking office, as well — think “Cryin’ Chuck” Schumer, “Psycho Joe” Scarborough and “Little Rocket Man” Kim Jong-un — but has generally avoided doing so with powerful Republican committee chairmen who control appointments and legislation.

It was not clear what Mr. Trump meant when he said The Times set up Mr. Corker by recording him. Angry that Mr. Corker had suggested he was an agent of “chaos,” Mr. Trump lashed out at the senator on Sunday by saying he “didn’t have the guts” to run for another term. A Times reporter then interviewed Mr. Corker by telephone and recorded the call with the senator’s knowledge and consent. Mr. Corker’s staff also recorded the call, and he said he wanted The Times to do the same.

“I know they’re recording it, and I hope you are, too,” Mr. Corker told the reporter.

During the interview, Mr. Corker said Mr. Trump’s advisers were struggling to keep the president under control. “I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it’s a situation of trying to contain him,” he said. He also said Mr. Trump’s reckless statements could put the country on a path “towards World War III.”

Mr. Trump on Tuesday rejected the suggestion that he was risking a nuclear war. “We were on the wrong path before,” he said, presumably referring to North Korea. “All you have to do is take a look. If you look over the last 25 years through numerous administrations, we were on a path to a very big problem, a problem like this world has never seen. We’re on the right path right now, believe me.”

But what a path. Ms. Ouellette, who has written or edited several books on reality television, including “Better Living Through Reality TV,” said Mr. Trump the president had gone even further than Mr. Trump the reality show star ever did.

“This has exceeded what would have been allowed on ‘The Apprentice,’” she said. “It’s almost a magnification. It’s like reality TV unleashed.

Steven L. Hall, a former chief of Russian operations at the C.I.A., said his former agency never used Kaspersky software, but other federal agencies did.","Like most security software, Kaspersky Lab’s products require access to everything stored on a computer in order to scour it for viruses or other dangers. Its popular antivirus software scans for signatures of malicious software, or malware, then removes or neuters it before sending a report back to Kaspersky. That procedure, routine for such software, provided a perfect tool for Russian intelligence to exploit to survey the contents of computers and retrieve whatever they found of interest.

The National Security Agency and the White House declined to comment for this article. The Israeli Embassy declined to comment, and the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Russian hackers had stolen classified N.S.A. materials from a contractor using the Kaspersky software on his home computer. But the role of Israeli intelligence in uncovering that breach and the Russian hackers’ use of Kaspersky software in the broader search for American secrets have not previously been disclosed.

Kaspersky Lab denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, the Russian hacking. “Kaspersky Lab has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,” the company said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. Kaspersky Lab also said it “respectfully requests any relevant, verifiable information that would enable the company to begin an investigation at the earliest opportunity.”

The Kaspersky-related breach is only the latest bad news for the security of American intelligence secrets. It does not appear to be related to a devastating leak of N.S.A. hacking tools last year to a group, still unidentified, calling itself the Shadow Brokers, which has placed many of them online. Nor is it evidently connected to a parallel leak of hacking data from the C.I.A. to WikiLeaks, which has posted classified C.I.A. documents regularly under the name Vault7.

For years, there has been speculation that Kaspersky’s popular antivirus software might provide a back door for Russian intelligence. More than 60 percent, or $374 million, of the company’s $633 million in annual sales come from customers in the United States and Western Europe. Among them have been nearly two dozen American government agencies — including the State Department, the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Justice Department, Treasury Department and the Army, Navy and Air Force.

The N.S.A. bans its analysts from using Kaspersky antivirus at the agency, in large part because the agency has exploited antivirus software for its own foreign hacking operations and knows the same technique is used by its adversaries.

“Antivirus is the ultimate back door,” Blake Darché, a former N.S.A. operator and co-founder of Area 1 Security. “It provides consistent, reliable and remote access that can be used for any purpose, from launching a destructive attack to conducting espionage on thousands or even millions of users.”

On Sept. 13, the Department of Homeland Security ordered all federal executive branch agencies to stop using Kaspersky products, giving agencies 90 days to remove the software. Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine C. Duke cited the “information security risks” presented by Kaspersky and said the company’s antivirus and other software “provide broad access to files” and “can be exploited by malicious cyber actors to compromise” federal computer systems.

That directive, which some officials thought was long overdue, was based, in large part, on intelligence gleaned from Israel’s 2014 intrusion into Kaspersky’s corporate systems. It followed months of discussions among intelligence officials, which included a study of how Kaspersky’s software works and the company’s suspected ties with the Kremlin.

“The risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky,” D.H.S. said in its statement, “could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security.”

Kaspersky Lab did not discover the Israeli intrusion into its systems until mid-2015, when a Kaspersky engineer testing a new detection tool noticed unusual activity in the company’s network. The company investigated and detailed its findings in June 2015 in a public report.

The report did not name Israel as the intruder but noted that the breach bore striking similarities to a previous attack, known as “Duqu,” which researchers had attributed to the same nation states responsible for the infamous Stuxnet cyberweapon. Stuxnet was a joint American-Israeli operation that successfully infiltrated Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility, and used malicious code to destroy a fifth of Iran’s uranium centrifuges in 2010.

Kaspersky reported that its attackers had used the same algorithm and some of the same code as Duqu, but noted that in many ways it was even more sophisticated. So the company researchers named the new attack Duqu 2.0, noting that other victims of the attack were prime Israeli targets.

Among the targets Kaspersky uncovered were hotels and conference venues used for closed-door meetings by members of the United Nations Security Council to negotiate the terms of the Iran nuclear deal — negotiations from which Israel was excluded. Several targets were in the United States, which suggested that the operation was Israel’s alone, not a joint American-Israeli operation like Stuxnet.

Kaspersky’s researchers noted that attackers had managed to burrow deep into the company’s computers and evade detection for months. Investigators later discovered that the Israeli hackers had implanted multiple back doors into Kaspersky’s systems, employing sophisticated tools to steal passwords, take screenshots, and vacuum up emails and documents.

In its June 2015 report, Kaspersky noted that its attackers seemed primarily interested in the company’s work on nation-state attacks, particularly Kaspersky’s work on the “Equation Group” — its private industry term for the N.S.A. — and the “Regin” campaign, another industry term for a hacking unit inside the United Kingdom’s intelligence agency, the Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ.

Israeli intelligence officers informed the N.S.A. that in the course of their Kaspersky hack, they uncovered evidence that Russian government hackers were using Kaspersky’s access to aggressively scan for American government classified programs, and pulling any findings back to Russian intelligence systems. They provided their N.S.A. counterparts with solid evidence of the Kremlin campaign in the form of screenshots and other documentation, according to the people briefed on the events.

It is not clear whether, or to what degree, Eugene V. Kaspersky, the founder of Kaspersky Lab, and other company employees have been complicit in the hacking using their products. Technical experts say that at least in theory, Russian intelligence hackers could have exploited Kaspersky’s worldwide deployment of software and sensors without the company’s cooperation or knowledge. Another possibility is that Russian intelligence officers might have infiltrated the company without the knowledge of its executives.

But experts on Russia say that under President Vladimir V. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, businesses asked for assistance by Russian spy agencies may feel they have no choice but to give it. To refuse might well invite hostile action from the government against the business or its leaders. Mr. Kaspersky, who attended an intelligence institute and served in Russia’s Ministry of Defense, would have few illusions about the cost of refusing a Kremlin request.

Steven L. Hall, a former chief of Russian operations at the C.I.A., said his former agency never used Kaspersky software, but other federal agencies did. By 2013, he said, Kaspersky officials were “trying to do damage control and convince the U.S. government that it was just another security company.”

He didn’t buy it, Mr. Hall said. “I had the gravest concerns about Kaspersky, and anyone who worked on Russia or in counterintelligence shared those concerns,” he said.",How Israel Caught Russian Hackers Scouring the World for U.S. Secrets,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/technology/kaspersky-lab-israel-russia-hacking.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

“It feels like a brutal reminder of another time,” said Jonathan Marc Sherman, a playwright and friend. “It’s going to be a long time for a lot of us to wrap our minds around this one.”

Best known for the 2010 Broadway musical “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson,” Mr. Friedman leaves behind several uncompleted shows, including a musical adaptation of “All the President’s Men” — a project he had excitedly presented in June to the book’s receptive authors, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.

Now his friends and family are struggling to rewind the events of the summer, asking what they, or Mr. Friedman, could have done in response to signs of trouble.

“I wish I could have done more,” said the director Michael Greif (“Dear Evan Hansen,” “Rent”). “I wish I had known more. I wish I could have interceded more. I wish that I could have found a way to let Michael let me be a better friend to him, and I regret that I wasn’t able to do that.”

Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater, where Mr. Friedman worked off and on for 20 years, called his death “a real warning shot across the bow for anybody who thinks this disease isn’t deadly any more.”

“It just killed one of the most brilliant and promising people in the American theater,” he said.

‘Things Were Getting Better’

Mr. Friedman had a new job this year, one seemingly perfect for a musical-theater obsessive. He was the artistic director of Encores! Off-Center, an annual New York City Center summer program that presents short-run concert revivals of Off Broadway shows.

“The guy was an encyclopedia,” said Anne Kauffman, who met Mr. Friedman in 1999 at the Williamstown Theater Festival, and who he chose to direct his first Encores! production, “Assassins.”

“He wanted his pals there — it felt like, we had been children together, and now he’d got a grown-up job, and he was like, ‘Hey, do this with me’,” she said.

Tall, gangly and gay, he was an outsized presence — exuberant and emotional, witty and irreverent, opinionated and self-doubting. “When he was at City Center, you knew he was in the halls,” said Arlene Shuler, the performing arts center’s president and chief executive.

But it was also obvious to his collaborators that he was not well. Always thin, he now seemed gaunt. He complained of recurrent gastrointestinal trouble.

Most disturbing, there were purple splotches on his face. Several people who saw him early this summer said they thought the spots looked like the lesions associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma, but then dismissed that thought.

“Of course the first thing you think of is KS, because of all those images from the ’80s, but then the other part of you is, ‘It’s 2017, so of course that’s not what it is; he has some other issue’,” said Trip Cullman, a director and close friend. “I was very concerned, and would try to bring it up as much as I could, but I also knew how much he valued privacy, and didn’t want to be pushy. I obviously very much regret that now.”

In mid-July, Mr. Friedman made it to the first two performances of “Assassins,” but with obvious difficulty.

“The day of the opening, we walked up five stairs, and got to the top, and Michael was completely winded,” said Sam Pinkleton, a choreographer and the associate artistic director of Encores! Off-Center. “Then he pulled me and others aside and told us that he was diagnosed positive. My gut response was, I know a lot of people who are H.I.V. positive, and this is not what they’re like — this is somebody whose body is in the process of being cannibalized.”

On July 14, Mr. Friedman showed up for a meet-and-greet with the cast of a second show, “The Bubbly Black Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin,” and then went straight to the hospital.

“He said he had HIV, he was going to the emergency room, and could I bring him a phone charger,” recalled Daniel Goldstein, a director and writer who also befriended him at Williamstown. “They had caught it at a rather advanced stage, but the drugs were working, and we all thought things were getting better.”

Mr. Friedman, who had health insurance as an employee of the Public Theater, where he was an artist-in-residence and director of an audience engagement program, had known he was H.I.V. positive only since early July, when he was tested by his primary care physician, according to his sister, Marion Friedman Young. He began taking antiretroviral medications that month.

His first hospital stay lasted 10 days, before he was sent home to recuperate. His immune system had been compromised, but his friends and family were hopeful that over time he would make a recovery. By text, he kept friends updated on his progress. By email, he was outlining plans for next summer.

“Every part of me expected him to break through the door of City Center, with an IV hooked up to his arm, shouting something, and the fact that he didn’t frightened me, a lot,” Mr. Pinkleton said. “This was somebody I’d watched be an aircraft carrier for 10 years, and he turned into a baby bird.”

On Aug. 19, he was readmitted to NYU Langone Medical Center with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He spent the rest of his life in the intensive care unit, intubated and periodically sedated. Family was with him daily; friends visited as much as possible.

When he was awake, he would converse by writing down his thoughts and showing them to visitors. But there were moments of stillness as well. “Often we were just being silent,” Mr. Goldstein said, “holding hands and watching the U.S. Open.”

In early September, his doctors detected another infection, and his body was not strong enough to fight it off. The consensus among his friends is that Mr. Friedman had waited too long to seek medical attention.

“As near as I can tell, he hadn’t actually been to a doctor or gotten tested for a couple of years, and only in July did he find out that he was H.I.V. positive,” Mr. Eustis said “That’s just staggering — staggeringly wrong of Michael, staggeringly upsetting.”

Upsetting, and poignant too. Mr. Friedman and several close collaborators were hoping to pursue a sequel to “A Chorus Line.” The original musical, about a group of auditioning dancers, was set in 1975; the sequel would have been set a decade later, as that same generation of dreamers was laid waste by AIDS.

‘Make This Piece for Him’

The cast of “The Abominables,” tricked out in hockey uniforms, was in-line skating around the stage at the Children’s Theater Company in Minneapolis, a few hours before opening. One of them was costumed as a Yeti.

It was Friday, Sept. 15, six days after Mr. Friedman died, and the week had been wildly emotional. On Sunday, the theater’s artistic director, Peter C. Brosius, had informed the cast that Mr. Friedman, the show’s composer and lyricist, had died the day before. He chose his words carefully, because many of the actors were children and had never met Mr. Friedman.

“The American theater has lost an original voice,” he recalled saying. “We’ve been given a great honor and responsibility to make this piece for him.”

Then on Tuesday, the show’s director and book writer, Steven Cosson, had set aside his own grief — he was Mr. Friedman’s most frequent collaborator and a close friend — to urge the cast to have fun with the show. “I didn’t want anyone to feel bad about enjoying this play,” Mr. Cosson said. “That’s why we made it, and that’s what he would want to happen.”

So now it was time to open, and it was hard to untangle the excitement from the sadness. “It’s on us to give it the life it deserves,” said Reed Sigmund, one of the adult performers.

“The Abominables,” as a musical for family audiences, was a new venture for Mr. Friedman, whose astonishing output had already included musicalizations of Shakespeare’s comedy “Love’s Labour’s Lost” and Jonathan Lethem’s novel “The Fortress of Solitude.”

He was a founding associate artist with The Civilians, a downtown documentary theater troupe, and with them he had honed his gift for making music out of everyday speech, writing songs for shows about evangelicals, gentrification and the pornography industry, among other subjects.

The Minneapolis theater — one of the nation’s leading children’s theaters — had commissioned the Civilians six years ago to produce a work with local flavor.

Informed by interviews with Minnesotans, “The Abominables” is a clever, zany and silly show about an adolescent hockey player whose ambitions are thwarted when a talented Yeti comes to town. It is also about the culture of success, and learning to accept defeat.

A few hours before the opening, his collaborators honored Mr. Friedman with teary speeches over a dinner (Minnesota-themed, with a Tater Tot hotdish). “He feels very present,” Mr. Cosson said. “I’m talking with him in my mind.”

The show’s New York-based costume designer, Jessica Pabst, was wistful as she sat in the theater’s 746-seat auditorium. “You don’t think of your contemporaries dying,” she said. “You think of people getting sick, and then they’ll get better. And I couldn’t wait to show him pictures of the Yeti.”

But Ms. Pabst said she took heart watching children respond to the show. “These are the next generation of Michael Friedman superfans,” she said. “These children will go home singing these songs, and that feels like an unbelievable legacy and gift.”

Unfinished

Mr. Friedman had much more he wanted to say.

“There is a mountain of stuff — notebooks and sheet music and ideas, an extraordinary archive of finished and half-finished works, and the kernels of ideas,” Mr. Cullman said.

Fully drafted are “The King of Kong,” a musical adaptation of the video game documentary, with Alex Timbers directing and Robert Askins writing, and “American Pop,” a cultural history written with Mr. Cullman on commission from the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. “All the President’s Men,” which Mr. Friedman was developing with the producers Ira Pittelman and Tom Hulce, was still in its early stages.

And then there were the still-under-discussion ideas: the “Chorus Line” sequel, with Mr. Cosson and Mr. Pinkleton, as well as a modern adaptation of “The Magic Flute,” for the Public Theater and the Metropolitan Opera.

“There is this grief at the work that won’t be finished — all the things he was talking about that I wanted to watch him work through,” said Will Frears, a director and writer and one of Mr. Friedman’s closest friends. “He wrote about difficult things in difficult ways, and my great wish is that the completed work moves forward and remains risky — that it doesn’t get turned into some nice warm thing, but remains an exhilarating and difficult look at the world.”

Now there will be memorials — the Public is planning one this month for friends and colleagues — and revivals; Mr. Eustis vows “to do everything I can to push his work to the forefront.” Kurt Deutsch of Sh-K-Boom/Ghostlight Records is working with Mr. Cosson to preserve unreleased songs; Ms. Kauffman is collecting audio recordings of Mr. Friedman teaching songs and giving advice to actors and directors.

One week after his death, on Sept. 16, several hundred of Mr. Friedman’s family and friends — theater world dignitaries, of course, but also his prom date, and a third grade classmate, and the high school choir teacher — gathered in the austere meetinghouse at Germantown Friends School, a private school in Philadelphia where Mr. Friedman had been educated from kindergarten through 12th grade.

He was remembered with stories, songs and reminiscences: he played a pig in a school musical; he started a madrigals club; he loved “My Spirit Sang All Day,” a composition by Gerald Finzi adapted from poetry by Robert Bridges. At one point, a playwright, Eisa Davis, posed a question: “I just wonder if Michael loved himself as much as we loved him?”

It was a Quaker meeting, full of silences between the speakers.

“I think, weirdly, silence is the thing Michael was most afraid of,” Mr. Goldstein said. “If there was space, he would fill it.”","‘Brilliant,’ 41 and Lost to AIDS: The Theater World Asks Why",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/theater/michael-friedman-aids-death-theater.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Many people fear the companies will be able to translate their hold on key digital platforms into wholesale ownership of adjacent industries that depend on those platforms, giving them wider economic and social power.

The entertainment industry is a good place to assess those claims because in different ways, the Five have spent years building platforms for the distribution of art, culture and media. Facebook runs the news; Google’s YouTube has videos and music; Microsoft’s Xbox has games; Amazon runs books, movies and TV (and, through its web-hosting service, AWS, hosts much else, including Netflix); and Apple has pretty much of the same, plus all those apps.

Yet in entertainment, we also see the limits of their efforts to push into new territory. Though their technologies have altered nearly everything about how we buy and experience popular culture, the Five themselves have not been the greatest beneficiaries of the changes.

They are pouring money into entertainment, but they have been cornered by nimbler start-ups like Netflix and Spotify. Amazon has struggled to make a hit show, while Apple’s plans for original TV are perpetually around the corner. (It has now struck a deal to revive “Amazing Stories,” the 1980s Steven Spielberg series; there’s no word on when it will air.) All of the Five have labored to create some killer position in the tumultuous new marketplaces their platforms have enabled.

Several times in conversations with people in Hollywood, I heard the tech people referred to as “dumb money” — the sort of outsiders (in the past, they came from oil, then from finance) who parade through town looking to call the shots. One Hollywood executive who has worked often with tech companies told me: “I wouldn’t say we’ve looked at them with fear, no.”

The Five’s struggles in entertainment, if they persist, suggest that they can be as clueless about the changes wrought by technology as the rest of us — that they do not quite understand, and haven’t yet begun to master, how to translate their technological power into wider cultural power.

Not long ago, this story looked a lot more open-and-shut. With the iPod and iTunes, Apple acquired dominance over a music industry that was struggling to respond to the digital age. Amazon eclipsed Barnes & Noble as the biggest boogeyman of the indie bookstore; for years, it fought bruising battles with the publishing industry over sales contracts that publishers said were too onerous. Through YouTube, Google gained control over not just funny cat videos, but also the modern replacement for radio. (People watch a lot of music videos on YouTube.) And Facebook has become the world’s most popular source of news, a position that has consumed its leaders over much of the last year.

There’s no doubt that technology has upended the economics of modern cultural businesses. In a recent polemic, “Move Fast and Break Things,” Jonathan Taplin, the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California (and a former rock band manager and movie producer), points out that musicians could once make a decent living off their royalty checks.

Digital technology has now completely undercut that business. YouTube has made every song available online, and even though many artists are paid a cut of the ads placed on YouTube (the company said it paid out $1 billion last year), the money is nothing close to what artists got from selling records.

Mr. Taplin sees what has happened in music as a harbinger for much of the rest of culture. “The rise of the digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries in our country,” he wrote.

But there is another side to the story. As I’ve argued before, while musicians have had to find new sources of revenue, the rise of online subscriptions and a new consumer willingness to pay have led to an explosion of new cultural voices.

Meanwhile, some earlier doomsaying has not come true: Indie bookstores and print books are making a comeback, while publishers are enjoying record profits. And the tech giants’ eagerness to create entertainment marketplaces has led to a bonanza for some artists. To compete for new members, Apple, Tidal and other streaming services are paying out lavish bonuses; Apple paid Chance the Rapper $500,000 for two weeks of exclusive access to his latest album.

The tech-industry money train is making its biggest hauls in Hollywood. “There are so many new markets for talent and writers to go to, and the creators here love that,” said Marty Kaplan, a professor of entertainment, media and society at the U.S.C. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. “Instead of having seven buyers for your idea, there are now more like 20 — and that makes everybody happy.”

This story may sound puzzling. The tech giants are the most sophisticated media companies in the world, so why, after prying open their wallets, have they struggled to capture Hollywood?

It’s because technology is not all that matters. The Five acquired their power by mastering the tech industry. They achieved dominance in a field that’s won with information, data and precision.

But even though they now control valuable platforms, as they move to areas that require them to stretch their skills they are finding that they won’t be able to roll in and take over. Several people in Hollywood told me that many of the Five just didn’t seem to “get” the movie and TV business. They had brought Northern California’s tech ideas to Southern California’s entertainment party, and did not understand the value of imagination, talent and subjective inspiration.

This myopia is part of a pattern that will repeat itself often in this series. You see it in how Facebook got caught off guard by how it was used during the election, or in YouTube’s surprise that some of its biggest stars were pushing hateful ideas on its platform.

The tech giants have upended much of society, but even they have difficulty understanding and navigating the chaos of the new platforms they have built.

Answer the immediate questions of what you’ll do next in the context of your longer and larger career — and life — goals.

Define what ‘meaningful’ means to you

One framework I’ve found useful is thinking about it in four categories: legacy, mastery, freedom and alignment.

Legacy and mastery are about the body of work and what you want to achieve and the skills you want to cultivate and strengthen. Freedom is about the conditions you need to have the lifestyle you want, like salary, benefits, flexibility. Finally, alignment is about belonging, in terms of the culture and values of whatever organization you may be working with. You can read more about each here.

Do these three things right now

1. Form a “personal board of directors” by picking four or five people you trust to help you test hypotheses and make decisions. This can be informal. The main point is to not go it alone.

2. Begin building a financial cushion by saving where you can and making a budget if you don’t have one. “Having a financial buffer will make it more likely that when you find something meaningful, you’ll be able to act on it,” wrote Amy Gallo in the Harvard Business Review. Here are a few simple tips for saving a few extra bucks.

Find a sponsor, not just a mentor

High-potential women are overmentored and undersponsored. Sponsoring is a much more specific function of mentoring and connects mentoring to advancement and getting the promotion. An important distinction is that a sponsor has to be highly placed, so she’s able to pull someone up. You can read more about what sponsorship looks like here.

It could be one or some combination of all of them. As a good friend and mentor told me: collect experiences and be generous.

But that was my parenting generation, when germs were scary but blankets weren’t.","But as the baby I call Bartola (as an affectionate nod to the former Mets pitcher Bartolo Colon) approaches her first birthday, I’m seeing that not everything I remember fits with contemporary parenting practices.

Some customs endure; some skills are timeless. But over the decades, other things change — a lot. You have to keep up.

Take something as elemental as sleeping. Every Thursday, when I serve as Bartola’s day care provider, I’m reminded of how I used to place her mother in her crib when she was a baby.

Her father or I settled her on her belly, which supposedly prevented choking if she spit up. We had tied cheerful gingham bumpers around the crib’s perimeter, so she wouldn’t bump her head on the slats. We tucked blankets around her on chilly nights, and we tossed in a stuffed animal or three for company. It was all very cozy.

We’d vaguely heard about what was then called “crib death,” and is now known as sudden infant death syndrome, but regarded it as a distant tragedy; it might be randomly, mysteriously visited upon you, but we didn’t know it was something you could help prevent.

By the time public health agencies started information campaigns that sharply reduced SIDS, we had a schoolgirl and didn’t need such precautions. But every part of our routine was wrong, and if I used it for Bartola, her parents would react with justifiable horror.

So, as pediatricians recommend, I put the baby on her back, the safest position, in a spartan crib that holds nothing soft or yielding.

This is becoming moot: Her mother heard strange noises at nap time recently and walked in to find the baby standing in the crib, happily attacking the mobile. Still, lesson learned.

On the other hand, today’s new parents have fewer fears about other things.

Germs, for instance. We used to wage war on microbes. For the first three months of our infant’s life, we scrupulously boiled bottles, nipples, pacifiers — anything that might come in contact with her mouth; after that, we sterilized things in the dishwasher.

None of that for Bartola. Her bottles, when she started using them, just got plunked into a bowl of soapy hot water. It appears that our attempts to create pristine environments for children just encouraged allergies and asthma, so our grandchildren are freer to get dirty and develop healthier — to use a phrase unknown to me in days of yore — microbiomes.

I saw this generational divide recently when my daughter and son-in-law traveled out to my New Jersey town for a museum event. They were bringing Bartola, so I invited a few local friends to come meet her.

“Are they bringing a portable playpen?” one asked.

Nah, I said, she’ll just crawl around on the floor.

“The floor? The filthy floor?” You’d have thought we were going to plop her down on a subway platform. But that was my parenting generation, when germs were scary but blankets weren’t.

In fact, the first few times I took Bartola to the playground in Brooklyn, she enjoyed the baby swing so much she started licking it. Her mother, duly informed, was untroubled. “It’s good for her immune system,” she said.

Technology has brought a bunch of change too, of course. How did I remember which side I had nursed on, or how long ago? I suppose I scrawled it on paper. My daughter, Emma, took notes on her phone. (She also, while pregnant, used an app that each week announced, among other information, what fruit or vegetable the developing fetus resembled in size, from mango to turnip to butternut squash.)

We had a monitor so that we could hear the baby from another part of the house. Bartola’s parents have a video monitor.

I thought this unnecessary, when Emma told me about it. But a large part of Effective Grandparenting 101 is, if your children tell you it’s reassuring to actually see a newborn’s chest rise and fall while she’s asleep, you nod and shut up. In fact, nodding and shutting up should probably be your default response to just about everything.

On balance, though, Bubbe-ing seems more familiar than not.

Much of what grandparents know still works, from silly songs about wheels on buses to the physics of propelling more mushy food into the baby than onto her.

Besides, we’re calmer now, more aware that babies get raised in all sorts of ways and most come through it fine — a useful insight. We’re still vigilant, but also committed to letting kids explore their environments, and we hope we get the balance right.

In fact, we hope we get most things right. But since a long time must pass before we learn whether we did (and to be honest, some of us will not be around for the denouement), we take a big leap of faith and hope that love and common sense will prevail.","Fear the Blanket, Not the Germs",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/well/family/parenting-grandparents-babies.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Conrad, a managing director of the foundation and the leader of the fellows program, said the goal was to find “people on the precipice,” where the award will make a difference, but also to inspire creativity more broadly.

“We hope that when people read about the fellows, it makes them think about how they might be more creative in their own lives,” Ms. Conrad said. “It does something for the human spirit.”

The honorees include relatively well-known figures in the arts, like the playwright Annie Baker, 36, who won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for “The Flick”; the theater artist Taylor Mac, 44, the creator of the 24-hour piece “A 24-Decade History of Popular Music”; and the writers Jesmyn Ward, 40, and Viet Thanh Nguyen, 46.

The youngest fellow is Cristina Jiménez Moreta, 33, a founder and executive director of United We Dream, a national network of advocates for immigrant youths. The oldest is Dawoud Bey, 63, a Chicago-based photographer and educator whose portraits of communities include “Harlem Redux” and “The Birmingham Project.”

Even some fellows who have already achieved substantial recognition described the honor as bringing palpable relief.

“I feel released from a profound, decades-old financial anxiety,” Ms. Baker said by email. “Now my job is just to wake up every morning and ask myself: What do I want to write? What is the most important thing I could be writing?”

Few honors are as wrapped in mystery and speculation as the MacArthur. Potential fellows cannot apply but are suggested by a network of hundreds of nominators from across the country, in a range of fields, and winnowed down by an anonymous committee of about a dozen.

When the winners were informed several weeks ago, more than one wondered if it was a prank call. “I’m still in a bit of a haze,” Mr. Mac said. “It’s ridiculous. It’s wonderful. It’s embarrassing. It’s all of it.”

Njideka Akunyili Crosby, 34, a Nigerian-born painter now living in Los Angeles whose work explores transnational identity, studied both biology and art as an undergraduate, and, as the daughter of scientists, had to grow into the idea of art as a potential career. “I think of my studio as a lab sometimes,” she said. “When I’m working out a new idea, I try to be as methodical as I can.”

Jason De Léon, 40, an anthropologist at the University of Michigan, trained as an archaeologist studying ancient sites in Mexico, before shifting focus to clandestine migration across the United States-Mexico border, which he studies using a combination of oral history, archaeological research and forensic science.

“I wear a lot of different hats in my work,” Mr. De Léon said. “Most of my career has been defined by making it up as I go along.”

Other fellows include Nikole Hannah-Jones, 41, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine who writes about racial injustice in housing and education; Yuval Sharon, 37, a Los Angeles-based opera director who has staged works in a train station and a fleet of moving cars; and Trevor Paglen, 43, a conceptual artist and geographer whose work explores invisible aspects of military and corporate power.

While only individuals are eligible for fellowships, some winners spoke of the intensely collaborative nature of their work and of the ways they might use the money and prestige to benefit collaborators, including nonprofessionals.

“I have worked with such amazing people from outside academia,” said Betsy Levy Paluck, 39, a psychologist at Princeton who has studied the ways social norms and social networks influence behavior in settings like American high schools or post-conflict Rwanda. “Some of my best ideas are really theirs.”

Greg Asbed, 54, a founder of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which seeks to improve conditions in the Florida tomato industry, said the fellowship money would be used to sustain and expand the group’s Fair Food Program, which enlists the purchasing power of large corporations to compel growers to improve working conditions. (Mr. Asbed added that he hoped publicity from his award would help persuade Wendy’s, the only one of the five largest fast-food companies not to join its agreement with tomato growers, to reconsider.)

Mr. Nguyen, who won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for his novel “The Sympathizer,” said he wanted to use some of the money to hire an editor to oversee the blog he created for the Diasporic Vietnamese Artists Network, as recognition to the broader tradition that made his own success possible.

“I think back to the first Asian-American writers,” he said. “They were really lonely people back then. They deserve this fellowship, too.”

Mr. Nguyen, a professor of English and American studies and ethnicity at the University of Southern California who has toggled between fiction and scholarship, added that the honor came with something paradoxical: a new opportunity to fail.

But for Mr. Nikolaou, the project, called “…Balkaniotheque” and sponsored by the Onassis Foundation, became more than a multifaceted look at the region. It has been a search for his very identity.

“I am a Greek,” said Mr. Nikolaou, who calls both Athens and Chalkis home. “And I have multiple identities. I belong in the East, in the West, but I also belong in the Balkans. This was forgotten for Greeks. None define themselves as Balkan. I had to find myself.”

Early on, Mr. Nikolaou said the project felt like psychoanalysis, a dive into his soul and the way he learned how to feel. He became fixated on the notion of a shared, repressed Balkan identity, one that he could unearth and restore to the collective memory.

“I wish to describe the Balkan soul,” he said. “Which seems to be dark and intractable, but it becomes simple, warm and human when it flames up.”

Mr. Nikolaou said he allowed the places to which he journeyed to choose him, not the other way around. In his travels, he’s been to nearly a dozen countries, exploring bustling capital cities as well as Roma ghettos and mountain villages.

“I made more than 20 trips trying not just to take photos, but to feel the Balkan reality,” he said. “To see those deep characteristics of the Balkan people that I believe are common all over the peninsula.”

The Balkan people were very hospitable, Mr. Nikolaou said, though he preferred to stay in the remote, rural areas. “There I met the most important people,” he said. “People totally free from the stress of our civilization. People with pain in their eyes but firstly, with big, big heart.”

He bore witness to funerals, celebrated at weddings and made intimate connections with those who opened their homes and lives to him. That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.

“The Balkans are a place where people look so different, but they are so alike in the way they face life,” he said. “And that must be what will lead us in the future. It may seem utopian, but deep inside me I believe that all people can live without borders. Even in the war-crushed Balkans, we can. It is enough to look at what it is that unites us. And what unites us is more important than what keeps us divided.”

Ms. Guadagno, under mounting pressure to chip into Mr. Murphy’s double-digit lead in recent polls and seizing the chance to make her case before a television audience, kept returning to an issue that she has made central to her campaign: property taxes.

“The first thing we can do to help the middle class is to have a thriving middle class,” she said. “And the way we help the middle class is lowering property taxes.”

She brought up property taxes while discussing a variety of issues, including school funding, immigration, job growth and the importance of keeping college graduates from leaving the state.

And she used the issue to attack Mr. Murphy on two fronts: his promise to provide the state’s full share of school funding, estimated by Mr. Murphy to be about $9 billion, and his tepid response to whether he would continue to seek an arbitration cap that limits raises for public workers, such as police officers and firefighters.

“I want to directly answer the question that you put to Phil Murphy, one I have yet to hear him answer,” she said. “I would extend the arbitration cap because it saves the taxpayers of New Jersey billions of dollars.”

Mr. Murphy sidestepped the initial question on the topic, saying that he was waiting for “all the facts.”

When Mr. Murphy pledged to fully fund the state’s pension obligation, a moderator pressed him on how he would do that.

“We have a very credible plan,” Mr. Murphy responded.

The moderator was unimpressed. “I still haven’t heard how.”

While vague on numbers in certain areas, Mr. Murphy offered plenty of data in others, including the grim condition of the state’s economy and the precise number of days that Mr. Christie and Ms. Guadagno had been in office — 2,821, according to Mr. Murphy.

Mr. Murphy not only took advantage of Ms. Guadagno’s ties to her boss, but also sought to link her to the one elected official who is disliked by a large majority of the state: President Trump

He repeatedly made reference to the “Guadagno-Christie” administration and called Ms. Guadagno, “Trump before Trump was Trump.”

Mr. Murphy promoted himself as a check on Mr. Trump’s policies, declaring that New Jersey would protect undocumented immigrants.

“If need be, we will be not just a sanctuary city, but a sanctuary state,” he said.

Ms. Guadagno countered by channeling lines that were familiar on the presidential campaign trail: describing crimes committed by undocumented immigrants.

Mr. Murphy quickly retorted.

“What you’re doing is what Donald Trump does,’’ he said. “You pit us against them. You cast a pall over entire communities of people. It is un-American.”

Recent events also triggered acrimonious exchanges.

Citing the massacre at a country music festival in Las Vegas, Mr. Murphy said that he would sign gun control legislation that Mr. Christie has vetoed and called for stricter background checks. Ms. Guadagno said she would not “take guns out of the hands of honest law-abiding citizens.”

The debate roiling Hollywood – the avalanche of reports accusing the producer Harvey Weinstein of rape and sexual harassment – also came up in the debate.

Mr. Murphy denied, when asked by a moderator, ever accepting money from Mr. Weinstein, a deep-pocketed Democratic donor.

“I didn’t ask for and I didn’t get one dime from this guy,” said Mr. Murphy, calling him “heinous” and adding that “anyone who did should give it back.”

Ms. Guadagno wasn’t satisfied by his answer. “I want to call Phil Murphy a coward,’’ she said. “Phil Murphy didn’t start to talk about Harvey Weinstein until after my campaign today listed the tens of thousands of dollars that he raised” as a part of his position as a finance chair for the Democratic National Committee. “Shame on him for not coming forward earlier,” she added.

“I literally have no idea what she’s talking about,” Mr. Murphy snapped when she finished.

Amid the insults, there were moments of levity. When boos from the crowd began to interrupt Ms. Guadagno, she stopped midsentence, saying she would wait them out.

Mr. Murphy joked, “Those were your folks.”

Ms. Guadagno laughed. “Well said.”

And when a microphone malfunctioned as a college student was asking a question, Ms. Guadagno invited him onstage, telling him to speak into her microphone that was clipped on her white jacket.

When he paused, she joked, “My husband is in the front row.”

As for Mr. Christie, whose name was cited and derided often, he was not at the debate supporting his lieutenant governor. He probably was not even watching it live on TV.

Its popular antivirus software scans for signatures of malicious software, or malware, then removes or neuters it before sending a report back to Kaspersky. That procedure, routine for such software, provided a perfect tool for Russian intelligence to exploit to survey the contents of computers and retrieve whatever they found of interest.

The National Security Agency and the White House declined to comment for this article. The Israeli Embassy declined to comment, and the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Russian hackers had stolen classified N.S.A. materials from a contractor using the Kaspersky software on his home computer. But the role of Israeli intelligence in uncovering that breach and the Russian hackers’ use of Kaspersky software in the broader search for American secrets have not previously been disclosed.

Kaspersky Lab denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, the Russian hacking. “Kaspersky Lab has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,” the company said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. Kaspersky Lab also said it “respectfully requests any relevant, verifiable information that would enable the company to begin an investigation at the earliest opportunity.”

The Kaspersky-related breach is only the latest bad news for the security of American intelligence secrets. It does not appear to be related to a devastating leak of N.S.A. hacking tools last year to a group, still unidentified, calling itself the Shadow Brokers, which has placed many of them online. Nor is it evidently connected to a parallel leak of hacking data from the C.I.A. to WikiLeaks, which has posted classified C.I.A. documents regularly under the name Vault7.

For years, there has been speculation that Kaspersky’s popular antivirus software might provide a back door for Russian intelligence. More than 60 percent, or $374 million, of the company’s $633 million in annual sales come from customers in the United States and Western Europe. Among them have been nearly two dozen American government agencies — including the State Department, the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Justice Department, Treasury Department and the Army, Navy and Air Force.

The N.S.A. bans its analysts from using Kaspersky antivirus at the agency, in large part because the agency has exploited antivirus software for its own foreign hacking operations and knows the same technique is used by its adversaries.

“Antivirus is the ultimate back door,” Blake Darché, a former N.S.A. operator and co-founder of Area 1 Security. “It provides consistent, reliable and remote access that can be used for any purpose, from launching a destructive attack to conducting espionage on thousands or even millions of users.”

On Sept. 13, the Department of Homeland Security ordered all federal executive branch agencies to stop using Kaspersky products, giving agencies 90 days to remove the software. Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine C. Duke cited the “information security risks” presented by Kaspersky and said the company’s antivirus and other software “provide broad access to files” and “can be exploited by malicious cyber actors to compromise” federal computer systems.

That directive, which some officials thought was long overdue, was based, in large part, on intelligence gleaned from Israel’s 2014 intrusion into Kaspersky’s corporate systems. It followed months of discussions among intelligence officials, which included a study of how Kaspersky’s software works and the company’s suspected ties with the Kremlin.

“The risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky,” D.H.S. said in its statement, “could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security.”

Kaspersky Lab did not discover the Israeli intrusion into its systems until mid-2015, when a Kaspersky engineer testing a new detection tool noticed unusual activity in the company’s network. The company investigated and detailed its findings in June 2015 in a public report.

The report did not name Israel as the intruder but noted that the breach bore striking similarities to a previous attack, known as “Duqu,” which researchers had attributed to the same nation states responsible for the infamous Stuxnet cyberweapon. Stuxnet was a joint American-Israeli operation that successfully infiltrated Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility, and used malicious code to destroy a fifth of Iran’s uranium centrifuges in 2010.

Kaspersky reported that its attackers had used the same algorithm and some of the same code as Duqu, but noted that in many ways it was even more sophisticated. So the company researchers named the new attack Duqu 2.0, noting that other victims of the attack were prime Israeli targets.

Among the targets Kaspersky uncovered were hotels and conference venues used for closed-door meetings by members of the United Nations Security Council to negotiate the terms of the Iran nuclear deal — negotiations from which Israel was excluded. Several targets were in the United States, which suggested that the operation was Israel’s alone, not a joint American-Israeli operation like Stuxnet.

Kaspersky’s researchers noted that attackers had managed to burrow deep into the company’s computers and evade detection for months. Investigators later discovered that the Israeli hackers had implanted multiple back doors into Kaspersky’s systems, employing sophisticated tools to steal passwords, take screenshots, and vacuum up emails and documents.

In its June 2015 report, Kaspersky noted that its attackers seemed primarily interested in the company’s work on nation-state attacks, particularly Kaspersky’s work on the “Equation Group” — its private industry term for the N.S.A. — and the “Regin” campaign, another industry term for a hacking unit inside the United Kingdom’s intelligence agency, the Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ.

Israeli intelligence officers informed the N.S.A. that in the course of their Kaspersky hack, they uncovered evidence that Russian government hackers were using Kaspersky’s access to aggressively scan for American government classified programs, and pulling any findings back to Russian intelligence systems. They provided their N.S.A. counterparts with solid evidence of the Kremlin campaign in the form of screenshots and other documentation, according to the people briefed on the events.

It is not clear whether, or to what degree, Eugene V. Kaspersky, the founder of Kaspersky Lab, and other company employees have been complicit in the hacking using their products. Technical experts say that at least in theory, Russian intelligence hackers could have exploited Kaspersky’s worldwide deployment of software and sensors without the company’s cooperation or knowledge. Another possibility is that Russian intelligence officers might have infiltrated the company without the knowledge of its executives.

But experts on Russia say that under President Vladimir V. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, businesses asked for assistance by Russian spy agencies may feel they have no choice but to give it. To refuse might well invite hostile action from the government against the business or its leaders. Mr. Kaspersky, who attended an intelligence institute and served in Russia’s Ministry of Defense, would have few illusions about the cost of refusing a Kremlin request.

Steven L. Hall, a former chief of Russian operations at the C.I.A., said his former agency never used Kaspersky software, but other federal agencies did. By 2013, he said, Kaspersky officials were “trying to do damage control and convince the U.S. government that it was just another security company.”

He didn’t buy it, Mr. Hall said. “I had the gravest concerns about Kaspersky, and anyone who worked on Russia or in counterintelligence shared those concerns,” he said.",How Israel Caught Russian Hackers Scouring the World for U.S. Secrets,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/technology/kaspersky-lab-israel-russia-hacking.html

The first big test for Senate Republicans and their two-seat majority comes next week, when they will try to advance a budget that sets the parameters for a tax bill and establishes a procedural framework to approve it with a simple majority. The House last week narrowly passed its version of a budget, but not before 18 Republicans defected.

A tax overhaul would be nearly impossible to achieve if the budget fails, and Senate leaders don’t have the kind of cushion that their House counterparts had. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, has already indicated that he could oppose the spending plan. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has clashed with the president and helped kill the health care repeal, is also considered a question mark.

That means Republicans cannot spare another vote.

That’s where the increasingly toxic relationship between Mr. Trump and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee comes into play. Mr. Corker is a senior Republican member on the Budget Committee who had already expressed misgivings about the tax plan and the potential for higher federal deficits. Losing his vote could be fatal. But Mr. Corker has very close relationships in the Senate, and many Republicans doubt he would kill the budget or tax plan simply to spite Mr. Trump.

“Defeating the budget is dishing more punishment on your colleagues than it is on the president,” said Neil Bradley, senior vice president at the chamber and a former top Republican official in the House.

Acutely aware of the tightrope he is walking, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, wrote an op-ed for NBC News encouraging Democrats interested in cutting taxes to put aside their issues with the president and join Republicans. It is unlikely to have much effect on the usually party-line budget vote, but Republicans know their job would be much easier if they could peel off just one or two centrist Democrats facing re-election next year.

Any significant rewrite of the tax code is extremely difficult — a political truth underscored by the fact that the last major overhaul was in 1986. Republicans concede that there are plenty of disagreements of the magnitude that could easily scuttle a proposal.

But they argue that Republicans are in such a politically perilous position because of their lack of accomplishment thus far that lawmakers — and the White House — are going to have to overlook their differences and come together on a plan. Otherwise they’ll be staring into the abyss.

“Members on both sides of the Capitol are going to have to be flexible and swallow features that may give them political indigestion in order to get a bill,” said Bob Stevenson, a Republican strategist and former senior Senate aide who was on Capitol Hill for the last tax overhaul. “But as Ben Franklin said, ‘You hang together or hang separately.’”

Mr. Bradley, the chamber official, said he agreed that in a more conventional political environment, existing divisions among Republicans could be sufficient to kill a tax bill. “But there is such a growing realization that failure is not an option that they will be able to overcome a lot of these policy and political conflicts,” he said.

Mr. Bradley notes that Republicans might not be the only ones to take a hit if the tax-cut push collapses. He said the death knell for tax revisions would cause a worrisome domestic economic disruption as well.

As they fret about the outlook for tax cuts, Republicans also understand that eventual success on a tax plan could ease a lot of the criticism they have come under for their legislative failures and demonstrate they have the capacity to run Washington.

“This is not one that can get left on the cutting room floor,” said Josh Holmes, a communications adviser with close ties to Mr. McConnell. “It has become a barometer of whether Republicans can govern under Trump’s leadership.”

I know these people.

No, they are not my family, but they could be. My parents left their respective mountain towns for New York City two decades earlier than those in the photo, fleeing the destruction, the penury and the hopelessness of post-World War II Italy.

The family on the platform could have easily been one of the multitudes of migrating Italians I encountered on trains when I lived in Milan and Bologna in the mid-1970s, traveling between their hometowns and northern Italian cities, Switzerland, Germany, and other enchanted places of drudgery, sacrifice and desires, temporary stops along an unending journey toward security.

Indeed, Italians keep leaving now, not with the same desperation of the undereducated masses that changed the course of nations in North and South America beginning in the 19th century, but with college degrees and smartphones in hands, grasping for opportunities their country remains incapable of providing.

These images from the mid-20th century capture the ubiquity and possibility of travel and escape, from the gaggle of scugnizzi (street urchins) hitching a ride on the back of a Neapolitan tram to a couple cuddling in their bathing suits, nestled between train tracks. I know them too, having met them in my own travels across the peninsula, heard about them in family stories on both sides of the Atlantic, and encountered them through the countless viewings of films by the likes of Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, and Michelangelo Antonioni.

The 31 black-and-white images displayed in the London gallery exhibition of Gardin’s work, “The Italians,” are, for the most part, those he made in the midcentury, when Italy hovered between agrarian provincialism and an internationally touted cosmopolitanism. The meta-image of an Asian tourist posing for a photographic portrait against a Mediterranean backdrop highlights Italy as destination, in stark disparity to the fleeing migrant family.

Contrasts are a leitmotif for Gardin, as seen with the seven girls in communion whites delighted by a dark-haired dog before them, or the jangle of men on a train, caught in mirrored reflections. The pairing of Italy with style and leisure is found in the photos of an elegantly veiled woman in sunglasses and pearls aboard what appears to be a Venetian water taxi, and the portly man in bathing trunks beatifically splayed on an outcrop, the sea below a resounding swirl.

Gardin is a master of the patterned panorama, vistas of startling beauty shot from above: In one image a donkey-driven plow cuts a billowing swath across an astonishingly stark landscape and in another, two men scurry across a plank in a flooded Piazza San Marco. These are captured flashes of haunting revelation.

His images are not merely of the real, the documented — they are also reveries of the imagination. Lovers, clothed but barefoot, embrace on a beach. A blanket, a pair of shoes and vinyl records in the foreground.

A need for finalityThat means that there is effectively only one imperfect release valve for the immigration system: the discretion of the people responsible for enforcement.
The work that amnesties, statutes of limitations and other such rules do is often invisible.","But in fact, statutes of limitations mean that most crimes can’t be prosecuted at all after a certain amount of time has passed, usually no more than a few years. The principle is so strong that only a small number of very serious crimes can be prosecuted indefinitely.

The same is true of civil lawsuits. Plaintiffs can sue only within a set window of time. After that, even if they have suffered serious harm, they are out of luck.

Taxes? The Internal Revenue Service currently offers an amnesty program for people who’ve stashed money overseas. If they come clean and pay, they avoid some or all penalties.

Even property law has a version of this, found in common-law rules saying that if someone has been using land a certain way for decades, that person is granted the legal right to continue — even if someone else actually owns the property in question.

And those are just some of the official limits in laws and court opinions. There are also the countless little everyday amnesties when officials exercise their discretion: the prosecutor who declines to pursue a case or drops certain charges as part of a plea bargain, the police officer who doesn’t write a ticket.

In other words, if you define amnesty broadly, as a rule or discretionary decision that exempts certain people from the legal consequences of their wrongdoing, then the American legal system is amnesties all the way down.

Serving the public by not enforcing the law

Those rules all share one unifying principle: that sometimes the public interest is best served by not enforcing the law. That even if a person is culpable for a serious offense, sometimes we gain more, as a society, by not holding the person legally responsible.

Tony O’Rourke, a professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law currently serving as a fellow with the Federal Defenders Service of New York, called criminal statutes of limitations an important part of due process protections.

“Prosecutions, if they occur too far in time from when the offense occurs, no longer vindicate the goals of punishment,” Mr. O’Rourke said, except in the case of some especially serious offenses. Statutes of limitations are a way to protect both the public and defendants against government overreach.

“It is absolutely a limitation on the power of the state, in the same way that the Bill of Rights is a limitation on the power of the state, and the due process clause is a limitation on the power of the state,” he said.

James Forman, a professor at Yale Law School, says that because prosecutors act on behalf of society and its citizens, “part of the message that prosecutors are sending when they decide not to prosecute is that we, as a society, don’t want someone to suffer the stigma of a criminal conviction for this action.” That element of discretion and forgiveness can bolster the legitimacy of the system.

There are gains in efficiency as well, said Miriam Baer, a professor at Brooklyn Law School and a former federal prosecutor. “It’s not a one-way street,” she said. “If drafted correctly, the government gets something, too.”

Tax amnesties, for instance, increase the revenue that is collected. And the government then doesn’t have to investigate and prosecute the tax crimes.

Video

There can be downsides to such amnesty programs, Ms. Baer cautioned. If not set up carefully, they can encourage people to break the law in the hope that they will eventually be forgiven rather than punished.

But that can often be avoided through careful drafting. And ultimately, she said, amnesties are common because the gains in productivity and efficiency are worth that risk.

Why is immigration different?

Immigration law, by comparison, is a bit of an outlier. There is no set period of time after which an undocumented immigrant is safe from deportation.

To be clear, the unlawful presence of an undocumented immigrant is generally not a crime, nor is being in the country without papers. So the immigration and criminal systems are not an apples-to-apples comparison.

But at the same time, courts recognize that deportation is similar to criminal punishment in terms of its severity. That is why criminal lawyers are legally required to inform their clients about the immigration consequences of guilty pleas, Mr. O’Rourke said, in order to provide constitutionally adequate counsel.

Yet immigration offenses are far less serious than crimes, like homicides, that don’t have statutes of limitation, Mr. Forman said.

“Certainly, offenses on par to being in the country illegally, they tend to have one, two, three-year statutes of limitations,” he said.

Nor does the immigration system offer an equivalent of property law’s common-law provisions that protect the status quo after years of peaceful use. A decades-long record of law-abiding life in the United States does not give undocumented immigrants citizenship, or even an opportunity to apply for it.

And although there have been temporary immigration amnesties in the past, they have been rare and unpredictable. And today, in contrast with, say, the tax system, there is no large-scale amnesty program available.

The most recent large-scale amnesty was under President Reagan, whose immigration reforms granted legal status to nearly three million people in 1986.

Photo

But that amnesty came with an enforcement crackdown stopping the flow of temporary workers across the southern border. Researchers have found that caused many to put down roots in the United States instead of returning seasonally to Mexico and Central America. Since then, the United States has had a large population of undocumented immigrants who live, work and have families in the United States, but who have little hope of achieving legal status.

A narrower program, the LIFE act, offered legal status to some undocumented immigrants in the 1990s if they had family members who were United States citizens and could petition on their behalf. But it ended in 2001.

A need for finality

That means that there is effectively only one imperfect release valve for the immigration system: the discretion of the people responsible for enforcement.

The president and Department of Homeland Security can issue guidelines saying that certain groups of people, such as those without criminal records, should not be deported.

The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, commonly known as DACA, was essentially a form of structured prosecutorial discretion ordered by the president.

But that kind of discretion offers only temporary relief from deportation, not the finality of a statute of limitations or other similar relief.

That difference was thrown into sharp relief last month, when President Trump ended the DACA program, leaving recipients fearful that they will now be subject to deportation.

The work that amnesties, statutes of limitations and other such rules do is often invisible. The backlogs prevented are hard to detect, the resources saved unnoticed. But they serve vital functions.

“It’s a routine and robust part of our justice system,” Mr. Forman said. “Everybody in the system knows that it’s a myth that you can go after everyone all the time.

On “The Late Late Show,” James Corden took aim at Mr. Trump from a variety of angles.

“So that’s where we’re at: Donny made fun of Little Bobby for being short. And if you’ve just tuned in, I’m not reporting things my 6-year-old saw on the playground today. I’m sharing news from the White House.” — JAMES CORDEN “In that tweet, Trump insinuates that The New York Times set up Bob Corker by recording him, but the transcript actually shows that they had Corker’s full consent. And when Trump heard that, he said, ‘Wait — what’s consent?’” — JAMES CORDEN

Mr. Corden also addressed another internecine fight that’s occupying Mr. Trump’s time.

“In an interview today, Trump addressed the rumors that his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, called him a moron, by saying, quote, ‘If he did that, I guess we’ll have to compare I.Q. tests, and I can tell you who is going to win.’ Yeah, I can also tell you who’s going to win: It’s not the guy who spells ‘little’ like this.” — JAMES CORDEN

But the late-night shows seemed reluctant to deal with the reports, and only some addressed them at all. Even those shows that did failed to spend much time on the revelations or mention the most unsettling accusations.

“The New Yorker today released audio of fired Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein begging a model to come into his room and watch him shower. And by the looks of him, I’m guessing that shower never happened.” — SETH MEYERS “Another big story is this Harvey Weinstein scandal.

When Landis joined the so-called Go-Go White Sox in 1957, he strengthened a formidable defense up the middle, with Nellie Fox at second base, Luis Aparicio at shortstop and Sherm Lollar at catcher. Landis made few errors, led the A.L. three times in double plays turned by a center fielder and won the Gold Glove Award each season from 1960 to 1964.

He was known for making difficult catches look easy and for snaring balls that appeared to be certain home runs.

“I think maybe Landis has better anticipation than anyone now playing,” Bill Veeck, the White Sox owner, said in an interview with The Chicago Tribune in 1959. “He catches balls that I know are two- or three-base hits.”

But as a minor leaguer Landis had learned that his speed was not enough to make him a great outfielder; he needed help. So during spring training he shadowed Johnny Mostil, an instructor who had been a White Sox outfielder in the 1920s. As fly balls and line drives were hit at them, Landis broke with Mostil at the crack of the bat.","Jim Landis, Defensive Star for Pennant-Winning White Sox, Dies at 83",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/obituaries/jim-landis-dead-sure-handed-center-fielder-for-59-white-sox.html

At Evanston Township High School in Illinois, actions during the national anthem became a schoolwide discussion after their girls’ volleyball team collectively knelt at a game a few weeks ago, the school superintendent Eric Witherspoon said. As school band members worked through their own choices later that week, Mr. Witherspoon assured the students and parents that non-disruptive protests would not be punished, and that the school considered kneeling an allowed free speech demonstration.

But he encouraged students to ask themselves, “Are they doing something as a copycat or are they doing something as a purpose?” In the end about half the band knelt during the anthem, Mr. Witherspoon said.

Focus on Law, Not Politics

Frame the discussion from a constitutional perspective rather than a political one, said Jeffrey Rosen, president and chief executive of the nonpartisan National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.

“Don’t debate whether or not people should salute the flag or should kneel or stand during the national anthem,” Mr. Rosen said, suggesting parents instead focus on what the free speech clause of the First Amendment allows people to do.

Despite contentious debate on how free speech rights are utilized, Mr. Rosen said, both conservative and liberal scholars generally agree on what free speech is under the law, including that United States citizens acting peacefully can express their opinions, even unpopular or offensive ones, without interference from the government. That includes protection for so-called “hate speech” that attacks someone’s race, religion or sexual orientation.

Make It Relatable

It’s important that students understand how far free speech rights extend in their own world, and that there are limits to what is covered. “The government can’t limit your free expression; your parents can,” and so can your school, said Barbara McCormack, the vice president of education at the Newseum in Washington, which educates thousands of students each year on the First Amendment.

Even though Americans are free to hold up protest signs on the National Mall criticizing a new law, public schools can limit speech they deem disruptive, and private schools have even more say on what their students can do.

Educators also suggest explaining that free speech rights do not allow words or actions that would lead to immediate harm. For many children, “harm” in the realm of free speech is confusing. “They get into feelings, so we have to separate those,” Ms. McCormack said. Educators should explain, she said, that saying, “Susie is ugly,” is not nice, but it’s not banned under the Constitution. Instead, to be prohibited, speech must be likely to incite immediate harm, like “We don’t like redheads. Here’s one now — let’s get them,” Ms. McCormack said. Individual states’ anti-bullying laws may help clarify what is considered over the line.

Add Historical Context

To explain free speech in action, parents can use examples of protest movements historically, perhaps with events children are already somewhat familiar with, like Rosa Parks’s refusal to give up her seat on the bus or Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech.

Arrests of civil rights leaders and setbacks during the movement also provide another important free speech lesson. “It’s not always smooth sailing and a straight trajectory to your change,” Ms. McCormack said, and it teaches students that, “Sometimes your rights are violated, even when you’re trying to exercise them.”

Talk About Speaking Up

Conversations about free speech can offer opportunities to encourage children to think of what they care about and when they might want to speak up. The Newseum asks middle school students to choose any subject important to them, be it loving their own curly hair or protecting animals, and have them write messages about it on a label for a water bottle or a sticker for their iPhone case.

It can be helpful to highlight other activities children can participate in outside of school, like joining local demonstrations or marches, writing letters to their lawmakers, and volunteering their time or raising money to support causes they care about.

Schools’ anti-bullying policies can be an entry point for discussing how children might speak up, said Jane Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota.

Burke, the foremost expositor of the authority of custom, preferred “the collected reason of ages, combining the principles of original justice with the infinite variety of human concerns” to “personal self-sufficiency and arrogance, the certain attendants upon all those who have never experienced a wisdom greater than their own.”

Burke is generally seen as the progenitor of modern conservatism, but Mr. Trump, who came late to the conservative cause, is said to be so hostile to custom that his staff knows the best way to get him to do something is to tell him it violates tradition. The tweeting, impulsivity, lying, interference with prosecutorial independence, incautious rhetoric about war and peace, demagogic campaign rallies masked as presidential addresses and the like are all violations of informal customs of presidential behavior. They also tend to be the moments when Mr. Trump makes his worst mistakes.

Of course, it is a conceit of many presidents — conceit being all but a constitutional qualification of the office — that they are saviors who, by force of personality, will transform all that preceded them. Most ultimately find the traditions of the office to be a shield. Mr. Trump is finding them to be a constraint he cannot bear. Worse, because many elements of his base associate these customs with failed politics, every violation reinforces the sense that he sides with them over a corrupt establishment.

Historically, conservatism has tended to value light governance, for which custom is even more essential. Aristotle writes that “when men are friends they have no need of justice.” In other words, rules enter where informal mechanisms of society have collapsed. The philosopher and statesman Charles Frankel summed it up powerfully: “Politics is a substitute for custom. It becomes conspicuous whenever and wherever custom recedes or breaks down.”

Mr. Trump’s many critics are not all guiltless on this score. Since Woodrow Wilson’s critique of the framers’ work, progressive legal theory has generally denied that the meaning of the original Constitution, as endorsed by generational assent, wields authority because it is customary. Much of libertarian theory elevates contemporary reason — the rationality of the immediate — above all else. Both schools of thought assume that individual reason, here and now, is better at resolving social and political questions, in all their dimensions of infinite complexity, than the accumulated wisdom of custom.

The president’s daily, even hourly, abuse of language is also deeply problematic for a republic that conducts its business with words and cannot do so if their meanings are matters of sheer convenience. The unique arrogance of Mr. Trump’s rejection of the authority of custom is more dangerous than we realize because without custom, there is no law.",The President’s Self-Destructive Disruption,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/opinion/donald-trump-tradition-disruption.html

The client also told him that other protesters were no longer being force-fed.

Another prisoner on a lengthy hunger strike — who was hospitalized in July, though he eats a small amount of solid food each day to accompany pain medication — told his lawyer on Sept. 21 that a prison official told him a day earlier that he would not be forcibly tube-fed, either, according to the lawyer, Pardiss Kebriaei of the Center for Constitutional Rights.

A fifth detainee whom other prisoners have identified as a hunger striker does not have a lawyer.

Navy Capt. John Robinson, a spokesman for the prison, said in a statement that an 11-year-old military policy permitting the involuntary feeding of hunger-striking detainees remained in effect. If medical officials decided tube-feeding was required to prevent death or serious self-harm, he said, “we would involuntarily enterally feed a detainee,” using the military’s preferred term for tube-feeding.

He declined to discuss specific cases. But Captain Robinson also said that the military had not “involuntarily enterally fed a detainee in well over a year.” He would not elaborate on what it would mean to be voluntarily tube-fed, but Ms. Kebriaei said it was most likely a reference to detainees who passively submitted to the procedure rather than fighting guards.

Maj. Ben Sakrisson, a Pentagon spokesman, said that prison officials had decided to start to more rigorously enforce existing policy standards for what health conditions were sufficient to prompt force-feeding.

“In some instances in the past, attempts to provide detainees who claimed that they were on hunger strike with a measure of dignity through voluntary enteral feedings unintentionally created a situation that potentially encouraged future hunger strikes,” he said. “As a result, the pre-existing standard of medical necessity will be enforced in the future.”

But Mr. Remes interpreted the move as a new strategy to induce hunger strikers to stop. He accused the military of “playing chicken” by withholding both force-feeding and medical care until the detainee was in danger of organ damage or even death.

“The theory is that a detainee won’t want to reach that point and so will abandon his hunger strike,” he said. “Who will blink first?”

Any such hardening of the government’s approach could put the prisoners’ lawyers in an awkward position. Though they say they do not want their clients to die, many have also argued that force-feeding amounts to torture and violates medical ethics. For now, the three lawyers said they are seeking independent medical evaluations of their clients.

Mr. Remes said his client was protesting because he wanted the military to permit him to talk to his family twice a month rather than once. Ms. Kebriaei said her client was in a general state of despair and might be suffering from an untreated illness. Mr. Smith said his clients were protesting because they wanted to be given trials or released.

In the case of another detainee, one who has received a rare trial, the Supreme Court declined on Tuesday to hear an appeal. The detainee, Ali Hamza al-Bahlul, is a Yemeni who made a propaganda video for Al Qaeda about the bombing of the American destroyer Cole in 2000 and helped administer loyalty oaths and drafted martyrdom wills for several Sept. 11 hijackers.

Mr. Bahlul, who boycotted his 2008 trial before a commission, was convicted, among other things, of conspiring to commit acts of terrorism. His appeal raised the question of whether a conspiracy charge, which is widely used in civilian court but is not a recognized international war crime, may be properly brought in a military commission.

The full United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a fractured decision last year that upheld Mr. Bahlul’s conviction but provided no answer to the question of whether military prosecutors may bring conspiracy charges in other cases. The Supreme Court’s demurral means that issue remains unresolved.

Also this week, military officials are preparing for a sentencing hearing for a Saudi detainee, Ahmed Muhammed Haza al-Darbi, who in February 2014 pleaded guilty before a commission. His deal included an agreement that after February 2018, he could serve the remainder of his sentence in Saudi Arabia.","Military Is Waiting Longer Before Force-Feeding Hunger Strikers, Detainees Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/us/politics/guantanamo-hunger-strikes-force-feeding.html

Vicki Eastus, a puzzle solver in Brooklyn, put it this way: “The more hectic life is, the more calming I find filling in those little boxes.”

Search the internet for research on the impact of puzzle-solving on the brain, and you’ll find plenty of studies. But the results are mixed, and it’s not clear whether puzzle solving has any purely physiological benefits.

The psychological benefits, though, are not in question.

“When you do a puzzle, the mind becomes completely absorbed in the task at hand,” said Joanne Cohen-Katz, a psychologist in Allentown, Pa. “There is total focus on what is happening in the moment, which is the definition of mindfulness. And we know that mindfulness results in all sorts of positive changes in the brain.”

For one, solving a crossword can be a path to serenity in a world of uncertainty.

“I don’t think I have to sell you on the increased demand for this type of pastime in an increasingly worried world,” wrote Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times, in a memo to Lester Markel, the Sunday editor, after the Pearl Harbor attack. “You can’t think of your troubles while solving a crossword.”

In recent interviews, New York Times crossword enthusiasts shared their emotional connections to the pastime and described the value they find in the exercise.

Harry Hassell, of Jackson Heights, Queens, remembered his mother working on crosswords. “Amid the chaos of the household, it allowed her a personal pleasure and a routine all her own,” he said. “It also allowed me to see her not just as a car-pooling, tennis-playing mother, but also as a clever, intelligent, word-loving woman.”

“I first started doing crosswords as a child while visiting my Grandma Pat,” said Neil Padrick Wilson, a claims analyst in Tacoma, Wash. “She would sit at the big dining room table, dipping toast in her coffee. I would dip toast in my hot chocolate and we would work through a puzzle together. It got me to think, it got me to learn and it got me to know her better.”

Puzzles became so important to Mr. Wilson that he began to create them, and a crossword he made recently ran in The Times.

While not all enthusiasts go on to construct puzzles, it’s not uncommon for an early habit to persist.

“Rituals are often key in bonding with others, particularly family rituals,” said Ray Bepko, a clinical psychologist in Clinton, N.Y. “Pastimes and hobbies are very much a part of this and impact our adult relationships.”

That seems to be at least one reason people continue or develop a solving habit in adulthood, Dr. Bepko said. “Accessing this deep emotional connection is a source of comfort and reassurance anytime, particularly in difficult moments.”

Of course, puzzles are games, and they’re meant to be fun — especially in the addictive “aha!” moments that many solvers describe.

Ms. Malliotakis benefited from her placement at the center podium, which put her next to the mayor and allowed her to engage him directly, while Mr. Dietl, a former police detective who now runs a private investigation firm, often wound up on the fringe of their exchanges.

“What are you talking about?” Ms. Malliotakis said sharply to Mr. de Blasio, after he outlined steps he had taken to address the homelessness crisis.

“What about me?” Mr. Dietl protested.

“I could think of many questions for you, but I only get one,” Mr. de Blasio said, drawing laughter from the audience.

The three were also asked about IDNYC, a city-issued identity card designed to appeal to undocumented immigrants, among others, to help them open bank accounts or access city services.

Mr. de Blasio said that he plans to destroy personal records collected by the program that could potentially be demanded by federal authorities looking to identify and deport undocumented immigrants. Mr. Dietl said that he would turn over documents if they related to people convicted of crimes. Ms. Malliotakis has sued the city to keep the documents from being destroyed, but she avoided answering the question directly.

Ms. Malliotakis said that the mayor had mismanaged city government, spending too much money on ineffective programs that had not solved problems concerning the schools, affordable housing or the homeless. “I’m ready to clean up his mess,” she said.

Mr. Dietl emphasized his business experience. “I’m a successful businessman,” he said, adding that he “can get things done.”

In one remarkable exchange, Mr. Dietl was asked about a remark some months ago regarding the judge in a lawsuit he filed seeking, unsuccessfully, to enter either the Republican or Democratic primary. He had said that he knew he would lose the case when he saw that the judge looked like the mayor’s wife, Chirlane McCray. Both Ms. McCray and the judge are black.

Mr. Dietl disputed the way his remarks were characterized by the questioner, Grace Rauh, of NY1. Mr. de Blasio interjected: “If you say a judge is going to make a decision based on her gender or the color of her skin, you’re no better than Donald Trump.”

After the debate, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Dietl shook hands and Ms. McCray joined them. Mr. Dietl said later that he told Ms. McCray that he was sorry if his earlier remarks had offended her, and that he had not meant them as “a racial epithet.” He said that she shook his hand.

His photos, of swells and speakeasies, crime and crowds, or perps and play, are a singular record of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s. And just when you thought you had seen all of his work, a new book, “Extra! Weegee,” features vintage prints — many previously unseen — that captures Weegee’s singular point of view.

Photo

Daniel Blau, the book’s editor, admitted that he had “never really liked Weegee.” Obviously, he has since come to his senses, putting together an impressive volume that captures the many sides of New York as it approached World War II. The images were found in the archives of the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a syndicate founded at the turn of the last century by Edward Willis Scripps. The photos — which had been taken for the association’s Acme Newspictures service — passed through the hands of several owners, and were discovered in storage in 2012 by Ryan Adams.

These prints, Mr. Blau wrote in the book, changed his mind, as he saw pictures vastly different from those he had encountered 30 years earlier in some badly reproduced volume. And in a nod to the current daily torrent of images, these photos had an air of mystery, he said, and the mark of a master.

Weegee, born Ascher Fellig in 1899 in what is now Ukraine, lived a spartan existence down by the old New York Police headquarters in Lower Manhattan. That’s not surprising, since his realm was the streets. And the images he shot revealed not just a knowledge of people and places, but an appreciation for the ironic, odd or absurd.

A car dangles off the roadway that encircles Grand Central Terminal, with a “ONE WAY” arrow pointing at it, while two men stand under an awning, not oblivious, but not impressed, either. In another, an overturned vehicle rests on its side, with a sign reading “SLOW DOWN” hovering behind it like an unheeded warning.

Photo

Working crowds, you have images of a sweaty, packed throng in Coney Island and people celebrating the end of World War II. A jubilant sailor is surrounded by four women, flanking a sign he held declaring: “$2,000 In Bank Now I’m Looking for a Wife,” with “18-40” added at the bottom. An image of gawkers at a murder scene is a collage of mostly children’s faces, some goofy, arrayed around one woman whose grief is etched on her face.

He also found the lighter side, showing teenaged bobbysoxers jitterbugging in the aisles of a theater, dogs and cats, and even a gorilla. The book is divided into chapters that all start with “EXTRA!” and are devoted to topics like Crime, Cool, Friends, Characters and more.

Of course, the main character on this sidewalk stage is Weegee himself. Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote. “Weegee made these possible. He was a game changer — breaking new ground in both photography and photojournalism. Using a camera to tell a story as others used their pen or speech.”

Mr. Blau concludes that while Weegee may have left to be a movie actor, he had long been on that path.

“By then he had already made all the films he wanted,” he wrote. “All films made of a single frame. All telling a story in one take. Today I love these short films.”

So far, careful hiring and training have been his secret sauce, Mr. Isabella said.

No more D.C.!” Mr. Isabella insisted.","Before the end of the year, he plans to open a vast dining emporium at Tysons Galleria, a luxury mall in McLean, Va. His French restaurant Requin is scheduled to open this month at the Wharf, a $2.5 billion development on 24 acres along Washington’s long-neglected riverfront. The restaurant, surrounded by a sprawl of condominiums, stores and other eating spots, is the only detached, stand-alone restaurant on the site.

Requin, a modernist food church at the center of a fabricated village, is a metaphor of sorts for Mr. Isabella’s unique stature among Washington restaurateurs — a perch attained, in large part, through simple proliferation.

Photo

Mr. Isabella owes his culinary fecundity to smart location plays, and a large and loyal team of chefs, bartenders, construction managers and two Greek-American brothers who have been the spine of his most-replicated outpost, Kapnos Taverna. He commands a United Nations of cuisines: the down-home Italian food of his youth, Greek and Mediterranean cooking, coastal Mexican fare and even some ramen.

From the pizzas at Graffiato to the succulent chicken parm sandwiches at G to the bomba rices served in a hotel-dining-room-cum-souk at Arroz to the spit-roasted lamb at Kapnos, his menus have largely drawn enthusiasm from Washington critics and diners. Yes, there is a cookbook. And there is cross-marketing: You can buy a G sandwich at Graffiato, where you can also purchase a take-home pizza kit.

In many ways, Mr. Isabella is the very model of the modern major chef: His $30 million empire has put his food into airports, a baseball stadium, events with catering, lunchboxes delivered to office workers and his own take on a food hall, while he moves along, sharklike, with various versions of his sit-down restaurants.

This has taken him, as it has many other chefs, out of the kitchen. His knife set now comes out only at home.

Mr. Isabella also had the Spidey sense to settle into Washington, where breakneck growth and the attendant investor cash have all exploded in recent years. His work force of 600 employees will nearly double once his new places open.

“He succeeds by putting a lot of trust and responsibility in people he grooms and finds,” said Anna Spiegel, food editor of Washingtonian magazine.

“He isn’t front and center,” as if he were just a chef with a single restaurant, she said. “This isn’t the Mike show. There isn’t the illusion of that.”

She added, “It’s not always the most cutting-edge food, but it’s food that pushes the boundaries just enough while remaining comfortable for people.”

Photo

Mr. Isabella, 42, seems to spend each day checking on an existing restaurant, peeking at a behind-schedule construction site, meeting with a catering client. He zooms back and forth in his black Range Rover, dragging on a cigarette between stops and musing aloud about something that has to be done that isn’t being done but might be done, or not.

“I have so much in my head,” he said on a recent afternoon, lamenting the absence of his assistant, who sends emails simultaneously transcribing whatever pops out.

He grew up in New Jersey and studied at the now-closed Restaurant School of New York, and spent the early part of his career along the Acela corridor, working in fine dining in New York before heading to Philadelphia, where he cooked for, among others, the chef Marcus Samuelsson and the prolific restaurateur Stephen Starr.

After a brief stint in Atlanta, where Mr. Isabella learned about Greek flavors and techniques, he came to Washington in 2007 to work at Mr. Andrés’s eastern-Mediterranean restaurant Zaytinya. “We wanted to be closer to home but not in our hometowns,” he said, referring to New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where his wife, Stacy, was raised.

IN 2009, Mr. Isabella, then head chef at Zaytinya, met Mr. Colicchio at the home of the cookbook writer Joan Nathan, where he cooked a dinner in honor of President Obama’s first inauguration. (Mr. Colicchio had to perform the Heimlich maneuver on Ms. Nathan after an incident involving Persian shish kebab, but that’s another story.)

Mr. Isabella turned on his signature confidence, pressing the “Top Chef” judge to let him in. “I could already tell he had an outsized personality and was very ambitious,” Mr. Colicchio said.

When Mr. Isabella returned to Washington after the show, he continued for a while at Zaytinya, but in 2011 struck out on his own with Graffiato, an Italian start-up in Chinatown inspired by his grandmother’s cooking. “Mike has used the opportunity to make a good name for himself,” Mr. Andrés said. “Since I met Mike, he always wanted more.”

Mr. Isabella’s pace invites the pitfalls that have tripped up many before him: overextending oneself, losing control over quality.

Photo

“With anyone who grows as fast as he has, one has wonder how they do it, or if he can keep up,” said Marjorie Meek-Bradley, a “Top Chef” finalist who has worked with him in kitchens for decades, and once served as his chef de cuisine at Graffiato. (Another ”Top Chef” alumna, Jennifer Carroll, is the executive chef and a partner at the original Requin Brasserie in Fairfax, Va. — and, as “Top Chef” fans may remember, the target of one of Mr. Isabella’s infamous rants, after she outpaced him at opening oysters.)

So far, careful hiring and training have been his secret sauce, Mr. Isabella said. George and Nick Pagonis, the culinary and managerial backbones of the five various Kapnos restaurants, have been with Mr. Isabella since the beginning. Taha Ismail, his beverage director, has worked with him since their Zaytinya days.

“If you grow too big too fast you have to hire, hire, hire, and if you build too fast you dilute your brand,” Ms. Meek-Bradley said. “It becomes, ‘Oh, they are never in the kitchen, they have too much going on,’ when you don’t have the right people in place. Mike understands the need to bring in some strong teams. He is a good person to work for and rewards hard work.”

Chefs in Washington are a tight group, proud and at times defensive of a city that was long ignored as other cities’ restaurants and bars lapped up praise. (Recent years have brought critical acclaim — Washington was named America’s best restaurant city last year by Bon Appétit — and an influx of chefs, despite the lack of a large culinary school or training culture.)

Chefs here back one another up, when needed, with spare pots and pans; they cook together on the extensive charity circuit, and are happy to share excess tomatoes, the names of suppliers and advice.

“When I worked at Per Se in New York, no one was friends with the people at Jean-Georges, which was across the street,” Ms. Meek-Bradley said. “The thing I love about D.C. is there is this sense of camaraderie here and sense of pride.”

Mr. Isabella remains very much a part of that world, dining often with chef friends at home. Still, the scale of his enterprises sets him apart.

Although he long ago shed his bad-boy image, his name can sometimes prompt undefined unease among food professionals here, as if his high profile were a personal threat to the city’s nascent culinary status.

“Of course, people are going to be a little resentful or jealous,” Ms. Meek-Bradley said. “But that’s what happens when you are willing to take those calculated risks that a lot of us are not willing to do, or don’t do.”

The ultimate test of his ambitions may come at Isabella Eatery in the Tysons Galleria, which will pack nine different spaces into 41,000 square feet, served by one commissary kitchen. Flailing malls have looked to food to lift their businesses, and Mr. Isabella sold General Growth Properties, which owns the Galleria, on a one-stop solution.

In addition to a coffee bar and an ice cream parlor, the complex will serve the greatest hits of Mike Isabella: tacos, a raw bar and Mediterranean, Italian and Japanese offerings.

A cocktail bar will spill out into the traffic area of the mall floor, which retailers no doubt hope will fuel $2,000 handbag sales with ample manhattans and martinis. “His concepts have delicious food,” said Michael Schlow, a chef and restaurateur, “but he realizes that’s not the only way to be successful. It needs to be an experience.”

At a sushi tasting at Yona, one of his spots in Northern Virginia, Mr. Isabella plowed through giant plates of fish that were vying for a spot in its Tysons Galleria outpost.

“No ponzo sauce, too mainstream,” he said, waving off a slice of hamachi. A piece of fluke dressed up with shrimp paste he dismissed as “a little too cheffy.” A lobster roll drew an appreciative nod. Salmon nigiri with pea shoots and avocado and cucumber showed promise, he said, if the vegetables were cut smaller.

Mr. Isabella looked tired, and reflexively grabbed for his phone. Tacos were next. “It’s not always easy,” he said. “People think it’s fun. It’s very filling!”

So clearly, Isabella Eatery will be the end?

“Yes! No more D.C.!” Mr. Isabella insisted. “Well, maybe one more coffee shop.”

It may sound ridiculous to invoke James Madison or Edmund Burke when we talk about this president, but that is part of the problem. Mr. Trump could profit from the wisdom of his predecessor Madison, for whom the very essence of constitutionalism lay not in what he derided as “parchment barriers” — mere written commands there was no will to follow — but rather “that veneration which time bestows on every thing.” The Constitution, in other words, would be only as strong as the tradition of respecting it.

Burke, the foremost expositor of the authority of custom, preferred “the collected reason of ages, combining the principles of original justice with the infinite variety of human concerns” to “personal self-sufficiency and arrogance, the certain attendants upon all those who have never experienced a wisdom greater than their own.”

Burke is generally seen as the progenitor of modern conservatism, but Mr. Trump, who came late to the conservative cause, is said to be so hostile to custom that his staff knows the best way to get him to do something is to tell him it violates tradition. The tweeting, impulsivity, lying, interference with prosecutorial independence, incautious rhetoric about war and peace, demagogic campaign rallies masked as presidential addresses and the like are all violations of informal customs of presidential behavior. They also tend to be the moments when Mr. Trump makes his worst mistakes.

Of course, it is a conceit of many presidents — conceit being all but a constitutional qualification of the office — that they are saviors who, by force of personality, will transform all that preceded them. Most ultimately find the traditions of the office to be a shield. Mr. Trump is finding them to be a constraint he cannot bear. Worse, because many elements of his base associate these customs with failed politics, every violation reinforces the sense that he sides with them over a corrupt establishment.

Historically, conservatism has tended to value light governance, for which custom is even more essential. Aristotle writes that “when men are friends they have no need of justice.” In other words, rules enter where informal mechanisms of society have collapsed. The philosopher and statesman Charles Frankel summed it up powerfully: “Politics is a substitute for custom. It becomes conspicuous whenever and wherever custom recedes or breaks down.”

Mr. Trump’s many critics are not all guiltless on this score. Since Woodrow Wilson’s critique of the framers’ work, progressive legal theory has generally denied that the meaning of the original Constitution, as endorsed by generational assent, wields authority because it is customary. Much of libertarian theory elevates contemporary reason — the rationality of the immediate — above all else. Both schools of thought assume that individual reason, here and now, is better at resolving social and political questions, in all their dimensions of infinite complexity, than the accumulated wisdom of custom.

The president’s daily, even hourly, abuse of language is also deeply problematic for a republic that conducts its business with words and cannot do so if their meanings are matters of sheer convenience. The unique arrogance of Mr. Trump’s rejection of the authority of custom is more dangerous than we realize because without custom, there is no law.",The President’s Self-Destructive Disruption,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/opinion/donald-trump-tradition-disruption.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“Kim Jong-un is extreme,” Mr. Barak said.","An unconstrained North Korea could impel Japan and South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons, he said. In the Middle East, Iran’s renewed drive for a bomb would pressure neighbors like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey to do likewise.

“Think what happens in the next generation if Iran turns nuclear,” he said. “It’s become almost inevitable that we are entering a totally different international landscape.”

As Mr. Trump’s expected decision draws closer, other prominent Israelis are urging him not to decline to certify the agreement. Uzi Arad, a former top Mossad official who served as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser, traveled to Washington last week to lobby Republicans on Capitol Hill to preserve the agreement.

On Tuesday, Condoleezza Rice, who served as President George W. Bush’s secretary of state, added her voice to those urging Mr. Trump not to disavow the deal, which was negotiated by the Obama administration. “The United States wants to be seen as living up to the obligations that it’s undertaken from president to president to president,” she said on Fox News.

Mr. Barak’s advocacy for the deal is particularly significant because, as Israel’s defense minister from 2007 to 2013, he led the preparations for a possible military strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities. He warned then that if the Israelis did not act at some point, Iran’s effort to produce a bomb would no longer be vulnerable to any military action.

He and Mr. Netanyahu were closely aligned in that view, but they faced resistance from the chiefs of Israel’s intelligence agencies, who argued that a military strike could have catastrophic consequences and that they were exaggerating the imminence of the Iranian threat.

President Barack Obama implored Mr. Netanyahu to give American efforts at pressure and diplomacy time to work, which he did grudgingly. But the prime minister never liked the resulting agreement. He lobbied against it in the United States Congress and encouraged Mr. Trump to try to renegotiate its terms. (Israel is not part of the deal.)

“Change it, or cancel it,” Mr. Netanyahu said at the United Nations last month. “Fix it, or nix it.”

Under the action being contemplated by the White House, Mr. Trump would essentially kick the agreement to Congress, which would have to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran — a step that would almost certainly blow up the deal — or use the threat of renewed sanctions to try to force the Iranians to renegotiate parts of the agreement.

“Like many Israelis,” Mr. Barak said, “I think the Iran deal is a bad deal. But it is a done deal.”

With the agreement in place, he said, “Iran is far from being an existential threat to Israel.” But he added, “It carries all the potential of turning into an existential threat in the longer-term” — a scenario made more, not less likely, by walking away from the deal, he said.

While refusing to certify the agreement would be politically satisfying for Mr. Trump, Mr. Barak said, it would also not help the United States in its campaign to curb Iran’s ballistic missile program, its support for terrorist organizations, or its cyberwarfare operations.

For Mr. Barak, the implications for North Korea are just as far-reaching. The United States, he said, had no military option to destroy the North’s nuclear facilities because of the massive retaliation that the North Korean leader would inflict on South Korea. That leaves only a strategy of negotiations, backed by sanctions, to coerce the North to curb its behavior.

“Kim Jong-un is extreme,” Mr. Barak said. “But he is totally predictable and almost transparent — simple to understand. He just doesn’t want to experience what happened to Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein. Basically, there is no way he will give up his nuclear intentions.”

Mr. Barak, now 75 and a nonresident senior fellow at the Belfer Center at Harvard, said the bellicose threats between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump raised the risks of a miscalculation that could lead to war.

“No one personally remembers the Cuban crisis or the Berlin crisis,” he said. “People at the leadership level don’t have the fingertip feel for how easily the world situation can cascade.”","Ehud Barak, Israeli Hawk and No Friend of Iran, Urges Trump to Keep Nuclear Deal",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/us/politics/trump-ehud-barak-iran-nuclear-deal.html

5A: Hi, kids! I wasn’t around for ADLAI Stevenson’s presidential campaign either, but I got this and I’ll explain how I did it.

In the mid-20th century, it was apparently fashionable among campaign slogan writers to try to make their slogans rhyme, primarily because it would have been considered laughable at the time to suggest that the candidate might want to have a beer with anyone who wasn’t at least a governor. Slogan writers would sit in small, smoke-filled offices with long lists of words that rhymed with their candidate’s name (“Badly for Adlai?” “No. ...” “Sadly for Adlai?” No!”), and they were released only when they hit on something that was not terrible and could fit on a campaign button. My point is, if you see a clue like “‘Madly for ___’ (1952 campaign slogan),” you have enough information to know that you should be thinking about a midcentury candidate whose name rhymed with “madly.”

42A: The holy Kaaba is a CUBE-shaped mosque in the town of Makka.

49A/57D: It’s unusual to see two words that are so close in current meaning in the same puzzle (YEARN and YENS), especially when they are clued so similarly. The etymology of the two words is different, however, so it’s allowable.

67A: “Even Homer NODS” is an idiom that means that even people who are the best at something can make mistakes during a momentary lapse in concentration. It’s an allusion to the epic poet Homer’s work, which apparently contains errors in continuity.

In 1848, the Mexican-American War ended and the Gold Rush began.

Californians were hungry for stability in the western lands ceded by Mexico.

So it was that a constitutional convention was called in Monterey to establish the contours of a state government.

The 48 delegates reflected California’s immigrant character. Most came from states east of the Mississippi, six were California born, and the rest came from Spain, Ireland, Scotland, France and Switzerland.

The men deliberated for six weeks in Colton Hall, the first American public building in California. They chose San Jose as the state capital, and the Sierra Nevada as the state’s eastern border.

After heated debate, slavery was forbidden.

And on this week in 1849, they signed California’s first Constitution, written on parchment in both English and Spanish. Statehood was granted by Congress a year later.

Bayard Taylor, a traveling journalist, described the signing ceremony in Monterey.

As the delegates affixed their names to the document, an American flag was hoisted and 31 gunshots, for each U.S. state plus one, echoed through the hills.

With the final boom, there was a shout: “That’s for California!”

“I am saying exactly that,” she replied to The Times. She wrote nothing further.

Mr. Affleck had been one of many Hollywood allies of Mr. Weinstein who remained silent following a Times report on Thursday about three decades of allegations of sexual misconduct by Mr. Weinstein and at least eight settlements with women. On Tuesday, The Times reported additional accusations by actresses including Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, and The New Yorker published harrowing accounts of women who told of being raped by Mr. Weinstein.

Mr. Weinstein has denied the sexual assault accusations as described in The New Yorker and he has characterized other allegations as “off base.” But he has also apologized for “the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past.”

Mr. Affleck, in his statement posted to Twitter Tuesday, wrote that he was “saddened and angry” and that new reports of more serious assaults — which include accounts of forced oral sex — “made me sick.” But he did not say whether he knew anything about Mr. Weinstein’s treatment of women. Other actors, like Meryl Streep and Judi Dench, said they were unaware of the accusations, and Glenn Close said she had heard “vague rumors.”

In 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a $100,000 settlement with Ms. McGowan after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival, according to the Times report on Thursday.

Ms. McGowan and Mr. Affleck appeared together in the 1997 movie “Going All the Way” and the 1998 movie “Phantoms.”

While several prominent actresses spoke out on Monday against Mr. Weinstein, Mr. Affleck was one of a small cadre of prominent male figures in Hollywood with ties to Mr. Weinstein who criticized him on Tuesday after the new reports in The Times and The New Yorker.

Matt Damon, Mr. Affleck’s longtime friend and film collaborator, said in an interview with Deadline on Tuesday that he “never saw” Mr. Weinstein harass or abuse women and that he would have put an end to it if he had. Mr. Damon’s and Mr. Affleck’s film careers were kicked off by “Good Will Hunting,” which Mr. Weinstein backed.

“This type of predation happens behind closed doors and out of public view,” Mr. Damon said. “If there was ever an event that I was at, and Harvey was doing this kind of thing and I didn’t see it, then I am so deeply sorry, because I would have stopped it.”

Several directors with close ties to Mr. Weinstein, such as Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, have not responded to requests for comment this week, however. An email to the director Stephen Daldry also received no response, and a representative for the director James Gray said he was in production on a new film and unable to speak. Phyllida Lloyd declined to comment.

As more women have come forward, questions have swirled over who in Hollywood might have known something and even directly or indirectly enabled him or protected him. Roughly two dozen former assistants and young actresses have said the powerful and widely feared producer routinely asked them to his hotel room under the pretense of talking about roles or work, and then solicited massages while he was naked or wearing a bathrobe, or sexually forced himself on them.

Ms. Paltrow told The Times that when she was 22, Mr. Weinstein invited her to his hotel bedroom for a work meeting and later proposed a massage. She said she had fled in terror and later relayed the incident to her boyfriend at the time, Brad Pitt. Mr. Pitt confirmed that he later confronted Mr. Weinstein at a theater premiere and told him to never touch her again.

Mr. Affleck later dated Ms. Paltrow, though it is not known whether she relayed news of the incident to him.

George Clooney has also weighed in on the controversy, telling The Daily Beast in an interview that was published Monday night that while he was aware of rumors that young actresses had slept with Mr. Weinstein to get roles, he had been unaware of any misconduct or the settlements Mr. Weinstein had reached with women.

“I didn’t hear anything about that, and I don’t know anyone that did. That’s a whole other level, and there’s no way you can reconcile that,” said Mr. Clooney, who has worked with Mr. Weinstein repeatedly over 20 years. “There’s nothing to say except that it’s indefensible.”",Rose McGowan Attacks Ben Affleck Over Harvey Weinstein: ‘You Lie’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/movies/rose-mcgowan-ben-affleck-matt-damon-weinstein.html

Would it have been nice if Iran had been persuaded to dismantle its nuclear program and its scientists induced to consign their mastery of the nuclear fuel cycle to amnesiac oblivion? Sure. Dream on. Diplomacy takes place in the real world, as those mouthing off about North Korean nuclear dismantlement will discover. It involves trade-offs equally painful for both sides that produce an imperfect outcome better than the alternative.

(If anyone needs reminding of the alternative, North Korea has nukes. Iran does not — and is now further from one than it was. One of the extraordinary aspects of Trump’s caprice is his apparent willingness to open a second nuclear front, like some loony generalissimo who wakes up feeling an Asian conflagration is insufficient, a Middle Eastern one is needed, too.)

Thanks to Dexter Filkins at The New Yorker we have a verbatim account of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s first encounter last month with the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Tillerson is an ineffective secretary of state whose major contribution to truth-telling has been to call his boss, Trump, a moron. Still, as long as he’s around, he’s beholden to the Trump line on Iran, whatever his own reservations.

So Tillerson tells Zarif: “No one can credibly claim that Iran has positively contributed to regional peace and security.” This is true, but irrelevant to the nuclear deal. He tells Zarif that lifting sanctions under the accord “has enabled Iran’s unacceptable behavior.” This is untrue and so by definition irrelevant. He says of Iran and the United States, “the relationship has been defined by violence — against us.” The violence has gone both ways, and this is irrelevant.

Bait and switch: Imagine if Iran said it planned to rip up the nuclear agreement because the United States elected a Saudi-loving, Iran-hating president in Trump; and his dancing with the Saudi royals, combined with his Qatar derangement syndrome, had not “contributed to regional peace and security.”

Filkins writes of the encounter: “An aide to Tillerson later told me, ‘It was one of the finest moments in American diplomacy in the last fifty years.’ ”

I am paid to produce words. I regret that this sentence renders me speechless.

Of course, a Trump refusal to certify may not unravel the deal, but it would put it on life-support, as well as doing lasting damage to American credibility.

The Republican-controlled Congress may not reimpose sanctions — a step that would kill the accord — or take other legislative action to scuttle it, but Trump will already have done enough damage to make any nation question why it should conclude a deal with the United States. Only Trump could contrive to cede the moral high ground to Iran.

Trump will also have made the Middle East more dangerous, reinforced Iranian hard-liners, angered allies and done a disservice to Israeli security.

At my first meal I was nonplused by the shrimp cocktail: The shrimp were warm but served on ice, and the cocktail sauce was a bizarre and acidic collision of peaches and horseradish. The last time I went, these hot-and-cold shrimp weren’t on the menu. I hope they are using their time away to think about the choices they’ve made.

Nothing else was so misconceived. But spicy avocado dip punched the lights out of a delicately flaky Chinese scallion pancake with basil in place of scallions. Nondescript cheese, bland mushrooms and a pointless egg dragged down a pizza with a very good, light crust. And Manhattan clam chowder, repurposed as a sauce for a fine, clean-tasting hunk of pan-seared salmon, was the answer to a question nobody asked.

The only reason I can think of for hijacking red chowder like this is to make a connection with New York. But with a few exceptions, Public Kitchen doesn’t explore the city’s food in a coherent or illuminating way. And it doesn’t come close to hitting, as the website puts it, “all of the cultures that make up the eclectic mix and melting pot that is New York City.” Thai flavors animate one side dish, roasted carrots in red curry paste and coconut milk. But the main cuisines brought into play are Italian and Chinese, as if it were still 1970.

A good menu doesn’t need a theme to hang together, of course. The pastry chef, Eric Kalaboke, found a through line in slightly old-fashioned favorites like a fruit cobbler capped with sweet sticks of puff pastry, an extremely endearing chocolate layer cake with blackberry sorbet and peanut butter ice cream, and a quietly spectacular tartufo resting in sour-cherry syrup. As for the wine list, it does a great job of presenting reasonably priced bottles from all over, made by some of the leading producers in their regions. This is a nice surprise in a hotel that seems to have been built as a backdrop for the cocktail lifestyle.

And if your big idea is New York City, you’re probably better off underplaying it than going all out like the Grill, where they all but park a Checker cab next to your table. There are no lectures at Public Kitchen, blessedly, no footnotes or history lessons. The closest I got to an elucidation of the menu was when a server said, “Everything is individually portioned and meant to be shared with the table” — a Zen koan for our time.

Still, it’s a sign of trouble that what Public Kitchen is trying to pull off doesn’t come across clearly. You can have a meal that is mostly very good, or one that is decidedly mixed, but either way you will probably walk out not entirely sure what sets this restaurant apart, other than Mr. Vongerichten’s sensibility.

He doesn’t layer flavors like anyone else. These days he doesn’t have as many imitators as he used to, either, although his spicy tuna tartare slicked with sesame oil will be with us forever. He trots it out again at Public Kitchen, over sliced avocado, with an undulated rice cracker that left oil on my fingers.

It’s hard to tell whether he’s repeating himself, making a sly comment on how pervasive the dish is in New York, or both.

“Kim Jong-un is extreme,” Mr. Barak said.","An unconstrained North Korea could impel Japan and South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons, he said. In the Middle East, Iran’s renewed drive for a bomb would pressure neighbors like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey to do likewise.

“Think what happens in the next generation if Iran turns nuclear,” he said. “It’s become almost inevitable that we are entering a totally different international landscape.”

As Mr. Trump’s expected decision draws closer, other prominent Israelis are urging him not to decline to certify the agreement. Uzi Arad, a former top Mossad official who served as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser, traveled to Washington last week to lobby Republicans on Capitol Hill to preserve the agreement.

On Tuesday, Condoleezza Rice, who served as President George W. Bush’s secretary of state, added her voice to those urging Mr. Trump not to disavow the deal, which was negotiated by the Obama administration. “The United States wants to be seen as living up to the obligations that it’s undertaken from president to president to president,” she said on Fox News.

Mr. Barak’s advocacy for the deal is particularly significant because, as Israel’s defense minister from 2007 to 2013, he led the preparations for a possible military strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities. He warned then that if the Israelis did not act at some point, Iran’s effort to produce a bomb would no longer be vulnerable to any military action.

He and Mr. Netanyahu were closely aligned in that view, but they faced resistance from the chiefs of Israel’s intelligence agencies, who argued that a military strike could have catastrophic consequences and that they were exaggerating the imminence of the Iranian threat.

President Barack Obama implored Mr. Netanyahu to give American efforts at pressure and diplomacy time to work, which he did grudgingly. But the prime minister never liked the resulting agreement. He lobbied against it in the United States Congress and encouraged Mr. Trump to try to renegotiate its terms. (Israel is not part of the deal.)

“Change it, or cancel it,” Mr. Netanyahu said at the United Nations last month. “Fix it, or nix it.”

Under the action being contemplated by the White House, Mr. Trump would essentially kick the agreement to Congress, which would have to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran — a step that would almost certainly blow up the deal — or use the threat of renewed sanctions to try to force the Iranians to renegotiate parts of the agreement.

“Like many Israelis,” Mr. Barak said, “I think the Iran deal is a bad deal. But it is a done deal.”

With the agreement in place, he said, “Iran is far from being an existential threat to Israel.” But he added, “It carries all the potential of turning into an existential threat in the longer-term” — a scenario made more, not less likely, by walking away from the deal, he said.

While refusing to certify the agreement would be politically satisfying for Mr. Trump, Mr. Barak said, it would also not help the United States in its campaign to curb Iran’s ballistic missile program, its support for terrorist organizations, or its cyberwarfare operations.

For Mr. Barak, the implications for North Korea are just as far-reaching. The United States, he said, had no military option to destroy the North’s nuclear facilities because of the massive retaliation that the North Korean leader would inflict on South Korea. That leaves only a strategy of negotiations, backed by sanctions, to coerce the North to curb its behavior.

“Kim Jong-un is extreme,” Mr. Barak said. “But he is totally predictable and almost transparent — simple to understand. He just doesn’t want to experience what happened to Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein. Basically, there is no way he will give up his nuclear intentions.”

Mr. Barak, now 75 and a nonresident senior fellow at the Belfer Center at Harvard, said the bellicose threats between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump raised the risks of a miscalculation that could lead to war.

“No one personally remembers the Cuban crisis or the Berlin crisis,” he said. “People at the leadership level don’t have the fingertip feel for how easily the world situation can cascade.”","Ehud Barak, Israeli Hawk and No Friend of Iran, Urges Trump to Keep Nuclear Deal",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/us/politics/trump-ehud-barak-iran-nuclear-deal.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Though he was the first to admit that he didn’t look the part — “I’ve been old and baldheaded and ugly since I’ve been 28,” he reflected long afterward — Tittle became a marquee figure with the Giants and one of their most popular players. The Giants’ radio station played the novelty song “I’m in Love With Y. A. Tittle,” and when Tittle connected on long passes, Yankee Stadium reverberated to chants of “Y. A., Y. A.”

Tittle led the Giants to Eastern Conference titles in 1961, ’62 and ’63, though they were beaten each time in the N.F.L. title game.

He threw for 242 touchdowns and 33,070 yards in his 17 years as a pro, and his 36 touchdown passes in 1963 set a record that stood for 21 years. He was named the league’s most valuable player in 1963 in an Associated Press poll and elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971.

The end for Tittle as one of football’s best and most resilient quarterbacks essentially came in Pittsburgh on Sept. 20, 1964, in his 17th bruising year in the pros, when a massive lineman slammed him to the ground in a game that Tittle’s Giants lost to the Steelers.

Slowly, Tittle tried to pull himself up off the turf, woozy from a concussion, and Morris Berman, a photographer for The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, was there to snap the picture: Tittle kneeling, his shoulders drooped, his helmet knocked off, his bald pate exposed, his face bloodied.

Perhaps more than the Pro Football Hall of Fame would do later, the image immortalized Tittle in football lore — in the image of the aging warrior who had finally fallen.

Yelberton Abraham Tittle Jr. was born on Oct. 24, 1926, in the East Texas town of Marshall and grew up there, the son of a postal worker. As a youngster, he idolized Texas Christian’s star quarterback Sammy Baugh and threw footballs through hanging tires as he had seen Baugh do in newsreels. His older brother, Jack, who went on to play blocking back in the single wing for Tulane, honed Y. A.’s football skills when he played junior high and high school football.

Tittle became a two-time all-Southeastern Conference quarterback playing for L.S.U. from 1944 to 1947, having been deferred from military service in World War II because of asthma. As a junior, he led the Tigers to the 1947 Cotton Bowl game, a 0-0 tie with Arkansas on a windy, frigid day.

He made his pro debut with the Baltimore Colts of the All-America Football Conference in 1948 and was named rookie of the year. He credited his coach, Cecil Isbell, formerly an outstanding passer for the Green Bay Packers, with fine-tuning his technique and bolstering his confidence.

Tittle joined the 49ers when the Colts disbanded after the 1950 season, their first year in the N.F.L. (A later Baltimore Colts franchise was far more successful.)

He played for two seasons behind Frankie Albert, a 49ers future Hall of Famer, then became the No. 1 quarterback in 1953. He handed off to running backs Joe Perry, Hugh McElhenny and John Henry Johnson in what became known as the Million Dollar Backfield (for brilliance on the field, not for the salaries they earned) and later threw soaring “alley oop” passes to R. C. Owens, who would race downfield and then outjump defenders.

But Tittle’s San Francisco teams never won a conference title. Late in the 1960 season, Coach Red Hickey installed a shotgun formation, which required occasional scrambling that the aging Tittle could not handle. Hickey benched him in favor of the much younger and more agile John Brodie, who went on to have a stellar career of his own.

Shortly before the 1961 season began, Tittle was traded to the Giants for Lou Cordileone, a young guard, in what became one of pro football’s most lopsided deals. “Me for Tittle?” a startled Cordileone remarked. “Just me?”

Tittle replaced the Giants’ longtime star quarterback, 40-year-old Charlie Conerly, as the starter for much of the 1961 season. Teaming up on pass plays with Del Shofner, Kyle Rote and Joe Walton, he took the Giants to the N.F.L. championship game. But they lost, 37-0, to the Packers on a frozen field at Green Bay, and Conerly retired after that.

Tittle tied an N.F.L. single-game record by throwing seven touchdown passes against the Washington Redskins in 1962. He threw 33 touchdown passes for the season, setting a league record, but frigid wind gusts and a strong Green Bay rush in the N.F.L. title game at Yankee Stadium stymied him in the Packers’ 16-7 victory.

Tittle passed for 36 touchdowns in 1963, but he tore a knee ligament in the first half against the Chicago Bears at Wrigley Field in the N.F.L. championship game when he was tackled by Larry Morris. Heavily taped, Tittle returned for the second half but was unable to properly plant his feet and was intercepted four times as the Bears scored a 14-10 victory.

The Giants were an aging team that looked nothing like the Eastern Division defending champions when they regrouped for the 1964 season. The opening game turned into a 38-7 beating at the hands of the Eagles in Philadelphia, and then it was on to Pittsburgh to face the Steelers.

The Giants were leading, 14-0, by the second quarter when Tittle, deep in Giants territory, dropped back to pass. From the right side — Tittle’s throwing side — John Baker, a 6-foot-7, 280-pound defensive end, saw an opening and smashed into Tittle, 6 feet and 190 pounds or so, as he was about to pass. The ball floated loose and into the arms of Steelers tackle Chuck Hinton, who ran it back for an easy touchdown.

As the Steelers celebrated in the end zone, Tittle knelt there, dazed and injured, and Mr. Berman captured the moment.

The Post-Gazette did not run the photo the next day; editors there did not think it was anything special. But Mr. Berman entered it for prize consideration, and it won the National Headliner award for best sports photograph of 1964. It now hangs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.

“Baker had crushed the cartilage in my ribs and brutally gashed my forehead,” Tittle recalled in his memoir, “Nothing Comes Easy” (2009), written with Kristine Setting Clark.

“I also suffered a concussion and a cracked sternum. That photo would later become one of the most enduring images in sports history. What a hell of a way to get famous!”

Photo

The play was a turning point: Pittsburgh went on to win, 27-24, Tittle played out the season hampered by the rib injuries, and the Giants would finish with only two wins. “After that I knew it was time to quit, especially when I saw our other quarterback, Gary Wood, was wanting to date my daughter,” Tittle told Richard Whittingham, the author of “Giants in Their Own Words” (1992).

Tittle announced his retirement on Jan. 22, 1965, never having played on a championship team in high school, college or the pros. Later that day, the Jets, the Giants’ rival of the American Football League, held an introductory news conference for Joe Namath, their heralded rookie quarterback.

John Baker, the huge Steelers lineman who pummeled Tittle, died in 2007 after serving for 24 years as sheriff of Wake County, N.C., where he was wryly known as Little John. When Baker first ran for the office, his supporters printed posters with the photo of the battered Tittle and the caption “This is what Little John is going to do for crime in Wake County.”

“I didn’t object to that,” Baker told The Post-Gazette in 1979.

“I was just doing my job,” he said of his crushing hit on Tittle. “It’s a tough business.”

Tittle began selling insurance in the off seasons while a 49er. After his playing days, he developed his company, now called Y. A. Tittle Insurance Services and based in San Jose, Calif., into a major insurer for Silicon Valley firms and other businesses along with individuals. He hung his famous image from yesteryear in his office with the words “Nothing Comes Easy” written below.

In his memoir of the same name, Tittle recalled his playing days as a time when “I could be my own boss,” instead of having “some guy in the press box with three or four assistants” calling plays. It was, he wrote, pro football’s “golden era.”

The Mercury News of San Jose, Calif., reported that Tittle, who lived in Atherton, Calif., is survived by his daughter, Dianne de Laet, who wrote of him in the 1995 book “Giants & Heroes”; his sons, John and Patrick; his brother Don; seven grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. His wife, Minnette, died in 2012.

In August 1965, when Tittle approached the first autumn since his junior high school days when he would not be throwing a football, he likened himself to a warrior who had seen his last battlefield.

“It will be a strange fall for me,” he told Sports Illustrated. “For 27 years, from September to December, I have put on my armor and gone out to engage in what is, really, a sort of warfare. This fall I'll be attending to my insurance business.

“I am a Greek,” said Mr. Nikolaou, who calls both Athens and Chalkis home. “And I have multiple identities. I belong in the East, in the West, but I also belong in the Balkans. This was forgotten for Greeks. None define themselves as Balkan. I had to find myself.”

Early on, Mr. Nikolaou said the project felt like psychoanalysis, a dive into his soul and the way he learned how to feel. He became fixated on the notion of a shared, repressed Balkan identity, one that he could unearth and restore to the collective memory.

Theia , Ines Di Santo , Reem Acra and other designers presented their 2018 fall and winter bridal collections last week during New York Bridal Fashion Week. The styles that graced the runways were a departure from tradition and a celebration of femininity and romance. Many of the looks featured gowns in soft shades of blush, body-hugging textured gowns adorned in fur and fringe, and showstopping bridal jumpsuits. Here is a look at some of what we saw during bridal fashion week.

Fierce Jumpsuits

Many bridal designers have expanded their bridal collections beyond glittery ball gowns and mermaid silhouettes. The designers Ines Di Santo and Theia sent glamorous jumpsuits down the runway that could be worn as a wedding gown alternative or worn for prewedding events.

Feathers and Fringe

Textured embellishments like feathers and fringe made an unexpected appearance. The designers Hayley Paige and Berta adorned their gowns with layers of feathers, while Pronovias closed their show with a bedazzled gown with fringe from top to bottom.

Inspired by Outerwear

Capes were all the rage last season. However, this season we’ve seen the introduction of intricately designed capelets, blazers and bolero jackets paired with gowns of all shapes and sizes. Inbal Dror paired a structured blazer with a revealing tulle skirt and the designer Allison Webb paired a heavily beaded bolero with a simple silhouette.

Sheer Perfection

Designers have proven that skin is always in, as barely-there gowns have yet again been a staple on the runways during bridal fashion week. The designer Berta showcased a gown with a detailed lace appliqué design and a full sheer skirt and train. The designer Reem Acra accentuated a metallic ball gown with a voluminous sheer-paneled skirt.

Blush is the New White

Who said all brides have to wear white? Designers like Lazaro , Galia Lahav and Inbal Dror all sent blush-toned gowns down the runway in traditional silhouettes like the ball gown. The soft shades of pink and rose was a slightly daring, yet romantic departure from the traditional white gowns.

I used it to explore a neighborhood where I used to be a local (Astoria, Queens) to see if it could deliver. The fact that it included a wide assortment of suggestions in a borough not named Manhattan was impressive enough, compared to the other apps I tested, but the recommendations themselves were also spot on.

For example, Astoria’s popular Bohemian Hall and Beer Garden was rightfully featured, but so was SingleCut Brewery, a lesser-known, but worthwhile, beer spot.

The advice for each location is the perfect length — detailed but not overwhelming, and the “Nearby” tab on the map makes it easy to scope out places wherever you are.

Cool Cousin

This app scored points for originality as well as its practicality, and is perfect for travelers who don’t have any cool cousins of their own.

Cool Cousin gives you access to contributors in 40 large cities around the world. Each “cousin” has a profile, with name, age, photo, occupation and a lot more information. The idea is to add those to your network who seem to have similar tastes to your own. After each add, the cousin’s recommendations are added to your map and broken down into eight different categories, such as food, coffee, night life and outdoors.

The app seems geared toward younger travelers — it feels like a cross between Facebook, Tinder and Foursquare — and most of the cousins themselves have an appropriately hipster look. For New York, this leads to a higher concentration of recommendations below 14th Street in Manhattan and several in Brooklyn (very few in Queens), and heavy in the food and night life areas.

But the app itself is easy to figure out, and the map includes the option to download and use offline (for free). No matter where you are, just hit the location arrow to see what’s nearby.

The recommendations themselves are solid and are written casually — think Yelp, minus the negativity. I added 26 of 55 available cousins in New York and was impressed with what was revealed, including free public gardens and lesser-known art galleries, as well as a wide variety of intriguing bars and restaurants.

Your new cousins will even message you through the app to say hello, and you have the option of writing them back to ask for more tips. You will also get a push notification every time you receive a new message, which you can turn off by adjusting your settings. After asking two of my paired cousins, I received additional restaurant recommendations.

Like a Local

Well-designed and easy to navigate, Like a Local has fewer contributors than the other apps (28, providing 197 tips for New York at the time of writing) but it is in more cities than the others (over 300) and best functions as a complementary tool.

The recommendations are detailed yet concise, giving an excellent general overview and a “special tip” for each location. For example, at the Brazilian restaurant Beco in Brooklyn, Kelly advises: “Come early because the restaurant’s seating space is limited. CA$H ONLY.”

You don’t have to sign up to use the app, so you can dig right in and explore — though if you want to use the app offline, you have to pay $1.99 per city.

There’s also an option to “ask locals,” which works like a message board. I asked for Upper East Side restaurant recommendations (it is a neighborhood not represented well on any of the apps) and after a week had yet to get a response.

The recommendations included mainstream spots like St. Patrick’s Cathedral and the Central Park more often than the other apps did.

It was the first of many medications that Jake, who asked that his last name not be used, would try over the next year. But none seemed to work — and some made a bad situation worse. An increase in dosage made Jake “much more excited, acting strangely and almost manic,” his father wrote in a journal in the fall of 2015. A few weeks later, Jake locked himself in a bathroom at home and tried to drown himself in the bathtub.

He was hospitalized for four days, but soon after he returned home, he started hiding out in his room again. He cried, slept, argued with his parents about going to school and mindlessly surfed the internet on his phone. The more school he missed, the more anxious he felt about missing school. And the more anxious he felt, the more hopeless and depressed he became. He had long wanted to go to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but now that felt like wishful thinking.

Not every day was bad. During spring break in 2016, Jake’s father wrote: “Jake was relaxed and his old sarcastic, personable, witty self.” A week later, though, Jake couldn’t get through a school day without texting his mother to pick him up or hiding out in the nurse’s office. At home, Jake threatened suicide again. His younger siblings were terrified. “It was the depth of hell,” his mother told me.

That summer, after two more hospitalizations, Jake’s desperate parents sent him to Mountain Valley in New Hampshire, a residential treatment facility and one of a growing number of programs for acutely anxious teenagers. Over the last decade, anxiety has overtaken depression as the most common reason college students seek counseling services. In its annual survey of students, the American College Health Association found a significant increase — to 62 percent in 2016 from 50 percent in 2011 — of undergraduates reporting “overwhelming anxiety” in the previous year. Surveys that look at symptoms related to anxiety are also telling. In 1985, the Higher Education Research Institute at U.C.L.A. began asking incoming college freshmen if they “felt overwhelmed by all I had to do” during the previous year. In 1985, 18 percent said they did. By 2010, that number had increased to 29 percent. Last year, it surged to 41 percent.

Those numbers — combined with a doubling of hospital admissions for suicidal teenagers over the last 10 years, with the highest rates occurring soon after they return to school each fall — come as little surprise to high school administrators across the country, who increasingly report a glut of anxious, overwhelmed students. While it’s difficult to tease apart how much of the apparent spike in anxiety is related to an increase in awareness and diagnosis of the disorder, many of those who work with young people suspect that what they’re seeing can’t easily be explained away. “We’ve always had kids who didn’t want to come in the door or who were worried about things,” says Laurie Farkas, who was until recently director of student services for the Northampton public schools in Massachusetts. “But there’s just been a steady increase of severely anxious students.”

For the teenagers who arrive at Mountain Valley, a nonprofit program that costs $910 a day and offers some need-based assistance, the center is usually a last resort after conventional therapy and medications fail. The young people I met there suffered from a range of anxiety disorders, including social anxiety, separation anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. (Though OCD and PTSD are considered anxiety disorders at Mountain Valley and other treatment centers, they were moved into separate categories in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)

Mountain Valley teenagers spend a lot of time analyzing — and learning to talk back to — their anxious thoughts. During one group session in the summer of 2016 in a sunlit renovated barn with couches, a therapist named Sharon McCallie-Steller instructed everyone to write down three negative beliefs about themselves. That’s an easy exercise for anxious young people (“Only three?” one girl quipped), but McCallie-Steller complicated the assignment by requiring the teenagers to come up with a “strong and powerful response” to each negative thought.

She asked for volunteers. First, residents would share their negative beliefs and rebuttals with the group. Then others would act those out, culminating in a kind of public performance of private teenage insecurity.

Jake raised his hand. By then, he was in his third month at Mountain Valley, and he looked considerably less anxious than several of the newcomers, including one who sat slumped on a couch with his head in his hands. “I’m free to play the part of terrible, evil thoughts for anyone who needs them,” Jake said with a smile. He had already spent weeks challenging his own thinking, which often persuaded him that if he failed a single quiz at school, “then I’ll get a bad grade in the class, I won’t get into the college I want, I won’t get a good job and I’ll be a total failure.”

At Mountain Valley, Jake learned mindfulness techniques, took part in art therapy and equine therapy and, most important, engaged in exposure therapy, a treatment that incrementally exposes people to what they fear. The therapists had quickly figured out that Jake was afraid of failure above all else, so they devised a number of exercises to help him learn to tolerate distress and imperfection. On a group outing to nearby Dartmouth College, for example, Jake’s therapist suggested he strike up conversations with strangers and tell them he didn’t have the grades to get into the school. The college application process was a source of particular anxiety for Jake, and the hope was that he would learn that he could talk about college without shutting down — and that his value as a person didn’t depend on where he went to school.

Though two months in rural New Hampshire hadn’t cured Jake of anxiety, he had made significant progress, and the therapy team was optimistic about his return home for his senior year. Until then, Jake wanted to help other Mountain Valley teenagers face their fears.

Among them was Jillian, a 16-year-old who, when she wasn’t overwhelmed with anxiety, came across as remarkably poised and adultlike, the kind of teenager you find yourself talking to as if she were a graduate student in psychology. Jillian, who also asked that her last name not be used, came to Mountain Valley after two years of only intermittently going to school. She suffered from social anxiety (made worse by cyberbullying from classmates) and emetophobia, a fear of vomit that can be so debilitating that people will sometimes restrict what they eat and refuse to leave the house, lest they encounter someone with a stomach flu.

Jillian listened as Jake and other peers — who, in reality, liked her very much — voiced her insecurities: “I can’t believe how insignificant Jillian is.” “I mean, for the first three weeks, I thought her name was Susan.” “If she left tomorrow, maybe we wouldn’t even miss her.”

At the last one, Jillian’s shoulders caved, and her eyes watered. “I don’t want to do this,” she said, looking meekly at McCallie-Steller.

“If it’s too much, you can stop,” the therapist said, but Jillian considered the offer only long enough to reject it. She straightened her back. “No, I feel like I need to do this,” she announced. “I have a week and a half left. If I can’t get through something like this here ...”

Her voice trailed off, but the implication was clear: The real world would be much more anxiety producing — and much less forgiving.

Anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. But unlike depression, with which it routinely occurs, anxiety is often seen as a less serious problem.

“Anxiety is easy to dismiss or overlook, partially because everyone has it to some degree,” explained Philip Kendall, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple University in Philadelphia. It has an evolutionary purpose, after all; it helps us detect and avoid potentially dangerous situations. Highly anxious people, though, have an overactive fight-or-flight response that perceives threats where there often are none.

But sometimes there are good reasons to feel anxious. For many young people, particularly those raised in abusive families or who live in neighborhoods besieged by poverty or violence, anxiety is a rational reaction to unstable, dangerous circumstances. At the Youth Anxiety Center’s clinic in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, which serves mostly poor and working-class Hispanic youth, teenagers would object to the definition of anxiety I heard often at Mountain Valley: “The overestimation of danger and the underestimation of our ability to cope.”

“The fears can be very real for our kids,” explained Carolina Zerrate, the clinic’s medical director. “Oftentimes their neighborhoods are not safe, their streets are not safe and their families can feel unsafe if there’s a history of trauma and abuse.” The contemporary political climate can also feel “incredibly unsafe for the community of kids we serve,” Zerrate adds, explaining that many have undocumented family members.

And yet addressing anxiety is low on the priority list in many economically disadvantaged communities. Kids who “act out” are often labeled defiant or aggressive, while those who keep to themselves — anxiety specialists call them “silent sufferers” — are overlooked or mistaken for being shy. “If you go to a public school in a struggling urban area, teachers will talk about drugs, crime, teen pregnancy, violence,” Kendall says. “When you start to talk about anxiety, they’re like, ‘Oh, those are the kids we like!’ ”

Teenagers raised in more affluent communities might seemingly have less to feel anxious about. But Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University who has studied distress and resilience in both well-off and disadvantaged teenagers, has found that privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. “These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic,” she says, but there’s “contempt and scorn for the idea that kids who have it all might be hurting.”

Photo

For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they “never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop,’ ” Luthar says. “There’s always one more activity, one more A.P. class, one more thing to do in order to get into a top college. Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.”

It’s tempting to blame helicopter parents with their own anxiety issues for that pressure (and therapists who work with teenagers sometimes do), but several anxiety experts pointed to an important shift in the last few years. “Teenagers used to tell me, ‘I just need to get my parents off my back,’ ” recalls Madeline Levine, a founder of Challenge Success, a Stanford University-affiliated nonprofit that works on school reform and student well-being. “Now so many students have internalized the anxiety. The kids at this point are driving themselves crazy.”

Though there are cultural differences in how this kind of anguish manifests, there’s considerable overlap among teenagers from different backgrounds. Many are anxious about school and how friends or teachers perceive them. Some obsess about family conflicts. Teenagers with OCD tend to worry excessively about what foods they should eat, diseases they might contract or whatever happens to be in the news that week. Stephanie Eken, a psychiatrist and the regional medical director for Rogers Behavioral Health, which runs several teenage-anxiety outpatient programs across the country and an inpatient program in Wisconsin, told me that in the last few years she has heard more kids than ever worry about terrorism. “They wonder about whether it’s safe to go to a movie theater,” she said.

When I asked Eken about other common sources of worry among highly anxious kids, she didn’t hesitate: social media. Anxious teenagers from all backgrounds are relentlessly comparing themselves with their peers, she said, and the results are almost uniformly distressing.

Anxious kids certainly existed before Instagram, but many of the parents I spoke to worried that their kids’ digital habits — round-the-clock responding to texts, posting to social media, obsessively following the filtered exploits of peers — were partly to blame for their children’s struggles. To my surprise, anxious teenagers tended to agree. At Mountain Valley, I listened as a college student went on a philosophical rant about his generation’s relationship to social media. “I don’t think we realize how much it’s affecting our moods and personalities,” he said. “Social media is a tool, but it’s become this thing that we can’t live without but that’s making us crazy.”

Photo

In his case, he had little doubt that social media made him more self-conscious. “In high school, I’d constantly be judging my self-worth online,” he told me, recalling his tortured relationship with Facebook. “I would think, Oh, people don’t want to see me on their timeline.”

While smartphones can provoke anxiety, they can also serve as a handy avoidance strategy. At the height of his struggles, Jake spent hours at a time on his phone at home or at school. “It was a way for me not to think about classes and college, not to have to talk to people,” he said. Jake’s parents became so alarmed that they spoke to his psychiatrist about it and took his phone away a few hours each night.

At a workshop for parents last fall at the NW Anxiety Institute in Portland, Ore., Kevin Ashworth, the clinical director, warned them of the “illusion of control and certainty” that smartphones offer anxious young people desperate to manage their environments. “Teens will go places if they feel like they know everything that will happen, if they know everyone who will be there, if they can see who’s checked in online,” Ashworth told the parents. “But life doesn’t always come with that kind of certainty, and they’re never practicing the skill of rolling with the punches, of walking into an unknown or awkward social situation and learning that they can survive it.”

Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University who researches adolescent mental health and psychological differences among generations, used to be skeptical of those who sounded an alarm about teenage internet use. “It seemed like too easy an explanation for negative mental-health outcomes in teens, and there wasn’t much evidence for it,” she told me. She searched for other possible explanations, including economic ones. But the timing of the spike in anxious and depressed teenagers since 2011, which she called one of the sharpest and most significant she has seen, is “all wrong,” she said. “The economy was improving by the time the increase started.”

The more she looked for explanations, the more she kept returning to two seemingly unrelated trend lines — depression in teenagers and smartphone adoption. (There is significantly more data about depression than anxiety.) Since 2011, the trend lines increased at essentially the same rate. In her recent book “iGen,” and in an article in The Atlantic, Twenge highlights a number of studies exploring the connection between social media and unhappiness. “The use of social media and smartphones look culpable for the increase in teen mental-health issues,” she told me. “It’s enough for an arrest — and as we get more data, it might be enough for a conviction.”

Last fall, at a high school near the New Hampshire-Vermont border, I watched Lynn Lyons, a psychotherapist and author, deliver bad news to a packed auditorium of teachers and counselors. “We’re not getting the job done,” she said, pacing the stage at Fall Mountain Regional High School, where she had been asked to lead a professional-development training session about anxiety.

More than a decade ago, the school would have been unlikely to invite her to speak. Anxiety was barely on the radar of most educators back then, according to Denise Pope, another founder of Challenge Success, the Stanford-affiliated nonprofit. Pope remembers facing skepticism when she sounded the alarm about growing anxiety among teenagers. “We don’t have to convince them anymore,” she told me. “Schools are coming to us, eager for help.”

A gregarious speaker, Lyons kept her audience entertained by calling anxiety “the cult leader” — for its ability to convince people of falsehoods about themselves — and telling funny stories about overinvolved parents. But her main point was clear: In a seemingly well-meaning effort to help kids avoid what makes them anxious, administrators actually make anxiety worse. “Anxiety is all about the avoidance of uncertainty and discomfort,” Lyons explained. “When we play along, we don’t help kids learn to cope or problem-solve in the face of unexpected events.”

She pointed to the increasing use of “504 plans,” a popular educational tool that allows for academic accommodations for students with physical or mental disabilities. Though 504 plans for anxiety vary by student, a typical one might allow a teenager to take more time on homework and tests, enter the school through a back door — to avoid the chaos of the main entrance — and leave a classroom when feeling anxious.

Lyons believes in the necessity of 504 plans, and she is in agreement with many of the recommendations of Challenge Success, including later school start times, less homework and more project-based learning. But Lyons worries that too many 504 plans are “avoidance-based and teach zero skills.” She gave the example of a plan that allows a student to leave a classroom anytime he feels overwhelmed. Often, a teenager “can go wherever he wants and stay there for as long as he thinks he needs,” she said. Instead, she argued, a school should have a policy in place for the student to seek out a guidance counselor or nurse and do some role-playing that helps the student “externalize his worry,” similar to how Mountain Valley teenagers are taught to observe their thinking and talk back to it. Then the student should return to his regular classroom as soon as possible, Lyons said.

“If anxiety could talk, it would say, ‘You know, let’s just get out of here. We don’t have to do this!’ ” Lyons said from the stage. “But in order to retrain the brain, in order to create that message that says that even though I’m uncomfortable I can do this, we need to stop treating these anxious kids like they’re so frail, like they can’t handle things.”

Lyons sees a connection between how some schools deal with anxious students and what she worries is a generation of young people increasingly insistent on safe spaces — and who believe their feelings should be protected at all costs. “Kids are being given some really dangerous messages these days about the fact that they can’t handle being triggered, that they shouldn’t have to bear witness to anything that makes them uncomfortable and that their external environments should bend to and accommodate their needs,” she told me.

Among many teachers and administrators I spoke to, one word — “resiliency” — kept coming up. More and more students struggle to recover from minor setbacks and aren’t “equipped to problem-solve or advocate for themselves effectively,” a school counselor in suburban Oregon told me. In the last few years, the counselor said, she has watched in astonishment as more students struggle with anxiety — and as more of those “stop coming to school, because they just can’t.”

Some schools have taken drastic measures to accommodate what one administrator called “our more fragile students.” At Roxbury High School in Roxbury Township, N.J., there are two dedicated classrooms for anxious teenagers, including one next to a mural of Edvard Munch’s painting “The Scream.” These students typically avoid the mammoth school cafeteria in favor of eating lunch in one of the classrooms, as they did on the day of my visit last May. They had just finished gym class, an anxiety-producing event for some even as the school did all it could to reimagine the concept. Music blasted throughout the gym as the teenagers halfheartedly played something vaguely approximating a game of volleyball. The ball was allowed to bounce once before being struck — not that anyone was keeping score.

I couldn’t help wondering what Lyons, and other therapists I spoke to who worry that schools inadvertently worsen anxiety, would think of this approach. Some of the programs’ teenagers hoped to go to college, where no special classrooms would await them. How was this preparing them for that?

“Some will say that this feeds the monster,” concedes Patricia Hovey, director of special services at Roxbury High. “But you’ve got to start where the kids are, not where you are or where you want them to be. We’ve got to get them in the building. Many of our students simply don’t come to school if they have to spend all day in” general-education classes. Once the students are in school, Hovey explained, staff members can help them build the confidence and skills to eventually transition to Roxbury’s regular classes — and stand a chance at navigating college or a job once they graduate.

Even with the promise of a special classroom, getting anxious kids to Roxbury High each morning demands a herculean effort from the program’s teachers and therapists. During my visit, I watched them text and call several no-show students in an effort to coax them out of bed. They also regularly communicate with parents, talking them through what to say to a teenager who refuses to leave his room. Paul Critelli, one of the program’s teachers, told me that many parents feel overwhelmed trying to get two or three kids ready for school each morning, and that their instinct is often to “sacrifice the anxious kid” in order to avoid morning hysterics and keep the family train running on time.

Mostly, though, Critelli wants to talk to the anxious students. “What’s the issue today?” I heard him ask during a phone call with a sophomore boy, who had missed his scheduled bus and was presumably speaking to Critelli from underneath his sheets. The call was a “Hail Mary,” as Critelli put it, because while he suspects that the boy sleeps with the phone “right next to his face,” he rarely responds when he’s feeling anxious. “I appreciate you picking up — you don’t normally do that,” Critelli told him, mixing in positive affirmation with a call to action. The school would be sending another bus, and Critelli expected him to be on it.

Critelli looked for any opportunity to push students out of their comfort zones. During an informal study period after lunch, I watched him confiscate cellphones he said the teenagers were using to “hide from, control and avoid” their feelings; scoff at a student who claimed to be too anxious to return a book to the school library; and challenge a particularly reserved boy who said he had nothing to work on.

Critelli looked at him incredulously. “Dude, you’re failing physics,” Critelli said. “What do you mean you don’t have anything to do?”

“There’s nothing I can do — I’m going to fail,” the student mumbled.

“So you’re just accepting that you’re going to fail?” The boy looked at his hands. “Here’s an idea,” Critelli continued. “You can email your teacher and say, ‘What can I do to improve my grade? What extra work can I do?’ ”

Critelli surveyed his classroom of anxious teenagers. “I’d love to see you advocate for yourselves!”

Jake is a remarkably minimalist emailer and texter, eschewing exclamation points and emojis in favor of an almost old-fashioned formality. It can be challenging to gauge his moods that way, so I checked in with him regularly by phone in the months after he left Mountain Valley. He usually sounded content when we spoke, an impression confirmed by his parents, who were relieved by the changes they saw in him. In the fall of his senior year, Jake was regularly attending school — on some days he “even enjoyed it,” he told me with a laugh.

While he was careful not to overschedule himself, anxiety still sometimes overtook him. One weekend, he had to leave a Model United Nations conference after he became anxious and his stomach started cramping. “That was really disheartening, but when I struggle now it doesn’t last long, and I can usually get myself out of it pretty quickly,” he said, by talking back to his negative thoughts.

Jake also confessed to some worry about his application to attend U.N.C. He had decided to be transparent with the school about his anxiety disorder, partly because it helped explain his junior-year absences and grades and partly because the months he had spent challenging his beliefs and ideas at Mountain Valley perfectly fit the application essay prompt: Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea.

In 650 thoughtful and sometimes uncharacteristically dramatic words, Jake explained that in middle school he had “aced the tests and seemed to many as the bright future of the American ideal.” But then came high school and fear of failure, the debilitating worry that he might not be good enough. He explained that going to treatment helped him change his perspective on learning and life. “Just being able to type this very essay would have been impossible months ago due to my fear of judgment,” he wrote. “College is the next step in my journey to find a true sense of self, both academically and personally. The future has reopened its doors.”

The doors had not reopened quite as wide for Jillian, whom I visited on an oppressively humid spring afternoon in Florida. It was a school day, but Jillian wasn’t at school. Instead, she was on the screened-in back patio of the townhouse where she lives with her mother, Allison. A talented artist, Jillian loves theater and special-effects makeup design, and she was hard at work on an outfit for a “Walking Dead” costume contest at a local car dealership.

While she painted her costume to make it appear blood-soaked, we half-watched an episode of the Netflix series “13 Reasons Why” on her laptop. Jillian told me she could relate to many of the series’s themes, including cyberbullying. In middle school, she made a profile page on ASKfm, a social-networking site favored at the time by mean girls and their unsuspecting prey. Jillian was quickly targeted. “I’d get 30 mean questions or messages a day,” she said. “Most of them were like, ‘Just kill yourself.’ ”

Nothing like that happened at the small private high school Jillian attended after leaving Mountain Valley. Though the school is known for its flexibility and willingness to work with nontraditional students, Jillian still struggled to feel comfortable there. She didn’t want to open up and be known as “the anxious girl.” There were other students at school who had severe anxiety and depression — “It’s like the flu broke out here with anxious kids this year,” the headmaster told me — but Jillian didn’t feel comfortable hanging out with them, either. Several had yet to go to treatment, and “I don’t want to go backward,” she told me. But the end result, unsurprisingly, was that most students never got to know Jillian.

Her longtime pattern of missing school began again. She had the tools to challenge her anxious thoughts, but using them every day proved exhausting. “There’s feeling a weight on your chest, and there’s the feeling of 16 people sitting on top of each other on your chest,” she said. “As soon as I’d wake up, it was absolute dread.”

Needing to get to her job 40 minutes away each morning, Allison, who had sold her previous house in order to afford Mountain Valley, had little time to coax Jillian out of bed. They argued constantly. Jillian thought her mother — who was severely depressed during a year when Jillian was younger and especially needed support — could be insensitive. Allison struggled with when (and how hard) to push her daughter. She knew Jillian had a serious disorder, but she also knew it wouldn’t get better by letting her hide out in her room. Allison also couldn’t be sure when Jillian was genuinely paralyzed by anxiety and when she was “manipulating me to get out of doing whatever she didn’t feel like doing,” she said.

“The million-dollar question of raising an anxious child is: When is pushing her going to help because she has to face her fears, and when is it going to make the situation worse and she’s going to have a panic attack?” Allison told me. “I feel like I made the wrong decision many times, and it destroyed my confidence as a mother.”

Allison sometimes wondered how her own anxiety issues might have genetically predisposed her daughter to anxiety. Allison had done enough Google searches to know that anxious teenagers tend to come from anxious parents. Research points to hereditary genes that predispose children to an anxiety disorder, and studies have found that an overbearing or anxious parenting style can induce anxiety and risk-aversion in kids. In the parents’ workshop I attended in Oregon, Ashworth, the therapist, spent a lot of time urging family members to work on their own anxiety issues.

He also cautioned parents not to accommodate their children’s avoidance strategies. Families of children with OCD will routinely open doors for them, cook only the two or three specific foods they’ve agreed to eat and avoid saying certain words or sounds. Families of socially anxious kids will let them stay in the car while they go shopping, order for them at restaurants and communicate with a teacher because they’re afraid to. “So many teens have lost the ability to tolerate distress and uncertainty, and a big reason for that is the way we parent them,” Ashworth said.

While Ashworth can be blunt, he is also disarming and funny, with a self-deprecating sense of humor that appeals to both parents and their cynical children. Like many therapists who work with anxious teenagers, he tries to model a “let’s not take life — and ourselves — too seriously” approach. He also has an almost endless empathy for the challenges that these teenagers and their families face. He knows, for example, that raising a severely anxious child can feel counterintuitive. How, for example, do you set and enforce limits with an anxious teenager? If you send him to his room, “you’ve just made his day,” Ashworth told the parents in his workshop, who nodded knowingly.

Though Jillian had returned from Mountain Valley a more confident person with a nuanced understanding of her issues (and with her emetophobia largely under control), treatment didn’t solve her school struggles. As she fell further behind, her morning battles with her mother became increasingly untenable. In consultation with the school, Allison agreed to let Jillian drop out and study for the G.E.D. But Allison wasn’t happy about it; she considered it a momentary concession. “We basically said, ‘O.K., anxiety, you win.’ ”

Jillian was relieved never to have to set foot in another high school. “I’m just a lot more relaxed now,” she told me in her messy bedroom, where the walls were adorned with “Star Wars” posters and the bookshelf overflowed with young-adult fiction and sci-fi, as well as a worn copy of “Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.” Near her bed were two prescription bottles — one for Prozac and another for Klonopin, a benzodiazepine tranquilizer. Jillian had been prescribed a number of drug combinations over the years, and while none were panaceas, she believed she would be “a lot worse if I wasn’t taking them.”

Though she spoke to a therapist once or twice a week online, Jillian otherwise ignored the structured daily schedule — including yoga, studying and cleaning her room — that she had agreed to with her mother. Jillian told me she often felt lonely at home, and she spent much of her days texting friends from around the country, some of whom she met at “Star Wars” conventions or on social media.

At the same time, Jillian was trying to make new friends. I watched her joke with fellow contestants at the costume contest (where she walked away with a $250 prize), and she was practically a social butterfly at a film event she attended with her mother. Bored with our company after the screening, Jillian spotted two teenagers talking to each other in a corner.

“O.K., I’m going to go mingle,” she announced.

On a busy weekday morning last May, a new crop of Mountain Valley residents were discovering that a key component of their treatment would involve repeatedly making fools of themselves. On the Dartmouth College campus, eight teenagers wore hand-painted white T-shirts that read “Ask Me About My Anxiety” and “I Have OCD.” They were encouraged by the therapy team to come up with scenarios that would make them uncomfortable. One teenager considered approaching random guys on campus and saying, “You must be a Dartmouth football player.” Later that afternoon, a second group of teenagers arrived. One feigned a panic attack at Starbucks. Another ordered nonsensically at a restaurant.

“What do we need to do to make your anxiety higher?” McCallie-Steller, the therapist, asked several teenagers as they prepared for their morning of exposure therapy. First developed in the 1950s, the technique is an essential component of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety, which a vast majority of researchers and clinicians believe is the most effective treatment for a range of anxiety disorders. In a large 2008 study of anxious youth published in The New England Journal of Medicine, more improved using CBT (60 percent) than the antidepressant Zoloft (55 percent), though the most effective therapy (81 percent) was a combination of the two.

But while exposure therapy has been proved highly effective, few teenagers receive it. “We’re much more likely to medicate kids than to give them therapy,” says Stephen Whiteside, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Program at the Mayo Clinic. “And when we do give them therapy, it’s unlikely to be exposure. With a few exceptions, we’re not treating people with what actually works best.”

Part of the reason is that exposure work is hard. Anxious people aren’t typically eager to feel more anxious. “It’s also uncomfortable for many therapists,” Whiteside told me. “Most people go into therapy or psychology to help people, but with exposure therapy you’re actually helping them feel uncomfortable. It’s not much fun for anybody. It’s much easier to sit in a therapist’s office and talk about feelings.”

Researchers are trying to better understand how exposure works in the brain and to fine-tune its application for anxiety treatment. At U.C.L.A., scientists at the school’s Anxiety and Depression Research Center discovered that the more anxious a person feels going into an exposure exercise, and the more surprised he or she is by the result, the more effective it is at competing with an original negative association or traumatic memory. (That’s why McCallie-Steller did her best to ramp up the teenagers’ anxiety before they began their exposure work.) Other researchers are focused on virtual-reality-aided exposure therapy, which allows people to encounter the sources of their anxiety in a therapist’s office.

For two Mountain Valley 14-year-olds on the main quad at Dartmouth, the sources of their distress were numerous. One, a brown-haired boy who embarrassed easily, suffered from a dispiriting combination of social anxiety, OCD, binge-eating and depression. It was a lot to work on in three months, and he was often overwhelmed by the magnitude of the project. On this day, he had agreed to tackle his social anxiety by sitting next to a stranger on a park bench and striking up a conversation.

Earlier, another Mountain Valley teenager took part in a similar exercise, during which the stranger opened up about his own struggles with anxiety. The teenagers were sometimes surprised that others could relate to their issues. As one girl handed out fliers about anxiety on campus, she sometimes asked people, “Can I tell you about anxiety?” More than a few students — including one who looked as if he might actually be a Dartmouth football player — responded with some version of “Trust me, I know all about it.”

The brown-haired boy was highly anxious about his exposure. He bombarded the therapist, Bryan Randolph, with questions in a seeming attempt to run out the clock until they had to return to Mountain Valley. “Can I just sit on the bench for a minute?” he asked Randolph. “And can I sit down and then start talking? I mean, do I need to ask, ‘Do you mind if I sit there?’ It’s weird to just sit there, have a conversation, then get up and come running back to a group of people.”

“Even better — let’s make it weird,” Randolph told him.

The boy shook his head. “Maybe the guy’s on break and doesn’t want to be bothered.”

“Maybe,” Randolph said. “He might hate you. He might get real mad at you.”

“That’s terrifying,” the teenager confessed. “And what if we’re so close on the bench that we’re touching?”

“That would be awkward,” Randolph said with a half-smile.

The boy craned his neck to get a better look at the man. “Is he sitting in the middle of the bench?”

“I don’t know — he might be,” Randolph told him. “But are you going to ‘what if’ this to death, or are you going to do it?”

He eventually shuffled off toward the stranger, allowing Randolph to turn his attention to the other 14-year-old, Thomas, who stood sheepishly on a nearby corner holding his sign: “I’ve Been Bullied. Ask Me.” The “Ask Me” was hard to make out, because Thomas had also included many of the insults peers have hurled at him over the years, including “B*tch,” “F*ggot,” “Ur Fat” and “Kill Yourself.” Holding the sign on a busy corner had been Thomas’s idea; he thought it might ratchet up his anxiety and force him to interact with strangers, while having the potential added benefit of educating people about bullying.

Randolph and I watched dozens of students walk by, some giving Thomas’s sign a glance but most never slowing their stride. He had been bullied for years, and now he was being ignored. I felt anxious just looking at him.

Eventually, an attractive couple in their mid-20s stopped to read the sign. They smiled, Thomas beamed and after a minute or two of conversation they all hugged. “Oh, my God, that was the greatest,” Thomas announced upon his return.

I asked him what they’d talked about. “The muscular dude said he’s been bullied, too, in middle school, and that bullies get nowhere in life,” Thomas told us. “Then the girl said, ‘You’re really brave. Can I give you a hug?’ ”

“That’s not what you were expecting, huh?” Randolph said. “Instead of being mean to you, people actually treated you with compassion.”

“Yeah, it was awesome,” he said. “I feel so good!”

The brown-haired boy, meanwhile, returned from his brief visit to the bench: “It was sooooo awkward,” he reported. “The guy just kept texting. He was probably like, Why is this kid asking me questions?”

“And what if he was?” Randolph asked him. “You’re not responsible for what he’s thinking.”

The boy appeared to consider Randolph’s point as they made their way back to the van that would return them to Mountain Valley. Sometimes, Randolph told the boys, “exactly what you think will happen happens. Other times, the exact opposite of what you think will happen happens. Either way, it’s all manageable.”

The subject line of Jake’s email to me last winter read simply, “College Results.” I opened it: “Hey Benoit, I just wanted to tell you that I was accepted to U.N.C. Chapel Hill. Jake.” I emailed back to say that he could stand to sound a little bit more excited, to which he replied, “Trust me, I’m pretty excited!”

Last month, I visited him during his fourth week of college classes. It was a Sunday, and Jake met me outside his dorm wearing khaki shorts and a Carolina Panthers jersey. He looked happier than I’d ever seen him. “Let’s walk,” he said, leading me on a tour of campus and nearby Chapel Hill, where he went record shopping (he left with a Parquet Courts album) and played touch football with a few of his friends.

Since leaving Mountain Valley, Jake had prioritized his social life. “The health of my relationships with people is just as important as academics,” he told me on a bench overlooking the main quad. He had said something similar at Mountain Valley, but back then it sounded theoretical, aspirational. It felt true now. He had made new friends on campus and was keeping up with old ones from home — and some of his peers from Mountain Valley — via text and Snapchat, the only social-media platform he regularly uses these days. “My junior year, when things got really bad, I told myself that I didn’t need to hang out with my friends a lot, that all that really mattered was how well I did at school,” he said. “I don’t think like that anymore.”

That’s not to say that Jake doesn’t study. He does — usually days before he needs to. “Procrastination isn’t a good idea for me,” he said. But he was actually enjoying several of his college classes, especially Intro to Ethics, for which he was reading Plato’s “Republic.”

Jake had experienced only one intense bout of anxiety at U.N.C. For his info sciences course, he turned in an assignment online but realized days later that there had been a technical glitch and it hadn’t gone through. He said he felt “a sudden burst of anxiety” — his chest tightened, and adrenaline coursed through his body. What had he done? He sent a panicked email to his professor and told a friend who also has anxiety issues that he was “freaking out.” Then he took a nap, which had long been one of his coping strategies. When he awoke, the professor had emailed saying it wasn’t a big deal. “That ended that crisis,” Jake told me.

For the most part, Jake felt he was managing his anxiety. Over the summer, he met twice with Jonathan Abramowitz, a psychology professor who leads the university’s anxiety and stress lab, but Jake had put off finding a regular therapist for the school year. His parents kept bugging him about it. “I just haven’t felt like I need it here,” Jake told me. But then, a few beats later, he added: “I know I need to stop making excuses and just do it.”

I was curious how much of Jake’s newfound contentment had to do with being at U.N.C., with getting into his dream school. After all, a major component of his treatment at Mountain Valley was learning to accept that his value didn’t depend solely on academic achievement. How would he have reacted if his application was one of the 74 percent that U.N.C. rejected last year?

It was clear that Jake had thought about the question. “I would have been disappointed, but I really think I would have been O.K.,” he told me. “There are other schools in the world where I would have been happy. I definitely wouldn’t have believed that a couple years ago, but a lot’s changed.”

Before walking back to his dorm, where Jake’s friends were waiting for him, we stopped at the Old Well, a campus landmark where legend has it that students who drink from it on the first day of classes will get straight A’s that semester.

Disability insurance is more expensive than life insurance, but these two planning solutions require comparatively little effort. Most people understand they should have both forms of insurance, though not everyone chooses to buy it.

The planning becomes more complex with the so-called softer issues: the questions to which there are multiple but sometimes conflicting answers. Who should be contacted if something goes wrong? How do I want my personal possessions divided? What are my thoughts about going into a nursing home? Do I want to be resuscitated if I go into cardiac arrest? Any thoughts on a funeral?

“The best way to plan for an event you can’t control is to put your own plan in place,” said Sharon Klein, president of the New York metropolitan region for Wilmington Trust. “Otherwise, someone else is going to be putting a plan in place for you.”

Clients of a firm like Wilmington Trust are wealthy and receive a higher level of attention from advisers. But there are plenty of web-based services that aim to help anyone plan.

Everplans is one site. It guides users through a list of documents and discussions that need to be considered: wills, insurance, a health care directive, passwords for email and social media accounts, funeral planning. But it also has sections for storing keepsakes like family recipes or for leaving instructions about pet care or how things work in the home.

“We want to help people think of the unexpected,” said Abby Schneiderman, co-founder and co-chief executive of Everplans. “It could be anything unexpected. Natural disaster, flood, fire, illness, a death — you don’t know. The idea is: Don’t wait until it’s too late.”

The service, which costs individuals $75 a year, prods users to do more. It offers a 10-minute “just in case” plan that asks people to put down as much information as they know from memory, Ms Schneiderman said.

“We want to be a one-stop shop, but we also try to get people to take it a piece at a time,” she said. For instance, the service sends out electronic reminders to prompt users to take one more step.

Final Roadmap is another such site. It was born out of a nurse’s frustration with families being unprepared for the decisions and logistical considerations that happen at the end of life.

Steve Byrne, a co-founder of Final Roadmap, said the website, which charges a one-time fee of $249, held legal and financial documents, instructions for death, and messages for loved ones.

“All of those notifications can prevent problems that supersede money problems,” he said. Without proper instructions, those decisions “can blow up and result in siblings not ever talking to each other.”

Wealthier people tend to rely on advisers who are privy to a raft of information to help them, especially when it comes to tax planning, which could become more urgent if President Trump’s proposal to repeal the estate and other transfer taxes is passed. Adam von Poblitz, head of Citi Private Bank’s North American trust division, said the repeal of a tax that took 40 percent of a couple’s assets above the current $11 million exemption would increase the need for creating a trust because more money would pass to heirs.

“You need trusts to protect the assets from creditors but also from the beneficiaries themselves,” he said. “That protection aspect doesn’t go away” if the estate tax is repealed.

Not planning for the expected can also cause unnecessary confusion and stress.

“There’s a growing emphasis placed on how do you want to live the end of your days,” said Rachel J. Sherman, vice president of client service at Market Street Trust Company, which began as the family office for the founders of Corning Glass Works. “It needs more attention. People don’t want to be a burden.”

Monette Booth, 73, who lives in the Virgin Islands, said she had learned from her mother and aunt to keep her affairs in order. They “stressed to us children that life is never guaranteed and one should always plan for the future,” she said.

After her husband, Peter, a retired Corning executive, died in 2011, she stepped up her planning to ensure that she could grow old where she wanted, that she would not burden her relatives and that her assets would eventually be disposed of as she wished.

“For practicality and having no children, I recognized that at some point in my life, I will need help,” she said. “It’s taken a load off my mind to have made the decision.”

Ms. Booth said she had become part of a “circle of friends” in which she and others shared information that someone would need if one of them became incapacitated.

She said the planning was not difficult to contemplate. “I thought it made a lot of sense,” she said. “Otherwise, one is being an ostrich and not paying attention. This is part of an inevitable process.”

Most people are not this pragmatic, let alone proactive and organized. One solution for affluent people is a revocable trust, which can be used as a repository for financial assets but also documents to guide the family.

Ms. Klein of Wilmington Trust said many clients had revocable trusts drafted so that they became irrevocable in the event of disability or death. She said they could then function as a more sophisticated power of attorney; they could also help avoid the probate process of a will that delays access to the assets.

Yet deciding what to do to prepare, for example, for the possibility of becoming incapacitated by illness is a test of managing expectations around the unexpected. Jeffrey Maurer, chief executive of Evercore Wealth Management, said he presented the case rationally.

“My major concern for clients, friends and family, for myself, is what is the likelihood, if one were a gambling person, that I’m going to outlive my current cognitive abilities?” he said.

The answer determines what protections people should put in place, if they can afford them.

Plans can have limits. Barry Sinrod, who retired early as a market researcher and went on to write several best-selling books, said he and his wife, Shelly, had thought they planned well in case one of them became incapacitated. They even had a provision for assisted suicide.

His wife learned in 2003 that she had Parkinson’s disease but managed well until she learned that she had dementia. By 2010, he said, she did not know him or their children. He looked for someone to assist his wife in dying but found there was no one who would do it, because by that point, she was not competent to appear before a judge.

She died in 2014. “I said, I don’t want this to happen to me,” said Mr. Sinrod, 75, of Delray Beach, Fla.

When he met his second wife, whom he married in January, he brought up his desire to die with dignity, he said.

“Now, I have this document that says my second wife will take me to the Netherlands to die if my kids won’t take me,” Mr. Sinrod said. “My kids don’t like the idea of this, but they understand.”

Plus, keeping your device clean works in your favor in other ways too — it keeps your screen clean and easy to read, and it keeps dust and grime out of speaker grates, away from charging ports and out of headphone jacks (if you even have one of those anymore).

If you plan to sell the phone in a few months or years to help fund the latest and greatest model, keeping yours clean now will make sure it stays free of scratches and dings for the long haul. Luckily, we have a complete guide to cleaning your phone, tablet and other gadgets to get you started.

Start with a microfiber cloth to pick up grease and dust (avoid paper towels and other materials that’ll just push it around). For those stubborn spots or anything that won’t come up, reach for some isopropyl alcohol. Mix a solution of 1 to 1 alcohol and water, then moisten a microfiber cloth and gently rub those spots and stains away. For more tips, check out this step-by-step from Greenbot.

Your computer keyboard

When you’re not using your phone, you’re probably using a desktop or laptop computer, which means your fingers are constantly in contact with your keyboard. And considering many of us snack or take lunch at our desks, drink over our computers, or even spill beverages on them, you can imagine the gross, grimy world living just below those keys.

And while there’s certainly no shortage of bombastic headlines trumpeting that your keyboard is dirtier than a toilet seat (a bit of a misconception, as toilet seats tend to be fairly clean compared to other bathroom surfaces), so-called high-touch surfaces like keyboards really can harbor and grow harmful bacteria if left uncleaned.

Photo

On the bright side, cleaning a keyboard isn’t too difficult to do, as this extremely thorough guide from tech site How-To Geek explains. You may be startled by what you find beneath those keys, if you go so far as to pull the key caps up and clean out the dirt, grime, hair and crumbs that likely lurk underneath.

Even if you don’t, flipping the keyboard upside down and shaking the debris out, then using a small hand-held vacuum cleaner or can of compressed air will do the job as well. Then a quick wipe down with cleaning wipes, cotton swabs or a microfiber cloth moistened with that same 1:1 alcohol-to-water solution we mentioned earlier will take care of the parts you actually touch.

Your remote control

Be honest: Have you ever cleaned your remote control? Whether you use the one that came with your TV or something complicated that came from your cable company, odds are you pick it up every time you flop down on the couch to Netflix and chill. But you’ve never even so much as wiped the grime and dirt from the valleys between the buttons, have you?

That grime can add up, if you think about how many times you’ve likely snacked in front of the screen. Whether your preference is popcorn, chips or full-blown meals, your remote is likely filthy — and again, while it’s unlikely you’ll get sick from that crusty, grimy thing, it certainly isn’t doing anything for the life of the gadget you rely on to relax after a long day of work.

Photo

In reality though, remote controls, especially the ones in hotel rooms that are often used by a rotating crew of people without ever being cleaned, are pretty gross with bacteria. While we can make the case that you might use a disinfecting cleaning wipe on the one in your hotel the next time you travel, there’s no reason to wait until you leave home. Grab a wipe and give the one you use every day a good wipe down, and try to make it part of your cleaning routine. It probably won’t make you healthier, but it will prolong the life of your remote, and that’s enough for us.

Your pillows

You may not know it, but most pillows are designed to be machine washable. You’ll have to fluff them when they come out of the washer (or the dryer, if the manufacturer suggests drying them), and you don’t want to wash them too often or they’ll lose their shape.

And it’s a good thing too, considering pillows tend to be exactly where dead skin, dust, drool and in many cases, dust mites love to hang out. For most people, that’s not a huge deal, aside from the fact that they’re putting their face on a gross, dirty pillow at night to sleep. For people with compromised immune systems or who have allergies, they can be an irritant that makes for sleepless nights, skin irritation and sinus congestion.

Photo

Luckily for all of us, whether you have allergies or you just don’t like the idea of a gross pillow under your head while you sleep, the solution is easy: a trip through the washing machine on the delicate cycle, then tumble dry low or air dry. If you like, take things a step further and invest in a quality pillow protector.

The play, which originated at the National Theater, in a coproduction with Headlong, duly transferred to the West End.

But success came only just in time: If Ms. Gough hadn’t gotten the part, she was going to quit acting altogether. She’d had a year without any work, and was broke.

Over a recent lunch in a West London brasserie where she makes a joke of ostentatiously ordering lobster pasta, she’s able to laugh at how far she’s come. “I can’t believe it,” she said. “It’s completely nuts.”

Ms. Gough (it rhymes with cough), who’s lived in London since she was a teenager, is great company, her chat as quick and flashing as those very blue eyes. She clearly doesn’t suffer fools, and enjoys pricking actorly pretensions. (“I like to shout ‘Macbeth’ a lot.”) Yet beneath the expletive-riddled sarcasm dwells a spiritual belief that the universe is unfolding as it should; she rejected Catholicism, but retains some “faith in a higher power — something very personal to me.”

So when it came to Emma, she had a sense that it was meant to be. “People will laugh, but I feel like the characters find me,” she said. “The ones I’m supposed to play, I’m going to play.”

She still busted a gut to get it, however, even snorting a line of icing sugar when auditioning. “It was one of those mythic auditions,” recalled Mr. Macmillan, whose adaptation of “1984” just closed on Broadway. “This play needs a talent, someone very charismatic. Denise came in and grabbed it by the throat and wrestled it to the floor.”

Why does she think “People, Places & Things” connected so profoundly with audiences? “Do you know someone in your life that has addiction issues?” she threw the question back at me. “So does every single person in this room, yet it’s so shrouded in shame. Duncan tapped into our need to connect with each other about that stuff.”

Jeremy Herrin, the play’s director, acknowledged that “American culture is much more conversant in addiction narratives, with more purchase on self-help and the therapeutic conversation than us repressed Brits,” but contended that the subject is universal. And Ms. Gough’s performance is key. “Denise is so attuned to the subject matter,” Mr. Herrin continued. “She gets it. She’s very brave, very courageous.”

Photo

In rehearsals, where tears flow and vocal cords surely shred, it’s striking how Ms. Gough also frequently refers to time the company spent with addicts in a recovery center in South London.

“To me, it’s incredibly brave for an addict to get clean,” she said. “The most avant-garde thing you can do in the world today is live sober, because if there was ever a time you’d want to switch off all the feelings it’s now, right?”

Audience members would pour their hearts out to her after shows; she still wears a pendant necklace that a recovering addict sent her in gratitude. “It’s more than a play for me,” she explained. And she’s not about to jeopardize it by succumbing to excess herself.

“No, I’ve done it all — I don’t need to,’’ she said. “I am actually such a safe bet now, because my work is really important to me and I don’t want to be [expletive] that up.”

Ms. Gough is becoming a more regular screen presence, recently appearing in “Guerrilla,” John Ridley’s Showtime mini-series about the British black power movement. Next year she plays Keira Knightley’s lover in “Colette,” a film about the French novelist; Ms. Gough is Mathilde de Morny, who dressed in suits and was “one of the first women to identify as a man.”

Her heart belongs to the theater, however. Her first taste was playing Miss Hannigan in a school production of “Annie.” “I made the audience laugh,” she recalled, “and I remember thinking: ‘Yep, that feels nice, I’ll have more of that.’ ”

She grew up in Ennis, Ireland; her father was a head of fisheries, her mother a marriage counselor. She was the seventh of 11 children — which explains her love of applause.

“It is obviously psychological,” she said, “now, what I do for a living, is get attention. But I wasn’t brought up with the thought that acting was a possibility.” Stubbornly determined to prove her parents wrong, she moved to London at just 15, and after a precarious few years living in squats, won a scholarship to the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts.

Her experience has made her an outspoken supporter of immigration as well as government support for those out of work or on low incomes — a fraught subject in Britain.

“I am an immigrant, but the difference between me and the immigrants dying in the sea is that I’m white and English-speaking, and that to me is deeply troubling,” she said. “England saved my life, really. I took advantage of everything this country has to offer, and now I’m giving back.”

She is troubled by contemporary politics in her adopted home country, particularly Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. That, followed by the election of President Donald Trump, left her reeling. Yet “People, Places & Things” has also provided her with a framework for understanding the current turbulent state of the world.

”An addict has to hit rock bottom before they change their lives,’’ she said. ”Maybe the world is hitting rock bottom, and there’s going to be a glorious spiritual awakening where we all start looking after each other.”

Is she optimistic, ultimately? “I have to be otherwise I would top myself,” she answered. “I can’t lose hope. I refuse.”

On the heels of the four-week New York run of “People, Places & Things,” Ms. Gough will reprise the role she played this summer — another addict, the Valium-hooked Harper in Tony Kushner’s “Angels in America.”

But audiences can expect an unusually punchy Harper, not a hazy victim.

“Someone said to me, she’s really angry,” Ms. Gough explained. “Well, wouldn’t you be? Harper has to save herself. That’s why the speech at the end is pure joy. It’s got to be: ‘It’s going to be really hard, but I’m going to be free.’ Free from addiction, free from a husband that doesn’t love me, free to leave.”

Eminem, who has never shied away from a feud, has made Mr. Trump a target before. In August, during a performance at the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, Eminem told the crowd that he “can’t stand” the president before leading them in an obscene anti-Trump chant. Days earlier, at a concert in Glasgow, the rapper wore a shirt reading “FACK TRUMP” and made similar comments about the president before performing his song “White America.” (“See the problem is/I speak to suburban kids/who otherwise would’ve never knew these words exist.”)

But in an earlier era, the two men appeared together amicably. Ahead of the 2004 presidential election, Mr. Trump made a cameo in the Eminem concert special “The Shady National Convention,” which aired on MTV. “I know a winner when I see one,” Mr. Trump said in an endorsement of Eminem’s alter-ego, Slim Shady. “Donald Trump is telling you right now Slim Shady is a winner. He’s got brains, he’s got guts and he’s got Donald Trump’s vote.”

The rapper’s dense, blistering lyrics have courted controversy in the past, with some accusing him of writing homophobic and misogynistic verses.

And this is not the first time that Eminem has tackled politics in his songs: He has also taken aim at Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and George W. Bush. Last October, he released the freestyle track “Campaign Speech,” in which he called Mr. Trump “a loose cannon who’s blunt with his hand on the button.”

Eminem is thought to be gearing up for the release this year of his eighth major-label album and first since “The Marshall Mathers LP 2” in 2013. (A longtime producer for the rapper said earlier this month that the new music was “done.”) In the last few years, he has popped up for occasional guest verses and soundtrack songs — he is featured on Pink’s “Revenge,” out Friday — but has largely remained in the shadows, away from celebrity and social media.

“Sometimes I think that if I get comfortable or set in my ways of doing something, maybe I should step back for a minute and figure out how to mix it up a little bit,” he told The New York Times in 2015.

Other hip-hop artists and rappers have also targeted the president in their lyrics and music videos. The California rapper YG released a single last August called “FDT,” in which he repeatedly curses Mr. Trump’s name. Kendrick Lamar lashed out at Mr. Trump in his tracks “The Heart Part 4” and “XXX.” Snoop Dogg’s music video “Lavender,” in which the rapper aimed a toy pistol at a clown resembling Mr. Trump, earned a rebuke and a call for “jail time!” from the president himself in March.",Eminem Lashes Out at Trump With Freestyle Rap Video,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/arts/music/eminem-donald-trump-bet.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

My grandmother Lea once told me a story about the woman who lived next door to her in Tel Aviv, of her capture by the Nazis in Belgium and of an unfathomable decision she had to take to save herself. I never forgot it.

Even as a teenager, I was familiar with stories from the Holocaust. My grandfather had survived the horrors of the camps himself, and his stories formed a large part of our family’s shared narrative.

But this woman’s story felt different. Her pain and horror were woven with love, loss, guilt and redemption — and the epilogue was truly extraordinary. Many years later, once I’d become a documentary filmmaker, I decided to find out whether the woman was still alive.

We sat in her living room, the camera started rolling, and she began. She was sharp, funny and generous, and when looking into the darkness and recalling that difficult time, she did not spare herself one bit. When finished she seemed emptied, for the first time looking as old as her age.

I was moved, even transformed, but told her how sorry I was for having stirred up her feelings and memories like that. I’m not sure she fully absolved me, but she did say she was happy I had come to see her.

Throughout my lifetime the Holocaust has felt like one of the defining narratives of the West. Almost three generations later, the mind still struggles to make sense of what happened in that time. But one commandment, one kernel of a logical response, seems to be expressed by all who have lived through the horror: Never forget.

Many obstetricians resist giving epidural anesthesia during the late stage of delivery because they believe it lengthens the duration of labor. But a clinical trial by Chinese researchers has found that it does not.

The study, in Obstetrics & Gynecology, randomized 400 women in labor to receive either a standard epidural anesthetic or a saline solution in an identical container. Neither the patients nor the health care providers knew who was receiving which.

The average time from full dilation of the cervix to delivery was 51 minutes in the saline group and 52 minutes in the women who got the anesthetic, a difference of no clinical significance.

The number of cesarean sections, the number of forceps deliveries and the number of episiotomies were almost identical in the two groups. Seventeen of the obstetricians in the saline group stopped the infusion to speed labor, compared with 21 in the epidural group, again an insignificant statistical difference.

The only difference between groups was that the women who received the anesthetic expressed greater satisfaction with their pain control.

“Turning off the anesthesia won’t help,” said the senior author, Dr. Philip E. Hess, an associate professor of anesthesia at Harvard. “If you decide you want an epidural for pain relief, you should not be concerned that it’s going to prevent a vaginal delivery or cause any negative effect on labor.”",Epidurals Do Not Prolong Labor,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/well/family/epidurals-do-not-prolong-labor.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mr. Peltz has been pushing for Procter & Gamble to split into three independent global business units, among other changes. The company was trying to convince shareholders that the current management and board of directors are well into a turnaround plan, and didn’t need Mr. Peltz to help them carry it out.

While Mr. Taylor spent much of the meeting highlighting the success of those efforts, various shareholders who spoke during the question-and-answer period voiced frustration with the company’s performance relative to its consumer products peers. The company’s stock immediately slumped about 2.7 percent when the outcome was announced, but bounced back slightly to a decline of 1.2 percent in late afternoon trading.

“I think the vote suggests shareholders are willing to trust David Taylor — for now,” said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Bernstein Research, adding that the company would lose credibility with its shareholders and others if the turnaround didn’t materialize soon.

“Clearly this proxy fight and the close vote suggests the company needs to step up its game and start delivering to its potential,” Mr. Dibadj added.

Mr. Peltz went a step further, saying in the CNBC interview that no matter what the outcome, Procter & Gamble should put him on the board.

“Because even if they win, which I’m not sure they did, think of what a Pyrrhic victory it is,” he said. “Think about it. I mean, everybody but the current employees voted for us up and down the line.”

It is unclear where the preliminary vote count stands. In a conference call with investors and analysts after the meeting, Mr. Taylor said he had not seen the percentages behind the preliminary totals, but believed the company’s message had resonated with the large base of small retail investors. Those investors control about 40 percent of the company’s shares.

Many large institutional investors, Mr. Taylor said, voted at the last minute, and he said he had not examined those votes yet.

The official outcome may take a few days, or longer, to be known.

The next step will come when the independent inspector of elections issues a preliminary vote count to both sides. Mr. Peltz, at that time, can demand a review to look over the inspector’s work and challenge any votes that he believes were counted incorrectly.

After the review and challenge period, the inspector would certify the vote.

While highly unusual, this isn’t the first time a proxy vote has been extremely close. In 2015, Mr. Peltz received 46 percent of the votes cast in his bid for a seat on the board of directors at DuPont.

Bridal Fashion Week What We Saw at New York Bridal Fashion Week

Theia , Ines Di Santo , Reem Acra and other designers presented their 2018 fall and winter bridal collections last week during New York Bridal Fashion Week. The styles that graced the runways were a departure from tradition and a celebration of femininity and romance. Many of the looks featured gowns in soft shades of blush, body-hugging textured gowns adorned in fur and fringe, and showstopping bridal jumpsuits. Here is a look at some of what we saw during bridal fashion week.

Fierce Jumpsuits

Many bridal designers have expanded their bridal collections beyond glittery ball gowns and mermaid silhouettes. The designers Ines Di Santo and Theia sent glamorous jumpsuits down the runway that could be worn as a wedding gown alternative or worn for prewedding events.

Feathers and Fringe

Textured embellishments like feathers and fringe made an unexpected appearance. The designers Hayley Paige and Berta adorned their gowns with layers of feathers, while Pronovias closed their show with a bedazzled gown with fringe from top to bottom.

Inspired by Outerwear

Capes were all the rage last season. However, this season we’ve seen the introduction of intricately designed capelets, blazers and bolero jackets paired with gowns of all shapes and sizes. Inbal Dror paired a structured blazer with a revealing tulle skirt and the designer Allison Webb paired a heavily beaded bolero with a simple silhouette.

Sheer Perfection

Designers have proven that skin is always in, as barely-there gowns have yet again been a staple on the runways during bridal fashion week. The designer Berta showcased a gown with a detailed lace appliqué design and a full sheer skirt and train. The designer Reem Acra accentuated a metallic ball gown with a voluminous sheer-paneled skirt.

Blush is the New White

Who said all brides have to wear white? Designers like Lazaro , Galia Lahav and Inbal Dror all sent blush-toned gowns down the runway in traditional silhouettes like the ball gown. The soft shades of pink and rose was a slightly daring, yet romantic departure from the traditional white gowns.

So does Angelina Jolie, who said that during the release of “Playing by Heart” in the late 1990s, he made unwanted advances on her in a hotel room, which she rejected.

“I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did,” Ms. Jolie said in an email. “This behavior towards women in any field, any country is unacceptable.”

A New York Times investigation last week chronicled a hidden history of sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Weinstein and settlements he paid, often involving former employees, over three decades up to 2015. By Sunday evening, his entertainment company fired him.

On Tuesday, The New Yorker published a report that included multiple allegations of sexual assault, including forced oral and vaginal sex. The article also included accounts of sexual harassment going back to the 1990s, with women describing how intimidating Mr. Weinstein was.

Several days ago, additional actresses began sharing with The Times on-the-record stories of casting-couch abuses. Their accounts hint at the sweep of Mr. Weinstein’s alleged harassment, targeting women on the way to stardom, those who had barely acted and others in between. Fantasies that the public eagerly watched onscreen, the women recounted, sometimes masked the dark experiences of those performing in them.

The encounters they recalled followed a similar narrative: First, they said, Mr. Weinstein lured them to a private place to discuss films, scripts or even Oscar campaigns. Then, the women contend, he variously tried to initiate massages, touched them inappropriately, took off his clothes or offered them explicit work-for-sex deals.

In a statement on Tuesday, his spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. He will not be available for further comments, as he is taking the time to focus on his family, on getting counseling and rebuilding his life.”

Even in an industry in which sexual harassment has long persisted, Mr. Weinstein stands out, according to the actresses and current and former employees of the film companies he ran, Miramax and the Weinstein Company. He had an elaborate system reliant on the cooperation of others: Assistants often booked the meetings, arranged the hotel rooms and sometimes even delivered the talent, then disappeared, the actresses and employees recounted. They described how some of Mr. Weinstein’s executives and assistants then found them agents and jobs or hushed actresses who were upset.

His alleged behavior became something of a Hollywood open secret: When the comedian Seth MacFarlane announced Oscar nominees in 2013, he joked, “Congratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.” The audience laughed. According to a 2015 memo by a former Weinstein Company executive that The Times previously disclosed, the misconduct continued.

More established actresses were fearful of speaking out because they had work; less established ones were scared because they did not. “This is Harvey Weinstein,” Katherine Kendall, who appeared in the film “Swingers” and television roles, remembers telling herself after an encounter in which she said Mr. Weinstein undressed and chased her around a living room. Telling others meant “I’ll never work again and no one is going to care or believe me,” she reasoned at the time, she said in a recent interview.

Ms. Paltrow, 45, is now an entrepreneur, no longer dependent on securing her next acting role. But she emphasized how much more vulnerable she felt at 22, when Mr. Weinstein had just signed her up for a star-making part. On a trip to Los Angeles, she received a schedule from her agents for the hotel meeting with Mr. Weinstein.

There was no reason to suspect anything untoward, because “it’s on the fax, it’s from C.A.A.,” she said, referring to Creative Artists Agency, which represented her.

When Mr. Weinstein tried to massage her and invited her into the bedroom, she immediately left, she said, and remembers feeling stunned as she drove away. “I thought you were my Uncle Harvey,” she recalled thinking, explaining that she had seen him as a mentor.

After she told Mr. Pitt about the episode, he approached Mr. Weinstein at a theater premiere and told him never to touch Ms. Paltrow again. Mr. Pitt confirmed the account to The Times through a representative.

Soon after, Mr. Weinstein called Ms. Paltrow and berated her for discussing the episode, she said. (She said she also told a few friends, family members and her agent.) “He screamed at me for a long time,” she said, once again fearing she could lose the role in “Emma.” “It was brutal.” But she stood her ground, she said, and insisted that he put the relationship back on professional footing.

Even as Ms. Paltrow became known as the “first lady of Miramax” and won an Oscar for “Shakespeare in Love” in 1999, very few people knew about Mr. Weinstein’s advances. “I was expected to keep the secret,” she said.

Like several of the other women interviewed for this article, she felt she had to suppress the experience. She praised Mr. Weinstein publicly, posed for pictures with him and played the glowing star to his powerful producer. Yet their work relationship grew rockier over the years, she said, and she distanced herself. “He was alternately generous and supportive and championing, and punitive and bullying,” she said.

Now, with the process of tallying the size and scope of Mr. Weinstein’s abuse allegations underway, Ms. Paltrow and others said they wanted to support women who had already come forward and help those in similar situations feel less alone.

“We’re at a point in time when women need to send a clear message that this is over,” Ms. Paltrow said. “This way of treating women ends now.”

With Republicans in full control of Congress, there is no prospect in the near term that the president might be impeached. Even if Democrats pull off the unlikely feat of winning the House and Senate next year, it is unclear party leaders would be inclined to try to drive Mr. Trump from the White House.

Congress can only remove the president with a vote by two-thirds of the Senate. The Constitution specifies that a president can be impeached for “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors,” though in practice there are widely divergent views on what represents an impeachable offense.

A handful of Democrats in Washington have backed proposals to eject Mr. Trump, including an impeachment resolution unveiled by Representative Al Green of Texas, and opinion polls have found considerable support for impeachment among Democratic voters.

But Democratic leaders have mainly focused on attacking Mr. Trump’s policy agenda; they have urged rank-and-file liberal activists to hold off on talk of impeachment while the gravest investigations into Mr. Trump’s conduct run their course.

Some party strategists are also concerned that putting impeachment on the ballot in 2018 could backfire, because so many Democratic senators are seeking re-election in states Mr. Trump won.

But Mr. Steyer, 60, may not be an easy figure for Democrats to ignore: He was the single biggest liberal donor in the last two federal elections, making climate change his signature issue and insisting that Democrats support action to curb carbon emissions. Mr. Steyer repeatedly denounced Mr. Trump’s environmental record in his letter.

Though Mr. Steyer did not mention Ms. Feinstein by name, his letter appeared to allude several times to deferential comments Ms. Feinstein made about Mr. Trump in August, when she counseled “patience” to restive Democrats and suggested Mr. Trump could change to become “a good president.”

“It is clear for all to see that there is zero reason to believe ‘he can be a good president,’” Mr. Steyer wrote in his letter.

A national opinion poll published in August, by the Public Religion Research Institute, found that impeaching Mr. Trump was a minority position, but a popular one among Democratic voters. About 7 in 10 Democrats said Mr. Trump deserved impeachment, while 40 percent of Americans in general took the same view.

That quite likely makes impeachment a popular idea in Mr. Steyer’s home state, which is the largest blue state in the country and a stronghold of liberal opposition to Mr. Trump.","Pledge to Impeach Trump, a Key Donor Demands of Democrats",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/us/tom-steyer-trump-impeachment.html

The team he assembled wasn’t all stars. With a few notable exceptions, it was a coalition of the willing, and a ragtag one at that. And then, through his example and erratic behavior this year, he systematically diminished these recruits. If they had pride and much of a reputation on their way into the administration, they’ll be lucky to hold on to tatters of either on their way out.

The most effective leaders extract the best from the people around them. Trump provokes the worst. Tom Price, his ousted health and human services secretary, was shady from the get-go, but still: Would he have acted quite so high-flying and mighty — all those regal seats on all those pricey charters — but for Trump, whose entire rule smacks of economically self-aggrandizing brand promotion and whose family is busting the Secret Service budget?

Would Mnuchin be so blasé about his own use of government planes? According to multiple reports, he charged the government $800,000 for military transport when commercial flights were available — and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, too, indulged in needlessly expensive air travel.

Would Scott Pruitt, the director of the Environmental Protection Agency, have spent nearly $25,000 on some special phone booth? This fish rots from the bejeweled head.

And these people have become practiced at humiliation. Maybe their perks are Percocets for the pain.

Sessions twisted in the wind while Trump, in tweets and talk, rued that he’d ever appointed him attorney general and suggested that he might dismiss him any day. Spicer sucked up Trump’s boldly advertised displeasure with his comportment at the lectern and even the color of his suits.

Tillerson tucked his dignity into some sock drawer as Trump repeatedly contradicted his statements and undermined his authority. For Trump this was gleeful sport. He’s only as big as his ability to make his underlings look small.

Mnuchin signed on as his Treasury secretary to become his apologist, and was prodded to vouch for the president along lines having nothing to do with his portfolio. On a Sunday morning news show, he dutifully joined Trump’s campaign against pro football players who don’t stand for the anthem. In a public statement, he docilely claimed that there was no reason — none whatsoever! — to believe that Trump had any patience for neo-Nazis.

I flash back on that infamous cabinet meeting, when Trump coaxed those insane testimonials, and see more clearly than ever that he was establishing the terms of service: I strut, you slobber, for as long as I can stand you or you can stand it.

Osteria al Casale

Chef Fabio Paolicelli makes some of the best cucina povera in town — his cavatelli with mushrooms and caciocavallo is especially good — as well as pizzas with weird and wonderful toppings (try the mozzarella, sausage and turnip). Everything is served with local aglianico wine — an inky red with a mineral-heavy, peppery punch — in a simple, white-walled space with a terracotta floor.

Mr. DuBay and Mr. Fuldner have more questions: Did soot affect the health of birds and other wildlife, as it has in humans?","As early as the 1930s, scientists noted the darker feathers of birds collected in the early 20th century. Some wondered if they were an adaptation to pollution — like the peppered moths of Britain’s Industrial Age. But Mr. DuBay and Carl Fuldner, a graduate student in art history at the University of Chicago and a co-author, used a special microscope to look closely at the feathers. They were just dirty — dusted in the same tiny particles of black carbon that were there a hundred years ago.

The team realized this dirty mess was a beautiful opportunity. Birds molt every year, so grimy feathers contained no more than a year’s worth of black carbon. With enough samples, they could place these birds back in their historical context.

They quantified the sootiness by taking pictures of the chests of sparrows, woodpeckers, larks and towhees and measuring how well they reflected light. Black carbon isn’t very reflective — which is why it’s been a problem in the environment. It absorbs sunlight and generates heat, leading to alterations in cloud cover and precipitation or acceleration of the melting of snow and ice.

The team found that dirty feathers corresponded to historical reports and other atmospheric measurements — and they were more localized in time and space. They hope that scientists and policy makers can use the data to inform climate models and environmental policy. And the birds, once dead and void of context in museum drawers, now play a part in environmental history.

Mr. DuBay and Mr. Fuldner have more questions: Did soot affect the health of birds and other wildlife, as it has in humans? Did the dirt alter their reproductive strategies? And could birds in other industrialized nations of the past and present like England or China, also reveal hidden measures of air pollution?

“These collections are hidden treasures, and who knows what other questions we’ll be able to ask by getting into these museums and exploring,” Mr. DuBay said.",The Dirty Secrets Saved in Dead Birds’ Feathers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/science/birds-air-pollution.html

Emily Naismith, an Australian writer and co-host of the food podcast Ingredipedia, said that she, like many Australians, had eaten the salty, savory spread her entire life.

“I feel like Vegemite is the great equalizer through all of Australia,” she said. “I don’t know who they’re trying to service — which type of market.”

Anthony Agius, a Melbourne resident who says he has eaten Vegemite for 32 years, purchased the new product out of curiosity. “I eat a lot of Vegemite, so I figured, Why not try a new flavor? Maybe I’d like it more than original Vegemite.”

Mr. Agius said he could not easily distinguish the new blend from the original. “Really couldn’t tell the difference,” he said. “It’s maybe a bit more salty, if I think about it, but that’s it.”

Other customers took to Twitter to review the new version.

“Some people spread their Vegemite on lightly; some lather it on,” said Mr. Hill, the Vegemite marketer. “I particularly say for those who lather it on to try this special edition. The higher intensity of the Vegemite taste means they can use less and savor the jar for longer.”

When asked whether the new product may be a cynical, short-lived marketing ploy to draw attention and stoke lighthearted controversy, Mr. Hill simply encouraged Australians to “embrace the taste.” The company, he said, did not plan to reissue the product after its initial run of 450,000 units. But if the new blend proved popular, Mr. Hill said, Bega might keep making it.

With a history dating back to the dinosaurs, trees are the planet’s documentarians, watching us cycle through life while providing oxygen, shade and shelter. Trees, the oldest of which, according to Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees,” has 9,500 years, are a critical part of the human experience. We rely on them, from their deep roots to fluttering leaves.

But — at least when we’re not cutting them down — how do we influence trees? Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October. Traveling to more than 70 locations, they found trees that represent “landscapes of complexity where nature and humanity converge.” In other words, trees with stories, like the young sycamore that witnessed the Civil War, or the elm that survived the Oklahoma City bombing. These photos show how events have shaped trees, their energy, and sometimes, literally, the shape of their limbs.

“Forty-million trees are being lost every day,” said Mr. Jenshel. “We love the environment and wanted to do something that would make people think differently about trees.”

Though Mr. Jenshel and Ms. Cook — who are married, collaborate on all their projects and frequently finish each other’s sentences — have a long history of photographing trees, a much more personal seed for their project was planted in the spring of 2012. They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying. Struggling to process the information, she found herself watching the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms slowly drift to the ground, one by one.

“We did what the Japanese have been doing for centuries,” said Ms. Cook. “To take in that beauty, appreciate its ephemeral nature, and know that life does go on.”

Her father died soon after, but a new project was born, influenced by the cherry blossoms and a National Geographic magazine commission. “Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook. “And the importance trees have had throughout history in so many cultures.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, search and rescue workers were looking for human remains among the rubble, when they found part of a Callery pear tree, which traditionally is the first tree to bloom in spring and the last to change leaves in autumn. Though its trunk was scorched and many branches missing, the tree had survived the attacks. Now a symbol of strength and survival, the pear tree was nursed back to health at a Bronx nursery and, nearly a decade later, replanted at the World Trade Center memorial.

Other trees have been a part of unspeakable cruelties. From 1846 to 1870, in Goliad, Tex., an oak known as “The Hanging Tree,” provided shade for court sessions and branches for lynching.

“It’s not always a happy story,” said Ms. Cook.

One of the rain or monkeypod trees in Cambodia (imported from South or Central America), was isolated from the others as “The Killing Tree.” In 1975 when Pol Pot’s murderous rule started, the tree was used to bash children’s heads while their mothers were forced to watch.

“It took us days to recover from that experience of photographing that tree,” said Ms. Cook. “That left the deepest scar on us.”

Other trees seem to travel, and quite far. It is not clear how the adansonia gregorii (or boab) tree got to Western Australia. Perhaps it was the result of seeds dropped from the fruits by early migrants. It was a good thing, though, for the local aboriginals who used the tree as a spiritual home and lifeline, since it can hold up to 26 gallons of water.

In India, from the ancient tree deities to current bodhis of enlightenment, most trees are seen as sacred. In a Varanasi sweet shop, they found a neem tree, said to cure all ailments. Long after they shot the photo, Ms. Cook noticed her spouse’s anxiety.

“Len kept saying, ‘I don’t think we got the picture. I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled. “I totally knew it was about the sweets.”

For something we use for hours every day, when’s the last time you did more than just wipe off your smartphone’s screen when it was too smudged to see through? In reality, considering how often we use our phones, and where we use them (yes, that includes checking Facebook on the toilet), our phones deserve a more thorough cleaning from time to time.

Photo

Sure, a little grease from your hands isn’t the end of the world, but that array of pretty foul bacteria thriving on your phone shouldn’t make you happy. Plus, keeping your device clean works in your favor in other ways too — it keeps your screen clean and easy to read, and it keeps dust and grime out of speaker grates, away from charging ports and out of headphone jacks (if you even have one of those anymore).

If you plan to sell the phone in a few months or years to help fund the latest and greatest model, keeping yours clean now will make sure it stays free of scratches and dings for the long haul. Luckily, we have a complete guide to cleaning your phone, tablet and other gadgets to get you started.

Start with a microfiber cloth to pick up grease and dust (avoid paper towels and other materials that’ll just push it around). For those stubborn spots or anything that won’t come up, reach for some isopropyl alcohol. Mix a solution of 1 to 1 alcohol and water, then moisten a microfiber cloth and gently rub those spots and stains away. For more tips, check out this step-by-step from Greenbot.

Your computer keyboard

When you’re not using your phone, you’re probably using a desktop or laptop computer, which means your fingers are constantly in contact with your keyboard. And considering many of us snack or take lunch at our desks, drink over our computers, or even spill beverages on them, you can imagine the gross, grimy world living just below those keys.

And while there’s certainly no shortage of bombastic headlines trumpeting that your keyboard is dirtier than a toilet seat (a bit of a misconception, as toilet seats tend to be fairly clean compared to other bathroom surfaces), so-called high-touch surfaces like keyboards really can harbor and grow harmful bacteria if left uncleaned.

Photo

On the bright side, cleaning a keyboard isn’t too difficult to do, as this extremely thorough guide from tech site How-To Geek explains. You may be startled by what you find beneath those keys, if you go so far as to pull the key caps up and clean out the dirt, grime, hair and crumbs that likely lurk underneath.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Even if you don’t, flipping the keyboard upside down and shaking the debris out, then using a small hand-held vacuum cleaner or can of compressed air will do the job as well. Then a quick wipe down with cleaning wipes, cotton swabs or a microfiber cloth moistened with that same 1:1 alcohol-to-water solution we mentioned earlier will take care of the parts you actually touch.

Your remote control

Be honest: Have you ever cleaned your remote control? Whether you use the one that came with your TV or something complicated that came from your cable company, odds are you pick it up every time you flop down on the couch to Netflix and chill. But you’ve never even so much as wiped the grime and dirt from the valleys between the buttons, have you?

That grime can add up, if you think about how many times you’ve likely snacked in front of the screen. Whether your preference is popcorn, chips or full-blown meals, your remote is likely filthy — and again, while it’s unlikely you’ll get sick from that crusty, grimy thing, it certainly isn’t doing anything for the life of the gadget you rely on to relax after a long day of work.

Photo

In reality though, remote controls, especially the ones in hotel rooms that are often used by a rotating crew of people without ever being cleaned, are pretty gross with bacteria. While we can make the case that you might use a disinfecting cleaning wipe on the one in your hotel the next time you travel, there’s no reason to wait until you leave home. Grab a wipe and give the one you use every day a good wipe down, and try to make it part of your cleaning routine. It probably won’t make you healthier, but it will prolong the life of your remote, and that’s enough for us.

Your pillows

You may not know it, but most pillows are designed to be machine washable. You’ll have to fluff them when they come out of the washer (or the dryer, if the manufacturer suggests drying them), and you don’t want to wash them too often or they’ll lose their shape.

And it’s a good thing too, considering pillows tend to be exactly where dead skin, dust, drool and in many cases, dust mites love to hang out. For most people, that’s not a huge deal, aside from the fact that they’re putting their face on a gross, dirty pillow at night to sleep. For people with compromised immune systems or who have allergies, they can be an irritant that makes for sleepless nights, skin irritation and sinus congestion.

Photo

Luckily for all of us, whether you have allergies or you just don’t like the idea of a gross pillow under your head while you sleep, the solution is easy: a trip through the washing machine on the delicate cycle, then tumble dry low or air dry. If you like, take things a step further and invest in a quality pillow protector.

While you’re at it, consider cleaning your comforters if you haven’t recently, and some other household textiles mentioned in this list of home products you probably don’t clean as often as you should, from Wirecutter, the New York Times’ product review site. Then you can breathe easy while you rest.",5 Things Around Your Home You Never Clean but Should,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/smarter-living/5-things-around-your-home-you-never-clean-but-should.html

TUESDAY PUZZLE — I’m always amazed by the variety of talents and professional skills that New York Times crossword constructors bring to the table. Some are musicians, some are scientists, all of them are very smart. They’re definitely an erudite bunch, and Mark MacLachlan is no exception: He’s a chemist who was last seen taking us on a cruciverbal roller coaster ride.

In comparison, I bang out words about solving crossword puzzles on a daily basis, and my greatest achievement this week is to try to win a bet with my editor that I can get through an entire column about noble gases without making a joke about breaking wind. Let’s see how long I last.

In 1848, the Mexican-American War ended and the Gold Rush began.

Californians were hungry for stability in the western lands ceded by Mexico.

So it was that a constitutional convention was called in Monterey to establish the contours of a state government.

The 48 delegates reflected California’s immigrant character. Most came from states east of the Mississippi, six were California born, and the rest came from Spain, Ireland, Scotland, France and Switzerland.

The men deliberated for six weeks in Colton Hall, the first American public building in California. They chose San Jose as the state capital, and the Sierra Nevada as the state’s eastern border.

After heated debate, slavery was forbidden.

And on this week in 1849, they signed California’s first Constitution, written on parchment in both English and Spanish. Statehood was granted by Congress a year later.

Bayard Taylor, a traveling journalist, described the signing ceremony in Monterey.

As the delegates affixed their names to the document, an American flag was hoisted and 31 gunshots, for each U.S. state plus one, echoed through the hills.

With the final boom, there was a shout: “That’s for California!”

The Orbital Reflector presented an opportunity to ‘‘get messy .","The Orbital Reflector, as Paglen calls it, seems at first glance almost romantic, even deliberately naïve. It has no scientific purpose; it doesn’t even carry a camera. But under closer scrutiny, it can be seen as an elaboration of the artist’s ongoing thesis about art, technology and the impossibility of separating either from a specific moment in time. ‘‘It began as a thought experiment in which we imagined that spaceflight was the opposite of what it actually is,’’ he explains over lunch at Soho House, at a table overlooking the Berlin TV tower, with its iconic dome evoking Sputnik, Earth’s first satellite. In the American mind, space is a frontier: ‘‘We imagine going to the moon and planting a flag, going to an asteroid and mining, going to Mars and setting up a colony,’’ he says. ‘‘And I think that expansionist mentality is very self-destructive, especially given the kind of precarious relationship we now have to the ecosystem here on Earth, because it allows us to imagine that Earth is disposable.’’ Billionaire entrepreneurs may dream of colonizing Mars, but in fact, space is not going to save us. Aliens are not going to grant us absolution. ‘‘People expect this kind of profound cosmic altruism, which is very religious in a way. Space is completely wrapped up with this kind of stuff, which is what makes it interesting.’’

The Orbital Reflector draws a clear parallel between contemporary art and space exploration: the ideal of a purely visionary gesture, and the less starry reality. While the satellite — a small, five-kilogram box called a CubeSat, from which a 100-foot-long inflatable structure will deploy — has no commercial or military purpose, its success depends on the very systems of power Paglen has spent more than a decade critiquing. Built by an aerospace contractor called Global Western, it, likely along with a governmental reconnaissance satellite, will launch from California’s Vandenberg Air Force Base on a Space X rocket into low orbit. The project illustrates how unfeasible it would be to execute any other way: For all the talk of civilian spaceflight, it remains a thoroughly militarized domain.

Managing the project is Zia Oboodiyat, a retired engineer who ran large communications satellite programs for the San Francisco-based Space Systems/Loral. He first met Paglen in 2011 while the artist was working on the time capsule; Oboodiyat oversaw the construction of the satellite the disc was attached to and advocated for the project. When Paglen approached him about the Orbital Reflector, Oboodiyat immediately recognized its potential lyricism. ‘‘You don’t have to be rich to see it; you don’t have to be tall to see it,’’ he says. ‘‘You don’t have to be American. Anybody anywhere on Earth has equal opportunity to see something that gives humanity hope.’’

Paglen’s partner in the project, the Reno-based Center for Art + Environment at the Nevada Museum of Art, is fund-raising to cover the $1.3 million cost. The center’s collection includes extensive material from the giants of land art, including Walter de Maria and Michael Heizer. The Orbital Reflector places Paglen (for the moment, anyway) in this tradition — an artist defying the laws of nature and practicality in order to create a work larger than himself. ‘‘It is a high-risk proposition — rockets do explode; CubeSats sometimes fail to open,’’ says David Walker, the museum’s executive director. ‘‘But it’s exciting, too, because we see outer space as the ultimate mirror for human aspiration.’’ The Orbital Reflector is like the inevitable conclusion to the land art movement; Paglen’s work, like Heizer’s, may start in the desert, but will eventually leave the Earth entirely.

Paglen moved to Berlin partly for financial reasons — ‘‘I wanted to hire people, not spend $10,000 a month on a studio in Sunset Park’’ — but seems to have found a home amid the city’s young expat artists and WikiLeaks types. At a Vietnamese restaurant, he bumps into a hacktivist friend who looks all of 17. ‘‘These guys have guts,’’ Paglen notes, after saying hello. ‘‘He was way up the butthole of the F.B.I. I probably shouldn’t talk about it.’’

Paglen doesn’t describe himself as a dissident — ‘‘I’m as American as it gets, a product of these contradictions’’ — but it’s impossible not to connect the themes in his work to a childhood spent on military bases. His father was an Air Force ophthalmologist; his mother, one of the first female Episcopalian priests. In third grade, in the San Francisco Bay Area, Paglen got in trouble for skipping school to sneak into lectures on dinosaurs at Berkeley — the same lecture halls in which he’d later be working toward his doctorate. The family moved to Wiesbaden, Germany, when he was 12, and he spent two years in a German school in a nearby village, where, as a foreign student, he was ostracized. ‘‘When you’re not the beneficiary of privilege, suddenly you see it for what it is,’’ he says.

An ongoing theme in Paglen’s more satirical work is the puerile machismo of military culture’s symbology and nomenclature, ‘‘the collective unconscious of this world of secrecy and violence,’’ as he puts it. One afternoon, Hanna Mattes, who oversees Paglen’s studio and helps manage its external production, is consulting with the artist on one of the sculptures he’s making for the fall show: an enormous dragon inspired by the small trophy in his studio. The trophy, Paglen explains, is presented to members of the 315th Network Warfare Squadron upon retirement. Paglen’s version will be a 12-foot sculpture inscribed in fetishistic detail, like medieval armor for the cyber age. The best way to preserve the details, they conclude, will be to 3D-print the mold in four sections, lightly polishing them to remove any marks. Another concern is the weight: The finished dragon, cast in bronze, will weigh two tons. Paglen mentions a crane. Mattes looks at him. ‘‘Maybe we should just paint the form for the exhibition.’’

The dragon will be included in the 2018 Smithsonian exhibit. This year’s Metro Pictures exhibit will showcase Paglen’s ongoing work with different kinds of artificial intelligence technologies, taking viewers down a rabbit hole of imagery, from the now quaint-seeming pictures first made by humans in the early 1990s to train military facial recognition software, to the kind of ‘‘invisible images’’ computers hallucinate for themselves — say, when we post an image on Facebook — in order to make sense of the external world. ‘‘This is how an A.I. brain sees a shark,’’ Paglen says back in his studio, looking at a weirdly beautiful Abstract Expressionist-like swath of blues and grays that results from a computer creating a visual amalgam of thousands of images of the animal in water. The exhibit invites critical questions about the extent to which artificial intelligence algorithms, with their potential for programmed-in bias, are governing our reality. It’s also aesthetically provocative: ‘‘Man,’’ a distillation of figurative imagery, vaguely recalls a Francis Bacon portrait; ‘‘Rainbow’’ — a blend of cosmic-like rainbows — a Dali-esque dreamscape. ‘‘It’s like I’m relearning art history,’’ Paglen says.

So how does an artist who has devoted his career to empirical scrutiny of those things that will shape our future, from artificial intelligence to the annexation of space, respond rationally to a time in which reason itself — when it comes to political discourse, at least — seems to be increasingly endangered? ‘‘Those are foundational questions for me,’’ Paglen says. ‘‘Nothing that you make in the world exists in isolation from the social and political and ecological dimensions of it.’’ He hasn’t given up on art’s ability to spark the imagination — and to make us see the things we might prefer not to. The Orbital Reflector presented an opportunity to ‘‘get messy . . . to make something that’s beautiful, but also self-contradictory, and tries to challenge common sense.’’ It’s Carl Sagan meets Dada for a new millennium’s inhumanity.

As we talk, the sky darkens in Berlin, and the first blinking glimmerings appear. ‘‘For me, there’s something very romantic about going and looking at the stars and trying to photograph spy satellites,’’ Paglen says. ‘‘Ultimately, what it comes down to is looking at the sky and trying to understand something about one’s place in history. People have been doing this for tens of thousands of years. This is kind of a variation on that. What if we could imagine a sky that wasn’t out to get us, you know?’’",Art for a Post-Surveillance Age,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/t-magazine/art/trevor-paglen.html

But one of the refugees on Manus, Amir Taghinia, said that there was confusion about what the offer might mean for the men hoping to be granted asylum in the United States.

Would it have been nice if Iran had been persuaded to dismantle its nuclear program and its scientists induced to consign their mastery of the nuclear fuel cycle to amnesiac oblivion? Sure. Dream on. Diplomacy takes place in the real world, as those mouthing off about North Korean nuclear dismantlement will discover. It involves trade-offs equally painful for both sides that produce an imperfect outcome better than the alternative.

(If anyone needs reminding of the alternative, North Korea has nukes. Iran does not — and is now further from one than it was. One of the extraordinary aspects of Trump’s caprice is his apparent willingness to open a second nuclear front, like some loony generalissimo who wakes up feeling an Asian conflagration is insufficient, a Middle Eastern one is needed, too.)

Thanks to Dexter Filkins at The New Yorker we have a verbatim account of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s first encounter last month with the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Tillerson is an ineffective secretary of state whose major contribution to truth-telling has been to call his boss, Trump, a moron. Still, as long as he’s around, he’s beholden to the Trump line on Iran, whatever his own reservations.

So Tillerson tells Zarif: “No one can credibly claim that Iran has positively contributed to regional peace and security.” This is true, but irrelevant to the nuclear deal. He tells Zarif that lifting sanctions under the accord “has enabled Iran’s unacceptable behavior.” This is untrue and so by definition irrelevant. He says of Iran and the United States, “the relationship has been defined by violence — against us.” The violence has gone both ways, and this is irrelevant.

Bait and switch: Imagine if Iran said it planned to rip up the nuclear agreement because the United States elected a Saudi-loving, Iran-hating president in Trump; and his dancing with the Saudi royals, combined with his Qatar derangement syndrome, had not “contributed to regional peace and security.”

Filkins writes of the encounter: “An aide to Tillerson later told me, ‘It was one of the finest moments in American diplomacy in the last fifty years.’ ”

I am paid to produce words. I regret that this sentence renders me speechless.

Of course, a Trump refusal to certify may not unravel the deal, but it would put it on life-support, as well as doing lasting damage to American credibility.

The Republican-controlled Congress may not reimpose sanctions — a step that would kill the accord — or take other legislative action to scuttle it, but Trump will already have done enough damage to make any nation question why it should conclude a deal with the United States. Only Trump could contrive to cede the moral high ground to Iran.

Trump will also have made the Middle East more dangerous, reinforced Iranian hard-liners, angered allies and done a disservice to Israeli security. He is in a class of his own.",Trump’s Iran Derangement,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/opinion/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html

In labeling Mr. Corker “liddle,” the president was evidently returning to a theme. He considered Mr. Corker for secretary of state during the transition after last year’s election but was reported to have told associates that Mr. Corker, at 5-foot-7, was too short to be the nation’s top diplomat. Instead, Mr. Trump picked Rex W. Tillerson, who is several inches taller but whose own relationship with the president has deteriorated to the point that he was said to have called Mr. Trump a “moron.”

Mr. Tillerson initially did not deny it, but later he had a spokeswoman insist that he did not say it. Mr. Trump chose to believe the denial, or at least said he did, but in an interview published Tuesday, he insisted that even if it was true, he could prove that he was actually smarter than his secretary of state.

“I think it’s fake news,” Mr. Trump told Forbes magazine. “But if he did that, I guess we’ll have to compare I.Q. tests. And I can tell you who is going to win.”

Mr. Trump later denied that he had demeaned his secretary of state. “I didn’t undercut anybody. I don’t believe in undercutting people,” he told reporters, in a comment that must have amused the many people he has undercut since taking office. Asked if he still had confidence in Mr. Tillerson, Mr. Trump said simply, “Yes.”

At the time, Mr. Trump was sitting next to Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state who happened to be visiting the Oval Office on Tuesday. To be sure, Mr. Kissinger would hardly tower over Mr. Corker on the basketball court, but Mr. Trump, perhaps wisely, did not risk challenging the former diplomat to an I.Q. contest.

After the meeting with Mr. Kissinger, the president headed to a lunch with Mr. Tillerson, who was joined by a mediator, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said they “had a great visit” and denied that Mr. Trump was serious about the I.Q. test. “He made a joke, nothing more than that,” she said.

Mr. Trump was not joking when he took a shot earlier in the day at Jemele Hill, the ESPN host who has called him a white supremacist and was suspended on Monday for suggesting a boycott of the Dallas Cowboys’ advertisers if the team punished players who protested racial injustice by kneeling during the national anthem.

“With Jemele Hill at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have ‘tanked,’ in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.

He made no mention of the other dust-up in his household. In an interview aired on Monday to promote her new memoir, Ivana Trump, his first wife, told ABC News that “I’m basically first Trump wife, O.K.? I’m first lady, O.K.?”

That did not sit well with Melania Trump, his third wife and the actual first lady, who issued a retort through a spokeswoman dismissing what she called “attention-seeking and self-serving noise.”

Andy Cohen, the creator of the “Real Housewives” reality television show franchise, found that too rich. “This is actually happening,” he wrote on Twitter. “All the wives are fighting. Even I AM SPEECHLESS.”

Mr. Trump’s gibe at Mr. Corker echoed his name calling during the presidential campaign when he labeled Senator Marco Rubio of Florida “Little Marco,” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas “Lyin’ Ted” and Hillary Clinton “Crooked Hillary.” He has used belittling nicknames to diminish political foes since taking office, as well — think “Cryin’ Chuck” Schumer, “Psycho Joe” Scarborough and “Little Rocket Man” Kim Jong-un — but has generally avoided doing so with powerful Republican committee chairmen who control appointments and legislation.

It was not clear what Mr. Trump meant when he said The Times set up Mr. Corker by recording him. Angry that Mr. Corker had suggested he was an agent of “chaos,” Mr. Trump lashed out at the senator on Sunday by saying he “didn’t have the guts” to run for another term. A Times reporter then interviewed Mr. Corker by telephone and recorded the call with the senator’s knowledge and consent. Mr. Corker’s staff also recorded the call, and he said he wanted The Times to do the same.

“I know they’re recording it, and I hope you are, too,” Mr. Corker told the reporter.

During the interview, Mr. Corker said Mr. Trump’s advisers were struggling to keep the president under control. “I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it’s a situation of trying to contain him,” he said. He also said Mr. Trump’s reckless statements could put the country on a path “towards World War III.”

Mr. Trump on Tuesday rejected the suggestion that he was risking a nuclear war. “We were on the wrong path before,” he said, presumably referring to North Korea. “All you have to do is take a look. If you look over the last 25 years through numerous administrations, we were on a path to a very big problem, a problem like this world has never seen. We’re on the right path right now, believe me.”

But what a path. Ms. Ouellette, who has written or edited several books on reality television, including “Better Living Through Reality TV,” said Mr. Trump the president had gone even further than Mr. Trump the reality show star ever did.

“This has exceeded what would have been allowed on ‘The Apprentice,’” she said. “It’s almost a magnification. It’s like reality TV unleashed.

And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common.
He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

PhotoIn an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well.","From grizzled cotton farmers to quiet small-town buildings and roadside stands, Walker Evans built his reputation on chronicling America’s out-of-the-way places and people. And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common. Born Walker Evans III, the scion of a prominent family, he grew up in privilege, attending Phillips Academy and then Williams College, dropping out after one year.

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

Photo

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

10A: It’s midweek, so read those clues carefully. “It’s found by the radius” sounds like it might be a math question, but it’s not; what other kind of “radius” exists? The radius we’re looking for today is a bone in the forearm. It is parallel to the ulna, a fabulous piece of osteocrosswordese (Yes, I made that up).

15A: A clue like “Brought home” evokes the childhood habit some of us might have had for bringing home stray animals and begging our parents to let us keep them. Not me, of course. But some of us. In a midweek puzzle, however, tricks are afoot, and today the clue is referring to how much money you’ve EARNED.

30A: #TIL the word MANUMIT, and it’s very interesting. To manumit is not merely to SET FREE, but to set someone free from slavery. It’s derived from the Latin manus, or hand, and means to “set forth from one’s hand,” or release from control.

2D: I had REFILL before REFUEL.

26D: “Glam rock?” is some nifty misdirection. You were thinking of a bunch of longhaired, bespangled musicians in heavy eyeliner, weren’t you? Not today. Another type of glamorous rock would be a GEM.

Let’s say hello to Evan Manhken:

Constructor Notes

I’m 20 years old, a junior at Brandeis University, majoring in Chemistry and American Studies. I started writing crosswords my freshman year of college. My school newspaper, the Justice, was using some very underwhelming syndicated crosswords, and I said to myself, “I could write better crosswords than that!” I couldn’t. At least, not at first. I still shudder to think of some of my very early crosswords. But, as I got more and more practice, I started to get decent at it. I continue to write a crossword for them each week. But when I write what I think is a really good puzzle, I send it off to The Times instead. This time, it seems Will agreed with me, and I got in. Not without a number of revisions beforehand, though. It’s a real honor to be in The New York Times for the first time, and I hope it won’t be the last! As for this puzzle’s construction, I don’t have all that much to say about it. The idea had been rattling around in my brain for a while before I got around to making it. I ended up brainstorming by thinking of all the spatial words I could muster, seeing which ones had phrases associated with them, and then seeing what I could come up with for words that fit those phrases. BENEATH ME was by far the answer I was most pleased with. I really learned a lot from the revision process, but I know I’ve got a lot left to learn about making crosswords.

Welcome to the party, Mr. Mahnken. I hope we get to see more from you soon, and 100 percent on your debut.

It was the first of many medications that Jake, who asked that his last name not be used, would try over the next year. But none seemed to work — and some made a bad situation worse. An increase in dosage made Jake “much more excited, acting strangely and almost manic,” his father wrote in a journal in the fall of 2015. A few weeks later, Jake locked himself in a bathroom at home and tried to drown himself in the bathtub.

He was hospitalized for four days, but soon after he returned home, he started hiding out in his room again. He cried, slept, argued with his parents about going to school and mindlessly surfed the internet on his phone. The more school he missed, the more anxious he felt about missing school. And the more anxious he felt, the more hopeless and depressed he became. He had long wanted to go to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but now that felt like wishful thinking.

Not every day was bad. During spring break in 2016, Jake’s father wrote: “Jake was relaxed and his old sarcastic, personable, witty self.” A week later, though, Jake couldn’t get through a school day without texting his mother to pick him up or hiding out in the nurse’s office. At home, Jake threatened suicide again. His younger siblings were terrified. “It was the depth of hell,” his mother told me.

That summer, after two more hospitalizations, Jake’s desperate parents sent him to Mountain Valley in New Hampshire, a residential treatment facility and one of a growing number of programs for acutely anxious teenagers. Over the last decade, anxiety has overtaken depression as the most common reason college students seek counseling services. In its annual survey of students, the American College Health Association found a significant increase — to 62 percent in 2016 from 50 percent in 2011 — of undergraduates reporting “overwhelming anxiety” in the previous year. Surveys that look at symptoms related to anxiety are also telling. In 1985, the Higher Education Research Institute at U.C.L.A. began asking incoming college freshmen if they “felt overwhelmed by all I had to do” during the previous year. In 1985, 18 percent said they did. By 2010, that number had increased to 29 percent. Last year, it surged to 41 percent.

Those numbers — combined with a doubling of hospital admissions for suicidal teenagers over the last 10 years, with the highest rates occurring soon after they return to school each fall — come as little surprise to high school administrators across the country, who increasingly report a glut of anxious, overwhelmed students. While it’s difficult to tease apart how much of the apparent spike in anxiety is related to an increase in awareness and diagnosis of the disorder, many of those who work with young people suspect that what they’re seeing can’t easily be explained away. “We’ve always had kids who didn’t want to come in the door or who were worried about things,” says Laurie Farkas, who was until recently director of student services for the Northampton public schools in Massachusetts. “But there’s just been a steady increase of severely anxious students.”

For the teenagers who arrive at Mountain Valley, a nonprofit program that costs $910 a day and offers some need-based assistance, the center is usually a last resort after conventional therapy and medications fail. The young people I met there suffered from a range of anxiety disorders, including social anxiety, separation anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. (Though OCD and PTSD are considered anxiety disorders at Mountain Valley and other treatment centers, they were moved into separate categories in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)

Mountain Valley teenagers spend a lot of time analyzing — and learning to talk back to — their anxious thoughts. During one group session in the summer of 2016 in a sunlit renovated barn with couches, a therapist named Sharon McCallie-Steller instructed everyone to write down three negative beliefs about themselves. That’s an easy exercise for anxious young people (“Only three?” one girl quipped), but McCallie-Steller complicated the assignment by requiring the teenagers to come up with a “strong and powerful response” to each negative thought.

She asked for volunteers. First, residents would share their negative beliefs and rebuttals with the group. Then others would act those out, culminating in a kind of public performance of private teenage insecurity.

Jake raised his hand. By then, he was in his third month at Mountain Valley, and he looked considerably less anxious than several of the newcomers, including one who sat slumped on a couch with his head in his hands. “I’m free to play the part of terrible, evil thoughts for anyone who needs them,” Jake said with a smile. He had already spent weeks challenging his own thinking, which often persuaded him that if he failed a single quiz at school, “then I’ll get a bad grade in the class, I won’t get into the college I want, I won’t get a good job and I’ll be a total failure.”

At Mountain Valley, Jake learned mindfulness techniques, took part in art therapy and equine therapy and, most important, engaged in exposure therapy, a treatment that incrementally exposes people to what they fear. The therapists had quickly figured out that Jake was afraid of failure above all else, so they devised a number of exercises to help him learn to tolerate distress and imperfection. On a group outing to nearby Dartmouth College, for example, Jake’s therapist suggested he strike up conversations with strangers and tell them he didn’t have the grades to get into the school. The college application process was a source of particular anxiety for Jake, and the hope was that he would learn that he could talk about college without shutting down — and that his value as a person didn’t depend on where he went to school.

Though two months in rural New Hampshire hadn’t cured Jake of anxiety, he had made significant progress, and the therapy team was optimistic about his return home for his senior year. Until then, Jake wanted to help other Mountain Valley teenagers face their fears.

Among them was Jillian, a 16-year-old who, when she wasn’t overwhelmed with anxiety, came across as remarkably poised and adultlike, the kind of teenager you find yourself talking to as if she were a graduate student in psychology. Jillian, who also asked that her last name not be used, came to Mountain Valley after two years of only intermittently going to school. She suffered from social anxiety (made worse by cyberbullying from classmates) and emetophobia, a fear of vomit that can be so debilitating that people will sometimes restrict what they eat and refuse to leave the house, lest they encounter someone with a stomach flu.

Jillian listened as Jake and other peers — who, in reality, liked her very much — voiced her insecurities: “I can’t believe how insignificant Jillian is.” “I mean, for the first three weeks, I thought her name was Susan.” “If she left tomorrow, maybe we wouldn’t even miss her.”

At the last one, Jillian’s shoulders caved, and her eyes watered. “I don’t want to do this,” she said, looking meekly at McCallie-Steller.

“If it’s too much, you can stop,” the therapist said, but Jillian considered the offer only long enough to reject it. She straightened her back. “No, I feel like I need to do this,” she announced. “I have a week and a half left. If I can’t get through something like this here ...”

Her voice trailed off, but the implication was clear: The real world would be much more anxiety producing — and much less forgiving.

Anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. But unlike depression, with which it routinely occurs, anxiety is often seen as a less serious problem.

“Anxiety is easy to dismiss or overlook, partially because everyone has it to some degree,” explained Philip Kendall, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple University in Philadelphia. It has an evolutionary purpose, after all; it helps us detect and avoid potentially dangerous situations. Highly anxious people, though, have an overactive fight-or-flight response that perceives threats where there often are none.

But sometimes there are good reasons to feel anxious. For many young people, particularly those raised in abusive families or who live in neighborhoods besieged by poverty or violence, anxiety is a rational reaction to unstable, dangerous circumstances. At the Youth Anxiety Center’s clinic in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, which serves mostly poor and working-class Hispanic youth, teenagers would object to the definition of anxiety I heard often at Mountain Valley: “The overestimation of danger and the underestimation of our ability to cope.”

“The fears can be very real for our kids,” explained Carolina Zerrate, the clinic’s medical director. “Oftentimes their neighborhoods are not safe, their streets are not safe and their families can feel unsafe if there’s a history of trauma and abuse.” The contemporary political climate can also feel “incredibly unsafe for the community of kids we serve,” Zerrate adds, explaining that many have undocumented family members.

And yet addressing anxiety is low on the priority list in many economically disadvantaged communities. Kids who “act out” are often labeled defiant or aggressive, while those who keep to themselves — anxiety specialists call them “silent sufferers” — are overlooked or mistaken for being shy. “If you go to a public school in a struggling urban area, teachers will talk about drugs, crime, teen pregnancy, violence,” Kendall says. “When you start to talk about anxiety, they’re like, ‘Oh, those are the kids we like!’ ”

Teenagers raised in more affluent communities might seemingly have less to feel anxious about. But Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University who has studied distress and resilience in both well-off and disadvantaged teenagers, has found that privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. “These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic,” she says, but there’s “contempt and scorn for the idea that kids who have it all might be hurting.”

For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they “never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop,’ ” Luthar says. “There’s always one more activity, one more A.P. class, one more thing to do in order to get into a top college. Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.”

It’s tempting to blame helicopter parents with their own anxiety issues for that pressure (and therapists who work with teenagers sometimes do), but several anxiety experts pointed to an important shift in the last few years. “Teenagers used to tell me, ‘I just need to get my parents off my back,’ ” recalls Madeline Levine, a founder of Challenge Success, a Stanford University-affiliated nonprofit that works on school reform and student well-being. “Now so many students have internalized the anxiety. The kids at this point are driving themselves crazy.”

Though there are cultural differences in how this kind of anguish manifests, there’s considerable overlap among teenagers from different backgrounds. Many are anxious about school and how friends or teachers perceive them. Some obsess about family conflicts. Teenagers with OCD tend to worry excessively about what foods they should eat, diseases they might contract or whatever happens to be in the news that week. Stephanie Eken, a psychiatrist and the regional medical director for Rogers Behavioral Health, which runs several teenage-anxiety outpatient programs across the country and an inpatient program in Wisconsin, told me that in the last few years she has heard more kids than ever worry about terrorism. “They wonder about whether it’s safe to go to a movie theater,” she said.

When I asked Eken about other common sources of worry among highly anxious kids, she didn’t hesitate: social media. Anxious teenagers from all backgrounds are relentlessly comparing themselves with their peers, she said, and the results are almost uniformly distressing.

Anxious kids certainly existed before Instagram, but many of the parents I spoke to worried that their kids’ digital habits — round-the-clock responding to texts, posting to social media, obsessively following the filtered exploits of peers — were partly to blame for their children’s struggles. To my surprise, anxious teenagers tended to agree. At Mountain Valley, I listened as a college student went on a philosophical rant about his generation’s relationship to social media. “I don’t think we realize how much it’s affecting our moods and personalities,” he said. “Social media is a tool, but it’s become this thing that we can’t live without but that’s making us crazy.”

In his case, he had little doubt that social media made him more self-conscious. “In high school, I’d constantly be judging my self-worth online,” he told me, recalling his tortured relationship with Facebook. “I would think, Oh, people don’t want to see me on their timeline.”

While smartphones can provoke anxiety, they can also serve as a handy avoidance strategy. At the height of his struggles, Jake spent hours at a time on his phone at home or at school. “It was a way for me not to think about classes and college, not to have to talk to people,” he said. Jake’s parents became so alarmed that they spoke to his psychiatrist about it and took his phone away a few hours each night.

At a workshop for parents last fall at the NW Anxiety Institute in Portland, Ore., Kevin Ashworth, the clinical director, warned them of the “illusion of control and certainty” that smartphones offer anxious young people desperate to manage their environments. “Teens will go places if they feel like they know everything that will happen, if they know everyone who will be there, if they can see who’s checked in online,” Ashworth told the parents. “But life doesn’t always come with that kind of certainty, and they’re never practicing the skill of rolling with the punches, of walking into an unknown or awkward social situation and learning that they can survive it.”

Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University who researches adolescent mental health and psychological differences among generations, used to be skeptical of those who sounded an alarm about teenage internet use. “It seemed like too easy an explanation for negative mental-health outcomes in teens, and there wasn’t much evidence for it,” she told me. She searched for other possible explanations, including economic ones. But the timing of the spike in anxious and depressed teenagers since 2011, which she called one of the sharpest and most significant she has seen, is “all wrong,” she said. “The economy was improving by the time the increase started.”

The more she looked for explanations, the more she kept returning to two seemingly unrelated trend lines — depression in teenagers and smartphone adoption. (There is significantly more data about depression than anxiety.) Since 2011, the trend lines increased at essentially the same rate. In her recent book “iGen,” and in an article in The Atlantic, Twenge highlights a number of studies exploring the connection between social media and unhappiness. “The use of social media and smartphones look culpable for the increase in teen mental-health issues,” she told me. “It’s enough for an arrest — and as we get more data, it might be enough for a conviction.”

Last fall, at a high school near the New Hampshire-Vermont border, I watched Lynn Lyons, a psychotherapist and author, deliver bad news to a packed auditorium of teachers and counselors. “We’re not getting the job done,” she said, pacing the stage at Fall Mountain Regional High School, where she had been asked to lead a professional-development training session about anxiety.

More than a decade ago, the school would have been unlikely to invite her to speak. Anxiety was barely on the radar of most educators back then, according to Denise Pope, another founder of Challenge Success, the Stanford-affiliated nonprofit. Pope remembers facing skepticism when she sounded the alarm about growing anxiety among teenagers. “We don’t have to convince them anymore,” she told me. “Schools are coming to us, eager for help.”

A gregarious speaker, Lyons kept her audience entertained by calling anxiety “the cult leader” — for its ability to convince people of falsehoods about themselves — and telling funny stories about overinvolved parents. But her main point was clear: In a seemingly well-meaning effort to help kids avoid what makes them anxious, administrators actually make anxiety worse. “Anxiety is all about the avoidance of uncertainty and discomfort,” Lyons explained. “When we play along, we don’t help kids learn to cope or problem-solve in the face of unexpected events.”

She pointed to the increasing use of “504 plans,” a popular educational tool that allows for academic accommodations for students with physical or mental disabilities. Though 504 plans for anxiety vary by student, a typical one might allow a teenager to take more time on homework and tests, enter the school through a back door — to avoid the chaos of the main entrance — and leave a classroom when feeling anxious.

Lyons believes in the necessity of 504 plans, and she is in agreement with many of the recommendations of Challenge Success, including later school start times, less homework and more project-based learning. But Lyons worries that too many 504 plans are “avoidance-based and teach zero skills.” She gave the example of a plan that allows a student to leave a classroom anytime he feels overwhelmed. Often, a teenager “can go wherever he wants and stay there for as long as he thinks he needs,” she said. Instead, she argued, a school should have a policy in place for the student to seek out a guidance counselor or nurse and do some role-playing that helps the student “externalize his worry,” similar to how Mountain Valley teenagers are taught to observe their thinking and talk back to it. Then the student should return to his regular classroom as soon as possible, Lyons said.

“If anxiety could talk, it would say, ‘You know, let’s just get out of here. We don’t have to do this!’ ” Lyons said from the stage. “But in order to retrain the brain, in order to create that message that says that even though I’m uncomfortable I can do this, we need to stop treating these anxious kids like they’re so frail, like they can’t handle things.”

Lyons sees a connection between how some schools deal with anxious students and what she worries is a generation of young people increasingly insistent on safe spaces — and who believe their feelings should be protected at all costs. “Kids are being given some really dangerous messages these days about the fact that they can’t handle being triggered, that they shouldn’t have to bear witness to anything that makes them uncomfortable and that their external environments should bend to and accommodate their needs,” she told me.

Among many teachers and administrators I spoke to, one word — “resiliency” — kept coming up. More and more students struggle to recover from minor setbacks and aren’t “equipped to problem-solve or advocate for themselves effectively,” a school counselor in suburban Oregon told me. In the last few years, the counselor said, she has watched in astonishment as more students struggle with anxiety — and as more of those “stop coming to school, because they just can’t.”

Some schools have taken drastic measures to accommodate what one administrator called “our more fragile students.” At Roxbury High School in Roxbury Township, N.J., there are two dedicated classrooms for anxious teenagers, including one next to a mural of Edvard Munch’s painting “The Scream.” These students typically avoid the mammoth school cafeteria in favor of eating lunch in one of the classrooms, as they did on the day of my visit last May. They had just finished gym class, an anxiety-producing event for some even as the school did all it could to reimagine the concept. Music blasted throughout the gym as the teenagers halfheartedly played something vaguely approximating a game of volleyball. The ball was allowed to bounce once before being struck — not that anyone was keeping score.

I couldn’t help wondering what Lyons, and other therapists I spoke to who worry that schools inadvertently worsen anxiety, would think of this approach. Some of the programs’ teenagers hoped to go to college, where no special classrooms would await them. How was this preparing them for that?

“Some will say that this feeds the monster,” concedes Patricia Hovey, director of special services at Roxbury High. “But you’ve got to start where the kids are, not where you are or where you want them to be. We’ve got to get them in the building. Many of our students simply don’t come to school if they have to spend all day in” general-education classes. Once the students are in school, Hovey explained, staff members can help them build the confidence and skills to eventually transition to Roxbury’s regular classes — and stand a chance at navigating college or a job once they graduate.

Even with the promise of a special classroom, getting anxious kids to Roxbury High each morning demands a herculean effort from the program’s teachers and therapists. During my visit, I watched them text and call several no-show students in an effort to coax them out of bed. They also regularly communicate with parents, talking them through what to say to a teenager who refuses to leave his room. Paul Critelli, one of the program’s teachers, told me that many parents feel overwhelmed trying to get two or three kids ready for school each morning, and that their instinct is often to “sacrifice the anxious kid” in order to avoid morning hysterics and keep the family train running on time.

Mostly, though, Critelli wants to talk to the anxious students. “What’s the issue today?” I heard him ask during a phone call with a sophomore boy, who had missed his scheduled bus and was presumably speaking to Critelli from underneath his sheets. The call was a “Hail Mary,” as Critelli put it, because while he suspects that the boy sleeps with the phone “right next to his face,” he rarely responds when he’s feeling anxious. “I appreciate you picking up — you don’t normally do that,” Critelli told him, mixing in positive affirmation with a call to action. The school would be sending another bus, and Critelli expected him to be on it.

Critelli looked for any opportunity to push students out of their comfort zones. During an informal study period after lunch, I watched him confiscate cellphones he said the teenagers were using to “hide from, control and avoid” their feelings; scoff at a student who claimed to be too anxious to return a book to the school library; and challenge a particularly reserved boy who said he had nothing to work on.

Critelli looked at him incredulously. “Dude, you’re failing physics,” Critelli said. “What do you mean you don’t have anything to do?”

“There’s nothing I can do — I’m going to fail,” the student mumbled.

“So you’re just accepting that you’re going to fail?” The boy looked at his hands. “Here’s an idea,” Critelli continued. “You can email your teacher and say, ‘What can I do to improve my grade? What extra work can I do?’ ”

Critelli surveyed his classroom of anxious teenagers. “I’d love to see you advocate for yourselves!”

Jake is a remarkably minimalist emailer and texter, eschewing exclamation points and emojis in favor of an almost old-fashioned formality. It can be challenging to gauge his moods that way, so I checked in with him regularly by phone in the months after he left Mountain Valley. He usually sounded content when we spoke, an impression confirmed by his parents, who were relieved by the changes they saw in him. In the fall of his senior year, Jake was regularly attending school — on some days he “even enjoyed it,” he told me with a laugh.

While he was careful not to overschedule himself, anxiety still sometimes overtook him. One weekend, he had to leave a Model United Nations conference after he became anxious and his stomach started cramping. “That was really disheartening, but when I struggle now it doesn’t last long, and I can usually get myself out of it pretty quickly,” he said, by talking back to his negative thoughts.

Jake also confessed to some worry about his application to attend U.N.C. He had decided to be transparent with the school about his anxiety disorder, partly because it helped explain his junior-year absences and grades and partly because the months he had spent challenging his beliefs and ideas at Mountain Valley perfectly fit the application essay prompt: Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea.

In 650 thoughtful and sometimes uncharacteristically dramatic words, Jake explained that in middle school he had “aced the tests and seemed to many as the bright future of the American ideal.” But then came high school and fear of failure, the debilitating worry that he might not be good enough. He explained that going to treatment helped him change his perspective on learning and life. “Just being able to type this very essay would have been impossible months ago due to my fear of judgment,” he wrote. “College is the next step in my journey to find a true sense of self, both academically and personally. The future has reopened its doors.”

The doors had not reopened quite as wide for Jillian, whom I visited on an oppressively humid spring afternoon in Florida. It was a school day, but Jillian wasn’t at school. Instead, she was on the screened-in back patio of the townhouse where she lives with her mother, Allison. A talented artist, Jillian loves theater and special-effects makeup design, and she was hard at work on an outfit for a “Walking Dead” costume contest at a local car dealership.

While she painted her costume to make it appear blood-soaked, we half-watched an episode of the Netflix series “13 Reasons Why” on her laptop. Jillian told me she could relate to many of the series’s themes, including cyberbullying. In middle school, she made a profile page on ASKfm, a social-networking site favored at the time by mean girls and their unsuspecting prey. Jillian was quickly targeted. “I’d get 30 mean questions or messages a day,” she said. “Most of them were like, ‘Just kill yourself.’ ”

Nothing like that happened at the small private high school Jillian attended after leaving Mountain Valley. Though the school is known for its flexibility and willingness to work with nontraditional students, Jillian still struggled to feel comfortable there. She didn’t want to open up and be known as “the anxious girl.” There were other students at school who had severe anxiety and depression — “It’s like the flu broke out here with anxious kids this year,” the headmaster told me — but Jillian didn’t feel comfortable hanging out with them, either. Several had yet to go to treatment, and “I don’t want to go backward,” she told me. But the end result, unsurprisingly, was that most students never got to know Jillian.

Her longtime pattern of missing school began again. She had the tools to challenge her anxious thoughts, but using them every day proved exhausting. “There’s feeling a weight on your chest, and there’s the feeling of 16 people sitting on top of each other on your chest,” she said. “As soon as I’d wake up, it was absolute dread.”

Needing to get to her job 40 minutes away each morning, Allison, who had sold her previous house in order to afford Mountain Valley, had little time to coax Jillian out of bed. They argued constantly. Jillian thought her mother — who was severely depressed during a year when Jillian was younger and especially needed support — could be insensitive. Allison struggled with when (and how hard) to push her daughter. She knew Jillian had a serious disorder, but she also knew it wouldn’t get better by letting her hide out in her room. Allison also couldn’t be sure when Jillian was genuinely paralyzed by anxiety and when she was “manipulating me to get out of doing whatever she didn’t feel like doing,” she said.

“The million-dollar question of raising an anxious child is: When is pushing her going to help because she has to face her fears, and when is it going to make the situation worse and she’s going to have a panic attack?” Allison told me. “I feel like I made the wrong decision many times, and it destroyed my confidence as a mother.”

Allison sometimes wondered how her own anxiety issues might have genetically predisposed her daughter to anxiety. Allison had done enough Google searches to know that anxious teenagers tend to come from anxious parents. Research points to hereditary genes that predispose children to an anxiety disorder, and studies have found that an overbearing or anxious parenting style can induce anxiety and risk-aversion in kids. In the parents’ workshop I attended in Oregon, Ashworth, the therapist, spent a lot of time urging family members to work on their own anxiety issues.

He also cautioned parents not to accommodate their children’s avoidance strategies. Families of children with OCD will routinely open doors for them, cook only the two or three specific foods they’ve agreed to eat and avoid saying certain words or sounds. Families of socially anxious kids will let them stay in the car while they go shopping, order for them at restaurants and communicate with a teacher because they’re afraid to. “So many teens have lost the ability to tolerate distress and uncertainty, and a big reason for that is the way we parent them,” Ashworth said.

While Ashworth can be blunt, he is also disarming and funny, with a self-deprecating sense of humor that appeals to both parents and their cynical children. Like many therapists who work with anxious teenagers, he tries to model a “let’s not take life — and ourselves — too seriously” approach. He also has an almost endless empathy for the challenges that these teenagers and their families face. He knows, for example, that raising a severely anxious child can feel counterintuitive. How, for example, do you set and enforce limits with an anxious teenager? If you send him to his room, “you’ve just made his day,” Ashworth told the parents in his workshop, who nodded knowingly.

Though Jillian had returned from Mountain Valley a more confident person with a nuanced understanding of her issues (and with her emetophobia largely under control), treatment didn’t solve her school struggles. As she fell further behind, her morning battles with her mother became increasingly untenable. In consultation with the school, Allison agreed to let Jillian drop out and study for the G.E.D. But Allison wasn’t happy about it; she considered it a momentary concession. “We basically said, ‘O.K., anxiety, you win.’ ”

Jillian was relieved never to have to set foot in another high school. “I’m just a lot more relaxed now,” she told me in her messy bedroom, where the walls were adorned with “Star Wars” posters and the bookshelf overflowed with young-adult fiction and sci-fi, as well as a worn copy of “Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.” Near her bed were two prescription bottles — one for Prozac and another for Klonopin, a benzodiazepine tranquilizer. Jillian had been prescribed a number of drug combinations over the years, and while none were panaceas, she believed she would be “a lot worse if I wasn’t taking them.”

Though she spoke to a therapist once or twice a week online, Jillian otherwise ignored the structured daily schedule — including yoga, studying and cleaning her room — that she had agreed to with her mother. Jillian told me she often felt lonely at home, and she spent much of her days texting friends from around the country, some of whom she met at “Star Wars” conventions or on social media.

At the same time, Jillian was trying to make new friends. I watched her joke with fellow contestants at the costume contest (where she walked away with a $250 prize), and she was practically a social butterfly at a film event she attended with her mother. Bored with our company after the screening, Jillian spotted two teenagers talking to each other in a corner.

“O.K., I’m going to go mingle,” she announced.

On a busy weekday morning last May, a new crop of Mountain Valley residents were discovering that a key component of their treatment would involve repeatedly making fools of themselves. On the Dartmouth College campus, eight teenagers wore hand-painted white T-shirts that read “Ask Me About My Anxiety” and “I Have OCD.” They were encouraged by the therapy team to come up with scenarios that would make them uncomfortable. One teenager considered approaching random guys on campus and saying, “You must be a Dartmouth football player.” Later that afternoon, a second group of teenagers arrived. One feigned a panic attack at Starbucks. Another ordered nonsensically at a restaurant.

“What do we need to do to make your anxiety higher?” McCallie-Steller, the therapist, asked several teenagers as they prepared for their morning of exposure therapy. First developed in the 1950s, the technique is an essential component of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety, which a vast majority of researchers and clinicians believe is the most effective treatment for a range of anxiety disorders. In a large 2008 study of anxious youth published in The New England Journal of Medicine, more improved using CBT (60 percent) than the antidepressant Zoloft (55 percent), though the most effective therapy (81 percent) was a combination of the two.

But while exposure therapy has been proved highly effective, few teenagers receive it. “We’re much more likely to medicate kids than to give them therapy,” says Stephen Whiteside, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Program at the Mayo Clinic. “And when we do give them therapy, it’s unlikely to be exposure. With a few exceptions, we’re not treating people with what actually works best.”

Part of the reason is that exposure work is hard. Anxious people aren’t typically eager to feel more anxious. “It’s also uncomfortable for many therapists,” Whiteside told me. “Most people go into therapy or psychology to help people, but with exposure therapy you’re actually helping them feel uncomfortable. It’s not much fun for anybody. It’s much easier to sit in a therapist’s office and talk about feelings.”

Researchers are trying to better understand how exposure works in the brain and to fine-tune its application for anxiety treatment. At U.C.L.A., scientists at the school’s Anxiety and Depression Research Center discovered that the more anxious a person feels going into an exposure exercise, and the more surprised he or she is by the result, the more effective it is at competing with an original negative association or traumatic memory. (That’s why McCallie-Steller did her best to ramp up the teenagers’ anxiety before they began their exposure work.) Other researchers are focused on virtual-reality-aided exposure therapy, which allows people to encounter the sources of their anxiety in a therapist’s office.

For two Mountain Valley 14-year-olds on the main quad at Dartmouth, the sources of their distress were numerous. One, a brown-haired boy who embarrassed easily, suffered from a dispiriting combination of social anxiety, OCD, binge-eating and depression. It was a lot to work on in three months, and he was often overwhelmed by the magnitude of the project. On this day, he had agreed to tackle his social anxiety by sitting next to a stranger on a park bench and striking up a conversation.

Earlier, another Mountain Valley teenager took part in a similar exercise, during which the stranger opened up about his own struggles with anxiety. The teenagers were sometimes surprised that others could relate to their issues. As one girl handed out fliers about anxiety on campus, she sometimes asked people, “Can I tell you about anxiety?” More than a few students — including one who looked as if he might actually be a Dartmouth football player — responded with some version of “Trust me, I know all about it.”

The brown-haired boy was highly anxious about his exposure. He bombarded the therapist, Bryan Randolph, with questions in a seeming attempt to run out the clock until they had to return to Mountain Valley. “Can I just sit on the bench for a minute?” he asked Randolph. “And can I sit down and then start talking? I mean, do I need to ask, ‘Do you mind if I sit there?’ It’s weird to just sit there, have a conversation, then get up and come running back to a group of people.”

“Even better — let’s make it weird,” Randolph told him.

The boy shook his head. “Maybe the guy’s on break and doesn’t want to be bothered.”

“Maybe,” Randolph said. “He might hate you. He might get real mad at you.”

“That’s terrifying,” the teenager confessed. “And what if we’re so close on the bench that we’re touching?”

“That would be awkward,” Randolph said with a half-smile.

The boy craned his neck to get a better look at the man. “Is he sitting in the middle of the bench?”

“I don’t know — he might be,” Randolph told him. “But are you going to ‘what if’ this to death, or are you going to do it?”

He eventually shuffled off toward the stranger, allowing Randolph to turn his attention to the other 14-year-old, Thomas, who stood sheepishly on a nearby corner holding his sign: “I’ve Been Bullied. Ask Me.” The “Ask Me” was hard to make out, because Thomas had also included many of the insults peers have hurled at him over the years, including “B*tch,” “F*ggot,” “Ur Fat” and “Kill Yourself.” Holding the sign on a busy corner had been Thomas’s idea; he thought it might ratchet up his anxiety and force him to interact with strangers, while having the potential added benefit of educating people about bullying.

Randolph and I watched dozens of students walk by, some giving Thomas’s sign a glance but most never slowing their stride. He had been bullied for years, and now he was being ignored. I felt anxious just looking at him.

Eventually, an attractive couple in their mid-20s stopped to read the sign. They smiled, Thomas beamed and after a minute or two of conversation they all hugged. “Oh, my God, that was the greatest,” Thomas announced upon his return.

I asked him what they’d talked about. “The muscular dude said he’s been bullied, too, in middle school, and that bullies get nowhere in life,” Thomas told us. “Then the girl said, ‘You’re really brave. Can I give you a hug?’ ”

“That’s not what you were expecting, huh?” Randolph said. “Instead of being mean to you, people actually treated you with compassion.”

“Yeah, it was awesome,” he said. “I feel so good!”

The brown-haired boy, meanwhile, returned from his brief visit to the bench: “It was sooooo awkward,” he reported. “The guy just kept texting. He was probably like, Why is this kid asking me questions?”

“And what if he was?” Randolph asked him. “You’re not responsible for what he’s thinking.”

The boy appeared to consider Randolph’s point as they made their way back to the van that would return them to Mountain Valley. Sometimes, Randolph told the boys, “exactly what you think will happen happens. Other times, the exact opposite of what you think will happen happens. Either way, it’s all manageable.”

The subject line of Jake’s email to me last winter read simply, “College Results.” I opened it: “Hey Benoit, I just wanted to tell you that I was accepted to U.N.C. Chapel Hill. Jake.” I emailed back to say that he could stand to sound a little bit more excited, to which he replied, “Trust me, I’m pretty excited!”

Last month, I visited him during his fourth week of college classes. It was a Sunday, and Jake met me outside his dorm wearing khaki shorts and a Carolina Panthers jersey. He looked happier than I’d ever seen him. “Let’s walk,” he said, leading me on a tour of campus and nearby Chapel Hill, where he went record shopping (he left with a Parquet Courts album) and played touch football with a few of his friends.

Since leaving Mountain Valley, Jake had prioritized his social life. “The health of my relationships with people is just as important as academics,” he told me on a bench overlooking the main quad. He had said something similar at Mountain Valley, but back then it sounded theoretical, aspirational. It felt true now. He had made new friends on campus and was keeping up with old ones from home — and some of his peers from Mountain Valley — via text and Snapchat, the only social-media platform he regularly uses these days. “My junior year, when things got really bad, I told myself that I didn’t need to hang out with my friends a lot, that all that really mattered was how well I did at school,” he said. “I don’t think like that anymore.”

That’s not to say that Jake doesn’t study. He does — usually days before he needs to. “Procrastination isn’t a good idea for me,” he said. But he was actually enjoying several of his college classes, especially Intro to Ethics, for which he was reading Plato’s “Republic.”

Jake had experienced only one intense bout of anxiety at U.N.C. For his info sciences course, he turned in an assignment online but realized days later that there had been a technical glitch and it hadn’t gone through. He said he felt “a sudden burst of anxiety” — his chest tightened, and adrenaline coursed through his body. What had he done? He sent a panicked email to his professor and told a friend who also has anxiety issues that he was “freaking out.” Then he took a nap, which had long been one of his coping strategies. When he awoke, the professor had emailed saying it wasn’t a big deal. “That ended that crisis,” Jake told me.

For the most part, Jake felt he was managing his anxiety. Over the summer, he met twice with Jonathan Abramowitz, a psychology professor who leads the university’s anxiety and stress lab, but Jake had put off finding a regular therapist for the school year. His parents kept bugging him about it. “I just haven’t felt like I need it here,” Jake told me. But then, a few beats later, he added: “I know I need to stop making excuses and just do it.”

I was curious how much of Jake’s newfound contentment had to do with being at U.N.C., with getting into his dream school. After all, a major component of his treatment at Mountain Valley was learning to accept that his value didn’t depend solely on academic achievement. How would he have reacted if his application was one of the 74 percent that U.N.C. rejected last year?

It was clear that Jake had thought about the question. “I would have been disappointed, but I really think I would have been O.K.,” he told me. “There are other schools in the world where I would have been happy. I definitely wouldn’t have believed that a couple years ago, but a lot’s changed.”

She noted that sponsors “have to spend some capital and take a risk on the up-and-coming person, and you simply don’t do that unless you know them and trust them.” But these relationships are crucial, she said, for “getting from the middle to the top.”

Certain workplaces have become more tense in recent months, after high-profile sexual harassment cases at Fox News, in venture capital and elsewhere, and after the vulgar comments about women by Donald J. Trump that emerged during the presidential campaign. Most recently, accusations against the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein caused him to be fired.

The Society for Human Resource Management, an industry group, said it saw a spike in questions from members about sexual harassment in March — when cases at Uber, Fox News and military academies were in the news — and in August, when harassment surfaced again at Fox, in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.

In some cases, the heightened awareness has improved people’s behavior. “People are more sensitive to how they conduct themselves, because they’ve seen what can happen,” said a male executive in the news and entertainment industry, who spoke anonymously because of the same heightened caution over the topic that is in the air in some workplaces. “That’s presented a better working environment.”

But elsewhere, men have begun avoiding solo interactions with women altogether. In Austin, Tex., a city official was formally reprimanded last month for refusing to meet with female employees, after he ended regular mentoring lunches with one.

Some tech investors have taken similar steps. “A big chill came across Silicon Valley in the wake of all these stories, and people are hyperaware and scared of behaving wrongly, so I think they’re drawing all kinds of parameters,” said a venture capitalist who spoke anonymously for the same reason.

Some are avoiding solo meetings with female entrepreneurs, potential recruits and those who ask for an informational or networking meeting.

“Before, you might have said, ‘Of course I would do that, and I will especially do it for minorities, including women in Silicon Valley,’ ” the investor said. “Now you cancel it because you have huge reputational risk all of a sudden.”

Sometimes women avoid solo meetings with men who have made them uncomfortable or have bad reputations, as when female executives brought colleagues to meetings with Mr. Weinstein.

It has not happened in every workplace, of course, and depends in part on company culture and employees’ trust in human resources to appropriately deal with harassment. In interviews with people across industries, many said interacting with members of the opposite sex was a nonissue. People were warier in jobs that emphasized appearance, as with certain restaurants or TV networks; in male-dominated industries like finance; and in jobs that involve stark power imbalances, like doctors or investors.

Dr. Mukund Komanduri, 50, an orthopedic surgeon with a practice outside Chicago, said he avoids being alone with female colleagues, particularly those he does not know well or who are subordinates.

“I’m very cautious about it because my livelihood is on the line,” he said. “If someone in your hospital says you had inappropriate contact with this woman, you get suspended for an investigation, and your life is over. Does that ever leave you?”

He mentioned a hospital colleague who lost his job because of harassment allegations. “That individual has created a hypersensitive atmosphere for every other physician,” he said. “We basically stand 10 feet away from everyone we know.”

Even before the recent attention on harassment, the practice of avoiding solo meetings with colleagues of the opposite sex was not uncommon. It could mean not sharing in cabs, travel, lunches, projects or get-togethers over coffee, and not meeting behind closed doors.

Nearly two-thirds of men and women say people should take extra caution around members of the opposite sex at work, and about a quarter think private work meetings with colleagues of the opposite sex are inappropriate, according to a poll conducted in May by Morning Consult for The New York Times.

The effect on women’s careers is quantifiable, research has found.

Women with sponsors are more likely to get challenging assignments and raises and to say they are satisfied with their career progress, according to data from the Center for Talent Innovation. Yet 64 percent of senior men and 50 percent of junior women avoid solo interactions because of the risk of rumors about their motives, according to a survey by the center.

Good sponsors also give candid, difficult feedback, and women are less likely than men to receive it, McKinsey and Lean In found.

Megan Ketchum, 37, recently got a promotion to sales leader at LinkedIn. It’s a job that required new skills, and she said she got it largely based on the trust and friendship she’d built with leaders on her team, who were all men.

One of them regularly invited her to go for walks and grab coffee. “Trust does get built through intimacy and understanding others and sharing values,” she said. “That comes from interactions that are one-on-one, and not super formal in a conference room with an agenda.”

The dynamic affects racial and other minorities in the workplace, too. “Sponsorship is so often a mini-me — straight white guys sponsoring younger straight white guys,” Ms. Hewlett said. By getting to know people who are different from them, leaders can avoid playing favorites — which can happen if sponsorship isn’t done well and which can hurt office morale.

One way to encourage these relationships is to have more people at the top of companies who are not straight white men. In interviews, women in companies with many female or gay executives were more likely to say one-on-one relationships had never been an issue for them.

Another way is for companies to explicitly support relationship-building meetings. Some companies, for instance, have designated a certain restaurant where senior leaders take protégées for breakfast or lunch. “Once you see it happening out in public, then it becomes the norm,” said Laura Sherbin, director of research at the Center for Talent Innovation.

She added, “If you don’t want people to judge you when you go out with a senior leader, don’t be someone who judges another person.”

It helps when leaders talk about their families, introduce junior employees to their spouses or invite them to their homes, researchers said.

And would-be sponsors and would-be sponsorees can build relationships in daily moments in the office, said Lareina Yee, a senior partner at McKinsey who studied the issue with Lean In.

“It’s walking down the hallway, it’s seeking the opinion of others, it’s catching someone after a meeting,” she said. “It may be an unintentional blind spot, but it’s something you could start changing on a Monday morning.”",Unintended Consequences of Sexual Harassment Scandals,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/upshot/as-sexual-harassment-scandals-spook-men-it-can-backfire-for-women.html

Look who’s back! Fans saw more of Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker in the 154-second trailer unveiled Monday night for “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” than they did in the entire 135-minute running time of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” in 2015. That film featured only a brief glimpse of the Jedi knight in its final scene, but he appears to be back in force for the next installment.

The story picks up where the last film left off, with resistance fighter Rey (Daisy Ridley) seeking the tutelage of Luke on the planet Ahch-To, where he has exiled himself.

Carrie Fisher, who died in December after having finished her work on the film, can be seen but not heard as General Leia Organa. Several other cast members from “The Force Awakens,” including Adam Driver, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are also prominent in the new teaser.

“He has turned homelessness into a business,” Ms. Malliotakis said, referring to the fact that some homeless people are housed in hotels.
Early on, Ms. Malliotakis tried to turn the signature slogan of Mr. de Blasio’s first mayoral run — that New York is “a tale of two cities” — against the incumbent.
Mr. de Blasio kept repeating that New York is the “safest big city” in America.
When he was asked about concerns over how he has managed his own finances, Mr. Dietl challenged one of the media question-askers, “What’d you make last year?","Ms. Malliotakis called the budget growth “the epitome of mismanagement.” But when pressed what she would cut, she offered few specifics, only a vague, “You have to streamline these agencies.” The mayor defended the spending increases as “fiscally sound” because the city still has the “biggest reserves in history.”

On homelessness, Mr. de Blasio was more on the defensive. “This man has done nothing for the homeless,” Mr. Dietl said. “He has turned homelessness into a business,” Ms. Malliotakis said, referring to the fact that some homeless people are housed in hotels.

Mr. de Blasio acknowledged the “homelessness crisis,” but claimed he has undertaken “the biggest affordable housing initiative in our history.” He said the use of hotels was “not fair to the homeless or the taxpayers” but a necessary stopgap.

Early on, Ms. Malliotakis tried to turn the signature slogan of Mr. de Blasio’s first mayoral run — that New York is “a tale of two cities” — against the incumbent. She said the real tale is that “his friends and donors have gotten richer while the rest of us continue to struggle.”

But she seemed to lose that thread as the debate wore on.

Despite some heated back and forth, no one ever knocked the mayor off his talking points. And for all their attacks, Ms. Malliotakis and Mr. Dietl could not sidestep the reality that with each strong answer of their own, they were dividing the anti-de Blasio vote with each other.

2. The debate was ugly — on stage and off

In his introduction, Mr. Louis promised the audience that the evening would be “an uninterrupted conversation about issues.” That did not last long. “First of all, I’ve got to say, go Yankees!” Mr. Dietl screamed in his opening statement, pointing at the mayor and adding, “Mayor de Blasio’s a Boston Red Sox fan!”

That set the tone.

When Mr. de Blasio began his opening statement, the crowd booed so loud that the mayor was forced to stop, as his supporters shouted back, “Four more years.”

The crowd cheered, hooted and hollered as if attending a sporting event. Mr. Louis paused halfway through and threatened that security officials would escort misbehaving audience members to the “sidewalk.” Moments later, at least one person was ejected. “Goodbye, goodbye,” Mr. Louis waved.

The candidates took their cues from the chaos, as they diverted from substantive discussions to talking over one another, often egged on by the loudmouthed Mr. Dietl.

3. The mayor would rather be running against President Trump

Mr. de Blasio immediately dismissed his two opponents and tried to lump them together as “right-wing Republicans who voted for Donald Trump.” It was a charge he repeated, especially with Ms. Malliotakis, whom he asked about supporting the president in his one question to an opponent. She came prepared with a retort, if not an answer.

“Mr. Mayor, this election is not about Donald Trump. This election is about you,” she responded, accusing him of trying to “deflect from your lousy record.”

Mr. Dietl acknowledged, “I did vote for him,” but said that he has since soured on the president, calling Mr. Trump a “lying narcissist.”

When the topic came up again, this time from one of the media questioners, Ms. Malliotakis appeared exasperated. “I feel like you’re carrying the mayor’s water right now,” she said, as Mr. Dietl walked across stage and offered his bottle of water to the mayor in jest.

For Mr. de Blasio, any minute spent discussing Mr. Trump marked a strategic victory in a heavily Democratic city that strongly disapproves of the president. And there were multiple minutes devoted to Mr. Trump.

4. The mayor wrapped himself up with the police

Tempers flared and tensions increased during the discussion on crime. Mr. de Blasio kept repeating that New York is the “safest big city” in America. Both his opponents objected. “That is not true if you’re a woman in this city,” Ms. Malliotakis said, citing a “25 percent increase in felony sex crimes.” Mr. de Blasio slashed back that she was engaged in a “classic right-wing Republican scare tactic.”

Then, in a fascinating maneuver for a mayor who has at times had a fraught relationship with rank-and-file police, Mr. de Blasio said that anyone who disagreed with the statistics that crime is down was “denigrating the hard work of” the New York Police Department.

Early in his tenure, police officers had turned their backs on the mayor at the funeral of an officer killed in the line of duty, angry at his rhetoric and his emphasis on the problems with stop-and-frisk. But at this debate, the mayor used the police force he controls as a bit of a political shield.

“I’d like a little more respect of the hard work of our officers,” Mr. de Blasio scolded his rivals.

Ms. Malliotakis later interrupted to question whether the mayor thought the women who were suffering sex crimes were “not real human beings?”

“You know better than that,” Mr. de Blasio replied.

And when she brought up his trip to Germany not long after a police officer was killed last summer, the mayor emphasized his law enforcement credentials, saying he had spent time with the family of the fallen officer.

5. Bo Dietl was loud, but maybe not heard

From his opening Yankees line to his disagreement with the mayor about the state of the city (“Do you think the people of New York are idiots?”), Mr. Dietl certainly won the pithy sweepstakes. He bounced from topic to topic, accusing the mayor of building a wall around the mayoral mansion, waking up late, and running a “criminal enterprise” — all in the course of trying to ask him a single question.

His interruptions won him valuable screen time, but it was not clear if his constant, almost Trumpian bombast would break through. When he was asked about concerns over how he has managed his own finances, Mr. Dietl challenged one of the media question-askers, “What’d you make last year? I made $1.8 million.”

Mr. Dietl had his microphone cut off eventually, and Mr. Louis accused him of “foolishness.” Mr. Dietl was undeterred, shouting into the auditorium at one point without the aid of his microphone as his opponents waited for their turn.",Five Takeaways From the New York City Mayoral Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/nyregion/mayoral-debate.html

I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled.","Trees can live without us, but we cannot live without trees.

With a history dating back to the dinosaurs, trees are the planet’s documentarians, watching us cycle through life while providing oxygen, shade and shelter. Trees, the oldest of which, according to Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees,” has 9,500 years, are a critical part of the human experience. We rely on them, from their deep roots to fluttering leaves.

But — at least when we’re not cutting them down — how do we influence trees? Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October. Traveling to more than 70 locations, they found trees that represent “landscapes of complexity where nature and humanity converge.” In other words, trees with stories, like the young sycamore that witnessed the Civil War, or the elm that survived the Oklahoma City bombing. These photos show how events have shaped trees, their energy, and sometimes, literally, the shape of their limbs.

“Forty-million trees are being lost every day,” said Mr. Jenshel. “We love the environment and wanted to do something that would make people think differently about trees.”

Though Mr. Jenshel and Ms. Cook — who are married, collaborate on all their projects and frequently finish each other’s sentences — have a long history of photographing trees, a much more personal seed for their project was planted in the spring of 2012. They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying. Struggling to process the information, she found herself watching the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms slowly drift to the ground, one by one.

“We did what the Japanese have been doing for centuries,” said Ms. Cook. “To take in that beauty, appreciate its ephemeral nature, and know that life does go on.”

Her father died soon after, but a new project was born, influenced by the cherry blossoms and a National Geographic magazine commission. “Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook. “And the importance trees have had throughout history in so many cultures.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, search and rescue workers were looking for human remains among the rubble, when they found part of a Callery pear tree, which traditionally is the first tree to bloom in spring and the last to change leaves in autumn. Though its trunk was scorched and many branches missing, the tree had survived the attacks. Now a symbol of strength and survival, the pear tree was nursed back to health at a Bronx nursery and, nearly a decade later, replanted at the World Trade Center memorial.

Other trees have been a part of unspeakable cruelties. From 1846 to 1870, in Goliad, Tex., an oak known as “The Hanging Tree,” provided shade for court sessions and branches for lynching.

“It’s not always a happy story,” said Ms. Cook.

One of the rain or monkeypod trees in Cambodia (imported from South or Central America), was isolated from the others as “The Killing Tree.” In 1975 when Pol Pot’s murderous rule started, the tree was used to bash children’s heads while their mothers were forced to watch.

“It took us days to recover from that experience of photographing that tree,” said Ms. Cook. “That left the deepest scar on us.”

Other trees seem to travel, and quite far. It is not clear how the adansonia gregorii (or boab) tree got to Western Australia. Perhaps it was the result of seeds dropped from the fruits by early migrants. It was a good thing, though, for the local aboriginals who used the tree as a spiritual home and lifeline, since it can hold up to 26 gallons of water.

In India, from the ancient tree deities to current bodhis of enlightenment, most trees are seen as sacred. In a Varanasi sweet shop, they found a neem tree, said to cure all ailments. Long after they shot the photo, Ms. Cook noticed her spouse’s anxiety.

“Len kept saying, ‘I don’t think we got the picture. I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled. “I totally knew it was about the sweets.”

When I was living in Bangkok, a Thai friend told me she had worked in the kitchen of a Thai restaurant in Austria. I asked her whether it was difficult to cook for farangs, the term Thais use to describe Europeans and Americans.

“It’s easy,” she said. “You pretend you are cooking for children.”

Thai food is not the only cuisine to have been transformed in the journey across oceans. But I’ve made it my mission to track down good Thai cooking in the Bay Area, where I am now the Times bureau chief. I quiz every Thai person I meet, trade tips with diplomats and scour the streets for high-end and hole-in-the-wall restaurants that hold promise.

What I’ve found has been encouraging. A number of restaurants here serve dishes that respect the complexity of Thai food and its balance of sweet, sour, salt and spice. They’re part of a sea change that in recent years has produced ambitious and acclaimed Thai restaurants around the country, particularly in West Coast cities like Los Angeles and Portland, Ore.

“It’s a golden age for Thai food,” said James Syhabout, a Thailand-born chef and cookbook author who owns Hawker Fare, a San Francisco restaurant that specializes in dishes from that country’s Isaan region. “Restaurants serving good Thai food, as they do now, didn’t exist two decades ago because there wasn’t the community to support it, besides our own community.”

“Now diversity is more celebrated. And we are more brave, more proud of showcasing our ethnicity,” said Mr. Syhabout, who also owns Commis, an Oakland restaurant that has two Michelin stars.

When his parents opened their first Thai restaurant in the late 1980s, they made their dishes milder and sweeter to attract diners unfamiliar with the cuisine. “The last thing any chef wants is to get the food sent back.” he said. “You want to play on the safer side.”

Photo

In California, the change has come in part because the Thai population has reached a critical mass: The Thai Consulate in Los Angeles estimates that there are more than 200,000 Thais in the state, enough to have restaurants that cater only to them.

San Francisco’s Tenderloin district, the epicenter of the down-and-out in a city that has become largely unaffordable to all but the very wealthy, is also home to some of the city’s best Thai food.

There I met Narupon Silargorn, who came to this city as an art student and in 2008 opened Lers Ros Thai, where most of the early customers were Asian.

“I didn’t care whether farangs liked it,” he said. He also didn’t care that many customers couldn’t properly pronounce the name (layre rote tie), which means “excellent taste.” Now he has three branches, and two-thirds of his customers are not Thai. The image of farangs with unsophisticated palates is out of date, Mr. Narupon said.

For years, Thai chefs in America pointed out that fresh ingredients were not available; they were forced to buy Thai vegetables frozen or out of a can. That has changed with the intertwining of immigrant groups in California.

Thai chefs today describe an informal partnership with ethnic Hmong refugees from Laos who came to America after the Vietnam War. Many settled as farmers in California’s Central Valley.

It’s a classic American and Californian story: The Hmong farmers grow herbs and plants essential to Southeast Asian cooking, and the Thai chefs rejoice over access to freshly plucked Kaffir lime leaves; calamansi, a small citrus fruit akin to a kumquat; unripened papayas ready to be shredded into som tam, and the chickpea-size Thai eggplant found in dishes like green curry.

The Hmong grow cilantro, for decades a staple of California cuisine; they know not to slice off the roots, which are used in Thai soups, chili pastes and meat marinades.

Michael Yang, a Hmong immigrant who works for a University of California agricultural program in Fresno, has helped organize small-scale Hmong farmers to sell Asian vegetables and herbs to restaurants, grocery stores and farmers’ markets in the Bay Area. “We took a full busload of farmers to meet with restaurant owners,” Mr. Yang said, describing a trip three years ago. “We wanted them to make connections.”

When he began working with the farmers 24 years ago, they were growing about 50 varieties of Asian vegetables and herbs. Now they grow more than 200. “The list just goes on,” Mr. Yang said. “I’m still discovering new crops that are coming in.”

One avid customer for Hmong produce is Pim Techamuanvivit, the Bangkok-born owner of Kin Khao (Let’s Eat), a Thai restaurant wedged between the Tenderloin and Union Square.

Kin Khao breaks the mold of Thai restaurants in a number of ways. The staff is a mix of Thai and non-Thai. There are no wooden elephants and pictures of Thai landmarks; in an otherwise sparse wood-and-white dining room, Ms. Pim has chosen a Thai accent mark, mai toh, as the restaurant’s icon.

My favorite dish there so far is a yam som-o, which is normally made from pomelo, a citrus fruit the size of a cantaloupe that grows in the tropics. This version is a medley of citrus fruits — pomelo, grapefruit, blood orange — mixed with small fried shrimp, cilantro, peanuts, shallots, mint and toasted coconut.

Sometimes an item on the menu is followed by this: “Warning: This is not Thai food for beginners.”

Ms. Pim described one such dish, namprik long rua, an intensely spicy sauce. “It’s got shrimp paste, it’s got a lot of garlic, it’s served with raw vegetables, some of them quite bitter,” she said. “It’s supposed to hurt you, probably for a couple of days.” (Another convention that Kin Khao breaks is price. A solo dinner a few months ago cost me more than $100. My crab meat and betel leaf curry was delicious, but set me back $55.)

A 10-minute walk away is Zen Yai, where the check for two people came to $35. Zen Yai is a meeting spot for the Thai community, and most of the conversations I heard at nearby tables were in Thai.

Still, there is a lot of mediocre Thai food in the Bay Area, and beyond. Leela Punyaratabandhu, a Thai-American cookbook author who shuttles between Chicago and Bangkok, says she has been to restaurants where it was clear that the chefs and waiters would not eat what they serve. This is especially true of pad thai, a dish that has become the defining Thai dish in America. It’s probably eaten more widely here than in Thailand.

The worst pad thai Ms. Leela had in America was in a restaurant in Detroit. The Thai waitress warned her not to eat it, but Ms. Leela says she wanted to experiment. “It was really, really bad,” she recalled. “The server was looking at me with a puppy face that said, ‘Sorry’ and ‘I told you so.’”

How to find flavorful dishes in Thai restaurants that tailor their food for American tastes? I usually speak Thai in the hope that servers will take me seriously. Ms. Leela asks the staff what they would serve if their parents came to the restaurant.

Sometimes, authenticity can be painful. When I beseeched a waitress at Daughter Thai Kitchen, in the Montclair neighborhood of Oakland, not to hold back on the spice, she asked me to estimate my heat tolerance on a scale from one to 10.

I told her nine. And I nearly cried my way through a three-alarm southern curry.

Intel said its intent “was to convey the performance capabilities of our processors through the visual metaphor of a sprinter,” but acknowledged, “Unfortunately, our execution did not deliver our intended message and in fact proved to be insensitive and insulting.”

Dove, May 2011

In 2011, Dove was criticized for another ad: this one showing three women standing side by side, each with lighter skin than the woman next to her. Behind them were signs reading “before” and “after”; the “before” sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the “after” sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.

“Visibly more beautiful skin,” the ad read.

Edelman, the public relations company representing Dove, said in a statement to Gawker: “All three women are intended to demonstrate the ‘after’ product benefit. We do not condone any activity or imagery that intentionally insults any audience.”

The fact that the most recent ad was Dove’s second to cause offense was not lost on social media users.

Popchips, May 2012

Popchips drew fire in 2012 for an ad in which Ashton Kutcher played several characters — including a Bollywood producer named Raj, complete with brownface and an Indian accent.

Popchips initially urged viewers to watch the ad in the humorous “spirit it was intended.” Later, its chief executive, Keith Belling, said in a statement: “Our team worked hard to create a lighthearted parody featuring a variety of characters that was meant to provide a few laughs. We did not intend to offend anyone. I take full responsibility and apologize to anyone we offended.”

Qiaobi, May 2016

In a 2016 commercial for the Chinese company Qiaobi’s laundry detergent, an Asian woman shoves a detergent pod into a black man’s mouth and puts him in a washing machine, from which he emerges as a light-skinned Asian.

A spokeswoman for Qiaobi, Xu Chunyan, was unapologetic. “We did this for some sensational effect,” she said at the time. “If we just show laundry like all the other advertisements, ours will not stand out.”

Nivea, April 2017

In April, the skin care company Nivea released a deodorant ad that read, “White is purity.” White supremacists on the internet took note, with one 4chan user writing, “Nivea has chosen our side.”

A representative of Nivea’s parent company, Beiersdorf, said it had “never intended to hurt anybody or to raise any wrong interpretation.”

But, like Dove, Nivea had offended before.

Six years earlier, after apologizing for an ad that showed a black man preparing to throw away his old Afro-wearing head behind the words “Re-civilize yourself,” it promised to review “current development and approval processes” in order to “avoid any kind of future misleading interpretations.”",Dove Drops an Ad Accused of Racism,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/dove-ad-racist.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — I’m not sure whether it stems from a solving, constructing, or editing mind-set, but I’m always fascinated by the variety of “circled letter” themes in puzzles. Circles can highlight letters within a single entry that spell a word, whether they’re adjacent or spread out. At times, they can be arranged to form images the solver must identify. There have even been puzzles where the circles were used to bring attention to noncircled letters.

Thus, with nearly infinite theme possibilities of this type, it’s no surprise that Jacob Stulberg has come up with an interesting “circled letters” puzzle based on a fresh revealer. Let’s take a look:

Today’s Theme

Mr. Stulberg has made the revealer, THREE-RING CIRCUS, almost come to life: the grid contains three common circus performers arranged in a “ring” as indicated by the clusters of circled letters. When read clockwise, they spell out GLASS EATER, FIRE DANCER, and WIRE WALKER.

This is a very impressive feat. Not only did Mr. Stulberg have to find three circus performers large enough to form into rings, but each one had to be hidden within normal entries so that the surrounding fill could still be smooth.

Normally, when constructing a crossword, each letter has two constraints: it must work with both Across and Down entries. However, for a puzzle like this, the requirement of spelling out a circular phrase serves as a third constraint that makes filling the grid exponentially more difficult. Sure, we have tougher bits of fill like KER, LATH and ASSAI in the bottom-right corner alone ... but these are small prices to pay for such an intricate theme.

Ms. Guadagno countered by channeling lines that were familiar on the presidential campaign trail: describing crimes committed by undocumented immigrants.
Mr. Murphy denied, when asked by a moderator, ever accepting money from Mr. Weinstein, a deep-pocketed Democratic donor.
“I literally have no idea what she’s talking about,” Mr. Murphy snapped when she finished.
When boos from the crowd began to interrupt Ms. Guadagno, she stopped midsentence, saying she would wait them out.","“The inconvenient truth for Phil is that Chris Christie is not on the ballot in November,” she said. “I am.”

Ms. Guadagno, under mounting pressure to chip into Mr. Murphy’s double-digit lead in recent polls and seizing the chance to make her case before a television audience, kept returning to an issue that she has made central to her campaign: property taxes.

“The first thing we can do to help the middle class is to have a thriving middle class,” she said. “And the way we help the middle class is lowering property taxes.”

She brought up property taxes while discussing a variety of issues, including school funding, immigration, job growth and the importance of keeping college graduates from leaving the state.

And she used the issue to attack Mr. Murphy on two fronts: his promise to provide the state’s full share of school funding, estimated by Mr. Murphy to be about $9 billion, and his tepid response to whether he would continue to seek an arbitration cap that limits raises for public workers, such as police officers and firefighters.

“I want to directly answer the question that you put to Phil Murphy, one I have yet to hear him answer,” she said. “I would extend the arbitration cap because it saves the taxpayers of New Jersey billions of dollars.”

Mr. Murphy sidestepped the initial question on the topic, saying that he was waiting for “all the facts.”

When Mr. Murphy pledged to fully fund the state’s pension obligation, a moderator pressed him on how he would do that.

“We have a very credible plan,” Mr. Murphy responded.

The moderator was unimpressed. “I still haven’t heard how.”

While vague on numbers in certain areas, Mr. Murphy offered plenty of data in others, including the grim condition of the state’s economy and the precise number of days that Mr. Christie and Ms. Guadagno had been in office — 2,821, according to Mr. Murphy.

Mr. Murphy not only took advantage of Ms. Guadagno’s ties to her boss, but also sought to link her to the one elected official who is disliked by a large majority of the state: President Trump

He repeatedly made reference to the “Guadagno-Christie” administration and called Ms. Guadagno, “Trump before Trump was Trump.”

Mr. Murphy promoted himself as a check on Mr. Trump’s policies, declaring that New Jersey would protect undocumented immigrants.

“If need be, we will be not just a sanctuary city, but a sanctuary state,” he said.

Ms. Guadagno countered by channeling lines that were familiar on the presidential campaign trail: describing crimes committed by undocumented immigrants.

Photo

Mr. Murphy quickly retorted.

“What you’re doing is what Donald Trump does,’’ he said. “You pit us against them. You cast a pall over entire communities of people. It is un-American.”

Recent events also triggered acrimonious exchanges.

Citing the massacre at a country music festival in Las Vegas, Mr. Murphy said that he would sign gun control legislation that Mr. Christie has vetoed and called for stricter background checks. Ms. Guadagno said she would not “take guns out of the hands of honest law-abiding citizens.”

The debate roiling Hollywood – the avalanche of reports accusing the producer Harvey Weinstein of rape and sexual harassment – also came up in the debate.

Mr. Murphy denied, when asked by a moderator, ever accepting money from Mr. Weinstein, a deep-pocketed Democratic donor.

“I didn’t ask for and I didn’t get one dime from this guy,” said Mr. Murphy, calling him “heinous” and adding that “anyone who did should give it back.”

Ms. Guadagno wasn’t satisfied by his answer. “I want to call Phil Murphy a coward,’’ she said. “Phil Murphy didn’t start to talk about Harvey Weinstein until after my campaign today listed the tens of thousands of dollars that he raised” as a part of his position as a finance chair for the Democratic National Committee. “Shame on him for not coming forward earlier,” she added.

“I literally have no idea what she’s talking about,” Mr. Murphy snapped when she finished.

Amid the insults, there were moments of levity. When boos from the crowd began to interrupt Ms. Guadagno, she stopped midsentence, saying she would wait them out.

Mr. Murphy joked, “Those were your folks.”

Ms. Guadagno laughed. “Well said.”

And when a microphone malfunctioned as a college student was asking a question, Ms. Guadagno invited him onstage, telling him to speak into her microphone that was clipped on her white jacket.

When he paused, she joked, “My husband is in the front row.”

As for Mr. Christie, whose name was cited and derided often, he was not at the debate supporting his lieutenant governor. He probably was not even watching it live on TV.

Instead, he told reporters earlier on Tuesday, that he was going to “TiVo” it.”",Sleepy New Jersey Governor’s Race Turns Fiery in First Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/nyregion/new-jersey-governor-race-murphy-guadagno.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Sometimes these demolition experts are pretty funny. But if you don’t already know “Measure for Measure” — and it’s an uncommonly hard play to know — you’ll need NoDoz to stay engaged.

Frustration and even defeat are not unusual responses to “Measure for Measure,” which is set in a medieval, vice-ridden Vienna in which fornication before marriage is punishable by death. That law has gone long unenforced when the play begins, so the enigmatic Duke of Vienna (Scott Shepherd) decides to step aside and put the merciless puritan Angelo (Pete Simpson) in charge.

But even as he sends police into the city’s bars and brothels, Angelo is wrestling with illicit desires of his own. He finds himself inconveniently in lust with Isabella (Rinne Groff), a convent novitiate, when she comes to plead for the life of her brother, Claudio (Greig Sargeant), condemned for premarital sex. All the while, the Duke, disguised as a lowly friar, observes from the shadows.

The scholar Harold Bloom has described “Measure for Measure” as a nihilistic “comedy that destroys comedy.” It is a work that combines psychosexual portraiture that anticipates Freud with stock farcical figures like the illiterate cop and various rascally lowlifes. It does not have a single sympathetic character, and every philosophical principle seems to be contradicted by another.

Photo

I usually lower my expectations for “Measure,” which contemporary directors like to trick out in (yawn) S&M and Storm Trooper regalia. The most persuasive version I’ve ever seen, from Fiasco Theater in 2014, refrained from interpretive gloss, and let the play’s paradoxes speak eloquently for themselves. But even in over-conceptualized versions, there’s usually at least one, thought-provoking portrayal that illuminates.

Mr. Collins’s production does feature one such performance, from Mr. Shepherd (more on whom later). Mostly, though, it translates the challenges of a notorious problem play into “oh, why not?” parlor tricks and slapstick.

Much of the intermissionless, two-hours-plus show is conducted at a rushing tempo that defies comprehension. Often, the words being spoken are simultaneously seen (via Eva von Schweinitz’s projections) sliding down the walls of Jim Findlay’s multi-table set, which suggests the shabby boardroom of an underfinanced company.

The performers, wearing Kaye Voyce’s jauntily eclectic costumes, alternately sit, like extras on a movie set, or rush around in high frenzy, scattering papers and props. (I half expected them to start singing, “You say tragedy, I say comedy,” concluding with, “Let’s call the whole thing off.”) And then a silence falls for the Act Three scene in which Isabella explains to Claudio why she cannot sacrifice her maidenhood (to Angelo) to save him from the executioner’s block.

Ms. Groff’s Isabella, dressed to resemble a Tennessee Williams spinster, and Mr. Sargeant’s Claudio speak their exchange plainly and slowly. And it suddenly registers that within all the pious bureaucratic double-talk we’ve been hearing lie matters of genuine life and death. It is an ingeniously placed revelation, and it registers intellectually, if not emotionally.

The lack of affect has to do with the absence of any character definition beyond the archetypal. While I enjoyed the vaudeville neuroses of Mr. Simpson’s Angelo, only one actor told me anything new about “Measure for Measure.”

That’s Mr. Shepherd, whose narrator in “Gatz” was one of the great virtuosic performance of recent years. Here he portrays the “fantastical duke of dark corners” as an exuberant escapee from the House of Windsor, an inbred composite of all the 20th century princes of Wales, including Charles.

This Duke has the enthusiastic but distractible air of a nobleman who has been conditioned to see the world as his personal Erector Set. While his character’s erratic behavior has inspired centuries of debate, Mr. Shepherd suggests that the most accurate interpretation is the simplest.

The Duke acts as he does because he can. He’s the Duke! Like the spoiled and glamorous aristocrats of “The Great Gatsby,” he careers through the lives of lesser mortals, without explanation, leaving others to clean up his mess.

Back Story

When Hinda Miller took up jogging in 1977, she found herself in a predicament — the run was great, but what about the bounce factor?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Her friend Lisa Lindahl was asking herself the same question. So they bought some bras, tore them apart, and went to work figuring out the perfect support system.

Photo

Breasts move in a figure eight when a woman runs. The idea for a more form-fitting garment came after Ms. Lindahl’s husband jokingly crisscrossed two jock straps across his chest.

The sports bra, or Jogbra as it was originally known, turns 40 this year.

It remained largely out of the public eye until the Women’s World Cup in 1999. But after Brandi Chastain scored the decisive penalty kick to give the U.S. a win over China, she dropped to the grass in jubilation and took off her jersey, revealing a black sports bra.

Ms. Miller later described the indelible scene, in which her invention played a role: “I saw the exuberance of being right out there, confident and joyous and totally committed and not ashamed of your body, a body of strength and athleticism: ‘This is me. Accept me for who I am.’ ”

So many areas to get around to! So many feelings to consider! And I know I’d get jealous and wonder if those other two are having fun without me when I’m not looking. Not to judge. If this is your life and it’s working, more power to you.

This is what I love about “Transparent” and the mind of Jill Soloway, the creator. She’s built a world where characters are free to explore every aspect of themselves. Wherever that takes them.

While Mr. Puigdemont is facing a fight for his own political survival — hard-line separatists have denounced his failure to deliver a clear message of independence — Mr. Rajoy appears to have consolidated his power base in Madrid, where he has been in charge of a minority government since late 2016.

Spain’s main opposition Socialist party expressed support for Mr. Rajoy as he discussed using Article 155, an idea it has been more reluctant to endorse in the past.

Pedro Sánchez, the Socialist leader, told a news conference that his party also supported Mr. Rajoy in his demands “to clarify and get out of the quagmire in which Mr. Puigdemont has put Catalan politics.”

In return, Mr. Sánchez said that he had reached an agreement with Mr. Rajoy to form a commission on changing the Constitution because “the Spain of 2017 is not the same as that of 1978,” when the document enshrined Spain’s return to democracy.

The commission is not expected to complete its preliminary report for six months, however, so its work is likely to have little influence on the conflict with the Catalan separatists.

Mr. Rajoy is under intense pressure from his own lawmakers to stop Catalan secessionism in its tracks, but he is also aware that strong reprisals against the region’s leader, Carles Puigdemont, could galvanize the independence movement.

The comments on Wednesday represented the first formal response to the events of the previous evening, when Mr. Puigdemont appeared to declare independence from Spain in an address to the Catalan Parliament, before immediately suspending that decision to allow for more “dialogue” with Madrid.

Further muddying the waters, Mr. Puigdemont and separatist lawmakers later signed a declaration of independence, a process set in motion after a highly disputed referendum on Oct. 1 that went ahead despite being suspended by the Spanish Constitutional Court.

Most Madrid-based newspapers and television morning talk shows ridiculed Mr. Puigdemont’s speech on Tuesday and described his call for negotiations with Madrid as an act of desperation.

The headline in the newspaper El Mundo described the night’s events as “farce and blackmail.” Susanna Griso, a news anchor on the television channel Antenna 3, said the Catalan parliamentary session swung “between tragedy and comedy.”

Spanish legal experts said that Mr. Puigdemont and his separatist lawmakers had violated the Constitution by signing a declaration of independence, and speculated that the move would almost certainly compel Mr. Rajoy to intervene forcefully in Catalonia.

“Let’s be clear: A region doesn’t have the competence to declare any kind of independence,” Ignacio Gordillo, a former prosecutor for Spain’s national court, told Antenna 3. “You cannot negotiate with criminals.”

Mr. Rajoy, who has stood firm against the separatists, has a battery of potential emergency measures available to him: not just Article 155, but also a national emergency law that his government enacted in 2015.

However, he also has a long record as a cautious politician who has stayed on the front line of Spanish politics for two decades by steering clear of difficult decisions and letting rivals dig themselves into holes instead. He said on Wednesday that he would “continue to act with prudence,” and put the onus on Mr. Puigdemont to explain himself.

Article 155, which requires Senate approval, would allow Mr. Rajoy to suspend, for as long as he believes necessary, the political institutions of Catalonia, including its regional government and Parliament. His government could also take over the leadership of the region’s autonomous police force and its public broadcaster.

Separately, public prosecutors could open criminal proceedings against Mr. Puigdemont and his government. On Monday, Pablo Casado, the spokesman for Mr. Rajoy’s governing party, warned that Mr. Puigdemont could be imprisoned for insurrection.

Still, Ignacio González Vega, spokesman for a Spanish association of judges, warned on Wednesday that “a political issue cannot be resolved only by applying laws.” He also told Antenna 3 that Mr. Rajoy “will have to step in with a lot of sensitivity, because these measures are very serious.”",Spain Asks Catalonia: Did You Declare Independence or Not?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/world/europe/catalonia-spain-independence-mariano-rajoy.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

FRIDAY PUZZLE — When you’ve had a busy or a tough week — a week where it feels as if your hair is on fire — your best bet is to find a distraction. Ideally, this distraction should be good for you (or at least not terribly harmful) and should allow you to focus hard on it so that you can temporarily displace thoughts about what kindled that hair fire to begin with.

My own go-to distractions are running, reading, cooking and knitting. When I really need to distract myself and focus down, I enjoy British-style cryptic crosswords. I’m sure you have your own distractions.

My point is, once the hair fire is extinguished and the smoke settles, you deserve a reward for making it through. The Venn diagram of “distractions from hair fires” and “rewards” probably overlaps quite a bit, but in my opinion, sitting down on a Friday with a lovely beverage and a Patrick Berry themeless crossword is one of the best ways to end the week. I put that firmly in the rewards circle.

Mr. Berry can bring some fresh entries to his grids and bring back entries that have not been seen for a while. The middle section — BARBARA JORDAN, SOCIAL STUDIES and ACCOUNT HOLDER — is O.K. in terms of liveliness, but those are all debuts, so bonus points there. What I really liked was the openness of the center, which gave Mr. Berry room to cross those center entries with ROBERT ALTMAN, METEOR SHOWERS and SENATOR ELECT.

From that moment, they stayed with the house seven to 10 minutes, she said — just long enough to load the three of them, a dog and a handful of belongings into a car.

“By the time I started to back the car out of the garage, the house was already on fire,” Ms. Grinnell said. “I drove down the road through smoke with flames on both sides. It almost looked like the burning of Atlanta in ‘Gone With the Wind.’”

Pamela Taylor, 66, at first watched the fire from the mobile home park in Santa Rosa where she lived, thinking it was not near enough to pose a threat — and then, suddenly, it was. “A gigantic fireball jumped across the freeway to the trees around the trailer park,” she said, and within minutes, trailers and cars were ablaze, and people were fleeing.

“There was no turning the gas off. There was just running,” she said.

James Harder and his friends managed to save his business, James Cole Winery, a small-scale maker of high-priced cabernets, even as the nearby Signorello Estate winery burned. Mr. Harder said he saw a wall of flame 20 to 30 feet high descending a hillside toward his property, embers whipping toward him, and formed a bucket brigade with six other people, working through the night, scooping water from a 10,000-gallon tank meant to irrigate his vines.

“We just thought, ‘Keep working, keep working,’” he said. “We would have lost everything if not for our friends.”

All around them, in some of the most expensive real estate in the country, they could see neighbors’ houses going up in flames, their propane tanks exploding with ground-shaking force.

Next door, the gate to the Signorello property was open on Tuesday and a sign said “Open,” but no one was there. The reception area was destroyed, fires still burned from gas pipes there, and ash covered an infinity pool with a commanding view of the valley. But in the bar area, a refrigerator held a wheel of manchego cheese, beer bottles and soda cans, still intact.

How much of the season’s grape harvest was destroyed remains unclear.

Across the state, 17 large wildfires were still burning Tuesday, covering 115,000 acres, Chief Pimlott said. An unusually wet winter produced ample brush, and the state’s hottest summer on record dried it to tinder, setting the stage for a rough October, a month usually marked by dry air and high winds from the north and east.

The entire American West has experienced a particularly brutal wildfire season, even as people in the Southeast have suffered the floods and winds of hurricanes. As of Oct. 6, wildfires had raced through 8.5 million acres, well above the last decade’s average of six million per year.

Most of the current California wildfires are in the north, including a large one in Mendocino County and several others in the Sierra Nevada, the north coast and the San Joaquin Valley. But in Southern California, a fire that broke out Monday in the Anaheim Hills burned through thousands of acres and about a dozen homes, sending smoke pouring into Orange County and closing the 91 freeway, the main route into the county from the east.

The winds whipping the flames in the area north of San Francisco Bay came from the north, and thousands of firefighters labored to build fire breaks on the southern flanks of the blazes to hold them back from populated areas. Supported by aircraft dropping water and fire retardant — ranging from helicopters to a Boeing 747 tanker — fire crews used bulldozers, chain saws and shovels to clear trees and brush, hoping to create fire breaks and starve the blazes of fuel.

A thick layer of smoke shrouded the region, and the Environmental Protection Agency rated the air quality as “unhealthy,” “very unhealthy,” and even “hazardous” in places. Many of the people taken to area hospitals were treated for smoke inhalation, and people walked through their neighborhoods and evacuation centers wearing paper masks, in hopes of protecting their lungs.",Northern California Wildfires Ravage Wine Country; 17 Are Dead,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/california-fires.html

Cooler still was owning one from far away, like from Madagascar, Egypt or Burma. The more exotic, the better. Thousands of cold-blooded creatures moved through Miami’s international airport to their new glass-box homes.

The Burmese python — which can be draped around a neck — was especially popular. A baby python is just 10 inches in length. Much to the surprise of some of their owners, those babies could grow up to 20 times that size.

Reptile-parents let their Burmese pythons loose somewhere in the Everglades. Liana Finck

Maybe it was those overwhelmed owners who let their snakes loose. Maybe it was Hurricane Andrew, which destroyed a reptile breeding facility in 1992 and might have sent its specimens into the wild. One way or another, by the early 2000s, Everglades National Park was teeming with giant non-native pythons, which strangled, and then gobbled whole, almost anything in sight.

A Burmese python gobbles up deer, racoons, and opossums. Liana Finck

Foxes and rabbits, which once commonly roamed the park, appeared to have vanished. Deer, raccoon and opossum populations dwindled by as much as 99 percent. The snakes targeted more than mammals: Once, a 13-foot python ate an entire six-foot alligator before exploding.

In 2015, Bob McCleery, an associate professor of wildlife ecology and conservation at the University of Florida, sent 26 rabbits into the Everglades. Three-quarters of his tracking devices — along with the rabbits — ended up in the stomachs of the snakes.

“The best explanation for the rapid decline of most mammals throughout southern Florida is pythons,” Dr. McCleery said. Most of the mammals, he said, are simply gone.

But not all of them.

The hispid rat, an explosive breeder. Liana Finck

One hardy species endured the invasion: the hispid cotton rat. There are a number of theories about why the rat survived. It could be that its population was already dense and abundant, or that its predators — foxes and bobcats — were eliminated. Or it could be that the hispid cotton rat reproduces even more prolifically than rabbits. (A female can breed again within a few hours of giving birth.)

The hispid rat is very good at carrying mosquito-borne disease. Liana Finck

The rat is also one of the only known hosts of a particular strain of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis complex, known as the Everglades virus, which is spread by mosquitoes.

And, with fewer big mammals to feed on, the native Everglades mosquito had fewer choices for its next meal.

According to a new study, the amount of rat blood in the Everglades mosquito’s diet has quadrupled since 1979.

“We were as surprised by the results as anyone else would be,” said Nathan Burkett-Cadena, an assistant professor of entomology at the University of Florida, whose research, published this week in the journal Biology Letters, looks at whether invasive species could increase the risk of disease for humans by setting off such chains of events.

Mosquitos transmit the Everglades virus to humans. Liana Finck

In humans, the Everglades virus can cause fever, headache and in some cases encephalitis, a swelling of the brain.

“I don’t think that anyone could have predicted that this large snake, decimating some native mammals in a relatively wild area, could have some kind of cascading impact for human health,” Dr. Burkett-Cadena said.

While no known human outbreaks have occurred in Florida, Dr. Burkett-Cadena and his team pieced together information from Venezuela, Guatemala and Mexico, where it is thought that viruses in the same family may have spread from rats to people. Together with three of his students, Dr. Burkett-Cadena spent five months collecting “blood-engorged females” from the Everglades and Vero Beach, Fla., to see whether the mosquitoes’ eating habits changed at snake-infested sites. (Only females drink blood, in preparation for egg-laying.)

“We never get to sit down and talk to a mosquito and say, ‘Hey, you feeling okay? Let me feel your forehead — seems like you’ve got Everglades. Do you remember what animal you bit last?’” he said.

Dr. McCleery, who was not involved in his colleague’s study, said the missing mammals would have far-reaching impacts. “As ecologists, we’ve known that this is really bad for some time,” he said. “You can’t completely alter an ecosystem and not expect that there won’t be other implications that will impact humans.”

Gage, an entomologist and ecologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said exotic species could disturb ecosystems in ways that humans could not anticipate.",How Pet Snakes Set Off an Unlikely Chain of Events That Could Make You Sick,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/07/climate/everglades-pythons-mosquitoes.html

The path through qualifying had been full of pivotal moments; the team switched coaches after losing its first two qualifiers of the final round, firing Jurgen Klinsmann and rehiring Bruce Arena for a second stint leading the team. While Arena’s arrival initially seemed to steady the team, the Americans ultimately won only three of the eight qualifiers he coached.

“We didn’t qualify for the World Cup,” Arena said after Tuesday’s loss. “That was my job.”

He added: “We have no excuses. We failed today.”

Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer, echoed his coach’s disappointment.

“We certainly expected to qualify, throughout the process, and especially after Friday night,” he said, adding, “It’s a huge disappointment for everybody; the players, the staff, the coaches, the federation.

“It’s not good enough.”

Gulati, who is expected to face his first contested election for the U.S. Soccer presidency in February, said he would make no decisions about the future of the program in the immediate aftermath of the defeat.

“That’s for tomorrow,” he said. He declined to say whether Arena would coach the team through the end of his contract, which runs through the end of the 2018 World Cup.

Arena and his team entered Tuesday’s game needing only a win or a tie to qualify, and — after a 4-0 win over Panama on Friday that kept the Americans in control of their qualification destiny — even a loss would have done the trick if the results in the other two games went the Americans’ way.

But a listless first half on Tuesday put them back on perilous footing.

Soon Panama and Honduras were rallying from early deficits, and then it all unraveled for the U.S. Trinidad and Tobago forward Shahdon Winchester and United States defender Omar Gonzalez converged on a looping cross in the penalty area in the 17th minute, and the hopeful ball knuckled off Winchester’s foot and Gonzalez’s shin before sailing over goalkeeper Tim Howard, who was caught off his line.

The goal, a crestfallen Gonzalez said later, “is one that will haunt me forever.”

The day, one Gonzalez called “the worst of my career,” soon got worse. Twenty minutes later, Trinidad and Tobago right back Alvin Jones, sauntering up the right side and looking for a passing option, realized he had no pressure and decided to shoot instead — a rocket from nearly 35 yards that screamed past Howard. The tiny crowd that bothered to show up to Ato Boldon Stadium roared again.

The Americans had lost control of their fate, and suddenly needed goals — or help elsewhere — to save them. Christian Pulisic grabbed a goal back less than 90 seconds after halftime, and the press for one more — which would have been good enough to clinch qualification — was on.

It never came, though, and despite Clint Dempsey’s hitting the post in the final minutes — one of several late chances that would have rescued the U.S. — the Americans were out.

The defeat could mean the end of the national team careers of several national team mainstays, including Dempsey, 34, and Howard, 38. But those decisions, too, are for another day.

On Tuesday night, there was just the hard truth of qualification. In international soccer, midfielder Michael Bradley had noted on Monday, “you either qualify for the World Cup, or you don’t. There’s no extra points for how you qualify.”

There is no relying on other teams to help, either. So as the scores turned bad in the other two matches, and as the time ticked down on the tiny scoreboard at the stadium here, the increasingly desperate Americans could sense what was coming. Arena said he did not check the other scores, but Gonzalez said he could read the body language on the bench from his position on the field, and he knew the news wasn’t good.

When the final whistle blew, Gonzalez and Bradley and the rest of the team were, for the first time since the 1986 World Cup, on the wrong side of the qualifying line.

So does Angelina Jolie, who said that during the release of “Playing by Heart” in the late 1990s, he made unwanted advances on her in a hotel room, which she rejected.

“I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did,” Ms. Jolie said in an email. “This behavior towards women in any field, any country is unacceptable.”

A New York Times investigation last week chronicled a hidden history of sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Weinstein and settlements he paid, often involving former employees, over three decades up to 2015. By Sunday evening, his entertainment company fired him.

On Tuesday, The New Yorker published a report that included multiple allegations of sexual assault, including forced oral and vaginal sex. The article also included accounts of sexual harassment going back to the 1990s, with women describing how intimidating Mr. Weinstein was.

Several days ago, additional actresses began sharing with The Times on-the-record stories of casting-couch abuses. Their accounts hint at the sweep of Mr. Weinstein’s alleged harassment, targeting women on the way to stardom, those who had barely acted and others in between. Fantasies that the public eagerly watched onscreen, the women recounted, sometimes masked the dark experiences of those performing in them.

The encounters they recalled followed a similar narrative: First, they said, Mr. Weinstein lured them to a private place to discuss films, scripts or even Oscar campaigns. Then, the women contend, he variously tried to initiate massages, touched them inappropriately, took off his clothes or offered them explicit work-for-sex deals.

In a statement on Tuesday, his spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. He will not be available for further comments, as he is taking the time to focus on his family, on getting counseling and rebuilding his life.”

Even in an industry in which sexual harassment has long persisted, Mr. Weinstein stands out, according to the actresses and current and former employees of the film companies he ran, Miramax and the Weinstein Company. He had an elaborate system reliant on the cooperation of others: Assistants often booked the meetings, arranged the hotel rooms and sometimes even delivered the talent, then disappeared, the actresses and employees recounted. They described how some of Mr. Weinstein’s executives and assistants then found them agents and jobs or hushed actresses who were upset.

His alleged behavior became something of a Hollywood open secret: When the comedian Seth MacFarlane announced Oscar nominees in 2013, he joked, “Congratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.” The audience laughed. According to a 2015 memo by a former Weinstein Company executive that The Times previously disclosed, the misconduct continued.

More established actresses were fearful of speaking out because they had work; less established ones were scared because they did not. “This is Harvey Weinstein,” Katherine Kendall, who appeared in the film “Swingers” and television roles, remembers telling herself after an encounter in which she said Mr. Weinstein undressed and chased her around a living room. Telling others meant “I’ll never work again and no one is going to care or believe me,” she reasoned at the time, she said in a recent interview.

Ms. Paltrow, 45, is now an entrepreneur, no longer dependent on securing her next acting role. But she emphasized how much more vulnerable she felt at 22, when Mr. Weinstein had just signed her up for a star-making part. On a trip to Los Angeles, she received a schedule from her agents for the hotel meeting with Mr. Weinstein.

There was no reason to suspect anything untoward, because “it’s on the fax, it’s from C.A.A.,” she said, referring to Creative Artists Agency, which represented her.

When Mr. Weinstein tried to massage her and invited her into the bedroom, she immediately left, she said, and remembers feeling stunned as she drove away. “I thought you were my Uncle Harvey,” she recalled thinking, explaining that she had seen him as a mentor.

After she told Mr. Pitt about the episode, he approached Mr. Weinstein at a theater premiere and told him never to touch Ms. Paltrow again. Mr. Pitt confirmed the account to The Times through a representative.

Soon after, Mr. Weinstein called Ms. Paltrow and berated her for discussing the episode, she said. (She said she also told a few friends, family members and her agent.) “He screamed at me for a long time,” she said, once again fearing she could lose the role in “Emma.” “It was brutal.” But she stood her ground, she said, and insisted that he put the relationship back on professional footing.

Even as Ms. Paltrow became known as the “first lady of Miramax” and won an Oscar for “Shakespeare in Love” in 1999, very few people knew about Mr. Weinstein’s advances. “I was expected to keep the secret,” she said.

Like several of the other women interviewed for this article, she felt she had to suppress the experience. She praised Mr. Weinstein publicly, posed for pictures with him and played the glowing star to his powerful producer. Yet their work relationship grew rockier over the years, she said, and she distanced herself. “He was alternately generous and supportive and championing, and punitive and bullying,” she said.

Now, with the process of tallying the size and scope of Mr. Weinstein’s abuse allegations underway, Ms. Paltrow and others said they wanted to support women who had already come forward and help those in similar situations feel less alone.

“We’re at a point in time when women need to send a clear message that this is over,” Ms. Paltrow said. “This way of treating women ends now.”

Iowa’s waiver request is more far-reaching, providing what Timothy S. Jost, an emeritus professor of health law at Washington and Lee University, has called a “watershed moment” for Obamacare.
Under the law, people who don’t get insurance through work can buy it through the online marketplace.
“I still think it’s the best thing on the table right now,” she said of the stopgap plan.","In Des Moines on Tuesday, Gov. Kim Reynolds told reporters that her team was in constant contact with the White House and C.M.S. about the plan, including a call with Ms. Verma this week, trying “to get to yes.” She said the administration has been “very receptive” to the plan as a solution to the “unaffordable,” “unworkable” health law until it can be repealed.

Iowa calls its request a stopgap plan that would allow the state to opt out of the federal health insurance marketplace, HealthCare.gov, for 2018 and create a state-run system that its insurance commissioner says would lower premiums for the 72,000 Iowans who currently have Obamacare health plans, including 28,000 who earn too much to get subsidies to help with the cost.

But the cheaper premiums would come with a big trade-off: higher out-of-pocket costs. The only option for customers would be a plan with deductibles of $7,350 for a single person and $14,700 for a family. The proposal would also reallocate millions of federal dollars that the health law dedicates to lowering costs for people with modest incomes and use the money for premium assistance to those with higher incomes, no matter how much money they make.

The individual insurance market is particularly fragile in Iowa, partly because the state has allowed tens of thousands of people to keep old plans that do not meet the health law’s standards. Aetna and Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield, the state’s most popular insurer, are both withdrawing at the end of the year. The only insurer planning to remain, Medica, is seeking premium increases that average 56 percent, blaming Mr. Trump’s ongoing threats to stop paying subsidies known as cost-sharing reductions that lower many people’s deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. Wellmark has said it will stay if the stopgap plan is approved.

“What we are trying to address is a really large number of people being priced out,” said Doug Ommen, the state’s Republican insurance commissioner.

Two other states, Alaska and Minnesota, have already won permission to shore up their Obamacare markets with waivers allowed under the law; they will use federal money to help insurers cover the claims of their most expensive customers next year. But Oklahoma abruptly withdrew a similar request in late September — one that state officials said would have reduced premiums by an average of 30 percent — saying that the Trump administration had reneged on a promise to approve it by Sept. 25 and they were out of time.

Iowa’s waiver request is more far-reaching, providing what Timothy S. Jost, an emeritus professor of health law at Washington and Lee University, has called a “watershed moment” for Obamacare.

“It’s a decision to abandon a number of key principles of the Affordable Care Act,” he said.

Under the law, people who don’t get insurance through work can buy it through the online marketplace. They get federal subsidies to help with the cost if their income is below 400 percent of the poverty level, or about $65,000 a year for a couple. Those whose incomes are below 250 percent of the poverty level — $40,600 a year for a couple — also get cost-sharing reductions.

Iowa’s plan would reallocate much of that federal assistance, using it to provide premium subsidies based on age and income for even the wealthiest individual market customers. It would also be used to create a “reinsurance” program, like Alaska’s and Minnesota’s, to help insurers cover their sickest customers. The law’s essential health benefits and protections for people with pre-existing conditions would remain in place, but every individual market customer would get the same standardized high-deductible plan.

Mr. Jost and other supporters of the law say Iowa’s proposal does not meet the requirements for so-called innovation waivers, including that the coverage they provide must be at least as comprehensive and affordable as Obamacare plans, because poorer people would face higher deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. That, they say, leaves the plan open to almost-certain legal challenges.

Seemingly acknowledging that problem, Mr. Ommen has tweaked Iowa’s proposal — including with a supplemental filing to the Trump administration on Thursday — to preserve subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket costs for roughly 21,000 low-income Iowans.

But those at slightly higher income levels would lose cost-sharing assistance completely, facing the $7,350 deductible and other out-of-pocket expenses.

“You still have some real problems from the perspective of making sure low-income people can afford coverage,” said Joel Ario, a managing director at Manatt Health who worked on the Affordable Care Act at the Department of Health and Human Services during the Obama administration.

But for the roughly 28,000 Iowans who have Obamacare coverage but earn too much to get subsidies, the need for a shake-up is urgent. And with open enrollment starting in about three weeks, time is of the essence.

Dozens of them, including many farmers, submitted comments to Mr. Ommen or testified at public hearings in favor of the stopgap plan, with many saying they would be forced to drop their insurance next year if it were not approved.

“Fortunately both my husband and I have already prepaid our funeral expenses,” write a woman identified as Nancy K., of Bellevue, who said she could no longer afford her coverage. “Every single item, even our cemetery marker, is paid for or covered for my death in the event that we cannot afford insurance to pay for any so-called catastrophic health care.”

Landi Livingston, whose family raises beef cattle in rural southern Iowa, said she was paying almost $500 a month for a Wellmark plan and dreaded having to switch to Medica next year, with what she assumed would be significantly higher prices.

If the Trump administration approves the state’s request, Ms. Livingston’s premium would likely drop to around $350 a month, according to estimates from the state, saving her $1,800 next year. But her $3,000 deductible would more than double, meaning that if she had high medical expenses she could end up paying more toward those bills.

“I still think it’s the best thing on the table right now,” she said of the stopgap plan. “It’s high time the people in power get this figured out.”

For Tony Ross, a retired paralegal in Des Moines who has a subsidized marketplace plan from Aetna, the stopgap plan would lower his premiums to about $85 a month, from $220, according to the state estimates. But his deductible – currently $750 because his low income qualifies him for cost-sharing reductions – would balloon by almost tenfold. That would mean paying thousands more each year for his expensive blood pressure medication, he said.

“Obviously I need a way lower deductible than $7,350,” said Mr. Ross, 63. “This doesn’t seem like a fair way of fixing things.”","In New Test for Obamacare, Iowa Seeks to Abandon Marketplace",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/health/obamacare-iowa-premiums.html

Eminem, who has never shied away from a feud, has made Mr. Trump a target before. In August, during a performance at the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, Eminem told the crowd that he “can’t stand” the president before leading them in an obscene anti-Trump chant. Days earlier, at a concert in Glasgow, the rapper wore a shirt reading “FACK TRUMP” and made similar comments about the president before performing his song “White America.” (“See the problem is/I speak to suburban kids/who otherwise would’ve never knew these words exist.”)

But in an earlier era, the two men appeared together amicably. Ahead of the 2004 presidential election, Mr. Trump made a cameo in the Eminem concert special “The Shady National Convention,” which aired on MTV. “I know a winner when I see one,” Mr. Trump said in an endorsement of Eminem’s alter-ego, Slim Shady. “Donald Trump is telling you right now Slim Shady is a winner. He’s got brains, he’s got guts and he’s got Donald Trump’s vote.”

The rapper’s dense, blistering lyrics have courted controversy in the past, with some accusing him of writing homophobic and misogynistic verses.

And this is not the first time that Eminem has tackled politics in his songs: He has also taken aim at Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and George W. Bush. Last October, he released the freestyle track “Campaign Speech,” in which he called Mr. Trump “a loose cannon who’s blunt with his hand on the button.”

Eminem is thought to be gearing up for the release this year of his eighth major-label album and first since “The Marshall Mathers LP 2” in 2013. (A longtime producer for the rapper said earlier this month that the new music was “done.”) In the last few years, he has popped up for occasional guest verses and soundtrack songs — he is featured on Pink’s “Revenge,” out Friday — but has largely remained in the shadows, away from celebrity and social media.

“Sometimes I think that if I get comfortable or set in my ways of doing something, maybe I should step back for a minute and figure out how to mix it up a little bit,” he told The New York Times in 2015.

Other hip-hop artists and rappers have also targeted the president in their lyrics and music videos. The California rapper YG released a single last August called “FDT,” in which he repeatedly curses Mr. Trump’s name. Kendrick Lamar lashed out at Mr. Trump in his tracks “The Heart Part 4” and “XXX.” Snoop Dogg’s music video “Lavender,” in which the rapper aimed a toy pistol at a clown resembling Mr. Trump, earned a rebuke and a call for “jail time!” from the president himself in March.",Eminem Lashes Out at Trump With Freestyle Rap Video,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/arts/music/eminem-donald-trump-bet.html

Conrad, a managing director of the foundation and the leader of the fellows program, said the goal was to find “people on the precipice,” where the award will make a difference, but also to inspire creativity more broadly.

“We hope that when people read about the fellows, it makes them think about how they might be more creative in their own lives,” Ms. Conrad said. “It does something for the human spirit.”

The honorees include relatively well-known figures in the arts, like the playwright Annie Baker, 36, who won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for “The Flick”; the theater artist Taylor Mac, 44, the creator of the 24-hour piece “A 24-Decade History of Popular Music”; and the writers Jesmyn Ward, 40, and Viet Thanh Nguyen, 46.

The youngest fellow is Cristina Jiménez Moreta, 33, a founder and executive director of United We Dream, a national network of advocates for immigrant youths. The oldest is Dawoud Bey, 63, a Chicago-based photographer and educator whose portraits of communities include “Harlem Redux” and “The Birmingham Project.”

Even some fellows who have already achieved substantial recognition described the honor as bringing palpable relief.

“I feel released from a profound, decades-old financial anxiety,” Ms. Baker said by email. “Now my job is just to wake up every morning and ask myself: What do I want to write? What is the most important thing I could be writing?”

Few honors are as wrapped in mystery and speculation as the MacArthur. Potential fellows cannot apply but are suggested by a network of hundreds of nominators from across the country, in a range of fields, and winnowed down by an anonymous committee of about a dozen.

Njideka Akunyili Crosby, 34, a Nigerian-born painter now living in Los Angeles whose work explores transnational identity, studied both biology and art as an undergraduate, and, as the daughter of scientists, had to grow into the idea of art as a potential career. “I think of my studio as a lab sometimes,” she said. “When I’m working out a new idea, I try to be as methodical as I can.”

Jason De Léon, 40, an anthropologist at the University of Michigan, trained as an archaeologist studying ancient sites in Mexico, before shifting focus to clandestine migration across the United States-Mexico border, which he studies using a combination of oral history, archaeological research and forensic science.

“I wear a lot of different hats in my work,” Mr. De Léon said. “Most of my career has been defined by making it up as I go along.”

While only individuals are eligible for fellowships, some winners spoke of the intensely collaborative nature of their work and of the ways they might use the money and prestige to benefit collaborators, including nonprofessionals.

“I have worked with such amazing people from outside academia,” said Betsy Levy Paluck, 39, a psychologist at Princeton who has studied the ways social norms and social networks influence behavior in settings like American high schools or post-conflict Rwanda. “Some of my best ideas are really theirs.”

Greg Asbed, 54, a founder of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which seeks to improve conditions in the Florida tomato industry, said the fellowship money would be used to sustain and expand the group’s Fair Food Program, which enlists the purchasing power of large corporations to compel growers to improve working conditions. (Mr. Asbed added that he hoped publicity from his award would help persuade Wendy’s, the only one of the five largest fast-food companies not to join its agreement with tomato growers, to reconsider.)

Mr. Nguyen, who won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for his novel “The Sympathizer,” said he wanted to use some of the money to hire an editor to oversee the blog he created for the Diasporic Vietnamese Artists Network, as recognition to the broader tradition that made his own success possible.

“I think back to the first Asian-American writers,” he said. “They were really lonely people back then. They deserve this fellowship, too.”

Mr. Nguyen, a professor of English and American studies and ethnicity at the University of Southern California who has toggled between fiction and scholarship, added that the honor came with something paradoxical: a new opportunity to fail.

When Hinda Miller took up jogging in 1977, she found herself in a predicament — the run was great, but what about the bounce factor?

Her friend Lisa Lindahl was asking herself the same question. So they bought some bras, tore them apart, and went to work figuring out the perfect support system.

Breasts move in a figure eight when a woman runs. The idea for a more form-fitting garment came after Ms. Lindahl’s husband jokingly crisscrossed two jock straps across his chest.

The sports bra, or Jogbra as it was originally known, turns 40 this year.

It remained largely out of the public eye until the Women’s World Cup in 1999. But after Brandi Chastain scored the decisive penalty kick to give the U.S. a win over China, she dropped to the grass in jubilation and took off her jersey, revealing a black sports bra.

Ms. Miller later described the indelible scene, in which her invention played a role: “I saw the exuberance of being right out there, confident and joyous and totally committed and not ashamed of your body, a body of strength and athleticism: ‘This is me. Accept me for who I am.’ ”

The result, released last week by the Ripped Bodice, is “The State of Racial Diversity in Romance Publishing.” It reports that of the romance novels published in 2016 by the 20 largest imprints in the romance genre, 7.8 percent were written by nonwhite authors.

To account for instances in which biographical information on authors was scant or whether they missed titles on publishers’ lists, the sisters appended the study with a 2 percent margin of error.

Beverly Jenkins, a prolific author of historical and contemporary romantic suspense, is not surprised. “It’s indicative of every major industry, regardless of whether it’s publishing, academics, finance or government,” said Ms. Jenkins, who is black, in an interview earlier this week. “It’s a sign of how America treats people of color.”

When she was getting her start as an author in the 1980s, Ms. Jenkins said, publishers told her that they did not see a market for historical fiction about or for black people. “That was proved wrong because I have 37 books in print,” Ms. Jenkins said. Her subjects have included Harriet Tubman’s spy ring.

Her latest book, “Chasing Down a Dream,” is the eighth book in her women’s fiction series, “Blessings,” about a wealthy woman who saves from financial ruin a town in Kansas founded by freed slaves.

Ms. Jenkins’s novels are published by Avon Romance and William Morrow, both of which are imprints of HarperCollins. According to the Ripped Bodice survey, 2.8 percent of the books published in 2016 by Avon Romance were by nonwhite authors. (Avon declined to comment for this article.)

It’s tough for any new author to get a first book published, but some people say the bar is even higher for writers who aren’t white.

When Sonali Dev, a popular Indian-American romance and women’s fiction author, was shopping her first book to publishers, “The Bollywood Bride,” “big-name editors looked me straight in the eye, as if was perfectly normal, and said, ‘Well, is it possible to change one of the protagonists to white?’” she said.

At a book-industry seminar she attended, Ms. Dev says she asked a well-known agent who was sitting on a panel to address the difficulty that nonwhite authors face in trying to sell books that focus on people of different backgrounds.

“He said to me, ‘You write a ‘Kite Runner’ and no one can stop you,” referring to the 2003 international best-selling book written by Khaled Hosseini, an Afghan-American first-time author.

Ms. Dev replied, “So every time you get a white story, do you think it has to be ‘Gone With the Wind’?”

She remains exasperated by the exchange. “How many authors have their first book as their best book? You have to develop writers,” she said in a phone interview. “People of color get one shot only, if they get a shot at all.”

After more than two years and 50 rejections, she sold “The Bollywood Bride” and “A Bollywood Affair” in a two-book deal to Kensington. She has since published another novel with Kensington, and a fourth book, “A Distant Heart,” is set for publication at the end of the year.

She recently signed a new deal with William Morrow, a sister imprint of Avon Romance at HarperCollins, which rejected her back in 2012. She is switching publishers in part because she wants to expand beyond the romance genre into women’s fiction and believes her new publisher will make a better showing in future studies.

“They have made a concerted effort over last year to really increase their diversity,” Ms. Dev said.

Kensington Publishing, a family business founded in 1974 that publishes about 650 trade, mass-market, electronic and hardcover books each year, drew the highest rank on the Ripped Bodice report. Of its romance titles, nearly 20 percent were written by nonwhite authors.

Marketing a range of authors and stories has been a smart business strategy, said Steven Zacharius, the company’s chief executive. In 1994, Kensington introduced Arabesque, a romance-focused imprint for novels about and by black women. It was a success and was acquired by BET.

About 15 years ago, Kensington tried to start a bilingual Spanish imprint to bring romance novels to Hispanic women in America. This was before social media had become a large-scale phenomenon, and the effort faltered.

But the company still tries to find compelling stories that will appeal to often underserved readers. “We don’t do it to be politically correct,” Mr. Zacharius said. “We do well by doing good.”

That the best-performing company on the Ripped Bodice report has only 20 percent of its 2016 titles written by nonwhite people underscores a larger problem in the publishing industry, said Robin Bradford, the collection development librarian who purchases primarily adult fiction for the 27 branches of the Timberland Regional Library in Washington State.

“It really speaks to the diversity of publishing behind-the-scenes,” she said.

Ms. Bradford, who in 2016 was named librarian of the year by the Romance Writers of America, said she frequently asks editors and publishers how they decided which books to acquire. Inevitably, she said, they tell her that they read a book and then try to think of someone they know who would like it.

“That’s the problem,” she said. “If you’re thinking about your cousin, your aunt, your best friend, you’re going to keep acquiring the same books and keep not acquiring the same book.”

The difficulty for publishing houses in becoming more diverse is that they don’t necessarily know the race of authors submitting manuscripts to them, said Cindy Hwang, the editorial director at Berkley, the imprint at Penguin Random House.

“It has to be a good read,” Ms. Hwang said, adding that she doesn’t think her imprint receives many manuscripts from nonwhite authors. “You can only publish what you get.”

Berkley publishes about 300 books a year, with romance novels and women’s fiction making up about two-thirds of the list. The Ripped Bodice study reports that 3.9 percent of it 2016 romance books were written by nonwhite authors.

Berkley declined to provide the Koch sisters with their publishing list, leaving it to them to cull the information.

“We were not comfortable in participating,” Ms. Hwang said, adding that she thinks the Ripped Bodice’s findings of 3.9 percent nonwhite were low. “It felt very awkward to us to hand out lists of our authors, and they were only concentrated on people-of-color diversity, which we thought was limiting.”

Jasmine Guillory, whose first romance novel, “The Wedding Date,” is to be published next year by Jove Trade Paperback, a Berkley imprint, said that Ms. Hwang, her editor, encouraged her to examine more closely the issues of race experienced by the black protagonist and her white boyfriend. “This delighted me,” said Ms. Guillory, a lawyer who lives in Oakland, Calif.

Heidi Bond, whose pen name is Courtney Milan, is a New York Times best-selling romance author who has turned to self-publishing in order to have more agency over the background of her characters and the stories she wishes to tell.

“There is a deep and systemic problem in that publishing is insular and people have learned everything about the industry from the people who came before them, in a time when nobody understood or wanted to understand that people of color have inner lives and want to find love and happiness,” said Ms. Bond, a former clerk for Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, of the United States Supreme Court.

From that moment, they stayed with the house seven to 10 minutes, she said — just long enough to load the three of them, a dog and a handful of belongings into a car.

“By the time I started to back the car out of the garage, the house was already on fire,” Ms. Grinnell said. “I drove down the road through smoke with flames on both sides. It almost looked like the burning of Atlanta in ‘Gone With the Wind.’”

Pamela Taylor, 66, at first watched the fire from the mobile home park in Santa Rosa where she lived, thinking it was not near enough to pose a threat — and then, suddenly, it was. “A gigantic fireball jumped across the freeway to the trees around the trailer park,” she said, and within minutes, trailers and cars were ablaze, and people were fleeing.

“There was no turning the gas off. There was just running,” she said.

James Harder and his friends managed to save his business, James Cole Winery, a small-scale maker of high-priced cabernets, even as the nearby Signorello Estate winery burned. Mr. Harder said he saw a wall of flame 20 to 30 feet high descending a hillside toward his property, embers whipping toward him, and formed a bucket brigade with six other people, working through the night, scooping water from a 10,000-gallon tank meant to irrigate his vines.

“We just thought, ‘Keep working, keep working,’” he said. “We would have lost everything if not for our friends.”

All around them, in some of the most expensive real estate in the country, they could see neighbors’ houses going up in flames, their propane tanks exploding with ground-shaking force.

Next door, the gate to the Signorello property was open on Tuesday and a sign said “Open,” but no one was there. The reception area was destroyed, fires still burned from gas pipes there, and ash covered an infinity pool with a commanding view of the valley. But in the bar area, a refrigerator held a wheel of manchego cheese, beer bottles and soda cans, still intact.

How much of the season’s grape harvest was destroyed remains unclear.

Across the state, 17 large wildfires were still burning Tuesday, covering 115,000 acres, Chief Pimlott said. An unusually wet winter produced ample brush, and the state’s hottest summer on record dried it to tinder, setting the stage for a rough October, a month usually marked by dry air and high winds from the north and east.

The entire American West has experienced a particularly brutal wildfire season, even as people in the Southeast have suffered the floods and winds of hurricanes. As of Oct. 6, wildfires had raced through 8.5 million acres, well above the last decade’s average of six million per year.

Most of the current California wildfires are in the north, including a large one in Mendocino County and several others in the Sierra Nevada, the north coast and the San Joaquin Valley. But in Southern California, a fire that broke out Monday in the Anaheim Hills burned through thousands of acres and about a dozen homes, sending smoke pouring into Orange County and closing the 91 freeway, the main route into the county from the east.

The winds whipping the flames in the area north of San Francisco Bay came from the north, and thousands of firefighters labored to build fire breaks on the southern flanks of the blazes to hold them back from populated areas. Supported by aircraft dropping water and fire retardant — ranging from helicopters to a Boeing 747 tanker — fire crews used bulldozers, chain saws and shovels to clear trees and brush, hoping to create fire breaks and starve the blazes of fuel.

A thick layer of smoke shrouded the region, and the Environmental Protection Agency rated the air quality as “unhealthy,” “very unhealthy,” and even “hazardous” in places. Many of the people taken to area hospitals were treated for smoke inhalation, and people walked through their neighborhoods and evacuation centers wearing paper masks, in hopes of protecting their lungs.",Northern California Wildfires Ravage Wine Country; 17 Are Dead,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/california-fires.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

But that was my parenting generation, when germs were scary but blankets weren’t.","But as the baby I call Bartola (as an affectionate nod to the former Mets pitcher Bartolo Colon) approaches her first birthday, I’m seeing that not everything I remember fits with contemporary parenting practices.

Some customs endure; some skills are timeless. But over the decades, other things change — a lot. You have to keep up.

Take something as elemental as sleeping. Every Thursday, when I serve as Bartola’s day care provider, I’m reminded of how I used to place her mother in her crib when she was a baby.

Her father or I settled her on her belly, which supposedly prevented choking if she spit up. We had tied cheerful gingham bumpers around the crib’s perimeter, so she wouldn’t bump her head on the slats. We tucked blankets around her on chilly nights, and we tossed in a stuffed animal or three for company. It was all very cozy.

We’d vaguely heard about what was then called “crib death,” and is now known as sudden infant death syndrome, but regarded it as a distant tragedy; it might be randomly, mysteriously visited upon you, but we didn’t know it was something you could help prevent.

By the time public health agencies started information campaigns that sharply reduced SIDS, we had a schoolgirl and didn’t need such precautions. But every part of our routine was wrong, and if I used it for Bartola, her parents would react with justifiable horror.

So, as pediatricians recommend, I put the baby on her back, the safest position, in a spartan crib that holds nothing soft or yielding.

This is becoming moot: Her mother heard strange noises at nap time recently and walked in to find the baby standing in the crib, happily attacking the mobile. Still, lesson learned.

On the other hand, today’s new parents have fewer fears about other things.

Germs, for instance. We used to wage war on microbes. For the first three months of our infant’s life, we scrupulously boiled bottles, nipples, pacifiers — anything that might come in contact with her mouth; after that, we sterilized things in the dishwasher.

None of that for Bartola. Her bottles, when she started using them, just got plunked into a bowl of soapy hot water. It appears that our attempts to create pristine environments for children just encouraged allergies and asthma, so our grandchildren are freer to get dirty and develop healthier — to use a phrase unknown to me in days of yore — microbiomes.

I saw this generational divide recently when my daughter and son-in-law traveled out to my New Jersey town for a museum event. They were bringing Bartola, so I invited a few local friends to come meet her.

“Are they bringing a portable playpen?” one asked.

Nah, I said, she’ll just crawl around on the floor.

“The floor? The filthy floor?” You’d have thought we were going to plop her down on a subway platform. But that was my parenting generation, when germs were scary but blankets weren’t.

In fact, the first few times I took Bartola to the playground in Brooklyn, she enjoyed the baby swing so much she started licking it. Her mother, duly informed, was untroubled. “It’s good for her immune system,” she said.

Technology has brought a bunch of change too, of course. How did I remember which side I had nursed on, or how long ago? I suppose I scrawled it on paper. My daughter, Emma, took notes on her phone. (She also, while pregnant, used an app that each week announced, among other information, what fruit or vegetable the developing fetus resembled in size, from mango to turnip to butternut squash.)

We had a monitor so that we could hear the baby from another part of the house. Bartola’s parents have a video monitor.

I thought this unnecessary, when Emma told me about it. But a large part of Effective Grandparenting 101 is, if your children tell you it’s reassuring to actually see a newborn’s chest rise and fall while she’s asleep, you nod and shut up. In fact, nodding and shutting up should probably be your default response to just about everything.

On balance, though, Bubbe-ing seems more familiar than not.

Much of what grandparents know still works, from silly songs about wheels on buses to the physics of propelling more mushy food into the baby than onto her.

Besides, we’re calmer now, more aware that babies get raised in all sorts of ways and most come through it fine — a useful insight. We’re still vigilant, but also committed to letting kids explore their environments, and we hope we get the balance right.

In fact, we hope we get most things right. But since a long time must pass before we learn whether we did (and to be honest, some of us will not be around for the denouement), we take a big leap of faith and hope that love and common sense will prevail.","Fear the Blanket, Not the Germs",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/well/family/parenting-grandparents-babies.html

SATURDAY PUZZLE — I’m going to do something a bit different today. I’ve spilled a few clues, but I want you to get through the puzzle yourself, mostly so you will appreciate the rest of the column. I’ve been looking for an opportunity to develop my Lewis Black impression, and this is it.

Sometimes, when I’m feeling like I haven’t yet had enough pain and humiliation in my life, I take a Zumba class. No, don’t write me letters about how I’m doing it wrong and if I would just relax I’d learn to enjoy it. No one on the entire planet has ever convinced another human being to do anything that way, especially when it comes to tripping over their own two feet. I’ve accepted my fate when it comes to Zumba.

At other times, I solve puzzles by Byron Walden. It has largely the same effect as the Zumba, minus the muscle pain. Mr. Walden, who is one of the nicest people you would ever want to meet, quietly takes his aggressions out by writing the kind of clues that make many solvers, myself included, feel a lot like this dog:

That’s called misdirection. Misdirection is when you look at a clue like 20D’s “One who tries to avoid being touched” and your brain starts to run through the names of disorders where people don’t like being touched because that’s got to be what the constructor is thinking, right, and then the answer winds up being an odd word like EPEEIST. (A “touch” is when your fencing opponent scores against you.)

It’s when you see a clue like “Fabulous speaker?” and think O.K., maybe it’s AESOP, because you’ve been trained, I mean trained, to think AESOP’s fables whenever you see the word “fabulous” in a clue, but the answer turns out to be LIAR. And he’s not wrong. Someone who tells tales is a LIAR.

So over the last century, as temples in Japan and elsewhere began to struggle financially with fewer donations coming in, the natural solution was to open the doors a little wider and welcome visitors who were curious about Buddhism.

Reading up on the shukubo options before my trip, I learned that many previous visitors to Koyasan were irked by the simplicity of the lodgings. Some wrote on TripAdvisor.com that their rooms were too cold, or that they could hear their neighbors snoring through the 200-year-old paper walls of the temple. More than one reviewer complained that the multicourse vegan meals were too simple to satiate people who are accustomed to eating meat. “Take snacks or you will starve,” one warned.

Others felt that they weren’t quite receiving a good enough spiritual bang for their buck. “I expected something a bit spiritual and to feel that Zen/Buddhist vibe,” one visitor from Ohio complained, “I have to say I did not feel it.” Some complained that the monks running the temples didn’t speak enough English, or didn’t offer visitors enough individual attention. “The major disappointment came during dinner,” another wrote. “I was expecting to have the opportunity to mingle with the monks.”

I found these comments more entertaining than dissuasive. I wanted to go and prove to myself how little I was bothered by a chill in the air or a little noise through the walls. Maybe that would be its own form of spiritual growth on a micro scale — proof of my own congruity with the universe even under mildly uncomfortable conditions.

Arriving at this micro-enlightenment would take many modes of transportation, it turned out. Although Koyasan is only about 86 miles outside of Kyoto, the journey to get there is its own self-selecting odyssey. From Kyoto, I took three separate trains past power plants, greenhouses, small towns, backyard yuzu trees and grass tennis courts. At the base of the mountain, I shuffled off the train and onto a cable car along with a handful of European backpackers. At the top of the mountain, a bus waited for us to make the final journey along mortifyingly steep cedar-studded ravines into the center of Koyasan.

I arrived at my temple, Eko-in, just as an American couple and their teenage son were checking in. A monk showed us where to put our shoes by the broad carved wood entrance. Outfitted with wooden slippers, I walked through a maze of creaky wooden hallways to my room, a small, serene square of space with elaborately painted sliding doors and a large window looking out onto the temple’s central garden. The room came equipped with a TV, a space heater, a telephone, and Wi-Fi. Waiting for me were some small red bean sweets and a kettle full of hot water for tea.

When it was time for dinner, a fleet of several monks arrived, bearing a carafe of hot sake and several lacquerware platforms for the food, each containing a clutter of small bowls. The traditional temple cuisine, called shojin-ryori, incorporates a bright variety of tastes, textures and colors. Tiny cups of vegetable broth and miso soup flocked around plates of delicate tempura squash, lotus root and shiso leaves. A pot of slightly bland but hearty cabbage and mushroom udon sat over a little flame. My favorite dish was one that Koyasan is famous for: a savory tofu-like pudding called goma dofu, made from ground sesame and arrowroot flour.

Once it was dark, I slipped out of my room and down to the main entrance of the temple to retrieve my shoes and join the nighttime tour of Okunoin Cemetery. An English-speaking monk led a group of about 20 guests from Eko-in and some of the surrounding temples through the lantern-lit paths of Japan’s largest cemetery, pointing out the moss-covered tombs of important national figures, including the inventor of Kabuki and the founder of Panasonic. Since Buddhism values all forms of life, our guide explained, not all of the graves belonged to human beings; the writing on one of them translated essentially to “R.I.P. Ants.” In the 600-year-old cedars overhead, we could hear the chirps and squeaks of flying squirrels rippling through the brisk air.

In the early morning, before breakfast was served, guests of the temple were invited to attend morning prayer and a daily fire ceremony. The printed schedule left in our room requested that visitors not use flash photography and issued a stern warning: “The morning service and fire ritual are NOT A TOURIST SHOW, monks must do them every day to show daily appreciation to Buddhist saints.”",Seeking Solitude in Japan’s Mountain Monasteries,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/travel/japan-monastery-koyasan.html

With Republicans in full control of Congress, there is no prospect in the near term that the president might be impeached. Even if Democrats pull off the unlikely feat of winning the House and Senate next year, it is unclear party leaders would be inclined to try to drive Mr. Trump from the White House.

Congress can only remove the president with a vote by two-thirds of the Senate. The Constitution specifies that a president can be impeached for “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors,” though in practice there are widely divergent views on what represents an impeachable offense.

A handful of Democrats in Washington have backed proposals to eject Mr. Trump, including an impeachment resolution unveiled by Representative Al Green of Texas, and opinion polls have found considerable support for impeachment among Democratic voters.

But Democratic leaders have mainly focused on attacking Mr. Trump’s policy agenda; they have urged rank-and-file liberal activists to hold off on talk of impeachment while the gravest investigations into Mr. Trump’s conduct run their course.

Some party strategists are also concerned that putting impeachment on the ballot in 2018 could backfire, because so many Democratic senators are seeking re-election in states Mr. Trump won.

But Mr. Steyer, 60, may not be an easy figure for Democrats to ignore: He was the single biggest liberal donor in the last two federal elections, making climate change his signature issue and insisting that Democrats support action to curb carbon emissions.

Though Mr. Steyer did not mention Ms. Feinstein by name, his letter appeared to allude several times to deferential comments Ms. Feinstein made about Mr. Trump in August, when she counseled “patience” to restive Democrats and suggested Mr. Trump could change to become “a good president.”

“It is clear for all to see that there is zero reason to believe ‘he can be a good president,’” Mr. Steyer wrote in his letter.

A national opinion poll published in August, by the Public Religion Research Institute, found that impeaching Mr. Trump was a minority position, but a popular one among Democratic voters. About 7 in 10 Democrats said Mr. Trump deserved impeachment, while 40 percent of Americans in general took the same view.

Tuesday’s report, the Australian Cyber Security Center Threat Report, noted that 734 private-sector systems of “national interest” were affected by cyberattacks last year.

“Certain companies take cybersecurity quite seriously,” said Alana Maurushat, academic co-director of the Cyberspace Law and Policy Center at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. “But you have key industries to Australia who — while there may not be the same media coverage — you know through internal sources are being breached. Our mining industry has notoriously been rumored to have been breached by competitors.”

Ms. Maurushat said that Australia as a whole was not far behind the rest of the developed world’s level of cybersecurity, but emphasized concerns about its private sector.

“The crazy thing about this is that they don’t even know that they’ve been breached,” she said. “There are certain breaches that occur, and there are studies on this, where sometimes someone would be on your system for almost a year, without the breach even being noticed. That’s the stuff that keeps me up at night.”

A cybersecurity report released this year by Telstra, the country’s dominant telecommunications company, said that 59 percent of surveyed companies in Australia had detected a security breach on at least a monthly basis. A similar number reported experiencing at least one ransomware attack. Over half of Australian organizations that came under such an attack paid the ransom, the report said.

Ms. Maurushat said that, in part, Australia’s private-sector cybersecurity was lacking because of an acute shortage of skilled workers.

The government report also noted “extensive” state-sponsored activity against Australia’s government, saying that its defense contractors continued to be targeted by foreign nations’ cyberespionage efforts.

At a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Tehan said that the government was pivoting toward offensive capabilities to “prevent and shut down safe havens for offshore cybercriminals.”

Last year, the Australian government blamed foreign actors for an attack on its online census portal.

“The whole census thing — that’s an I.B.M. mistake,” Ms. Maurushat said, referring to the technology company’s contracting role in the census. “That’s not a government mistake, that’s an industry mistake, from a company you wouldn’t expect to make those errors.”

In a settlement over the census problems, I.B.M. paid the government about 30 million Australian dollars, or about $23 million.

Not unlike vaccines and herd immunity, Ms. Maurushat said, a government’s cybersecurity is only as strong as those it chooses to share its data with.

When asked whether Australia’s lagging digital infrastructure and poor internet speeds might have a detrimental effect on its security, Ms. Maurushat said that a beleaguered attempt to speed up Australia’s internet, the National Broadband Network initiative, may prove to be a silver lining.

“It’s the opposite,” she said, adding that hackers rely on fast internet speeds. “So in some ways, if the N.B.N. is a disaster, it might be better for us.”",Australian Cybersecurity Report Shows Gaps in Private Companies’ Defenses,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/world/australia/cybersecurity-data-breach.html

But you’ll want to book before you hit about 10 days out from Christmas Day, Mr. Surry said.

“Based on Hopper’s historical data, the best time to book Christmas flights is about 83 days before departure, which is the first week of October. Prices begin rising by about $4 per day around Thanksgiving, and then by about $7 per day in the final two weeks,” Mr. Surry said.

Does It Matter Which Day I Book?

There are several different theories about which day of the week, and time of day, has the most affordable fares. For example, Priceline.com data shows that the cheapest day of the week to purchase is Friday, despite the majority of tickets being purchased on a Tuesday.

But there might not be a whole lot to gain from focusing on the day of the week.

“Pricing is extremely nuanced,” Mr. Surry said. “Everyone wants a golden rule about when to buy, but it really depends on your route, dates and demand.”

“If you have flexibility, in general it will pay to extend your trip,” Mr. Surry said.

Regarding Thanksgiving, the most expensive day to depart is the Wednesday before, which should not come as a surprise as it’s also one of the busiest travel days of the year. But if you are able to leave on the Monday or the Thursday of that week you can save around $50 on the first leg of your trip. The same goes for your return day. The busiest and most expensive day to come back is Sunday. But you can save around $160 by returning on Wednesday, Nov. 29, instead, Mr. Surry said.

For Christmas this year, the cheapest days to depart are Saturday, Dec. 16, or Tuesday, Dec. 19, which can save you about $110 compared to traveling on the busiest day, which is Friday, Dec. 22. The most popular return day is New Year’s Day, and returning on Thursday, Jan. 4, instead could save you around $100, according to Hopper’s data.

Does It Matter Where I’m Going?

Yes, data for domestic flights show that some destination cities are more expensive to travel to than others, which can be tied to demand.

Priceline.com found that the most popular travel route for both Thanksgiving and Christmas is New York City to Florida (Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando). For Christmas travel, these destination cities are also among the ones with the highest “holiday premium,” as Hopper terms it, meaning the greatest increase in price compared to non-holiday travel.

No matter where you are traveling from for the Christmas holiday, you can expect to pay up to 82 percent more for a fare to Miami ($383 instead of $211), according to Hopper. Fort Lauderdale and Orlando see spikes of over 60 percent.

For Thanksgiving, you can expect to spend 40 percent more than usual for trips to Denver and Boston.

John Robinson, a spokesman for the prison, said in a statement that an 11-year-old military policy permitting the involuntary feeding of hunger-striking detainees remained in effect.
“In some instances in the past, attempts to provide detainees who claimed that they were on hunger strike with a measure of dignity through voluntary enteral feedings unintentionally created a situation that potentially encouraged future hunger strikes,” he said.

The client also told him that other protesters were no longer being force-fed.

Another prisoner on a lengthy hunger strike — who was hospitalized in July, though he eats a small amount of solid food each day to accompany pain medication — told his lawyer on Sept. 21 that a prison official told him a day earlier that he would not be forcibly tube-fed, either, according to the lawyer, Pardiss Kebriaei of the Center for Constitutional Rights.

A fifth detainee whom other prisoners have identified as a hunger striker does not have a lawyer.

Navy Capt. John Robinson, a spokesman for the prison, said in a statement that an 11-year-old military policy permitting the involuntary feeding of hunger-striking detainees remained in effect. If medical officials decided tube-feeding was required to prevent death or serious self-harm, he said, “we would involuntarily enterally feed a detainee,” using the military’s preferred term for tube-feeding.

He declined to discuss specific cases. But Captain Robinson also said that the military had not “involuntarily enterally fed a detainee in well over a year.” He would not elaborate on what it would mean to be voluntarily tube-fed, but Ms. Kebriaei said it was most likely a reference to detainees who passively submitted to the procedure rather than fighting guards.

Maj. Ben Sakrisson, a Pentagon spokesman, said that prison officials had decided to start to more rigorously enforce existing policy standards for what health conditions were sufficient to prompt force-feeding.

“In some instances in the past, attempts to provide detainees who claimed that they were on hunger strike with a measure of dignity through voluntary enteral feedings unintentionally created a situation that potentially encouraged future hunger strikes,” he said. “As a result, the pre-existing standard of medical necessity will be enforced in the future.”

But Mr. Remes interpreted the move as a new strategy to induce hunger strikers to stop. He accused the military of “playing chicken” by withholding both force-feeding and medical care until the detainee was in danger of organ damage or even death.

“The theory is that a detainee won’t want to reach that point and so will abandon his hunger strike,” he said. “Who will blink first?”

Any such hardening of the government’s approach could put the prisoners’ lawyers in an awkward position. Though they say they do not want their clients to die, many have also argued that force-feeding amounts to torture and violates medical ethics. For now, the three lawyers said they are seeking independent medical evaluations of their clients.

Mr. Remes said his client was protesting because he wanted the military to permit him to talk to his family twice a month rather than once. Ms. Kebriaei said her client was in a general state of despair and might be suffering from an untreated illness. Mr. Smith said his clients were protesting because they wanted to be given trials or released.

In the case of another detainee, one who has received a rare trial, the Supreme Court declined on Tuesday to hear an appeal. The detainee, Ali Hamza al-Bahlul, is a Yemeni who made a propaganda video for Al Qaeda about the bombing of the American destroyer Cole in 2000 and helped administer loyalty oaths and drafted martyrdom wills for several Sept. 11 hijackers.

Mr. Bahlul, who boycotted his 2008 trial before a commission, was convicted, among other things, of conspiring to commit acts of terrorism. His appeal raised the question of whether a conspiracy charge, which is widely used in civilian court but is not a recognized international war crime, may be properly brought in a military commission.

The full United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a fractured decision last year that upheld Mr. Bahlul’s conviction but provided no answer to the question of whether military prosecutors may bring conspiracy charges in other cases. The Supreme Court’s demurral means that issue remains unresolved.

Also this week, military officials are preparing for a sentencing hearing for a Saudi detainee, Ahmed Muhammed Haza al-Darbi, who in February 2014 pleaded guilty before a commission. His deal included an agreement that after February 2018, he could serve the remainder of his sentence in Saudi Arabia.","Military Is Waiting Longer Before Force-Feeding Hunger Strikers, Detainees Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/us/politics/guantanamo-hunger-strikes-force-feeding.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

No one was killed. Injured victims have testified before the jury, describing injuries that have mostly healed. Not so for the Dumpster. Dumpsters never heal.

Outside the jury’s presence, lawyers on both sides have argued over the Dumpster for days. Mr. Rahimi’s legal team said in an Oct. 2 letter to the court that it is irrelevant to the case and it is “unduly prejudicial, and clearly a play for press.”

Judge Richard M. Berman allowed the Dumpster in the room, covered until he made his final ruling. That happened Thursday morning, when he said he would allow the Dumpster to be shown to the jury.

He wanted to know how the heavy Dumpster would be handled. More arguments followed, essentially over stagecraft. “I intend to walk up to the Dumpster, lift the cover off,” explained Shawn G. Crowley, a prosecutor. Then she and others who were “stronger” would push it before the jury.

Defense lawyers were unhappy. “We’re at a complete loss as to why this is necessary,” Matthew Larsen, part of that team, countered. He asked that the thing at least be uncovered before the trial resumed for the day instead of “some big dramatic” unveiling before jurors.

Judge Berman said no: “I get to be the director of the courtroom, and we’re going to do it that way.”

Showtime! Jurors took their seats and a detective on the witness stand identified the Dumpster in a photograph. The moment had arrived. Ms. Crowley grasped the white blanket and pulled.

“Do you recognize this?” she asked.

“Yes,” the detective said. “That’s the Dumpster.”

It rested on a cart. Prosecutors dragged it toward the jury. Judge Berman told jurors they were welcome to stand for a closer look, and they did, craning their necks.

The Dumpster lived up to the hype. It stood waist-high, bent and broken. The explosion had ripped through its center, flaying its sides outward like the petals of a dirty flower.

But experts already credit with Mr. Xi with making significant progress in creating a leaner, more modern, more professional force.","Since coming to power in 2012, Mr. Xi has used a crackdown on corruption to purge commanders deemed corrupt or disloyal. The moves have given Mr. Xi, whose father was an important figure in China’s revolutionary army, a degree of authority over the People’s Liberation Army that had eluded previous civilian leaders.

Mr. Xi “has been able to take political control of the military to an extent that exceeds what Mao and Deng have done,” said Tai Ming Cheung, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies China’s defense forces. “He has already demonstrated ahead of the congress his ability to elevate key commanders that are close to him.”

The abrupt disappearance of the two generals before the congress underlined how ruthlessly Mr. Xi was willing to act. He is now poised to cement his control by installing a new cohort of civilian and military leaders loyal to him and his vision for the Chinese military.

Before his abrupt removal, General Fang, 66, had seemed positioned for promotion at the congress. He had recently laid out China’s stance on North Korea to his visiting American counterpart and was enforcing Mr. Xi’s overhaul. He even accompanied Mr. Xi to Florida in April for a summit meeting with President Trump at his golf resort in Palm Beach.

General Fang, however, seems to have fallen afoul of Mr. Xi, for reasons that are not fully apparent. He has been put under investigation on suspicion of abuses of office, two former officials in Beijing said, confirming reports that first appeared in several overseas news outlets. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing recrimination for discussing internal affairs. One said General Zhang, 66, was also under investigation.

They are not the first commanders purged under Mr. Xi. There have been trials of dozens of high-ranking officers, including the two highest-ranking generals ever toppled for corruption in modern China: Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou, two former vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission, the party committee that commands China’s armed forces.

“Strong Military,” an eight-part documentary series shown on Chinese television in recent weeks, said that Mr. Xi had to act urgently because bribery and embezzlement in the top ranks had corroded morale and threatened battle-readiness in the armed forces.

One episode showed the confessions of Generals Guo and Xu as well as a luxurious compound that another fallen general had turned into his private playground.

“The problems of corruption and work style in the armed forces weren’t just harming the image of the military, they were badly damaging morale in the ranks,” Wan Minggui, a commissar in the Chinese military, says in the documentary. “It really had reached the point where something had to be done.”

For Mr. Xi, gaining firmer control of the military could help ensure his grip on power during his second terms as party leader and president, which he is all but certain to receive at this month’s party congress and a session of China’s legislature next year.

It could also be a way for Mr. Xi to extend his influence beyond a second term. Two predecessors, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, wielded influence after retiring from other official posts by staying in charge of the Central Military Commission, which Mr. Xi now leads.

The party congress, scheduled to open Oct. 18, could fill the 11-member commission with younger commanders loyal to Mr. Xi or shrink the size of the commission to enhance his say. Separately, dozens of other rising military officers are likely to be promoted to the Central Committee, the party’s highest organ, whose some 200 voting members oversee governance of the entire nation, not just the military.

“The control of the military is an ironclad insurance policy for Xi,” said Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in California who studies Chinese politics. “If Xi has complete control of the military, nobody dares lift a finger.”

Mr. Xi’s reshuffling of the military leadership is also aimed at accelerating the changes he has sought in the People’s Liberation Army, which, for all its size and influence, had become sclerotic and inward-looking.

Since late 2015, Mr. Xi has reorganized the army to weaken the traditional land forces and shift more resources to the technology-dependent naval, air and missile forces. Seven military regions — the heart of the old arm-focused system — were replaced with five new theater commands, and the army is cutting 300,000 enlisted soldiers and officers, paring the military to two million personnel.

Mr. Xi wants to create an integrated armed forces that can enforce China’s claims to disputed islands in the East and South China Seas, offset American influence and protect China’s growing interests as far away as Africa, Latin America and the polar regions.

It is a military that, while not yet a rival to the United States, could soon be one.

“China’s military modernization is targeting capabilities with the potential to degrade core U.S. military-technological advantages,” the Pentagon’s annual report to Congress on China’s military abilities asserted.

China’s military spending, officially $144 billion in 2016, still lags far behind the more than $600 billion spent last year by the United States. China, though, spends nearly three times as much as Russia, and its annual defense budgets are expected to continue to grow 7 percent per year on average, the report said.

“If I look out to 2025, and I look at the demographics and the economic situation, I think China probably poses the greatest threat to our nation,” Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified at his Senate reconfirmation hearing.

The biggest challenges to Mr. Xi’s military modernization may involve updating attitudes as well as technology. It could take years for new commanders to overcome rivalries and learn to operate jointly in the fog of war. But experts already credit with Mr. Xi with making significant progress in creating a leaner, more modern, more professional force.

“No one had the political mojo to pull it off until Xi Jinping, and Xi Jinping only had an anticorruption campaign to use as a hammer,” said James Mulvenon, a specialist on China’s military at SOS International, a firm that provides security services and advice. “The P.L.A. has known that they have to go to a joint force structure and get rid of the military regions for 25 years, but they had not been able to generate the political will to be able to do that.

Arrests of civil rights leaders and setbacks during the movement also provide another important free speech lesson.","Based on that decision, students are allowed to express themselves freely unless what they say causes a “substantial disruption” of the school environment or interferes with the rights of others.

At Evanston Township High School in Illinois, actions during the national anthem became a schoolwide discussion after their girls’ volleyball team collectively knelt at a game a few weeks ago, the school superintendent Eric Witherspoon said. As school band members worked through their own choices later that week, Mr. Witherspoon assured the students and parents that non-disruptive protests would not be punished, and that the school considered kneeling an allowed free speech demonstration.

But he encouraged students to ask themselves, “Are they doing something as a copycat or are they doing something as a purpose?” In the end about half the band knelt during the anthem, Mr. Witherspoon said.

Focus on Law, Not Politics

Frame the discussion from a constitutional perspective rather than a political one, said Jeffrey Rosen, president and chief executive of the nonpartisan National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.

“Don’t debate whether or not people should salute the flag or should kneel or stand during the national anthem,” Mr. Rosen said, suggesting parents instead focus on what the free speech clause of the First Amendment allows people to do.

Despite contentious debate on how free speech rights are utilized, Mr. Rosen said, both conservative and liberal scholars generally agree on what free speech is under the law, including that United States citizens acting peacefully can express their opinions, even unpopular or offensive ones, without interference from the government. That includes protection for so-called “hate speech” that attacks someone’s race, religion or sexual orientation.

Make It Relatable

It’s important that students understand how far free speech rights extend in their own world, and that there are limits to what is covered. “The government can’t limit your free expression; your parents can,” and so can your school, said Barbara McCormack, the vice president of education at the Newseum in Washington, which educates thousands of students each year on the First Amendment.

Even though Americans are free to hold up protest signs on the National Mall criticizing a new law, public schools can limit speech they deem disruptive, and private schools have even more say on what their students can do.

Educators also suggest explaining that free speech rights do not allow words or actions that would lead to immediate harm. For many children, “harm” in the realm of free speech is confusing. “They get into feelings, so we have to separate those,” Ms. McCormack said. Educators should explain, she said, that saying, “Susie is ugly,” is not nice, but it’s not banned under the Constitution. Instead, to be prohibited, speech must be likely to incite immediate harm, like “We don’t like redheads. Here’s one now — let’s get them,” Ms. McCormack said. Individual states’ anti-bullying laws may help clarify what is considered over the line.

To explain free speech in action, parents can use examples of protest movements historically, perhaps with events children are already somewhat familiar with, like Rosa Parks’s refusal to give up her seat on the bus or Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech.

Arrests of civil rights leaders and setbacks during the movement also provide another important free speech lesson. “It’s not always smooth sailing and a straight trajectory to your change,” Ms. McCormack said, and it teaches students that, “Sometimes your rights are violated, even when you’re trying to exercise them.”

Talk About Speaking Up

Conversations about free speech can offer opportunities to encourage children to think of what they care about and when they might want to speak up. The Newseum asks middle school students to choose any subject important to them, be it loving their own curly hair or protecting animals, and have them write messages about it on a label for a water bottle or a sticker for their iPhone case.

It can be helpful to highlight other activities children can participate in outside of school, like joining local demonstrations or marches, writing letters to their lawmakers, and volunteering their time or raising money to support causes they care about.

Schools’ anti-bullying policies can be an entry point for discussing how children might speak up, said Jane Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota.

It’s also hard to reconcile ESPN’s decision to suspend Jemele Hill for not quite calling for a boycott with the outspokenness that ESPN prizes in anchors who are not black women, who say things much more offensive and only get a slap on the wrist.

Suspending Jemele Hill is the sort of desperate move ESPN undoubtedly hopes might attract more viewers, much like the network’s sudden decision not to allow an Asian-American broadcaster named Robert Lee to call a college-football game last August. ESPN’s subscriber base dropped to 87 million households in September from a high of 100.1 million in 2011, and the network has laid off more than 100 people this year in addition to 300 workers in October 2015.

Even though 51 percent of Americans believe the N.F.L. protests are appropriate, we are apparently supposed to give the network a high-five for suspending an anchor who agrees with us because the network is awkwardly attempting to promote a form of so-called patriotism that would require many of us to decide that our own lives aren’t worth prizing.

It’s been hard to watch the N.F.L. this season. Like a lot of fans, I’m worried the league isn’t sufficiently dedicated to treating concussions and addressing domestic violence. And for me, a black woman, these worries have been compounded by the league’s grab bag of positions on the players’ police brutality protests, from mild support to mild disapproval. A surprisingly high percentage of my willingness to continue to watch the game hangs on whether the league will allow protests.

But Jerry Jones’s comments are the sort that may move the league toward a place where police brutality protests are not allowed, one where African-Americans could be asked to watch a sport that is determined to remind us that our opinions on whether we should be killed while unarmed are not valued. And somehow ESPN is determined to make this situation worse by showing that a black anchor is just as restricted in exercising her free speech rights as the players she covers.

While I realize that neither professional sports leagues nor national television networks are likely to be the forces leading the anti-police-brutality revolution, I am quietly happy whenever anyone in a position of power decides to say something that might stop someone somewhere from killing a person who looks like me.

Are Jasper’s outings encroaching on their security and freedom? Are his feline victims entitled to relief?

Among philosophers of animal welfare, the fur flies between those who think animals have rights and those who think they don’t. Skeptics say it makes no sense to talk about animal rights for the same reason it makes no sense to hold Jasper morally responsible for his actions. (Because he has no notion that what he’s doing is bad, he’s not a moral agent in any relevant sense.) If animals don’t have rights, you might adopt another approach, in which you simply weigh the pleasure that Jasper takes and gives in his outings against the suffering of the cats he bullies. This “utilitarian” calculation takes no account of rights or duties (just as rights-based theories tend to ignore the pleasure-minus-pain formulas of the utilitarians). But it’s sensitive to the empirical facts.

Cats, especially males, are prone to be aggressive with one another, and the resulting screams sound pretty awful. It’s possible to exaggerate the amount of suffering involved. The danger posed by serious catfights comes from the fact that deep wounds are one of the principal ways that feline leukemia and immunodeficiency disease are transmitted. You suggest, though, that the problem is assault rather than battery — that Jasper is the kind of bully whose hiss is worse than his bite. So it may be that, on balance, letting him go about his business is better than shutting him indoors.

In short, there’s no simple decision procedure here. But then philosophers have long been confounded by cats. Consider the person who originated utilitarianism, the calculus of pleasure and pain that has done so much to advance animal welfare — namely, the Enlightenment philosopher Jeremy Bentham. He taught a cat to eat macaroni at his table (and rewarded him with a doctorate), but he didn’t have much luck in curbing these creatures’ bad habits. Of another of his cats, Bentham declared, “His moral qualities were most despotic — his intellectual extraordinary: But he was a universal nuisance.”

I’m an undergraduate researcher at a center focused on policy work. Another undergrad and I were hired to assist with administrative and research-based tasks; half our stipend was paid before we started, and the other half is to be paid after our last day. We committed to working 30 hours a week and are expected to sign in and out. I noticed that my co-worker was spending significantly less time at the office than I was, but I shrugged it off. Then I saw that he was lying about his hours. These lies went beyond the occasional generous estimate — arriving at 10:10 but writing 10:00 on the sign-in sheet. He said he spent two whole days at the center when he wasn’t even there. If I mention this to our boss, I risk coming off as spiteful. However, I’m troubled by the fact that I’m putting in more work, yet we get equal credit. And watching him lie about his hours without consequence doesn’t make me want to sit in a cubicle for 30 hours a week. What should I do? Name Withheld

Clearly, supervision at your job is lax, and your sluggard classmate is taking advantage of that. Both the dishonesty and the breach of the employment terms are wrong. And there are good reasons to discourage bad behavior in others. What evolutionary psychologists call “altruistic punishment,” in which you penalize someone in a way that offers no direct advantage to you, is part of a package of psychological traits that ensures the good of the social group. This explains why we might feel the urge to inflict such punishment; but it’s also true that, with some caveats, it’s often a good thing to do. It might even help your colleague in his career to know there are penalties for misbehavior.

You’re right, though, that others may judge your motives negatively. I might, too. Your response is focused on what the wrongdoer’s behavior means for you. It’s that he’s being unfair to you that distresses you, not that he’s dishonest and unfair to your employer. And you’re worried that his getting away with it will reduce your motivation, which suggests that you don’t think that doing what you committed to do is sufficient motivation. Neither of these sentiments reflects especially well on you. But it’s just another fact of our psychology that when the rewards are perceived to be unfair, our commitment to a common enterprise can be undermined. I’d have a better view of you, though, if you did the right thing for the right reason. People, unlike cats, are moral agents.

This is where Alan Jacobs’s absolutely splendid forthcoming book “How to Think” comes in. If Thaler’s work is essential for understanding how the market can go astray, Jacobs’s emphasis on the relational nature of thinking is essential for understanding why there is so much bad thinking in political life right now.

Jacobs makes good use of C. S. Lewis’s concept of the Inner Ring. In every setting — a school, a company or a society — there is an official hierarchy. But there may also be a separate prestige hierarchy, where the cool kids are. They are the Inner Ring.

There are always going to be people who desperately want to get into the Inner Ring and will cut all sorts of intellectual corners to be accepted. As Lewis put it, “The passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things.”

People will, for example, identify and attack what Jacobs calls the Repugnant Cultural Other — the group that is opposed to the Inner Ring, which must be assaulted to establish membership in it.

Other people will resent the Inner Ring, and they will cut all sorts of intellectual corners in order to show their resentment. These people are quick to use combat metaphors when they talk about thinking (he shot down my argument, your claims are indefensible). These people will adopt shared vague slurs like “cuckservative” or “whitesplaining” that signal to the others in the outsider groups that they are attacking the ring, even though these slurs are usually impediments to thought.

Jacobs notices that when somebody uses “in other words” to summarize another’s argument, what follows is almost invariably a ridiculous caricature of that argument, in order to win favor with the team. David Foster Wallace once called such people Snoots. Their motto is, “We Are the Few, the Proud, the More or Less Constantly Appalled at Everyone Else.”

Jacobs nicely shows how our thinking processes emerge from emotional life and moral character. If your heart and soul are twisted, your response to the world will be, too. He argues that by diagnosing our own ills, we can begin to combat them. And certainly I can think of individual beacons of intellectual honesty today: George Packer, Tyler Cowen, Scott Alexander and Caitlin Flanagan, among many.

But I’d say that if social life can get us into trouble, social life can get us out. After all, think of how you really persuade people. Do you do it by writing thoughtful essays that carefully marshal facts? That works some of the time. But the real way to persuade people is to create an attractive community that people want to join. If you do that, they’ll bend their opinions to yours. If you want people to be reasonable, create groups where it’s cool to be reasonable.

Jacobs mentions that at the Yale Political Union members are admired if they can point to a time when a debate totally changed their mind on something. That means they take evidence seriously; that means they can enter into another’s mind-set. It means they treat debate as a learning exercise and not just as a means to victory.

How many public institutions celebrate these virtues? The U.S. Senate? Most TV talk shows? Even the universities?

The first big test for Senate Republicans and their two-seat majority comes next week, when they will try to advance a budget that sets the parameters for a tax bill and establishes a procedural framework to approve it with a simple majority. The House last week narrowly passed its version of a budget, but not before 18 Republicans defected.

A tax overhaul would be nearly impossible to achieve if the budget fails, and Senate leaders don’t have the kind of cushion that their House counterparts had. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, has already indicated that he could oppose the spending plan. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has clashed with the president and helped kill the health care repeal, is also considered a question mark.

That means Republicans cannot spare another vote.

That’s where the increasingly toxic relationship between Mr. Trump and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee comes into play. Mr. Corker is a senior Republican member on the Budget Committee who had already expressed misgivings about the tax plan and the potential for higher federal deficits. Losing his vote could be fatal.

“Defeating the budget is dishing more punishment on your colleagues than it is on the president,” said Neil Bradley, senior vice president at the chamber and a former top Republican official in the House.

Acutely aware of the tightrope he is walking, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, wrote an op-ed for NBC News encouraging Democrats interested in cutting taxes to put aside their issues with the president and join Republicans. It is unlikely to have much effect on the usually party-line budget vote, but Republicans know their job would be much easier if they could peel off just one or two centrist Democrats facing re-election next year.

Any significant rewrite of the tax code is extremely difficult — a political truth underscored by the fact that the last major overhaul was in 1986. Republicans concede that there are plenty of disagreements of the magnitude that could easily scuttle a proposal.

But they argue that Republicans are in such a politically perilous position because of their lack of accomplishment thus far that lawmakers — and the White House — are going to have to overlook their differences and come together on a plan. Otherwise they’ll be staring into the abyss.

“Members on both sides of the Capitol are going to have to be flexible and swallow features that may give them political indigestion in order to get a bill,” said Bob Stevenson, a Republican strategist and former senior Senate aide who was on Capitol Hill for the last tax overhaul. “But as Ben Franklin said, ‘You hang together or hang separately.’”

Mr. Bradley, the chamber official, said he agreed that in a more conventional political environment, existing divisions among Republicans could be sufficient to kill a tax bill. “But there is such a growing realization that failure is not an option that they will be able to overcome a lot of these policy and political conflicts,” he said.

Mr. Bradley notes that Republicans might not be the only ones to take a hit if the tax-cut push collapses. He said the death knell for tax revisions would cause a worrisome domestic economic disruption as well.

As they fret about the outlook for tax cuts, Republicans also understand that eventual success on a tax plan could ease a lot of the criticism they have come under for their legislative failures and demonstrate they have the capacity to run Washington.

“This is not one that can get left on the cutting room floor,” said Josh Holmes, a communications adviser with close ties to Mr. McConnell. “It has become a barometer of whether Republicans can govern under Trump’s leadership.”

So it began, and the daily gatherings have continued ever since.

The group sessions on the field are not long — anywhere from five to 10 minutes — but they are full of life and laughter. After each of his teammates spoke in the circle the other day, La Stella offered a hug. First baseman Anthony Rizzo had his arms wrapped around two teammates during Saturday’s gathering. And that day, as Tekchandani entered the circle, he was welcomed with a round of applause.

“It helps a lot,” catcher Willson Contreras said of the bonding. “It keep us together as a family, and happy together, despite being in a pressure-filled situation in the playoffs.”

“It’s like 10 minutes of fun,” Buss said.

Buss, who sports a beer belly and a mohawk, is immensely popular among Cubs players. In spring training, he is famous for the outrageous outfits he wears as he presides over daily conditioning. But there seems to be a method to his madness.

“Even though he’s funny and comes off as a goofball, he’s one of the smartest guys we’ve got in here,” outfielder Albert Almora Jr. said. “If he’s doing something, it’s for a purpose.”

Buss is modest about what impact his feel-good exercises may be having on the team’s fortunes. Feeling good does not guarantee a player will whack a really good curveball for a hit. “I don’t know how much that plays into it,’’ he said of the connection between what he does on the field with the players and what they do when the game begins.

But the players — Buss’s players really — beg to differ. “The more positive things in the clubhouse, the better the results,” Contreras said.

Bryant noted that even though the pregame sessions are a daily phenomenon, those taking part do not run out of things to mention. It is easy, he said, to always find something nice to say about the person standing in the middle of the circle, whether it be about their role as a teammate or friend or co-worker or parent.

“It definitely gets everyone’s confidence up,’’ Russell said. “To hear nice things said about you from guys that are professionals and have been for a long time, it definitely makes you happy.”",The Cubs’ Secret to Success?

The time scale is the blink of an eye, geologically speaking. It’s even shorter than a previous study that found that another ancient supervolcano beneath California’s Long Valley caldera awoke hundreds of years before its eruption. As such, scientists are just now starting to realize that the conditions that lead to supereruptions might emerge within a human lifetime.

“It’s shocking how little time is required to take a volcanic system from being quiet and sitting there to the edge of an eruption,” said Ms. Shamloo, though she warned that there’s more work to do before scientists can verify a precise time scale.

Dr. Kari Cooper, a geochemist at the University of California, Davis who was not involved in the research, said Ms. Shamloo and Dr. Till’s research offered more insights into the time frames of supereruptions, although she is not yet convinced that scientists can pin down the precise trigger of the last Yellowstone event. Geologists must now figure out what kick-starts the rapid movements leading up to supereruptions.

“It’s one thing to think about this slow gradual buildup — it’s another thing to think about how you mobilize 1,000 cubic kilometers of magma in a decade,” she said.

As the research advances, scientists hope they will be able to spot future supereruptions in the making. The odds of Yellowstone, or any other supervolcano, erupting anytime soon are small. But understanding the largest eruptions can only help scientists better understand, and therefore forecast, the entire spectrum of volcanic eruptions — something that Dr. Cooper thinks will be possible in a matter of decades.",A Surprise From the Supervolcano Under Yellowstone,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/science/yellowstone-volcano-eruption.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Some entrepreneurs said his breakneck investing pace with the Vision Fund was unlikely to slow.","What Mr. Son laid out for Mr. Gundersen helps explain why SoftBank and its Vision Fund have invested billions of dollars in a seemingly random sample of more than two dozen companies since the fund was announced. The investments span robotics software start-ups like Brain Corp and the indoor farming business Plenty, as well as more prominent companies like the business software maker Slack. The deals have run the gamut from smaller investments in start-ups to larger deals with public companies.

Yet the companies all have something in common: They are involved in collecting enormous amounts of data, which are crucial to creating the brains for the machines that, in the future, will do more of our jobs and creating tools that allow people to better coexist.

Most recently, SoftBank has been involved in a plan to buy nearly a fifth of the existing stock of Uber, the world’s biggest ride-hailing company and one that has changed the transportation industry. SoftBank is aiming to accumulate Uber’s stock through a tender offer that could value the company at a discount to its current valuation of $68.5 billion, according to people briefed on the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were confidential. The tender offer could still fall apart, one of the people said.

If it ends up being completed, Mr. Son would own significant chunks of ride-hailing companies globally because SoftBank already owns stakes in Uber’s rivals like Didi Chuxing in China and Ola in India. Altogether, SoftBank would have a network of companies that gather valuable logistics data and operate large, connected fleets that could work well with self-driving car technology.

“Location data is central and mission critical to the development of the world’s most exciting technologies,” Rajeev Misra, who helps oversee SoftBank’s Vision Fund, said about Mapbox in a statement on Tuesday. He added that the investment was part of SoftBank’s plan to put money into “the foundational infrastructure for the next stage of the Information Revolution.”

SoftBank declined to comment further for this article.

For more than three decades, Mr. Son has consistently made over SoftBank with acquisitions and investments to keep it on the cutting edge. The company began in 1981 as a PC software distributor in Japan and expanded to the United States in 1994 with the acquisition of the PC trade show operator Comdex.

Mr. Son later became the largest shareholder of Yahoo, started Yahoo Japan and, in the last decade, invested in broadband and telecommunications companies — SoftBank agreed to buy the majority of Sprint for $21.6 billion in 2012 — anticipating the need for high-speed connectivity. He has also invested in e-commerce companies, including the Alibaba Group of China and Gilt Groupe, as well as video game businesses like Supercell and media like HuffPost and BuzzFeed.

In a speech last month in New York, Mr. Son declared that in 30 years, there would be as many sentient robots on Earth as humans and that those robots, which he called metal collar workers, would fundamentally change the labor market.

“Every industry that mankind ever defined and created, even agriculture, will be redefined,” Mr. Son said. “Because the tools that we created were inferior to mankind’s brain in the past. Now, the tools have become smarter than mankind ourselves.”

Mr. Son is having many of the same conversations with entrepreneurs these days as he looks to spread investments from the Vision Fund. Many entrepreneurs said Mr. Son’s conversations jumped from philosophical discussions about technology’s impact on humanity to the minutiae of a technical problem.

Mr. Son recently told Matt Barnard, the chief executive of Plenty, that computers were ushering in a revolution in agriculture not seen since the invention of the plow. Mr. Son led a $200 million investment in Plenty in July, part of an effort to make it a global leader in indoor farms. Plenty, which has no farms operating at scale, is now planning to open its first farm, in South San Francisco, by the end of the year.

“I really do like to believe he likes us a lot,” Mr. Barnard said of Mr. Son. “I’d say the thing we have in common with his other investments is that they are all part of some of the largest systems on the planet: energy, transportation, the internet and food.”

Some entrepreneurs travel the globe to spend time with Mr. Son at his palatial home in Woodside, Calif., and his offices in India, San Francisco and Tokyo. The SoftBank chief is known for almost always smiling and speaking slowly. He rarely picks up phone calls, and his email signature includes the whirring fan icon that shows a computer is booting up, or “thinking.”

Many of the entrepreneurs speak of Mr. Son with reverence.

“Only people close to him know how huge his vision is,” said Eugene Izhikevich, the chief executive of Brain Corp, a company based in San Diego that makes the software that controls autonomous robots.

Mr. Son’s engineers stumbled on Brain Corp when they were looking for self-driving car technology. Mr. Izhikevich was soon seated across from Mr. Son, talking about robotics as well as how Britain operated 200 years ago when the landed gentry did not work, but came up with new inventions and business improvements.

Like many other entrepreneurs, Mr. Izhikevich said SoftBank moved “scary fast” to sew up its investment. Mr. Son’s team swarmed Brain Corp’s businesses and spent hundreds of hours on due diligence, wrapping up in a few months.

Unlike other investors, Mr. Son, who is already talking about a second Vision Fund, does not insert himself into the day-to-day operations of most of the companies he has invested in. His Sprint deal has yet to pan out and may be dependent on merging with another company. When other investments have lagged, as did his investment in Snapdeal, an online retailer in India, he has invested in competitors, leading a $2.5 billion investment into Flipkart, a rival Indian e-commerce company.

Some entrepreneurs said his breakneck investing pace with the Vision Fund was unlikely to slow.

“Masa is in a hurry,” said Vijay Sharma, the chief executive of Indian digital payments start-up Paytm, which SoftBank put $1.4 billion into in May. “He sees this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity where everything we touch can become a market, where we’re at the opening up of a new industrial revolution.”",Masayoshi Son’s Grand Plan for SoftBank’s $100 Billion Vision Fund,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/technology/masayoshi-son-softbank-vision-fund.html

Mr. Erdogan said on Tuesday that Gulen followers had infiltrated the American Consulate in Istanbul, and he questioned why the United States had tolerated them.
“If these agents did not infiltrate the American Consulate, then who put them there?
Regarding the legal cases against the United States Consulate employees, he said: “So what?
He told party members that around 80 percent of Turkish people do not like the United States.","“Ambassador Bass has our full backing, not only here at the State Department but also at the White House as well,” said Heather Nauert, the department spokeswoman.

The dispute began on Sunday after a Turkish employee of the United States Consulate in Istanbul was arrested and accused of having links to Fethullah Gulen, the Islamist cleric accused by the Turkish government of orchestrating a failed coup last year.

The consulate employee was the second to be detained this year. A third is being sought, and the police have questioned his family members, according to Turkish news reports.

The American Embassy dismissed the charges as baseless, and in response temporarily stopped issuing visas to Turkish citizens to travel to the United States while it assessed Turkey’s commitment to the security of American facilities and personnel.

Within hours, the Turkish Foreign Ministry announced similar measures in the United States, adding that the suspension included electronic visas and visas bought at the border, the way most tourists and other short-term visitors enter the country.

On Tuesday, Turkey seemed to have suspended its electronic visa service for Americans. But officials said by early afternoon that no Americans had been turned back since none had arrived without visas.

The Turkish government has been conducting a widespread crackdown under a state of emergency since the coup attempt in July 2016, arresting more than 50,000 people and suspending 150,000 for alleged links to the Gulen movement. It has also insisted on the need for wide-ranging investigations and purges to remove coup plotters and Gulen supporters from government institutions.

Military officers, politicians, journalists, academics and government workers have been caught up in the broad sweep, as well as several dozen foreign citizens, including 11 Americans.

Western officials have accused Mr. Erdogan of detaining foreign citizens as hostages or bargaining chips in order to secure the extradition of Mr. Gulen, who has been in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since the early 1990s.

Political analysts say Mr. Erdogan is also concerned about court cases in the United States against 15 of his bodyguards, who are accused of attacking protesters in Washington in May, and a group, including a former cabinet minister, charged with conspiring to break Iranian sanctions.

Adding to the tensions, a Turkish court on Tuesday sentenced a reporter for The Wall Street Journal to more than two years in prison over an article she wrote about the Kurds, the newspaper said. The court deemed the article to be terrorist propaganda in support of a banned Kurdish separatist organization.

The conviction of the reporter, Ayla Albayrak, who holds dual Turkish-Finnish citizenship and is currently in New York, “highlights the increasing targeting of journalists in Turkey,” the newspaper reported.

“This ruling against a professional and respected journalist is an affront to all who are committed to furthering a free and robust press,” said William Lewis, the chief executive of Dow Jones, the newspaper’s publisher. “We call on those who share this commitment to make their voices heard.”

Mr. Erdogan has used the attempted coup to rally political support and stir nationalist sentiment. Many of his supporters openly voice the suspicion that the United States had a hand in the plot and sought his downfall.

Mr. Erdogan said on Tuesday that Gulen followers had infiltrated the American Consulate in Istanbul, and he questioned why the United States had tolerated them.

“How did these agents infiltrate into the American Consulate?” he asked. “If these agents did not infiltrate the American Consulate, then who put them there? We need to focus on them. No state would allow such agents to threaten it from the inside.”

Prime Minister Binali Yildirim set an anti-American tone in comments to party members during a weekly meeting in Ankara.

Regarding the legal cases against the United States Consulate employees, he said: “So what? Is it a privilege to be in the U.S. mission? Should we get permission from those gentlemen?”

The United States authorities had never asked for Turkey’s permission when they detained an officer of a Turkish state-owned bank, Mr. Yildirim said. He was referring to the arrest in New York of Mehmet Hakan Atilla, the deputy general manager of International Banking at Halkbank, who is among those charged with conspiring to break sanctions on Iran.

Mr. Yildirim called for the diplomatic dispute to be resolved swiftly, through dialogue, but he also seemed to be rubbing salt in the wounds of the relationship. He told party members that around 80 percent of Turkish people do not like the United States. It had failed to cooperate with Turkey in the aftermath of the coup attempt and continued to support Kurdish fighters in Syria against Turkey’s request, he added.

A survey conducted recently by the Pew Research Group found that 72 percent of Turkish citizens felt that American power and influence were a major threat to their country, an increase of 28 percentage points since 2013.

The American suspension of all nonimmigrant visas could affect over 100,000 Turkish citizens who travel to the United States annually, but Turkey is likely to suffer more: Roughly half a million Americans, business travelers and tourists, visit Turkey annually.

But Turkey seems to have dialed back on its initial announcements that all visas would be suspended. Customs and Trade Minister Bulent Tufenkci said that no American without a visa would be allowed to enter the country, adding that none had tried so far. The airport police confirmed that no Americans had been turned back, since none had tried to arrive without visas.

Trade would not immediately be damaged since a lot of commerce was conducted electronically these days, Mr. Tufenkci said.

“The world is getting smaller now,” he said. “Everything is not connected to a visa.”",Turkish President Erdogan Blames U.S. Ambassador for Visa Row,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/world/europe/turkey-erdogan-us-visas.html

Never before had an aircraft carried so many passengers — including, by the time the jet touched down, several babies born midair.
PhotoLike every 747 pilot since, Mr. Waddell also took a keen interest in how the plane looked.
Now, well into the 21st century, I asked Mr. Foster for an update.
One reader detailed his first 747 flight, on Alitalia, bound for Rome in 1971.","The hopes and fears of the era that gave us the 747 can seem distant. Nor is it easy, in the age of the internet, to feel the same awe at the 747’s ability to shrink and connect the world. Looking back, it’s perhaps enough to marvel at the billions of reunions, migrations, exchanges and collaborations of all manner that were made possible, or at least more affordable, by this aircraft. Today, the equivalent of around half the planet’s population has flown on a 747. The jets have also served in firefighting, military and humanitarian roles. In 1991, as part of Operation Solomon, about 1,100 Ethiopian Jews boarded the 747 that would take them to Israel. Never before had an aircraft carried so many passengers — including, by the time the jet touched down, several babies born midair.

If the 747’s place in history is assured, so too, it seems, is its cultural stature. The jet remains a go-to synonym for aerial enormity, one that a “Game of Thrones” director recently deployed to suggest the dimensions of a dragon. The 747 also endures as a symbol of speed, escape and, frankly, sexiness, one that — along with the pleasingly palindromic rhythm of its number-name — has appealed in particular to singers. A 747 playlist might include Prince (“you are flying aboard the seduction 747”); Earth, Wind and Fire (“just move yourself and glide like a 747”); and Joni Mitchell, who gave perhaps my favorite tribute to 747s (“...over geometric farms.”)

Photo

The jet also seems certain to be remembered as an icon of modern design. “This is one of the great ones,” said Charles Lindbergh of the aircraft that many consider to be uniquely good-looking. I am surely not the first to speculate that the jet’s distinctive hump (fashioned to facilitate cargo-loading in a future that many expected to be dominated by supersonic passenger jets) suggests the graceful head of an avian archetype. Frequently, looking up from my cockpit paperwork, I’ll spot several passengers in the terminal photographing the very jet in which I am sitting. I often see even senior 747 pilots disembark the aircraft that they’ve just spent 11 hours flying to Cape Town or Los Angeles, and then pause, turn around and photograph it.

Indeed, the jet may be most esteemed by those who have been lucky enough to fly it. The very first to do so, the test pilot Jack Waddell, described it as “a pilot’s dream” and a “two-finger airplane” — one that can be flown with just the forefinger and thumb on the control wheel; it is hard to imagine higher praise for such an enormous aircraft. Personally, I find the aircraft to be both smooth and maneuverable, a joy to fly and to land.

Photo

Like every 747 pilot since, Mr. Waddell also took a keen interest in how the plane looked. Remarkably, he did so even as he was piloting the new jet on that first-ever flight. “What kind of a looking ship is this from out there, Paul?” he said over the radio to Paul Bennett, a pilot in the “chase” aircraft that was following the newborn 747 through the skies of the Pacific Northwest. The reply from Mr. Bennett echoes through aviation history: “It’s very good looking, Jack. Fantastic!”

Many 747 pilots feel the same, and are pleased, but not surprised, to hear that the British architect Norman Foster once named the aircraft his favorite building of the 20th century. Now, well into the 21st century, I asked Mr. Foster for an update. The 747 “still moves me now as it did then,” he told me in an email. “Perhaps with the passage of time, and in an age of ‘look-alikes,’ even more so.”

Photo

Mr. Foster has plenty of company. At the start of my first book, a sort of love letter to my job as a pilot, I invited readers to send me their favorite window seat photographs. Many also wrote to share their particular passion for the 747. One reader detailed his first 747 flight, on Alitalia, bound for Rome in 1971. “I have been hooked ever since,” he said. Another, Andrew Flowers, a 42-year-old South African writer who lives in Helsinki, wrote that the 747s he saw as a child in Cape Town stood for what “I wanted most in the world: a way to Europe, to adventure, to freedom.”

When Mr. Foster emailed me, he also attached a transcript of remarks he made about the 747 in a 1991 BBC documentary. “I suppose it’s the grandeur, the scale; it’s heroic, it’s also pure sculpture,” he said then of the jet. “It does not really need to fly, it could sit on the ground, it could be in a museum.”

Today the first 747 is indeed in a museum — the Museum of Flight in Seattle. When I last visited, I couldn’t stay long. (Inevitably, I had a flight to catch.) But if you see me there another time — perhaps in a few decades when I myself am retired, with more time, I hope, to sit on benches and listen to Joni Mitchell — come say hello. I’ll tell you how much I loved this plane, and how sorry I was that my parents did not live to join me on one of my flights. Perhaps you’ll tell me about the first time you ever saw a 747, or flew on one, and together we’ll marvel at how it towers above us even at its lowest altitude, even as it rests on the world.","As the 747 Begins Its Final Approach, a Pilot Takes a Flight Down Memory Lane",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/travel/747-airplane-jet-pilot.html

And in July, Coach’s rival Michael Kors acquired Jimmy Choo (a brand that Coach was reportedly also considering acquiring) for $1.2 billion. John Idol, the Kors chief executive, told The New York Times that it was “the beginning of a strategy that we have for building a luxury group that really is focused on international fashion brands.”

By rebranding Coach Inc., Mr. Luis is hoping to send a signal to potential targets in the $80 billion global premium fashion market that “this is a home that is not limited to any category, channel or geography.”

While Mr. Luis declined to say how many more threads he anticipated adding to his particular tapestry, he did note that one of the requirements for the new name was that it demonstrate inclusivity.

“We embrace our differences, whether they be race, gender, sexual orientation or belief systems,” he said. Mr. Luis added that while Tapestry was currently composed of brands based in the United States, he was open to acquisitions in Europe and Asia.

To that end, the name was also intended to clarify the differences between not only Tapestry and Kors but also Tapestry and potential European competitors like LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (the owner of brands like Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy and Fendi, and the world’s largest luxury group by sales), Kering (Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, among others) and Richemont (Chloé, Alaïa, Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels).

“I’m not here because I’m anyone’s son,” Mr. Luis said by way of example — an apparent veiled swipe at François-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, whose father, François Pinault, founded that group.

Then he said, “We are not a group that believes there is a single country where products have to be designed or manufactured,” a reference to the insistence by European groups on the importance of origin — that there is equity in “made in France” or “made in Italy.” Finally, Mr. Luis said Tapestry would include the results of each of its brands in its annual reports, as opposed to lumping them together into a single entity, as LVMH and Kering do with some of their brands.

Still, Tapestry is following in Kering’s steps in at least one way: In 2013, the French group, too, changed its name (it had been PPR), to reflect its transformation from retail and luxury to a luxury and sports lifestyle group.

Photo

That choice involved an invented word (pronounced like “caring”) that refers to the word for “home” in Brittany, France, where Mr. Pinault’s family is from. It was in line with other notable rebrandings like Andersen Consulting’s switch to Accenture (a shortening of “accent on the future”) and Kraft’s move to Mondelez (a combination of “monde” and “deliz”).

Mr. Luis said it was important for Coach to find a name that, unlike those moves, “wasn’t too corporate-y or made up, that was easy for everyone to understand.”

The search took two to three months and was conducted by the Carbone Smolan Agency. A list of thousands of names was winnowed to “tens,” which were then tested for legality and cultural associations in the brands’ key global markets.

“We were surprised Tapestry was still available,” Mr. Luis said. The one catch: a concern that tapestries could be seen as old-fashioned, and possibly even elitist, associated as they are with European history and palaces. Ultimately, though, the word’s suggestions of craft and handwork outweighed the negatives.

Of course, there is at least one other reference associated with “Tapestry.”

“For anyone who is aware of the album, Carole King does come up,” Mr. Luis acknowledged, referring to the 1971 record. (He admitted that he had it at home.) “But we discovered most millennials had not heard of it.”

Besides, it is not turning “Tapestry” into its theme music. “We will not be playing it in the office,” he said.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote.","To those among us fortunate enough to have known old-timers who regaled us with tales of tabloid derring-do, New York was once a place of outrageous characters both in front of and behind the camera. Like players in “The Front Page,” hordes of cigar-chomping, fedora-wearing men plied their trade as a contact sport that was not above recreating scenes or putting a prop or two — like a lonesome looking doll — into everyday moments of tragedy.

In this cast of characters, Weegee was the Dante of New York’s nighttime demimonde. His photos, of swells and speakeasies, crime and crowds, or perps and play, are a singular record of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s. And just when you thought you had seen all of his work, a new book, “Extra! Weegee,” features vintage prints — many previously unseen — that captures Weegee’s singular point of view.

Photo

Daniel Blau, the book’s editor, admitted that he had “never really liked Weegee.” Obviously, he has since come to his senses, putting together an impressive volume that captures the many sides of New York as it approached World War II. The images were found in the archives of the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a syndicate founded at the turn of the last century by Edward Willis Scripps. The photos — which had been taken for the association’s Acme Newspictures service — passed through the hands of several owners, and were discovered in storage in 2012 by Ryan Adams.

These prints, Mr. Blau wrote in the book, changed his mind, as he saw pictures vastly different from those he had encountered 30 years earlier in some badly reproduced volume. And in a nod to the current daily torrent of images, these photos had an air of mystery, he said, and the mark of a master.

Weegee, born Ascher Fellig in 1899 in what is now Ukraine, lived a spartan existence down by the old New York Police headquarters in Lower Manhattan. That’s not surprising, since his realm was the streets. And the images he shot revealed not just a knowledge of people and places, but an appreciation for the ironic, odd or absurd.

A car dangles off the roadway that encircles Grand Central Terminal, with a “ONE WAY” arrow pointing at it, while two men stand under an awning, not oblivious, but not impressed, either. In another, an overturned vehicle rests on its side, with a sign reading “SLOW DOWN” hovering behind it like an unheeded warning.

Working crowds, you have images of a sweaty, packed throng in Coney Island and people celebrating the end of World War II. A jubilant sailor is surrounded by four women, flanking a sign he held declaring: “$2,000 In Bank Now I’m Looking for a Wife,” with “18-40” added at the bottom. An image of gawkers at a murder scene is a collage of mostly children’s faces, some goofy, arrayed around one woman whose grief is etched on her face.

He also found the lighter side, showing teenaged bobbysoxers jitterbugging in the aisles of a theater, dogs and cats, and even a gorilla. The book is divided into chapters that all start with “EXTRA!” and are devoted to topics like Crime, Cool, Friends, Characters and more.

Of course, the main character on this sidewalk stage is Weegee himself. Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote. “Weegee made these possible. He was a game changer — breaking new ground in both photography and photojournalism. Using a camera to tell a story as others used their pen or speech.”

Mr. Blau concludes that while Weegee may have left to be a movie actor, he had long been on that path.

“By then he had already made all the films he wanted,” he wrote. “All films made of a single frame. All telling a story in one take. Today I love these short films.”

Indeed, the site’s most recommended comment to date mulls the life-or-death question of whether flour should be measured before or after sifting.

Even NYT Cooking’s nomenclature for reader feedback exudes politeness and diplomacy. “When the site was founded,” says the Food editor Sam Sifton, “we made a conscious decision to call for recipe ‘notes’ instead of ‘comments.’ We know people feel strongly about the recipes we run, and we’re happy to read and share what they have to say, but we want the site to be really and truly useful to readers. We felt that asking for ‘notes’ on recipes would lead to a more collegial and fact-based atmosphere than one filled with mere comment and opinion. That’s worked to a large extent.”

But every now and then ... a “note” takes a wildly unexpected turn.

“Superb recipe,” Christopher Johnson opined recently after trying a lemon soufflé recipe. “So light and fluffy it feels like a tangy cloud! My wife hates me and life is meaningless. Be sure to be careful with the variety of lemon because it can sometimes be too tart. Good luck!”

This blithe dropping of an overshare smack dab in the middle of a conversation about dessert ingredients is far from routine. But “dishes” (pardon the pun) are what cooking is all about — perhaps because food is such a visceral, basic, universal need, so tied up in our memories and emotions, from romantic passion to sadness to downright anger. Recipe communities can feel like a safe space in which to vent.

“We expected that there might be processes happening over thousands of years preceding the eruption,” said Christy Till, a geologist at Arizona State, and Ms. Shamloo’s dissertation adviser. Instead, the outer rims of the crystals revealed a clear uptick in temperature and a change in composition that occurred on a rapid time scale.

The time scale is the blink of an eye, geologically speaking. It’s even shorter than a previous study that found that another ancient supervolcano beneath California’s Long Valley caldera awoke hundreds of years before its eruption. As such, scientists are just now starting to realize that the conditions that lead to supereruptions might emerge within a human lifetime.

“It’s shocking how little time is required to take a volcanic system from being quiet and sitting there to the edge of an eruption,” said Ms. Shamloo, though she warned that there’s more work to do before scientists can verify a precise time scale.

Dr. Kari Cooper, a geochemist at the University of California, Davis who was not involved in the research, said Ms. Shamloo and Dr. Till’s research offered more insights into the time frames of supereruptions, although she is not yet convinced that scientists can pin down the precise trigger of the last Yellowstone event. Geologists must now figure out what kick-starts the rapid movements leading up to supereruptions.

“It’s one thing to think about this slow gradual buildup — it’s another thing to think about how you mobilize 1,000 cubic kilometers of magma in a decade,” she said.

As the research advances, scientists hope they will be able to spot future supereruptions in the making. The odds of Yellowstone, or any other supervolcano, erupting anytime soon are small. But understanding the largest eruptions can only help scientists better understand, and therefore forecast, the entire spectrum of volcanic eruptions — something that Dr. Cooper thinks will be possible in a matter of decades.",A Surprise From the Supervolcano Under Yellowstone,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/science/yellowstone-volcano-eruption.html

The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”",A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/your-money/paying-for-college/payback-college-loans.html

The Times emailed Ms. McGowan to confirm that she was asserting that Mr. Affleck knew about Mr. Weinstein’s mistreatment of her because she had told him, and that she was accusing Mr. Affleck of lying because his statement did not acknowledge awareness of Mr. Weinstein’s behavior.

“I am saying exactly that,” she replied to The Times. She wrote nothing further.

Mr. Affleck had been one of many Hollywood allies of Mr. Weinstein who remained silent following a Times report on Thursday about three decades of allegations of sexual misconduct by Mr. Weinstein and at least eight settlements with women. On Tuesday, The Times reported additional accusations by actresses including Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, and The New Yorker published harrowing accounts of women who told of being raped by Mr. Weinstein.

Mr. Weinstein has denied the sexual assault accusations as described in The New Yorker and he has characterized other allegations as “off base.” But he has also apologized for “the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past.”

Mr. Affleck, in his statement posted to Twitter Tuesday, wrote that he was “saddened and angry” and that new reports of more serious assaults — which include accounts of forced oral sex — “made me sick.” But he did not say whether he knew anything about Mr. Weinstein’s treatment of women. Other actors, like Meryl Streep and Judi Dench, said they were unaware of the accusations, and Glenn Close said she had heard “vague rumors.”

In 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a $100,000 settlement with Ms. McGowan after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival, according to the Times report on Thursday.

Ms. McGowan and Mr. Affleck appeared together in the 1997 movie “Going All the Way” and the 1998 movie “Phantoms.”

While several prominent actresses spoke out on Monday against Mr. Weinstein, Mr. Affleck was one of a small cadre of prominent male figures in Hollywood with ties to Mr. Weinstein who criticized him on Tuesday after the new reports in The Times and The New Yorker.

Matt Damon, Mr. Affleck’s longtime friend and film collaborator, said in an interview with Deadline on Tuesday that he “never saw” Mr. Weinstein harass or abuse women and that he would have put an end to it if he had. Mr. Damon’s and Mr. Affleck’s film careers were kicked off by “Good Will Hunting,” which Mr. Weinstein backed.

“This type of predation happens behind closed doors and out of public view,” Mr. Damon said. “If there was ever an event that I was at, and Harvey was doing this kind of thing and I didn’t see it, then I am so deeply sorry, because I would have stopped it.”

Several directors with close ties to Mr. Weinstein, such as Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, have not responded to requests for comment this week, however. An email to the director Stephen Daldry also received no response, and a representative for the director James Gray said he was in production on a new film and unable to speak. Phyllida Lloyd declined to comment.

As more women have come forward, questions have swirled over who in Hollywood might have known something and even directly or indirectly enabled him or protected him. Roughly two dozen former assistants and young actresses have said the powerful and widely feared producer routinely asked them to his hotel room under the pretense of talking about roles or work, and then solicited massages while he was naked or wearing a bathrobe, or sexually forced himself on them.

Ms. Paltrow told The Times that when she was 22, Mr. Weinstein invited her to his hotel bedroom for a work meeting and later proposed a massage. She said she had fled in terror and later relayed the incident to her boyfriend at the time, Brad Pitt. Mr. Pitt confirmed that he later confronted Mr. Weinstein at a theater premiere and told him to never touch her again.

Mr. Affleck later dated Ms. Paltrow, though it is not known whether she relayed news of the incident to him.

George Clooney has also weighed in on the controversy, telling The Daily Beast in an interview that was published Monday night that while he was aware of rumors that young actresses had slept with Mr. Weinstein to get roles, he had been unaware of any misconduct or the settlements Mr. Weinstein had reached with women.

“I didn’t hear anything about that, and I don’t know anyone that did. That’s a whole other level, and there’s no way you can reconcile that,” said Mr. Clooney, who has worked with Mr. Weinstein repeatedly over 20 years. “There’s nothing to say except that it’s indefensible.”",Rose McGowan Attacks Ben Affleck Over Harvey Weinstein: ‘You Lie’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/movies/rose-mcgowan-ben-affleck-matt-damon-weinstein.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.","Thirty years ago, Tim Rasmussen wore a mullet to the photojournalism version of Woodstock on a small upstate New York farm. He had traveled from his small town in Utah to the Catskill Mountains, to a celebration of photography where he studied with such masters of photojournalism as Mary Ellen Mark, Greg Heisler and Jodi Cobb.

A local high school band in Jeffersonville was playing a thunderous welcome as he entered a large, partly built barn. Inside he was greeted by the festival’s mastermind: Eddie Adams, the Pulitzer Prize-winning war photographer.

“Everybody who was anybody was there and I didn’t even know they existed,” said Mr. Rasmussen, now the director of photography for digital and print media at ESPN. “I went to this small agricultural college in Utah and didn’t know anybody, but in less than a week I left there with four or five lifelong friends. Sometimes you spend your whole life seeking your community and for me that was the moment that I found it.”

Mr. Rasmussen will return to Jeffersonville this weekend for the 30th Eddie Adams Workshop, which has since become one of the most important stops for up-and-coming photojournalists.

Mr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers. Some things have changed since the first session — Kodak slide film gave way to digital imagery in the late 1990s and audio and video have been added. Some sponsors have fallen away as the industry has withered, and while tuition is still free, students pay $375 for lodging.

The workshop is structured much as it was 30 years ago, with 10 groups of 10 students managed by a well-known photographer as team leader, a photo editor and a producer. This year, all the teams are led by photographers who were once students in the workshop.

For Jimmy Colton, a well-traveled photo editor who will be attending his 27th consecutive session this week, the workshop is about family. He calls himself Uncle Jimmy, and considers all 2,700 students he has worked with to be his nieces and nephews. The barn is also a place of family ghosts for Mr. Colton, whose brother Jay, and father, Sandy, both volunteered as photo editors before their deaths.

The core values of the workshop continue to be “a level of ethics beyond reproach, having great concern for your subjects and treating everyone as you would like to be treated,” Mr. Colton said.

Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography. But progress on rebuilding the ramshackle structures was slow as assignment work kept him busy. It was after he met Alyssa in 1983 that the plans for a free, merit-based workshop came together. They married shortly after the first workshop.

“This workshop is not a ‘how to,’ it’s more inspirational and aspirational,” Ms. Adams said. “This is a place where you can let your hair down and experiment a little as a student.”

The workshop does not romanticize photojournalism, and it acknowledges the price many photojournalists have paid while covering conflict. An annual memorial service for photographers who have died during war recognizes friends of Mr. Adams who were killed in Vietnam, like Henri Huet and Larry Burrows, as well as more recent casualties like Chris Hondros, who attended the 1993 workshop. An annual Award is given to a student by the Chris Hondros Foundation.

Recognizing colleagues who have been killed emphasizes that “the truth matters, pictures matter, and you can make a difference with your pictures not just in war,” said Nancy Andrews, who attended the first workshop in 1988 and has volunteered as a photo editor and will be a team leader this year. She returns for the sense of community and generosity, she said.

“I’m actually improved when you, my colleague, or you, my student, make a great picture” said Ms. Andrews, who was a Washington Post staff photographer and director of photography at The Detroit Free Press. “It’s not like there are finite numbers of great pictures out there and you stole one of them so now I can’t get one. It elevates the profession and I might be better as a result.”

Admission to the workshop, for students and professionals with less than three years’ experience is through portfolios judged by a panel of photo editors.

Not being included can be a difficult blow.

Ruth Fremson was among those young photographers who did not make the cut in the late 1980s. She remembers the rejection well, though she has since been part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams as a staff photographer for The Associated Press and starting in 2000 at The New York Times. While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.

She has been a team leader at the workshop the last two years and is returning this weekend as a kitchen volunteer to help prepare food for the students.

“It’s such a gift to be able to participate in it because the team leaders and volunteers get as much out of the workshop as the students,” she said. “I’ve had the benefit of many great mentors who have championed my career and this is a great place to pay it forward.”

“Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said.","With so many exhibits and monographs devoted to fashion photography and its leading practitioners, it’s hard to imagine that it wasn’t that long ago that the genre was seldom the focus of highbrow studies. Yet, that’s what Eugénie Shinkle discovered when she began researching it almost a decade ago.

“My fascination for fashion photography emerged because of my complete disbelief at how widely ignored the genre was in academia,” said Ms. Shinkle, a reader in photography at the University of Westminster, London. “Apart from a handful of exceptions, there was a real reluctance amongst scholars to engage with it in a serious way,” she said. “Unapologetically commercial, it had been reduced to ‘only advertising.’ And, until recently — that is until it started appearing in galleries — it was considered to be ephemeral. Because it wasn’t meant to last and because it wasn’t created with any kind of critical or artistic intent, people didn’t believe its history should be approached in that way.”

After publishing “Fashion as Photograph: Viewing and Reviewing Images of Fashion” in 2008, which examined why the genre deserves intellectual scrutiny, she’s now releasing “Fashion Photography: The Story in 180 Pictures,” a compendium of important figures who help chart the genre’s evolution. From Camille Silvy, a diplomat turned studio photographer in the 1850s, to the contemporary creative couple of Maurice Scheltens and Liesbeth Abbenes, who specialize in abstract still lives, the volume published by Aperture chronicles various movements and turning points.

“The history of fashion photography is the history of a growing confidence in its ability to comment explicitly on the wider world,” Ms. Shinkle noted. “Initially, it was reluctant to engage explicitly with politics, but since the end of the ’60s it has become more openly, overtly and unabashedly political.”

After World War II, photographers like Henry Clarke subtly alluded to the changing role of women in society by portraying them as “independent and in control,” writes Ms. Shinkle. Artists like William Klein parodied fashion conventions and encouraged his peers to engage in self-criticism. Even Richard Avedon proved to be a revelation: “I learned to appreciate his depth and talent by seeing how he was able to reinvent himself halfway through his career and noticing how ardently he campaigned for the use of models of color. Creatively, and politically, he’s one of the most important fashion photographers of the 20th century.”

By the ’90s, thanks in no small part to the nonconformist British magazine “The Face,” the grunge movement — which challenged gender norms, capitalism and the ideals of social respectability — appeared in mainstream publications and paved the way for today’s more cerebral work. Collier Schorr’s images, for example, question gender fluidity, notions of desire and how identity is constructed, while Chen Man speaks up creatively about China’s complexities.

Looking at the people in the volume, it also become more apparent how conservative the industry has been. Most photographers listed are Western-educated white men. This is due in part to the author’s and publisher’s decision to keep close reins on what was considered a primer. “We focused on the West because that’s where the major fashion houses and publications have historically been located,” Ms. Shinkle said. “I had to make that decision early on. Did I want to include more vernacular practices like that of Cameroonian photographer Samuel Fosso, who has been doing amazing fashion-inspired work since the ’70s? Or, did I want to restrict it to so-called pure fashion photography?”

In doing so, she revealed how difficult it has been for traditionally marginalized groups to be taken seriously. Case in point: Women, in the early 20th century, were rarely behind the camera. Yva, Madame D’Ora and Toni Frissell were trailblazers working “at a time when that was not what a well-bred women did, because photography was seen as a technical job.” To showcase them and highlight their technical prowess and unique perspectives is to revise history, which too often ignored them. Similarly, the inclusion of the Harlem Renaissance photographer James Van Der Zee, well known in the African-American community, but virtually unknown at the time outside of it, “points out how exclusive and white-centric the industry was in those years.”

While there’s now a more diverse roster, there’s still a long way to go. “Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said. “It’s representative and it popularizes certain tendencies in ways that no other type of photography can because it’s so ubiquitous.”

An earlier version of this article misstated the academic title held by Ms. Shinkle. She is a reader in photography, not a professor of Photographic Theory and Criticism.

“I imagined I’d raise the alarm,” Dr. Kosinski said in an interview. “Now I’m paying the price.” He’d just had a meeting with campus police “because of the number of death threats.”

Advocacy groups like Glaad and the Human Rights Campaign denounced the study as “junk science” that “threatens the safety and privacy of LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ people alike.”

The authors have “invented the algorithmic equivalent of a 13-year-old bully,” wrote Greggor Mattson, the director of the Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies Program at Oberlin College. He was one of dozens of academics, scientists and others who picked apart the study in blog posts and Tweet storms.

Some argued that the study is just the latest example of a disturbing technology-fueled revival of physiognomy, the long discredited notion that personality traits can be revealed by measuring the size and shape of a person’s eyes, nose and face.

The researchers have their defenders as well, among them LGBTQ Nation, which criticized Glaad for failing to understand “how science works.” But even they have been unable to agree on precisely what the tool has shown.

At the heart of the controversy is rising concern about the potential for facial analysis to be misused and for findings about its effectiveness to be distorted.

Indeed, few of the claims made by researchers or companies hyping its potential have been replicated, said Clare Garvie of Georgetown University’s Center on Privacy and Technology.

“At the very best, it’s a highly inaccurate science,” she said of promises to predict criminal behavior, intelligence and other character traits from faces. “At its very worst, this is racism by algorithm.”

Teaching a Machine to ‘See’ Sexuality

Dr. Kosinski and Mr. Wang began by copying, or “scraping,” photos from more than 75,000 online dating profiles of men and women in the United States. Those seeking same-sex partners were classified as gay; those seeking opposite-sex partners were assumed to be straight.

Some 300,000 images were whittled down to 35,000 that showed faces clearly and met certain criteria. All were white, the researchers said, because they could not find enough dating profiles of gay minorities to generate a statistically valid result.

The images were cropped further and then processed through a deep neural network, a layered mathematical system capable of identifying patterns in vast amounts of data.

Dr. Kosinski said he did not build his tool from scratch, as many suggested; rather, he began with a widely used facial analysis program to show just how easy it would be for anyone to pull off something similar.

The software extracts information from thousands of facial data points, including nose width, mustache shape, eyebrows, corners of the mouth, hairline and even aspects of the face we don’t have words for. It then turns the faces into numbers.

“We showed that this model produces slightly different numbers for gay and straight faces,” Dr. Kosinski said.

The authors were then ready to pit their prediction model against humans in what would become a notorious gaydar competition. Both humans and machine were given pairings of two faces — one straight, one gay — and asked to pick who was more likely heterosexual.

The participants, who were procured through Amazon Mechanical Turk, a supplier for digital tasks, were advised to “use the best of your intuition.” They made the correct selection 54 percent of the time for women and 61 percent of the time for men — slightly better than flipping a coin.

Dr. Kosinski’s algorithm, by comparison, picked correctly 71 percent for of the time for women and 81 percent for men. When the computer was given five photos for each person instead of just one, accuracy rose to 83 percent for women and 91 percent for the men.

After the study was referenced in an article in The Economist, the 91 percent figure took on a life of its own. News headlines “made it sound almost like an X-ray that can tell if you’re straight or gay,” said Dr. Jonathan M. Metzl, director of the Center for Medicine, Health, and Society at Vanderbilt University.



Yet none of the scenarios remotely resembled a scan of people “in the wild,” as Ms. Garvie put it. And when the tool was challenged with other scenarios — such as distinguishing between gay men’s Facebook photos and straight men’s online dating photos — accuracy dropped to 74 percent.

There’s also the issue of false positives, which plague any prediction model aimed at identifying a minority group, said William T.L. Cox, a psychologist who studies stereotypes at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Let’s say 5 percent of the population is gay, or 50 of every 1,000 people. A facial scan that is 91 percent accurate would misidentify 9 percent of straight people as gay; in the example above, that’s 85 people.

The software would also mistake 9 percent of gay people as straight people. The result: Of 130 people the facial scan identified as gay, 85 actually would be straight.

“When an algorithm with 91 percent accuracy operates in the real world,” Dr. Cox said, “almost two-thirds of the times it says someone is gay, it would be wrong.”

He noted in an email that “the algorithms were only trained and tested on white, American, openly gay men (and white, American, presumed straight comparisons),” and therefore probably would not have broader implications.

What a Face Reveals

Regardless of effectiveness, the study raises knotty questions about perceptions of sexual orientation.

Nicholas Rule, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto, also studies facial perception. Using dating profile photos as well as photos taken in a lab, he has consistently found that photos of a face provide clues to all kinds of attributes, including sexuality and social class.

“Can artificial intelligence actually tell if you’re gay from your face? It feels weird — it feels like physiognomy,” he said.

“I still personally sometimes feel uncomfortable, and I have to reconcile this as a scientist — but this is what the data shows,” said Dr. Rule, who is gay.

That is not to say that all LGBTQ people have the similar facial features, or even that there are only two kinds of sexuality, he said. But to pretend that sexual orientation is invisible “suffocates our ability to approach inequity.”

Given that the Stanford study was based on dating profile photos — which may contain all kinds of additional hints about preferences — the results should be taken with “not just a grain, but a tablespoon of salt,” he added.

Photo

Dr. Kosinski is no stranger to attention. In 2013, he published a study that showed that Facebook “likes” reveal unexpected personal attributes.

Liking curly fries, for example, was a reliable predictor of higher than average intelligence. Liking Wu-Tang Clan was a tip-off to male heterosexuality. All of our online likes, Dr. Kosinski said, have left us vulnerable to microtargeting by political candidates, companies and others with nefarious intentions.

Within several weeks of publication, Facebook had changed its default settings, keeping likes private. “It’s very similar” to the controversy over his current project, he said. “I was basically trying to warn people. People didn’t take it seriously.”

A major difference, though, is that Dr. Kosinski did not attempt to explain why “liking” curly fries indicated intelligence. It was simply a pattern identified by a machine.

To account for a link between appearance and sexuality, Dr. Kosinski went further, drawing on what his study called “the widely accepted prenatal hormone theory (P.H.T.) of sexual orientation,” which “predicts the existence of links between facial appearance and sexual orientation” determined by early hormone exposure.

The notion that it’s “widely accepted” was quickly disputed.

“That theory is a mess,” said Rebecca Jordan Young, chairwoman of women’s, gender and sexuality studies at Barnard College, who wrote a book on P.H.T. “There’s more contradictory and negative data than there is positive.”

Even many experts who are supportive of the theory, said they could not see how a study of self-selected dating photos made the case that gay people have gender-atypical faces, let alone a theory that attributes distinctive features to hormones.

The discussion of P.H.T. made the authors sound out of touch, said Dr. Cox: “Most sex scientists agree that there is no single cause to sexual orientation.”

So What Did the Machines See?

Dr. Kosinski and Mr. Wang say that the algorithm is responding to fixed facial features, like nose shape, along with “grooming choices,” such as eye makeup.

But it’s also possible that the algorithm is seeing something totally unknown.

“The more data it has, the better it is at picking up patterns,” said Sarah Jamie Lewis, an independent privacy researcher who Tweeted a critique of the study. “But the patterns aren’t necessarily the ones you think that you they are.”

Tomaso Poggio, the director of M.I.T.’s Center for Brains, Minds and Machines, offered a classic parable used to illustrate this disconnect. The Army trained a program to differentiate American tanks from Russian tanks with 100 percent accuracy.

Only later did analysts realized that the American tanks had been photographed on a sunny day and the Russian tanks had been photographed on a cloudy day. The computer had learned to detect brightness.

Dr. Cox has spotted a version of this in his own studies of dating profiles. Gay people, he has found, tend to post higher-quality photos.

Dr. Kosinski said that they went to great lengths to guarantee that such confounders did not influence their results. Still, he agreed that it’s easier to teach a machine to see than to understand what it has seen.

The study is on still on track to be published by the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, though no date has been set. The paper had already made its way through the official peer review process before unofficial reviewers began ripping it to shreds.

A representative of the American Psychological Association, which manages the journal, denied that the study was placed under “ethical review” due to the uproar, as some reports suggested, though she said that an additional step involving paperwork was taken.

Dr. Kosinski’s reputation may be permanently damaged, he said, but he has no regrets. Officials in a country where homosexuality is criminalized someday soon may turn to facial analysis to identify gay men and women.

A Course of History

Unlike Winogrand, Friedlander hasn’t given up on editing, but he is more interested in taking pictures and getting them out than in scrupulously curating his own oeuvre.

He did this by showing how monuments hide in plain sight: subsumed by traffic, by familiarity, by the abundance of incidental detail he “got” in that picture of his uncle.","Lee Friedlander’s “The American Monument” was first published in 1976. That’s “monument” singular, though one of the many singular things about Friedlander is that he’s nothing if not a pluralist. Whitman-like, he is great, contains multitudes. In an essay appended to the sumptuous new edition of this landmark work, Peter Galassi (who curated the 2005 Friedlander retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art) deems it “pointless” to try to count precisely how many books the photographer has published since 1976 before settling on roughly one a year. The retrospective was huge, and, inevitably, the accompanying catalog was almost too hefty to lug home comfortably. It was sort of monumental, though monuments tend to be erected to the dead.

On receipt of a lifetime achievement award from the International Center of Photography in 2006, the 71-year-old Friedlander responded that the honor, while welcome, was premature. At the glamorous reception and dinner, he spent the evening photographing, snapping guests and the other honorees like a cub photographer eager to make the most of what might prove to be his big break. That break actually came in 1967 at MoMA when he, Garry Winogrand (who died in 1984) and Diane Arbus (who died in 1971) were chosen to represent a shift in documentary photography from social concerns toward more personal ends. It’s possible that his reputation, as it has risen in the decades since, has also suffered, in the way that Dizzy Gillespie’s did in comparison with that of his doomed fellow bebop pioneer Charlie Parker.

Almost inevitably for an artistic career stretching over more than five decades, the quality of the work is uneven. Unlike Winogrand, Friedlander hasn’t given up on editing, but he is more interested in taking pictures and getting them out than in scrupulously curating his own oeuvre. “It’s a generous medium, photography,” he is quoted as saying in the epigraph to the MoMA catalog. He was thinking particularly of a picture of his uncle, which also included a bunch of other, unintended information. “The American Monument” came about in similar fashion, when he noticed that memorials and statues of all kinds cropped up in multiple contact sheets, some of which were primarily concerned with other matters. After that, he began seeking out such monuments in the course of his travels throughout the States. Eventually he had enough pictures for a book — which, in Friedlander-ese, means more than enough. The original edition boiled thousands of potential candidates down to 213, the bulk of them taken between 1971 and 1975, supplemented by a brilliant afterword by Leslie George Katz. That essay still feels remarkably fresh in the reprint, even though Katz’s observations occasionally gleam with a faith in the assumption of the continued worth of monuments that may turn out to be “discredited,” “outmoded” or ironically apposite, as when he says of their power, “Something like racial memory is at work.”

Robert Musil wrote that nothing is as invisible as a monument, and Friedlander in the 1970s relished the simple and complex task of making the invisible visible. He did this by showing how monuments hide in plain sight: subsumed by traffic, by familiarity, by the abundance of incidental detail he “got” in that picture of his uncle. The poet Siegfried Sassoon expressed the cruel paradox of remembrance while contemplating the Cenotaph, dedicated to the dead of the First World War, in London: “Make them forget, O Lord, what this Memorial/Means.” Friedlander’s photos read like an almost-random survey of the aesthetics and meanings of all kinds of monument — and of how easy it is to forget what is meant to be remembered.",The Photographer Who Saw America’s Monuments Hiding in Plain Sight,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/magazine/the-photographer-who-saw-americas-monuments-hiding-in-plain-sight.html

The team he assembled wasn’t all stars. With a few notable exceptions, it was a coalition of the willing, and a ragtag one at that. And then, through his example and erratic behavior this year, he systematically diminished these recruits. If they had pride and much of a reputation on their way into the administration, they’ll be lucky to hold on to tatters of either on their way out.

The most effective leaders extract the best from the people around them. Trump provokes the worst. Tom Price, his ousted health and human services secretary, was shady from the get-go, but still: Would he have acted quite so high-flying and mighty — all those regal seats on all those pricey charters — but for Trump, whose entire rule smacks of economically self-aggrandizing brand promotion and whose family is busting the Secret Service budget?

Would Mnuchin be so blasé about his own use of government planes? According to multiple reports, he charged the government $800,000 for military transport when commercial flights were available — and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, too, indulged in needlessly expensive air travel.

Would Scott Pruitt, the director of the Environmental Protection Agency, have spent nearly $25,000 on some special phone booth? This fish rots from the bejeweled head.

This app scored points for originality as well as its practicality, and is perfect for travelers who don’t have any cool cousins of their own.

Cool Cousin gives you access to contributors in 40 large cities around the world. Each “cousin” has a profile, with name, age, photo, occupation and a lot more information. The idea is to add those to your network who seem to have similar tastes to your own. After each add, the cousin’s recommendations are added to your map and broken down into eight different categories, such as food, coffee, night life and outdoors.

The app seems geared toward younger travelers — it feels like a cross between Facebook, Tinder and Foursquare — and most of the cousins themselves have an appropriately hipster look. For New York, this leads to a higher concentration of recommendations below 14th Street in Manhattan and several in Brooklyn (very few in Queens), and heavy in the food and night life areas.

But the app itself is easy to figure out, and the map includes the option to download and use offline (for free). No matter where you are, just hit the location arrow to see what’s nearby.

The recommendations themselves are solid and are written casually — think Yelp, minus the negativity. I added 26 of 55 available cousins in New York and was impressed with what was revealed, including free public gardens and lesser-known art galleries, as well as a wide variety of intriguing bars and restaurants.

Your new cousins will even message you through the app to say hello, and you have the option of writing them back to ask for more tips. You will also get a push notification every time you receive a new message, which you can turn off by adjusting your settings.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Do you ever feel your jaw immediately hit the ground the moment you look at a grid for the first time? Well, that was certainly the case for me today. Joe Krozel has been known to create some inventive puzzles in the past, and this one was no exception.

There’s a black square pattern resembling an animal in the grid’s center, and yet, the triple-stacked, nine-letter answers in the top-left corner make it appear to be themeless. And those orphaned five letters at 35A? What exactly is going on?

Today’s Theme

Turns out that Mr. Krozel wants us to put on our blindfolds to understand this theme. The revealer, 44D, indicates that the figure in the center is a PIÑATA. This also explains the black squares that connect to it; they represent the piñata’s thread.

Yet how are we supposed to nail 35A without any crossings to check? Take a look at the notepad accompanying the puzzle:

“Two letters of the alphabet are missing from the main, connected portion of the completed grid. What are they? The answer goes, appropriately, at 35-Across.”

A thorough scan of the grid conveys that every letter of the alphabet has been used at least once except for C and Y. Hold up. C. AND. Y. CANDY!

While Mr. Puigdemont is facing a fight for his own political survival — hard-line separatists have denounced his failure to deliver a clear message of independence — Mr. Rajoy appears to have consolidated his power base in Madrid, where he has been in charge of a minority government since late 2016.

Spain’s main opposition Socialist party expressed support for Mr. Rajoy as he discussed using Article 155, an idea it has been more reluctant to endorse in the past.

Pedro Sánchez, the Socialist leader, told a news conference that his party also supported Mr. Rajoy in his demands “to clarify and get out of the quagmire in which Mr. Puigdemont has put Catalan politics.”

In return, Mr. Sánchez said that he had reached an agreement with Mr. Rajoy to form a commission on changing the Constitution because “the Spain of 2017 is not the same as that of 1978,” when the document enshrined Spain’s return to democracy.

The commission is not expected to complete its preliminary report for six months, however, so its work is likely to have little influence on the conflict with the Catalan separatists.

Mr. Rajoy is under intense pressure from his own lawmakers to stop Catalan secessionism in its tracks, but he is also aware that strong reprisals against the region’s leader, Carles Puigdemont, could galvanize the independence movement.

The comments on Wednesday represented the first formal response to the events of the previous evening, when Mr. Puigdemont appeared to declare independence from Spain in an address to the Catalan Parliament, before immediately suspending that decision to allow for more “dialogue” with Madrid.

Further muddying the waters, Mr. Puigdemont and separatist lawmakers later signed a declaration of independence, a process set in motion after a highly disputed referendum on Oct. 1 that went ahead despite being suspended by the Spanish Constitutional Court.

Most Madrid-based newspapers and television morning talk shows ridiculed Mr. Puigdemont’s speech on Tuesday and described his call for negotiations with Madrid as an act of desperation.

The headline in the newspaper El Mundo described the night’s events as “farce and blackmail.” Susanna Griso, a news anchor on the television channel Antenna 3, said the Catalan parliamentary session swung “between tragedy and comedy.”

Spanish legal experts said that Mr. Puigdemont and his separatist lawmakers had violated the Constitution by signing a declaration of independence, and speculated that the move would almost certainly compel Mr. Rajoy to intervene forcefully in Catalonia.

“Let’s be clear: A region doesn’t have the competence to declare any kind of independence,” Ignacio Gordillo, a former prosecutor for Spain’s national court, told Antenna 3. “You cannot negotiate with criminals.”

Mr. Rajoy, who has stood firm against the separatists, has a battery of potential emergency measures available to him: not just Article 155, but also a national emergency law that his government enacted in 2015.

However, he also has a long record as a cautious politician who has stayed on the front line of Spanish politics for two decades by steering clear of difficult decisions and letting rivals dig themselves into holes instead. He said on Wednesday that he would “continue to act with prudence,” and put the onus on Mr. Puigdemont to explain himself.

Article 155, which requires Senate approval, would allow Mr. Rajoy to suspend, for as long as he believes necessary, the political institutions of Catalonia, including its regional government and Parliament. His government could also take over the leadership of the region’s autonomous police force and its public broadcaster.

Separately, public prosecutors could open criminal proceedings against Mr. Puigdemont and his government. On Monday, Pablo Casado, the spokesman for Mr. Rajoy’s governing party, warned that Mr. Puigdemont could be imprisoned for insurrection.

Still, Ignacio González Vega, spokesman for a Spanish association of judges, warned on Wednesday that “a political issue cannot be resolved only by applying laws.” He also told Antenna 3 that Mr. Rajoy “will have to step in with a lot of sensitivity, because these measures are very serious.”",Spain Asks Catalonia: Did You Declare Independence or Not?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/world/europe/catalonia-spain-independence-mariano-rajoy.html

It’s Archtober — architecture and design month in New York.

The festival, now in its seventh year, helps us appreciate the beauty and creativity in our concrete jungle, celebrating our city’s buildings with activities, exhibitions and other programs through Oct. 31.

On tap for today: The Architecture & Design Film Festival hosts its Short Films Walk in SoHo; an architecture boat tour around New York Harbor; and a lecture on interior design (and the future of the industry) with Mitchell Owens, the decorative arts editor at Architectural Digest, at the New York School of Interior Design.

And Archtober’s “Building of the Day” series, which highlights masterpieces along our skyline and offers guided tours of those spaces, continues. Today’s honoree is the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Morningside Heights.

Check out the full lineup of events, organized by the Center for Architecture, here.

173,"['marriage', 'ms', 'empowering', 'women', 'theyd', 'speak', 'workshops', 'community', 'workshop', 'sinclair', 'young', 'rescued', 'child', 'girls']","The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.
“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said.
Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls.
“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said.
“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said.","Having spent 15 years photographing child marriages around the world, Stephanie Sinclair is uniquely positioned to understand its lasting impact on communities and, especially, on the girls who were forced to wed against their will. “You can’t expect individuals who have been through significant abuse to just act normal as soon as they get out of that situation,” she said. “They need to be nurtured, to be given the time and the tools to heal.”

With this in mind, Ms. Sinclair last year started the Tehani Photo Workshop — named after an 8-year-old Yemeni bride — in partnership with the Samburu Girls Foundation. The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said. Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls. “The independence that comes with a such a career, the knowledge you acquire through meeting other people, and the freedom the camera gives you to express yourself can’t be underplayed,” she said. “Instinctively, I knew that a photo workshop could nurture the girls in a unique way.”

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

General Fang, however, seems to have fallen afoul of Mr. Xi, for reasons that are not fully apparent.
It could also be a way for Mr. Xi to extend his influence beyond a second term.
“China’s military modernization is targeting capabilities with the potential to degrade core U.S. military-technological advantages,” the Pentagon’s annual report to Congress on China’s military abilities asserted.
But experts already credit with Mr. Xi with making significant progress in creating a leaner, more modern, more professional force.","Since coming to power in 2012, Mr. Xi has used a crackdown on corruption to purge commanders deemed corrupt or disloyal. The moves have given Mr. Xi, whose father was an important figure in China’s revolutionary army, a degree of authority over the People’s Liberation Army that had eluded previous civilian leaders.

Mr. Xi “has been able to take political control of the military to an extent that exceeds what Mao and Deng have done,” said Tai Ming Cheung, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies China’s defense forces. “He has already demonstrated ahead of the congress his ability to elevate key commanders that are close to him.”

The abrupt disappearance of the two generals before the congress underlined how ruthlessly Mr. Xi was willing to act. He is now poised to cement his control by installing a new cohort of civilian and military leaders loyal to him and his vision for the Chinese military.

Before his abrupt removal, General Fang, 66, had seemed positioned for promotion at the congress. He had recently laid out China’s stance on North Korea to his visiting American counterpart and was enforcing Mr. Xi’s overhaul. He even accompanied Mr. Xi to Florida in April for a summit meeting with President Trump at his golf resort in Palm Beach.

General Fang, however, seems to have fallen afoul of Mr. Xi, for reasons that are not fully apparent. He has been put under investigation on suspicion of abuses of office, two former officials in Beijing said, confirming reports that first appeared in several overseas news outlets. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing recrimination for discussing internal affairs. One said General Zhang, 66, was also under investigation.

They are not the first commanders purged under Mr. Xi. There have been trials of dozens of high-ranking officers, including the two highest-ranking generals ever toppled for corruption in modern China: Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou, two former vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission, the party committee that commands China’s armed forces.

“Strong Military,” an eight-part documentary series shown on Chinese television in recent weeks, said that Mr. Xi had to act urgently because bribery and embezzlement in the top ranks had corroded morale and threatened battle-readiness in the armed forces.

One episode showed the confessions of Generals Guo and Xu as well as a luxurious compound that another fallen general had turned into his private playground.

“The problems of corruption and work style in the armed forces weren’t just harming the image of the military, they were badly damaging morale in the ranks,” Wan Minggui, a commissar in the Chinese military, says in the documentary. “It really had reached the point where something had to be done.”

For Mr. Xi, gaining firmer control of the military could help ensure his grip on power during his second terms as party leader and president, which he is all but certain to receive at this month’s party congress and a session of China’s legislature next year.

It could also be a way for Mr. Xi to extend his influence beyond a second term. Two predecessors, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, wielded influence after retiring from other official posts by staying in charge of the Central Military Commission, which Mr. Xi now leads.

The party congress, scheduled to open Oct. 18, could fill the 11-member commission with younger commanders loyal to Mr. Xi or shrink the size of the commission to enhance his say. Separately, dozens of other rising military officers are likely to be promoted to the Central Committee, the party’s highest organ, whose some 200 voting members oversee governance of the entire nation, not just the military.

“The control of the military is an ironclad insurance policy for Xi,” said Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in California who studies Chinese politics. “If Xi has complete control of the military, nobody dares lift a finger.”

Mr. Xi’s reshuffling of the military leadership is also aimed at accelerating the changes he has sought in the People’s Liberation Army, which, for all its size and influence, had become sclerotic and inward-looking.

Since late 2015, Mr. Xi has reorganized the army to weaken the traditional land forces and shift more resources to the technology-dependent naval, air and missile forces. Seven military regions — the heart of the old arm-focused system — were replaced with five new theater commands, and the army is cutting 300,000 enlisted soldiers and officers, paring the military to two million personnel.

Mr. Xi wants to create an integrated armed forces that can enforce China’s claims to disputed islands in the East and South China Seas, offset American influence and protect China’s growing interests as far away as Africa, Latin America and the polar regions.

It is a military that, while not yet a rival to the United States, could soon be one.

“China’s military modernization is targeting capabilities with the potential to degrade core U.S. military-technological advantages,” the Pentagon’s annual report to Congress on China’s military abilities asserted.

China’s military spending, officially $144 billion in 2016, still lags far behind the more than $600 billion spent last year by the United States. China, though, spends nearly three times as much as Russia, and its annual defense budgets are expected to continue to grow 7 percent per year on average, the report said.

“If I look out to 2025, and I look at the demographics and the economic situation, I think China probably poses the greatest threat to our nation,” Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified at his Senate reconfirmation hearing.

The biggest challenges to Mr. Xi’s military modernization may involve updating attitudes as well as technology. It could take years for new commanders to overcome rivalries and learn to operate jointly in the fog of war. But experts already credit with Mr. Xi with making significant progress in creating a leaner, more modern, more professional force.

“No one had the political mojo to pull it off until Xi Jinping, and Xi Jinping only had an anticorruption campaign to use as a hammer,” said James Mulvenon, a specialist on China’s military at SOS International, a firm that provides security services and advice. “The P.L.A. has known that they have to go to a joint force structure and get rid of the military regions for 25 years, but they had not been able to generate the political will to be able to do that. He was able to do it.”","Xi Jinping Presses Military Overhaul, and Two Generals Disappear",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/world/asia/xi-jinping-military-china-purge.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

She joined the Bronx Museum in 1985, becoming curator of off-site galleries and starting a museum program to make art more accessible to the public. Working with an annual budget of $100,000 (about $230,000 in today’s money), she organized as many as 40 pop-up exhibitions (as they would now be called) around the Bronx each year in places like Hostos Community College and the corporate headquarters of Krasdale Foods.

She was also instrumental in establishing the museum’s annual Art in the Marketplace seminar series, which offers career guidance to emerging artists and culminates in an exhibition of their work at the museum.

Ms. Block became director of Art in General in 1988. Over the next 16 years she was involved in staging exhibitions of work by nearly 4,000 artists, often unknown, from around the world.

She also initiated an international artist residency there, began a new commissions series that enabled artists to execute and exhibit ambitious works, and helped organize traveling exhibitions of the work of Emma Amos, Cecilia Vicuña, Maria Elena González and Alberto Casado. (Art in General moved to 145 Plymouth Street in the Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn in 2016.)

In 2003, Ms. Block was a commissioner for the American contribution to the Cairo Biennial featuring the work of the sculptor, photographer and video artist Paul Pfeiffer. She also edited and contributed to “Art Cuba: The New Generation,” a 2001 book published by Harry N. Abrams.

Ms. Block returned to the Bronx Museum as director in 2006, just as a new wing, designed by the international firm Arquitectonica, was being unveiled. In 2016, the museum announced a capital campaign to establish an endowment and to renovate and expand its building according to a design by the architect Monica Pónce de León, dean of the Princeton University School of Architecture.

Ms. Block’s marriage to John Morton ended in divorce. In addition to Mr. Emmott, she is survived by her brother, Eben; her stepmother, Margaret Almazan; and her half brother, Charles Block-Almazan.","Holly Block, Director of the Bronx Museum, Dies at 58",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/obituaries/holly-block-director-of-the-bronx-museum-dies-at-58.html

The first big test for Senate Republicans and their two-seat majority comes next week, when they will try to advance a budget that sets the parameters for a tax bill and establishes a procedural framework to approve it with a simple majority. The House last week narrowly passed its version of a budget, but not before 18 Republicans defected.

A tax overhaul would be nearly impossible to achieve if the budget fails, and Senate leaders don’t have the kind of cushion that their House counterparts had. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, has already indicated that he could oppose the spending plan. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has clashed with the president and helped kill the health care repeal, is also considered a question mark.

That means Republicans cannot spare another vote.

That’s where the increasingly toxic relationship between Mr. Trump and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee comes into play. Mr. Corker is a senior Republican member on the Budget Committee who had already expressed misgivings about the tax plan and the potential for higher federal deficits. Losing his vote could be fatal. But Mr. Corker has very close relationships in the Senate, and many Republicans doubt he would kill the budget or tax plan simply to spite Mr. Trump.

“Defeating the budget is dishing more punishment on your colleagues than it is on the president,” said Neil Bradley, senior vice president at the chamber and a former top Republican official in the House.

Acutely aware of the tightrope he is walking, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, wrote an op-ed for NBC News encouraging Democrats interested in cutting taxes to put aside their issues with the president and join Republicans. It is unlikely to have much effect on the usually party-line budget vote, but Republicans know their job would be much easier if they could peel off just one or two centrist Democrats facing re-election next year.

Any significant rewrite of the tax code is extremely difficult — a political truth underscored by the fact that the last major overhaul was in 1986. Republicans concede that there are plenty of disagreements of the magnitude that could easily scuttle a proposal.

But they argue that Republicans are in such a politically perilous position because of their lack of accomplishment thus far that lawmakers — and the White House — are going to have to overlook their differences and come together on a plan. Otherwise they’ll be staring into the abyss.

“Members on both sides of the Capitol are going to have to be flexible and swallow features that may give them political indigestion in order to get a bill,” said Bob Stevenson, a Republican strategist and former senior Senate aide who was on Capitol Hill for the last tax overhaul. “But as Ben Franklin said, ‘You hang together or hang separately.’”

Mr. Bradley, the chamber official, said he agreed that in a more conventional political environment, existing divisions among Republicans could be sufficient to kill a tax bill. “But there is such a growing realization that failure is not an option that they will be able to overcome a lot of these policy and political conflicts,” he said.

Mr. Bradley notes that Republicans might not be the only ones to take a hit if the tax-cut push collapses. He said the death knell for tax revisions would cause a worrisome domestic economic disruption as well.

As they fret about the outlook for tax cuts, Republicans also understand that eventual success on a tax plan could ease a lot of the criticism they have come under for their legislative failures and demonstrate they have the capacity to run Washington.

“This is not one that can get left on the cutting room floor,” said Josh Holmes, a communications adviser with close ties to Mr. McConnell. “It has become a barometer of whether Republicans can govern under Trump’s leadership.”

At the moment, that’s still an open question. But a Republican failure to succeed on a tax bill would provide an irrefutable answer.","For Republicans, ‘Failure Is Not an Option’ on Tax Cuts",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/us/politics/for-republicans-tax-cuts.html

Plath’s letters have been collected for the first time, edited by Peter K. Steinberg, an archivist specializing in Plath, and Karen V. Kukil, the editor of Plath’s journals and curator of the Plath collection at Smith College. The first volume — attractive, immense and done up in trendy millennial pink — is just out.

The era has passed in which those who held Ted Hughes responsible for Plath’s suicide would chisel her married name from her headstone. But the years have passed more slowly, you suspect, for the family and the Plath estate. Frieda Hughes, the couple’s daughter and only surviving child (their son, Nicholas, killed himself in 2009), begins the book of letters with a spectacularly defensive foreword — a tribute less to Plath than to Hughes:

“The reason my mother should be of interest to readers at all is due to my father, because, irrespective of the way their marriage ended, he honored my mother’s work and her memory by publishing ‘Ariel,’ ” she writes. “It seems to me that, as a result of their profound belief in each other’s literary abilities, my parents are as married in death as they once were in life.” There is the effect, slightly comic and horrifying, of the daughter presiding over the vow renewal ceremony for the ghosts of her parents.

But it does set the stage for the strangeness of these letters, first glimpsed when Plath’s mother, Aurelia, published a selection of them in “Letters Home” (1975). Her intention was to humanize Plath, to reveal her as a healthy all-American girl. Alas, it went very much the other way — the “psychic osmosis” between mother and daughter, of which Aurelia was so proud, was perceived to be pathological, and perhaps even the root cause of Plath’s depression.

Whatever the diagnosis, to speak of Plath’s letters is to speak of her relationship with Aurelia, to whom she wrote twice a day at times — long letters that swarmed to fill every inch of space on the page and trailed onto the envelopes.

This was, no doubt, lovely for her mother (and her biographers), but it can be rough going for even the committed Plathophile. We spend a small eternity at a summer camp where young Sylvia assuaged Aurelia’s anxieties with daily briefs on her diet and hygiene. In one moment of high drama, she longed for a toenail clipper.

As she grew up the reports to Aurelia continued but now included lists of her admirers and awards, invitations to the Yale junior prom, compliments from professors.

The journals, published unabridged in 2000, were, of course, a darker place. There her violent imagination could bloom. Her pet insult was “smiler” — for the false and appeasing; her own inclination as well, we learn in the letters. She would admit, in passing, to her loneliness in college before screwing on a smile: “My room is lovely.” “The campus is utterly lovely.” “The freshmen are dears.” “Lisa is very sweet.” Even a suicide attempt is glossed over. “My escapade,” she called it in a letter to a friend.

Her intense ambition was on full display, however. She even poked fun at it: “I’m chock-full of ideas for new poems. I can’t wait to get time to write them down. I can’t let Shakespeare get too far ahead of me, you know.”

The other great, governing hunger in her life was for a leading man, a colossus, which she found in Hughes, the hulking Heathcliff of her dreams. She met him in England, where she was on a Fulbright scholarship. She bit his cheek, he ripped off her earrings, they married four months later. In her letters to him, the determined peppiness finally fell away and the Plathian imagery — and nastiness — emerged. On a professor of hers: “I have a morbid desire to cut open her fat white flesh each time I see her and see if its onion juice or what that keeps her going.”

But these early letters reveal something the journals don’t: a flicker of uncertainty about Hughes that now seems prophetic. He “has done a kind of uncaring rip through every woman he’s ever met,” she wrote to her brother. To her mother: “He is a breaker of things and people.”

But she won’t be cowed. She’s conquered him, she reported two weeks later. “I have passed through the husk, the mask of cruelty, ruthlessness, callousness, in Ted.” She preened: “Every thing I do with and for Ted has a celestial radiance, be it only ironing or cooking.” She documented their days, their productivity with joy. She hoped for seven children.

It’s not Plath’s death necessarily, or even the dissolution of her marriage, but her doubleness that’s been the abiding mystery. In his foreword to her journals, Hughes wrote: “I never saw her show her real self to anybody — except, perhaps, in the last three months of her life.” It’s a line picked up by critics from Elizabeth Hardwick to Janet Malcolm, this belief in the authentic Plath, the aggressive genius lurking behind the polite banalities, that finally flowered in the final poems — the “blood jet,” she called them.

The achievement of this avalanche of letters — 1,300 pages and counting — is that it disabuses everyone of the notion that Plath wasn’t aware of her contradictions or in (some) control of them. She referenced her two selves every time she went from blonde to brunette (“I’m rather sure that my brown-haired personality will win out this year,” she wrote to a boyfriend. “Gone is the frivolous giddy gilded creature who careened around corners at the wheel of a yellow convertible.”) Her honors thesis was, in part, on Dostoevsky’s “The Double,” after all, in which a self splits, and one kills the other.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — TGIF, everyone! What a way to kick off the weekend; Damon Gulczynski has returned for his seventh themeless puzzle this year, and like all the rest of his work, it’s chock-full of pizazz.

Themelesses by their nature have numerous longer entries, and they show off overall vocabulary as opposed to an interesting theme, with a few fun nuggets of surrounding fill. However, there are many different styles to actually creating a themeless that should be noted. Some constructions are focused on a formidable-looking grid that has super smooth fill and a low word count. Other grids are less open, yet their longer answers are much flashier and thus allow the solver to overlook any dull, shorter fill.

Today, Mr. Gulczynski presents us with a hybrid of this concept: at 70 words total, he hasn’t quite reached the maximum allowed for a themeless (72), and yet the grid doesn’t appear very open. However, every answer of eight or more letters ranges from good to phenomenal: PHALANGE, I DARE NOT, GARY HART, SODA JERK, TELEKINESIS, OVER THE HUMP, HOVERBOARDS, IT’S NO BIGGIE, GIVE ME A RING, PABLO NERUDA, GENDER-BINARY and JOLLY RANCHER. That’s a ton of juicy fill.

As I said above, with so many marquee entries, the shorter fill usually suffers. But today? I pored over this grid post-solve, as I do when working with Will and Joel on submissions, and I couldn’t find more than three — maybe five, if I’m being super nitpicky — subpar answers. Can you guess which ones they were?

To have a puzzle be both so smooth and so exciting is near impossible, though Mr. Gulczynski makes it look easy. Let’s take a look at the cluing:

Ms. Arquette, 58, said he pulled her hand toward his crotch. She said he told her she was making a mistake when she resisted his advances. “I will never be that girl,” she recalled telling him on her way out of the room.

She added that she tried to avoid him for the rest of her career, which has included roles in movies including “Pulp Fiction.”

Tricky Clues

49A: “Strands in a cell?” looks like it refers either to the microscopic type of cell or a jail cell, although strands in a jail cell doesn’t make much sense. The answer refers to microscopic cells and the strands of genetic material within. If you are not sure whether the answer is RNA or DNA, fill in the “NA” and work that first crossing. 40D is AUDI, so the answer is DNA. See? You don’t have to be a scientist to do the crossword.

59D: I thought this one might bring out some of my fellow vegetable gardeners, because I’m sure I’m not the only one who believed that yams were tubers, not ROOTs. Apparently, “all tubers are root crops, but not all root crops are tubers,” and there are many ways to distinguish the part of a plant that grows underground. The main point you should take away from all this is that they’re good for you and you should eat your vegetables.

Constructor Notes

This idea for this theme came from thinking about Schrödinger puzzles, and wondering if I could potentially create one so that entries that contain more than one distinct stand-alone letter, for example, VITAMIN which can be followed by A, B, C, D, E, or K, intersect another such entry. Ideally, the shared possible letters for each pair of theme entries would be some combination of A, B, C and D, so that the revealer MULTIPLE CHOICE could be used. This didn’t end up panning out, but it did lead me, through a somewhat stream-of-consciousness manner of contemplating crossword themes, to come up with the one you see here. The first version of this puzzle had the theme entries VITAMINS, MUSICAL NOTES, CHEMICAL SYMBOLS, GREEK LETTERS and ALPHABET, and was rejected on the basis that ALPHABET was too obvious, and GREEK LETTERS was inconsistent. It was tough to find a new set of symmetrical theme entries, but I’m pleased with the current set. In each case, the category contains other members besides the ones that are composed of a single letter, and the letters are the members of the category themselves rather than being abbreviations, unlike something such as L M S for SHIRT SIZES. I spent a decent amount of time trying to remove the black square between TILE and GREEK and its symmetrical partner to allow for two pairs of long parallel downs, but I didn’t like the compromises on the fill, so I decided to stick to 78 words. Given that this ended up as a Monday (I had expected it to be a Tuesday) and the importance of smooth fill for Monday puzzles, I stand by this decision, and though there aren’t a ton of bonuses here, I’m fond of SHOT TO HELL and some of the mid-length fill like U.S. NEWS and HANSEL (he’s so hot right now). I don’t have a lot to say as far as the clues go, but a few of mine I’m glad to see survive the edit are 49-Across, 9-Down, 31-Down and 56-Down. Though I’m not sure it will be particularly applicable to this puzzle, I like the inside nod in the clue that Will and Joel came up with for AHA. In any case it’s great to be back, and I hope (fingers crossed) that my puzzle will be a pleasant start to everyone’s week.

The framework released last month would reduce the top income tax rate on individuals to 35 percent, from 39.6 percent today, while leaving open the possibility of levying a higher top rate on top income earners. It would repeal the estate tax, which currently affects only individuals’ estates valued at more than $5.49 million. And it would reduce taxes on so-called pass-through entities — businesses whose owners currently pay federal income taxes on their profits.

Republican leaders are working to ensure the plan does not raise taxes on the poor or the middle class, but details remain to be seen.

An analysis of the framework proposal by the Tax Policy Center in Washington, which made some assumptions about the unspecified details in the Republican plan, found that the gains from the proposal would be heavily concentrated among the very rich.

Maurice Obstfeld, the International Monetary Fund’s chief economist, said the fund was waiting to see the details of the plan but said it should generate revenue rather than increase the deficit, which would help the United States invest in infrastructure and assist its aging population.

“Increasingly, we’re aware that tax systems have to be cognizant of how they affect inequality. And there’s a need in a number of countries to be especially attuned to the needs of the middle class and those with incomes below the median,” Mr. Obstfeld said.

Other economists were more pointed about the effects of Mr. Trump’s tax proposals.

“Those kinds of regressive taxes lead to the creation over time of increasingly more disparate wealth and income inequality,” said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University. “So rather than reducing that kind of regressivity, his proposals, as far as one can say, are going to make things worse.”

Over the past three decades, inequality within countries — including in the United States, China and India — has risen primarily because of the skyrocketing growth of incomes at the top.

Some of this is a consequence of how economies are evolving, said Branko Milanovic, an economist at the City University of New York. New technologies are increasing the returns for the most educated, even as robots replace lower-earning workers. Globalization has allowed businesses to cast around the world for cheaper labor, while the decline of unions has left workers with less bargaining power.

But the trend, at least in part, is also because of governments that have redistributed less wealth to poorer people through taxes and spending, the monetary fund suggested.

In the report published Wednesday morning, the fund detailed how governments around the world have shifted away from policies that redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor, and how that has worsened inequality.

Progressivity — the degree to which the average tax rate rises with a person’s income — has fallen sharply in recent decades. Among the advanced economies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, for example, the average top income tax rate has plummeted to just 35 percent, in 2015, from 62 percent, in 1981.

The monetary fund argued that many countries, like the United States, have room to raise tax rates on the wealthiest without impeding growth.

Many economists believe some inequality can actually be good for the economy by encouraging people to strive and innovate. And the fund emphasized that redistribution should not risk undermining growth, which is the most important factor for helping to narrow gaps between the haves and have-nots.

But research suggests many countries are not near that point. In fact, inequality that is too high can harm growth — if, for example, people from less elite backgrounds are barred from contributing to the economy.

In a speech last month, Lael Brainard, a governor at the Federal Reserve, said that historically high levels of income and wealth inequality in the United States may be weighing on consumer spending, which fuels the majority of economic activity. That is because the wealthiest households are most likely to save a larger proportion of any additional income they earn, rather than spend it, Ms. Brainard said.

In its report, the monetary fund calculated that policies that redistribute wealth from the highest earners to the lowest reduce inequality in advanced economies by roughly one-third. Three-quarters of that reduction is achieved by transfers, while one-quarter is because of taxes, it said.

Even as wealthy countries have slashed the rate for the highest earners, many have also increased the thresholds for the kind of tax exemptions that help the poor. The cumulative effect has been to shift the tax burden from very low and very high incomes toward the middle class, the fund said.

Along with making taxes more progressive, the fund urged countries to fairly tax capital income, like business profits and interest earned on investment. It also recommended tightening deductions that benefit the wealthy, like that on home mortgages, and eliminating opportunities for tax evasion.

Even so, the monetary fund’s projections show they may not put much stock in the Trump administration’s plans. Compared with its previous projections, the fund is now assuming a tighter fiscal stance — that is, fewer tax cuts and less government spending.",I.M.F.

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

It will also build an unspecified number of fast chargers along roadways, each of which will have several charge units.
ChargePoint, the largest installer of vehicle charging stations in the United States, plans to install 400-kilowatt sites in the coming months.
According to ChargePoint, 80 percent of vehicle charging is currently done at home, and industry executives argue that it’s wrong to think about charging electric cars in the way they envision filling up a gasoline or diesel vehicle.
“Electric vehicles are more like horses than gasoline cars,” said Mr. Romano of ChargePoint.","Two levels of charging are typically available in residential settings. Level 1 is a standard AC outlet that provides between 1 and 1.5 kilowatts of electricity. It takes a Level 1 charger about 30 hours to fully charge the electric version of the Ford Focus, which has a range of 115 miles. Level 2 uses a professionally installed charger connected to a 240-volt AC outlet — the kind used by some large appliances — and delivers between 7 and 9 kilowatts, lowering the charge time to about 5.5 hours.

Some commercial charging locations offer more advanced technology, employing so-called fast chargers. These offer about 50 kilowatts of DC power, enabling the same Ford Focus to reach 90 miles of range in 30 minutes (battery chemistry causes charging to go more slowly after a battery is 80 percent full). The electric carmaker Tesla has a proprietary “supercharger” for its vehicles that provides 120 kilowatts of power, adding 300 miles of range in 75 minutes.

A new generation of charging points, the first of which are being installed in Europe this year, offer 350 kilowatts of power. Such a jump would slash charging times to 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the vehicle’s range, according to Charlie Yankitis, director of business development for the German manufacturer Bosch’s electric vehicle unit. Elon Musk, Tesla’s founder, has hinted that charging at even faster rates was being studied.

Several companies are making big bets on the technology.

Electrify America, the Volkswagen subsidiary, is planning on installing such high-capacity chargers along highway corridors throughout the United States. It is investing $2 billion in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and education nationwide, $800 million of which is earmarked for California alone.

By the end of 2020, Electrify America plans to have built 350 Level 2 charging sites in urban areas in California, like workplaces and apartment buildings. It will also build an unspecified number of fast chargers along roadways, each of which will have several charge units. A further 540 are to be built elsewhere in the country in that time.

ChargePoint, the largest installer of vehicle charging stations in the United States, plans to install 400-kilowatt sites in the coming months. But its chief executive, Pasquale Romano, did not specify how many.

Similar pushes are being made elsewhere. In Europe, the German automotive giants BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen have joined with Ford in a joint venture to install 350-kilowatt chargers across the Continent. They will start installing them this year, initially planning to get 400 fast-charging sites up and running, with “thousands” in place by 2020.

“We’re looking for similar solutions across the globe,” said Mike Tinskey, Ford’s global director of electrification and infrastructure.

There are, however, hurdles that need to be overcome.

For one, standards differ across manufacturers and regions. Today’s commercial chargers use three different kinds of plugs that are not entirely compatible. In practice, a Chevrolet, Nissan or Volkswagen cannot be charged at a Tesla charger. A Tesla, however, can use an adapter plug to charge at standard commercial stations, and Electrify America says its charging stations will be compatible with a variety of plugs.

Another issue: No vehicle on the road today is able to use the 350-kilowatt fast-charging stations. It is not a simple upgrade: High-speed charging requires thicker cables that won’t get too hot.

No automakers have indicated when they will sell cars equipped to accept such fast charges. Porsche’s Mission E electric vehicle is expected to be available by 2020, and will be able to charge to a 250-mile range in 15 minutes, according to the carmaker. Electrify America and ChargePoint say they expect vehicles capable of accepting 350-killowatt chargers to be available by 2019.

Utilities will also have to upgrade their infrastructure, a change for which California is already preparing.

Under the state’s zero emission regulations, every manufacturer must sell a certain number of emission-free vehicles, calculated as a proportion of overall sales. Consequently, California has become the hub for the mass installation of fast charging points. One of the state’s utility companies, Southern California Edison, estimates that 25 percent of its network must be upgraded to support new chargers.

“We hope we’ll be ready for fast charging when Electrify America is ready to install it,” said Caroline Choi, the utility’s senior vice president of regulatory affairs.

For now, the number of charging stations remains relatively low. According to the Department of Energy, there are just over 16,000 public electric vehicle charging points in the United States, offering about 44,000 individual outlets of varying charging speeds. By comparison, there are 120,000 gas stations nationwide, many of which have 10 or more pumps.

So customers will have to stick to charging an electric vehicle whenever it’s not being used, much as they already do with smartphones and tablets.

According to ChargePoint, 80 percent of vehicle charging is currently done at home, and industry executives argue that it’s wrong to think about charging electric cars in the way they envision filling up a gasoline or diesel vehicle.

The record features big talk about populism and political realignment, plus a dismissal of the white identitarians and racists drawn to his flame as just incidental idiots ... but it never seems to cash out in anything except a return to empty, race-baiting culture war.

At the White House, Bannon did not manage to inject much heterodoxy into any part of the same old, same old Republican agenda. But he did encourage the president to pick racialized fights at every chance. On the evidence so far, his new grass-roots populism promises to be more of the same: a notional commitment to some nebulous new agenda, with white-identity politics and the fear of liberalism supplying the real cultural-political cement.

Especially because the would-be senators he’s recruiting are a mix of cynics and fanatics who seem to share no coherent vision, just a common mix of ambition and resentment. A nationalist-populist realignment might be possible in theory, and Trump may have even shown how it could work — but if you believe figures like Roy Moore and Erik Prince are going to succeed where Trump is obviously failing, I have some affidavits attesting to Harvey Weinstein’s innocence to sell you.

Which is not to say Bannon is delusional. He and his allies are the latest group to recognize the void at the heart of the contemporary Republican Party, the vacuum that somebody, somehow needs to fill. The activists and enforcers of the Tea Party era tried with a libertarian style of populism. Paul Ryan tried with his warmed-over Jack Kempism. My friends the “reform conservatives” tried with blueprints for tax credits and wage subsidies. They all failed, and the Bannon crew actually got furthest, in the sense that they got the most unlikely figure imaginable elected president on something resembling their platform.

But now they, too, need to reckon with a reality that has confounded every kind of Republican reformer since Barack Obama was elected: Our politics are probably too polarized, our legislative branch too gridlocked, and the conservative movement too dysfunctional and self-destructive to build a new agenda from the backbenches of Congress up, or even from the House speaker or Senate majority leader’s office.

Our system isn’t really all that republican anymore; it’s imperial, and even an incompetent emperor like Trump is unlike to restore the legislative branch to its former influence. So if you want to remake the Republican Party as something other than a shambolic repository for anti-liberalism, the only way it’s likely to happen is from the top down — with the election of an effective, policy-oriented conservative president (which Donald Trump is not), surrounded by people who understand the ways of power (which Bannon, for all his bluster, didn’t) and prepared to both negotiate with Democrats and bend his own party to his will.

I don’t pretend to know if such a presidency will ever happen. But if I were Steve Bannon, or any other Republican with a vision for the G.O.P. future beyond the hapless “governance” on display today, I would not be wasting my time trying to elect a few cranks and gadflies who will make Mitch McConnell’s life more difficult.

But her approach, she said, is the same one taken by the other members of late-night TV’s mostly white male fraternity. Those hosts, Ms. Thede said, “are speaking to the stories that they feel matter to them — they’re certainly not saying, ‘Women, don’t watch,’ or ‘Black people, don’t watch.’”

What will ultimately bring an audience to “The Rundown,” Ms. Thede said, is the opportunity to laugh and “to get an authentic opinion about stories they’re not going to hear anywhere else.”

The program is both a risky proposition and a potential breakthrough for BET, which has a sporadic history of late-night talk-show programming, and for Ms. Thede, who was most recently the head writer and an occasional performer on Comedy Central’s “The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore.”

On a recent Wednesday morning, Ms. Thede was working out of her corner office in Midtown Manhattan, a work space furnished with a designer tick-tack-toe board and some down-market fidget spinners.

As she prepared to shoot a test show later in the week, Ms. Thede noted several news stories that “The Rundown” could mine for material: professional athletes protesting racial injustice; O. J. Simpson’s release from prison; facial-recognition software that misidentifies black people.

Ms. Thede explained, “We’re not going to spend a half-hour telling you Trump is bad, because black people didn’t vote for him anyway. They know that.”

“The Rundown” is BET’s first late-night talk show since “The Mo’Nique Show,” which ran from 2009 to 2011. Mo’Nique, the comedian and Academy Award-winning actress, was one of very few black women to have hosted such a program, including Wanda Sykes (whose Fox show ran one season in 2009-2010) and Whoopi Goldberg (whose show ran in syndication from 1992 to 1993).

Connie Orlando, BET’s head of programming, said in an interview that Ms. Thede had approached the network just when it was looking to expand its after-hours offerings.

“It was something that made sense for the direction we’re going in,” Ms. Orlando said of “The Rundown.” “We realized our real prime time starts at 10, and our audience loves to laugh. It felt like the perfect moment to add the voice of an African-American female to the conversation.”

Ms. Orlando said she believed the program’s topical content and viral potential would help it reach viewers who might not otherwise be watching BET.

“The show’s going to cover anything from Cardi B to what’s happening in the White House,” she said, “and I think all kinds of audiences will be interested to know and listen to what Robin has to say.”

Ms. Thede has broken ground here before: When she joined Mr. Wilmore’s “Nightly Show” as its head writer, she became the first black woman in late-night TV to hold such a title.

Mr. Wilmore said in an interview that when he sought Ms. Thede for the job, “she was already getting ready to move to New York and knew, in her mind, that she had the job.”

“That’s Robin’s personality,” Mr. Wilmore added. “Whatever happens in her mind is going to be real — she’s that strong of a thinker.”

Ms. Thede grew up in Davenport, Iowa; her mother, Phyllis, is now a Democratic member of the state’s House of Representatives. Her father, Dave, a teacher, turned her on to the comedy albums of Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy, and Ms. Goldberg’s performances on “Comic Relief.” Ms. Thede was named after Robin Williams.

She performed in campus sketch-comedy groups while a student at Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, and trained at the Second City improv theater in Chicago. Before she joined up with Mr. Wilmore, she wrote for several BET awards shows and its reality-TV satire “Real Husbands of Hollywood,” and was head writer of daytime TV’s “The Queen Latifah Show.”

“The Nightly Show” provided Ms. Thede with opportunity and exposure. She was the head writer for Mr. Wilmore’s performance at the 2016 White House correspondents’ dinner, which drew some criticism when Mr. Wilmore referred to President Obama as “my nigga.”

Today, Ms. Thede shrugs off any backlash. “Those jokes still hold up, and they’re genius,” she said. “I think that, in an age of Trump, history will be kinder to that performance.”

The abrupt cancellation of “The Nightly Show” in August 2016 was a gut punch but did not turn Ms. Thede off from late-night comedy.

“I sold this show like two weeks later,” she said with a laugh. “I was sad, and I’m still sad — it felt like we should have been able to stay on through the election. But I wasn’t discouraged at all. I was empowered.”

Though she never felt she had to compromise her voice at Comedy Central, Ms. Thede said that while she was there, “because you’re speaking to a majority-white audience, you are explaining things a little bit more from your perspective.”

“On BET,” she continued, “I don’t have to take that step. I can just speak how I speak.” (Both BET and Comedy Central are owned by Viacom.)

At its outset “The Rundown” will not feature any comic correspondents or celebrity guest interviews, just Ms. Thede’s satirical takes as well as skits and documentary segments that will feature her. (There will also be occasional pop-up concerts by surprise musicians.)

As she gets ready to take center stage, Ms. Thede is drawing inspiration from other late-night stars like Samantha Bee, of TBS’s “Full Frontal,” who, she said, naturally gravitates to subjects that other hosts overlook; and Jimmy Kimmel, of ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” who has offered his intensely personal perspectives on broader issues of health care and gun control.

Mr. Wilmore, who has remained a friend of Ms. Thede’s, said the proliferation of topical comedy programs would make it challenging for “The Rundown” to find an audience, but not impossible.

Recounting advice he had given Ms. Thede, Mr. Wilmore said, “Just be the best version of who you are onscreen, and whatever happens after that, you can’t really control. Either it’ll cut through that or it won’t. But the more you’re that, the better chance you have.”

Zoning regulations in most places — especially densely developed regions like the New York metro area — typically do not allow full-time living in temporary structures like R.V.s or movable tiny houses. Most tiny homes are built on wheeled trailers that can be towed. Unlike R.V.s, however, tiny houses are generally not wheeled for touring, so much as for flexibility of location.

Zoning also commonly specifies a minimum home or lot size that is too large and expensive for a lifestyle geared toward affordability. Residential building codes can also present a problem for tiny houses built on foundations.

As a result, “easily upwards of 90 percent of tiny-house owners are living illegally, when it comes to zoning,” said Andrew Morrison, a professional builder and tiny-house advocate in Oregon who travels the world teaching seminars on tiny-house construction.

“A very small minority live in R.V. parks, though they usually have a limit on how long you can stay,” he said. “A friend or family’s backyard, or land in the country, is much more common.”

For some, flouting zoning restrictions is an accepted, even celebrated, aspect of a culture that rejects the American appetite for big houses, rampant consumption and excess stuff. “It’s one of the last things we have where you can kind of stick it to the man,” Marcus Stoltzfus, a co-owner of Liberation Tiny Homes, near Lancaster, Pa., said with a smile.

In the right setting, illicit tiny-house dwellers can usually get away with it. “If it’s off the road and you’re on good terms with your neighbors, you probably won’t have an issue,” said Dave Cramer, an owner of Hudson River Tiny Homes, in the Albany area.

But with the tiny-living craze having lasted well past the fad stage, pressure is growing for municipalities to embrace tiny houses as legal residences. And more tiny-house building companies are popping up, anticipating just such a shift.

“The way they’re legalizing it, it’s coming from West to East,” said Tori Pond, who opened a tiny-home company called Craft & Sprout with her husband, Ken, in Greenwich, Conn, last year. “It’s a matter of when, not if.”

So far, advocates have made the most progress in changing ordinances governing so-called accessory dwelling units and backyard cottages. Some high-cost municipalities, including Fresno, Calif., and Nantucket, Mass., now allow tiny houses to share land with existing homes.

“It’s a spirit of cooperation,” Mr. Morrison said. “It’s a simple way to bring in affordable housing that doesn’t cost the municipality anything.”

Advocates hope the movement will gain more ground in coming years now that the International Code Council has approved a model code for tiny houses for inclusion in its International Residential Code, the most widely recognized residential building code in the country. Mr. Morrison, who led the effort to write the code, said it should alleviate both safety and aesthetic concerns for those states and municipalities that adopt it.

“There’s a fear that people are going to end up living in shanty shacks,” he said. “We don’t want that either. We want people to be safe in their houses, and in something they can afford.”

For the time being, however, finding a place to live long-term in a tiny house requires creativity, flexibility and considerable networking.

For Amy Garner and John McCarthy, it was a conversation over coffee with a well-connected architect that led them to the ideal location for their 340-square-foot tiny house in New Haven: waterside, at a marina on the Quinnipiac River.

For about $400 a month, including utility hookups, the couple enjoy up-close views of the river through the glass front of their Traveler XL, a high-end tiny home made by Escape Traveler. The spot alongside the docks has made their home a favorite hangout for friends, despite the close quarters, and it is only about a mile from their business, a Pilates studio.

“It’s perfect,” said Ms. Garner, 30. “You wake up in the morning, and the sun reflects off the water, and you get this twinkle effect on the bedroom ceiling.”

They have been there since April without issue, other than the occasional curious passers-by. And now they have a like-minded neighbor: A woman living in an Airstream, an aluminum-sided travel trailer, recently moved in behind them.

Lisa Cohen and Richard Ratcliff, who met last spring while hiking the Appalachian Trail, are hoping for similar stability while they finish converting a school bus they bought on eBay into a tiny house. Finding a place to park it within reasonable commuting distance of Sarah Lawrence College, in Bronxville, N.Y., where Ms. Cohen is a graduate student, was no easy feat.

“We asked a few farms, a gardening center and a flea market,” Ms. Cohen, 27, said in an email. “Everyone was kind and said they would think it over, but then would either not answer calls or said ‘no’ in the end.”

Eventually the couple found a restaurant owner in Dutchess County willing to let them park off to the side of his lot for $150 a month. (They asked that the restaurant not be identified.) Settled there for about a month now, they have access to electricity and well water. The train ride to Sarah Lawrence takes Ms. Cohen about 90 minutes, with three transfers, but she is appreciative of the spot, which she deemed preferable to “ending up in Walmart parking lots.”

Brianna Welch, 25, starts graduate school at the University of Vermont in January, and hopes to move from her Bronx apartment to the Burlington area in a 340-square-foot tiny house being built by Craft & Sprout. She and her husband, Chris Murphy, a 24-year-old software product manager, are actively hunting for land to rent, hoping to get settled before the first snow.

As of last week, they had no promising prospects. A year-round R.V. campground they looked into is already booked for the winter. Someone offered to rent them a building lot, but that particular town would require them to install a septic system, at a cost of about $18,000, and pay an $8,000 impact fee. As they look for farmland to rent, the couple are tapping sites like Tiny House Hosting, on Facebook, for connections.

“I think it’s going to be through our network that we find someone who knows someone who has land,” Ms. Welch said. “We knew this would be the hardest part, but I didn’t think it would be this hard.”

Finding a site in rural towns is often easier, because of the likelihood of looser zoning and enforcement. In Lodi, N.Y., for example, Eleanor Liebson, an occupational therapist, is hoping to start a tiny-house community on a portion of the 100-plus acres she owns near Finger Lakes National Forest. “There’s the potential because there’s no zoning in our town,” she said. “We can do it.”

The downside to remote sites, however, is the absence of readily available utility hookups. Seth Porges, a science and technology journalist, found that out after he bought a 180-square-foot tiny house last February. He put the house on rented farmland in the Hudson Valley to use as an Airbnb rental, and imagined it would be an off-the-grid experience.

The house had a solar energy system, 50-gallon water tanks and a dry-flush toilet. But he quickly realized that the solar power supply was not nearly robust enough, especially when the air-conditioner was on. And the water supply lasted only a few days before it had to be replenished.

“People think they’ll throw their house on a cheap piece of land and that’s the end of it,” said Mr. Porges, who lives in a regular house in a nearby town. “They don’t realize all the logistical challenges they’re going to face.”

He wound up hiring an electrician to lay heavy-gauge extension cords connecting the tiny house to a power supply elsewhere on the farm. And he invested in hoses specially designed for potable water to run downhill to his house from a spigot. But come winter, he expects those hoses will freeze, once again necessitating the use of the water tanks.

As for the dry-flush toilet, it functions as expected, essentially “shrink-wrapping your waste,” Mr. Porges said. But the disposable cartridges are fairly expensive: He calculates the cost at about $1 per flush. Other bathroom options for tiny homes include composting and incineration toilets.

For Kerri L. Richardson, a clutter-clearing coach and the author of “What Your Clutter is Trying to Tell You,” the hassles of tiny-house living are more appealing than the headaches of being tied to a traditional single-family home. She and her wife, Melissa Silk, sold their 2,200-square-foot home in Newburyport, Mass., about three years ago and have been gradually downsizing ever since. They are currently renting a 500-square-foot apartment in Groton, Conn., while building a 240-square-foot tiny home on a trailer.

“The roots that we had planted felt more like shackles,” said Ms. Richardson, 46. “It takes some courage to go against that societal template of life, but we decided we wanted to have more experiences and less things.”

As they both are able to work remotely, their plan is to tow their house up to northern New England later this fall – although they haven’t yet found a place to park it. While they’re not entirely averse to living under the radar, they would prefer to find a town where they can live aboveboard, Ms. Richardson said.

And if all else fails, they have a fallback: a year-round R.V. park they heard about in New Hampshire. “That’s our last choice,” Ms. Richardson said. “But if we have to, we will do it.”",Where Can You Park a Tiny Home?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/realestate/where-can-you-park-a-tiny-home.html

MONDAY PUZZLE — Happy Monday, all! Sam Ezersky here again. You may remember me from my “big break” two weeks ago or my diagramless in yesterday’s Magazine. Either way, I’ll be sticking around through Friday, and I promise I don’t bite. [Can confirm. — D.A.]

Let me start by sharing a little secret from my constructing perspective: A solid Monday puzzle is surprisingly hard to create. The theme should not only be exciting on its own, but must also appeal to solvers with widely varying backgrounds and skill levels. On top of this, the surrounding fill should not only be squeaky clean, but largely familiar. Thus, I’m always excited to see Bruce Haight’s byline early in the week, as I know he can produce a top-notch crossword given these criteria. Today’s offering was no disappointment.

Today’s Theme

Bruce has treated us to five, rhyming _ _ _ _ Y - _ _ _ _ Y phrases that cross at the middle letter:

17A/3D: “Useful” = HANDY-DANDY 19A/11D: “Snobbish” = HOITY-TOITY 39A/29D: “Sophisticated” = HOTSY-TOTSY 58A/48D: “Affectionate” = LOVEY-DOVEY 60A/51D: “Weak and indecisive” = NAMBY-PAMBY

Themes don’t get much more straightforward than this, but this is cute and well-crafted, especially since all answers are adjectival phrases as opposed to, say, HOKEY POKEY or LAFFY TAFFY.

It’s also a testament to how helpful the theme can be for getting toeholds elsewhere in the puzzle. Having trouble in the bottom-left corner, where there isn’t an easy three- or four-letter answer in sight? Well, if you’ve caught on to the theme in other areas of the grid, then filling in LOVEY/DOVEY shouldn’t be a problem, and boom! You may have just enough letters to grok answers like SILTS, SAY-SO and perhaps even HONEY-DO.

And it gave us another reminder that Mr. Trump is hellbent on abdicating the leadership on climate change Mr. Obama worked so hard to achieve — first with a suite of regulatory measures and then by making an emissions-reduction pledge at the 2015 Paris climate summit meeting strong enough to induce 194 other nations to sign on to what had all the makings of a historic global agreement.

Under that agreement, nations submitted voluntary pledges to curb their emissions in the near term and to ratchet up their efforts in the future; the idea was to limit the rise in global warming to well below two degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. To that end, Mr. Obama promised that the United States, which accounts for one-fifth of the world’s emissions, would lower its emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The administration later published a report sketching out various technological pathways to cutting emissions 80 percent or more by 2050.

Then along came Mr. Trump, who in March ordered the destruction or delay of nearly every building block that supported Mr. Obama’s pledge — rules aimed at increasing fuel efficiency of cars and trucks; rules aimed at limiting emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from oil and gas wells; rules aimed at increasing the energy efficiency of appliances; and most important of all, the Clean Power Plan. Not long afterward, Mr. Trump commanded his secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke, to reverse Mr. Obama’s efforts to limit oil and gas exploration in Arctic waters and on sensitive federal lands, a task to which Mr. Zinke has fallen with great enthusiasm and which, if successful, will further increase the carbon emissions the world is trying to limit.

Given all these orders, Mr. Trump’s decision in June to withdraw from the Paris agreement, though deeply demoralizing to the entire world, seemed in practical terms almost superfluous.

Some experts say that all is not lost, that it is still possible for the United States to hit its Paris targets. Aggressive state and local policies as well as market forces and technological improvements have already reduced emissions about 12 percent below 2005 levels. These include a huge switch to gas from coal, which once supplied more than half the country’s electricity and now supplies only a third; the steadily dropping cost of wind and solar energy; and more efficient vehicles, buildings and appliances. Further progress along these lines, without any federal help, could yield a total emissions reduction of 15 to 19 percent. One particularly bright note is that many states, including California and New York, are already moving ahead of the targets set by the Clean Power Plan.

Those same experts, however, also concede that federal help is crucial, both in limiting emissions from existing sources and in promoting alternative fuels and new technologies. This administration shows no interest in either. Mr. Pruitt, in fact, used the occasion of his triumphant dismissal of the Clean Power Plan to say he would love to get rid of the federal subsidies that have been and remain vital to the development of wind and solar power, while saying nary a word about the lavish subsidies for the oil industry.

Like some of Mr. Trump’s other rollbacks, the power plant decision will be fought in court by some states and by environmental groups. The E.P.A. is required by law to regulate carbon dioxide emissions in some fashion, but so far Mr. Pruitt has not proposed a substitute plan. The betting is that if he does, it won’t amount to much, surely not the closing of any coal-fired plants.

But the three companies are also businesses, and the last election suggests they’ve all connected more people than they can manage and they’ve been naïve about how many bad guys were abusing their platforms.

As Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, put it to me, “Up to now these companies have not taken the threat that Russia and other foreign agents pose to our system seriously enough or invested enough or to really reveal what happened in 2016 — or what is still happening now.”

Last November, Facebook C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg dismissed as “a pretty crazy idea” evidence that people were using Facebook to generate fake news to tip the U.S. election. Last week, after disclosing hundreds of Russia-linked accounts — where fictional people posing as U.S. activists spread inflammatory messages about immigration and guns and trashed Hillary Clinton and boosted Donald Trump — Zuckerberg admitted, “Calling that crazy was dismissive and I regret it.”

One reason Facebook was slow to respond is that its business model was to absorb all of the readers of the mainstream media newspapers and magazines and to absorb all their advertisers — but as few of their editors as possible. An editor is a human being you have to pay to bring editorial judgment to content on your website, to make sure things are accurate and to correct them if they’re not. Social networks preferred to use algorithms instead, but these are easily gamed.

On Sept. 28, Twitter executives sat for a briefing for the Senate and House Intelligence Committees. Afterward, The Times reported, “Twitter said that it had found about 200 accounts that appeared to be linked to the Russian campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election — a small fraction of the number found by outside researchers.”

Twitter’s presentation, said Senator Warner, “showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions.” It was “frankly inadequate on every level.”

And on Monday The Times reported that Google had found evidence that Russian agents spent tens of thousands of dollars buying ads on “its wide-ranging networks in an effort to interfere with the 2016 presidential campaign.”

Every week we are coming to realize that we do not know the depth of this Russian hacking — and that the people who did it were incredibly sophisticated, not only about the technology platforms but also about which districts and demographics to target with just the right inflammatory messages.

America’s democracy is built on two principles: truth and trust. We trust that our elections are fair and that enables our peaceful rotations of power. And we trust that the news we get from our mainstream outlets is true and that it is corrected if it is not. And we expect our president to defend both. But today many people are getting news from platforms that are easily polluted by Russian or other hackers with fake news. And our president is a liar who refuses to hold Russia to account for anything. It’s a terrible combination.

We can’t fix Trump right now. But have Equifax and these big social networks become so much part of the wiring of our lives — and the impacts of their failures so consequential — that they should be regulated in new ways? I don’t know, but I know it’s time for this discussion. It’s already started.

Said Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, “We must update our laws to ensure that when political ads are sold online Americans know who paid for them.”

These companies make billions selling our data, but they’re ambivalent about taking responsibility “for the uses, and abuses, of their platforms,” argued the Harvard political philosopher Michael Sandel. “They can’t have it both ways. If they claim they are neutral pipes and wires, like the phone company or the electric company, they should be regulated as public utilities. But if, on the other hand, they want to claim the freedoms associated with news media, they can’t deny responsibility for promulgating fake news.”

In the early 20th century, added Sandel, “the rise of monopolies and concentrated economic power brought forth an era of progressive reform that regulated railroads, banks and utilities in the public interest. Today, we need a similar spirit of reform. These platforms are so dominant that, like electric wires or telephone lines, we can scarcely avoid using them. But when they allow our personal data — or elections — to be hacked, there’s not much we can do about it.”

“A century ago, we found ways to rein in the unaccountable power associated with the Industrial Revolution,” concluded Sandel. “Today, we need to figure out how to rein in the unaccountable power associated with the digital revolution.”",From Russia With Poison,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/opinion/columnists/russia-fake-news-media.html

My grandmother Lea once told me a story about the woman who lived next door to her in Tel Aviv, of her capture by the Nazis in Belgium and of an unfathomable decision she had to take to save herself. I never forgot it.

Even as a teenager, I was familiar with stories from the Holocaust. My grandfather had survived the horrors of the camps himself, and his stories formed a large part of our family’s shared narrative.

But this woman’s story felt different. Her pain and horror were woven with love, loss, guilt and redemption — and the epilogue was truly extraordinary. Many years later, once I’d become a documentary filmmaker, I decided to find out whether the woman was still alive.

We sat in her living room, the camera started rolling, and she began. She was sharp, funny and generous, and when looking into the darkness and recalling that difficult time, she did not spare herself one bit. When finished she seemed emptied, for the first time looking as old as her age.

I was moved, even transformed, but told her how sorry I was for having stirred up her feelings and memories like that. I’m not sure she fully absolved me, but she did say she was happy I had come to see her.

Throughout my lifetime the Holocaust has felt like one of the defining narratives of the West. Almost three generations later, the mind still struggles to make sense of what happened in that time. But one commandment, one kernel of a logical response, seems to be expressed by all who have lived through the horror: Never forget.

Define what ‘meaningful’ means to you

One framework I’ve found useful is thinking about it in four categories: legacy, mastery, freedom and alignment.

Legacy and mastery are about the body of work and what you want to achieve and the skills you want to cultivate and strengthen. Freedom is about the conditions you need to have the lifestyle you want, like salary, benefits, flexibility. Finally, alignment is about belonging, in terms of the culture and values of whatever organization you may be working with. You can read more about each here.

Do these three things right now

1. Form a “personal board of directors” by picking four or five people you trust to help you test hypotheses and make decisions. This can be informal. The main point is to not go it alone.

2. Begin building a financial cushion by saving where you can and making a budget if you don’t have one. “Having a financial buffer will make it more likely that when you find something meaningful, you’ll be able to act on it,” wrote Amy Gallo in the Harvard Business Review. Here are a few simple tips for saving a few extra bucks.

Find a sponsor, not just a mentor

High-potential women are overmentored and undersponsored. Sponsoring is a much more specific function of mentoring and connects mentoring to advancement and getting the promotion. An important distinction is that a sponsor has to be highly placed, so she’s able to pull someone up. You can read more about what sponsorship looks like here.

“Dynasty,” on the other hand, is obvious in plot and dialogue. It’s the kind of show where you know you’ve met the black sheep of the family because he says, “I’m the black sheep,” and Fallon’s secret lover welcomes her back to sultry Atlanta by saying, “It wasn’t as hot without you here.”

The casting is at least promising. Ms. Gillies (“Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll”) seizes the screen as the lusty, ambitious Fallon, and Alan Dale is imperious as the snooty Carrington butler (another holdover figure from the original). And the show’s depiction of luxury is even more over-the-top, maybe reflecting a world in which the 0.001 percent are richer and more powerful than in the 1980s.

It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.
While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists.
“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967.","Catherine Leroy was 21 when she arrived in Vietnam in 1966 with only a hundred dollars, a Leica M2 and a limited professional portfolio. Over the next three years covering the war, she built an exceptional body of work: surviving and documenting a capture by the North Vietnamese Army, parachuting in combat operations with the 173rd Airborne, and being published on the covers of major magazines, including Life and Paris Match.

She was also the only female photojournalist then working in Vietnam, after the death of Dickey Chapelle, who was killed by a grenade in 1965.

Ms. Leroy wrote over 100 letters home during her three years in Vietnam, one almost every 10 days, and they show how she was processing her experiences and navigating professional challenges. They are candid and revealing, attesting to her resiliency, exposing insecurities, and showing her in moments of triumph, despair, optimism or courage.

Photo

Despite her many strong images, Ms. Leroy had remained relatively unknown, partly because she wasn’t a self-promoter, and partly because women photographers have often been excluded from the medium’s history, especially war photography. Now a selection of those letters are featured on a new website, accompanied by some of her archive and details from her life. It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.

Most of the letters are to her mother, Denise, focusing at first on topics that read like holiday postcards – gifts she hoped to send home, people she met, her tan. To her father, Jean, she wrote mostly about business — publications that bought her work, logistics and future plans. She frequently reassures them, noting in one letter to her mother that “if anything happens to me, you’ll be informed within 24 hours. So don’t worry if I sometimes leave you without any news.”

Her tone changed over time. In the early letters, she was unsure whether she should stay or go home, even as she felt less insecure about her technical skills. She spoke of the relationships she was forming with the military and about daily life. On Sept. 4, 1966, a few months after her initial arrival, she wrote to her mother:

I celebrated my 22nd birthday at the Da Nang press office in the company of lots of Marines. I had left Saigon a few days earlier with an AP reporter for an operation near the DMZ. On this occasion he opened a bottle of French champagne when we got back. I only got back last night, Saturday, very tired…I’m getting an iron reputation with the marines. I’m very proud of it. I’m leaving tomorrow, Tuesday, morning for the Delta. Subject: a village a few days from the election. The war seems to be calming down, as always happens just before political events. The Delta is the key region. I’ll stay there two or three days. After that, I don’t know. I’m preparing a few photos of me taken in various locations and will send them to you. I haven’t forgotten your wig, I’ll take care of it too. Don’t be angry with me. I’m always away: back in Saigon for two days, get something cleaned, tidy up, wash, everything is dirty.

As her confidence grew, she wrote about her professional successes. But the letters also showed low moments, like being unable to get the pictures she wanted in the field or leaving an envelope of her best prints in a taxi after fending off a robbery attempt from the driver.

The letters testify to the challenges women encountered in the field. While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists. Robert Pledge, president of the board of the Catherine Leroy Fund, a not-for-profit organization in Paris dedicated to her work, said many prominent photojournalists questioned why a young woman wanted to cover war.

She wrote about how people were nice when they first thought she was an unintimidating, five-foot-tall, pigtailed girl. But when they realized she was a serious photographer, their opinions changed. “Many were very, very negative and very nasty with her,” said Mr. Pledge, who is also co-founder and director of Contact Press Images.

Writing to her father on May 13, 1967, after noting her successes in being published in leading magazines, she marveled how “I’m getting telegrams from people who I didn’t know existed for years, while at the same time I’m hated more than ever by known and unknown enemies in Saigon, American civilians, as well as servicemen in Saigon.”

One photographer told Mr. Pledge that the male photographers “were really nasty chauvinistic pigs.” That same photographer, who now is a filmmaker, called her late in life to apologize.

Still, she found the opportunities available to her in Vietnam surpassed anything back home in France. Like parachuting with the 173rd Airborne Brigade — the 85th jump she had taken in her life, after receiving her parachuting license as a teenager.

“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967. “I’m very proud to have jumped with the Americans here, it’s a big professional success in every way. I now know that I will be able to work in the United Sates one day without too much problem.” She wrote how she planned to submit her work to major competitions. “I’ve always thought I should succeed because I never gave in,” she continued.

Many consider Ms. Leroy as the most daring of all photographers in Vietnam, and she most likely spent the most time in combat because she needed the money. Being broke meant traveling with soldiers, sharing rations and sleeping in the countryside.

As Mr. Pledge noted, “If Robert Capa was saying that it’s not good enough because it’s not close enough — she was very close.”

The path through qualifying had been full of pivotal moments; the team switched coaches after losing its first two qualifiers of the final round, firing Jurgen Klinsmann and rehiring Bruce Arena for a second stint leading the team. While Arena’s arrival initially seemed to steady the team, the Americans ultimately won only three of the eight qualifiers he coached.

“We didn’t qualify for the World Cup,” Arena said after Tuesday’s loss. “That was my job.”

He added: “We have no excuses. We failed today.”

Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer, echoed his coach’s disappointment.

“We certainly expected to qualify, throughout the process, and especially after Friday night,” he said, adding, “It’s a huge disappointment for everybody; the players, the staff, the coaches, the federation.

“It’s not good enough.”

Gulati, who is expected to face his first contested election for the U.S. Soccer presidency in February, said he would make no decisions about the future of the program in the immediate aftermath of the defeat.

“That’s for tomorrow,” he said. He declined to say whether Arena would coach the team through the end of his contract, which runs through the end of the 2018 World Cup.

Arena and his team entered Tuesday’s game needing only a win or a tie to qualify, and — after a 4-0 win over Panama on Friday that kept the Americans in control of their qualification destiny — even a loss would have done the trick if the results in the other two games went the Americans’ way.

But a listless first half on Tuesday put them back on perilous footing.

Soon Panama and Honduras were rallying from early deficits, and then it all unraveled for the U.S. Trinidad and Tobago forward Shahdon Winchester and United States defender Omar Gonzalez converged on a looping cross in the penalty area in the 17th minute, and the hopeful ball knuckled off Winchester’s foot and Gonzalez’s shin before sailing over goalkeeper Tim Howard, who was caught off his line.

The goal, a crestfallen Gonzalez said later, “is one that will haunt me forever.”

The day, one Gonzalez called “the worst of my career,” soon got worse. Twenty minutes later, Trinidad and Tobago right back Alvin Jones, sauntering up the right side and looking for a passing option, realized he had no pressure and decided to shoot instead — a rocket from nearly 35 yards that screamed past Howard. The tiny crowd that bothered to show up to Ato Boldon Stadium roared again.

The Americans had lost control of their fate, and suddenly needed goals — or help elsewhere — to save them. Christian Pulisic grabbed a goal back less than 90 seconds after halftime, and the press for one more — which would have been good enough to clinch qualification — was on.

It never came, though, and despite Clint Dempsey’s hitting the post in the final minutes — one of several late chances that would have rescued the U.S. — the Americans were out.

The defeat could mean the end of the national team careers of several national team mainstays, including Dempsey, 34, and Howard, 38. But those decisions, too, are for another day.

On Tuesday night, there was just the hard truth of qualification. In international soccer, midfielder Michael Bradley had noted on Monday, “you either qualify for the World Cup, or you don’t. There’s no extra points for how you qualify.”

There is no relying on other teams to help, either. So as the scores turned bad in the other two matches, and as the time ticked down on the tiny scoreboard at the stadium here, the increasingly desperate Americans could sense what was coming. Arena said he did not check the other scores, but Gonzalez said he could read the body language on the bench from his position on the field, and he knew the news wasn’t good.

When the final whistle blew, Gonzalez and Bradley and the rest of the team were, for the first time since the 1986 World Cup, on the wrong side of the qualifying line.

Conrad, a managing director of the foundation and the leader of the fellows program, said the goal was to find “people on the precipice,” where the award will make a difference, but also to inspire creativity more broadly.

“We hope that when people read about the fellows, it makes them think about how they might be more creative in their own lives,” Ms. Conrad said. “It does something for the human spirit.”

The honorees include relatively well-known figures in the arts, like the playwright Annie Baker, 36, who won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for “The Flick”; the theater artist Taylor Mac, 44, the creator of the 24-hour piece “A 24-Decade History of Popular Music”; and the writers Jesmyn Ward, 40, and Viet Thanh Nguyen, 46.

The youngest fellow is Cristina Jiménez Moreta, 33, a founder and executive director of United We Dream, a national network of advocates for immigrant youths. The oldest is Dawoud Bey, 63, a Chicago-based photographer and educator whose portraits of communities include “Harlem Redux” and “The Birmingham Project.”

Even some fellows who have already achieved substantial recognition described the honor as bringing palpable relief.

“I feel released from a profound, decades-old financial anxiety,” Ms. Baker said by email. “Now my job is just to wake up every morning and ask myself: What do I want to write? What is the most important thing I could be writing?”

Few honors are as wrapped in mystery and speculation as the MacArthur. Potential fellows cannot apply but are suggested by a network of hundreds of nominators from across the country, in a range of fields, and winnowed down by an anonymous committee of about a dozen.

Njideka Akunyili Crosby, 34, a Nigerian-born painter now living in Los Angeles whose work explores transnational identity, studied both biology and art as an undergraduate, and, as the daughter of scientists, had to grow into the idea of art as a potential career. “I think of my studio as a lab sometimes,” she said. “When I’m working out a new idea, I try to be as methodical as I can.”

Jason De Léon, 40, an anthropologist at the University of Michigan, trained as an archaeologist studying ancient sites in Mexico, before shifting focus to clandestine migration across the United States-Mexico border, which he studies using a combination of oral history, archaeological research and forensic science.

“I wear a lot of different hats in my work,” Mr. De Léon said. “Most of my career has been defined by making it up as I go along.”

Other fellows include Nikole Hannah-Jones, 41, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine who writes about racial injustice in housing and education; Yuval Sharon, 37, a Los Angeles-based opera director who has staged works in a train station and a fleet of moving cars; and Trevor Paglen, 43, a conceptual artist and geographer whose work explores invisible aspects of military and corporate power.

While only individuals are eligible for fellowships, some winners spoke of the intensely collaborative nature of their work and of the ways they might use the money and prestige to benefit collaborators, including nonprofessionals.

“I have worked with such amazing people from outside academia,” said Betsy Levy Paluck, 39, a psychologist at Princeton who has studied the ways social norms and social networks influence behavior in settings like American high schools or post-conflict Rwanda. “Some of my best ideas are really theirs.”

Greg Asbed, 54, a founder of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which seeks to improve conditions in the Florida tomato industry, said the fellowship money would be used to sustain and expand the group’s Fair Food Program, which enlists the purchasing power of large corporations to compel growers to improve working conditions. (Mr. Asbed added that he hoped publicity from his award would help persuade Wendy’s, the only one of the five largest fast-food companies not to join its agreement with tomato growers, to reconsider.)

Mr. Nguyen, who won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for his novel “The Sympathizer,” said he wanted to use some of the money to hire an editor to oversee the blog he created for the Diasporic Vietnamese Artists Network, as recognition to the broader tradition that made his own success possible.

“I think back to the first Asian-American writers,” he said. “They were really lonely people back then. They deserve this fellowship, too.”

Mr. Nguyen, a professor of English and American studies and ethnicity at the University of Southern California who has toggled between fiction and scholarship, added that the honor came with something paradoxical: a new opportunity to fail.

“The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said.","Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

Photo

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Photo

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

Since its beginnings, the New York Film Festival has showcased the work of many of the most acclaimed filmmakers. But the annual event — the 55th edition runs through Oct. 15 — has also used some of the most revered visual artists and photographers for its posters. They make up a roll call of contemporary art stars: Warhol, Lichtenstein, David Hockney, Cindy Sherman and many more. This year, the festival chose a sculptor for the task, Richard Serra. Here is a closer look at that poster and other standouts over the years.

Richard Serra (2017)

For his contribution, the artist, primarily known for his giant outdoor sculptures of steel or stone, focused on his 80-foot work displayed in a park at the Museum of Islamic Art in Qatar. It is photographed from inside to make the sculpture look like a camera’s aperture. “It’s one of my favorite posters in the festival’s history,” said Kent Jones, the festival director. “On one hand, it’s photography and cinema. On the other hand, it’s the embodiment of his art in one image. This is what it’s all about.”

Roy Lichtenstein (1966)

In the early years of the festival, a Lincoln Center benefactor and art collector, Vera List, created the Lincoln Center/List Art Poster and Print Program, which commissioned artists to make posters for the event. The program brought in the pop artist Larry Rivers the first year of the festival, then in 1966 commissioned another pop-art luminary, Roy Lichtenstein. During this decade, he was creating some of his most talked-about work. His poster design reads like an art deco reflection of Lincoln Center cachet. It came at a time when Lichtenstein switched from paintings based primarily on comic books to works that still used his characteristic Ben-Day dots but focused more on geometric shapes and other inspirations from architecture.

Photo

David Hockney (1981)

Now 80 and still very much an active part of the art scene, David Hockney was a celebrated painter for two decades before he provided this poster. It reproduces his 1970 crayon drawing “Window, Grand Hotel, Vittel,” and in the context of the festival, it feels like a contemplative moment from French cinema. Fittingly, the lineup that year included the contemplative French films “Le Pont du Nord” from Jacques Rivette, and “Beau-Père” from Bertrand Blier.

Photo

Sol LeWitt (1987)

That year the festival poster went in a conceptual direction. Sol LeWitt took simple black-and-white lines and configured them in dizzying ways. The close positioning of the lines, and their varied directions inside boxes suggest an image in motion — a motion picture if you will. New Yorkers may be familiar with LeWitt’s work from their commute. The Columbus Circle subway station, near Lincoln Center, is home to one of the artist’s final commissions, “Whirls and Twirls (MTA).”

Gregory Crewdson (2009)

Photographers have often been asked to create posters for the festival. Richard Avedon and Diane Arbus, for example, each contributed posters. And Gregory Crewdson, who uses movies to inform his photography, was a logical choice. His still photographs capture a moment in a cinematic way through lighting, production design and character. In 2009, two different posters were designed, one a still, seen in his exhibition “Beneath the Roses,” of a girl on a swing in the rain. A second poster showed the making of the photograph, a behind-the-scenes view that included the lights, the rain machine and the crew. “This idea of how pictures are produced and then the beautiful fiction of a final image seemed appropriate for the festival,” Mr. Crewdson said in an interview.",The Art of a New York Film Festival Poster,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/movies/the-art-of-a-new-york-film-festival-poster.html

Tricky Clues

A lot of the nonthemed clues in this puzzle had clever twists, which I think increase the difficulty and the enjoyment of solving a big Sunday grid.

15A: “Gasoline may make it go” turned out to be a pretty grim type of combustion, ARSON. I ran through a long list of vehicles and yard and garden tools before this became apparent.

22A: “Change of locks?” had to be a pun, as indicated by the question mark. Looking back, I don’t know why I starred this clue as a toughie since NEW DO is such an apt entry, but that’s often a sign that a clue is just elegant.

95A: I don’t stay up on my Disney much, so when I saw “Big 2016 film set in Polynesia” I searched my recent memory for a serious movie. I figured out MOANA through a few crosses and had a “D’oh” moment because of course in New York you can’t go a day without hearing about some insane accomplishment by Lin-Manuel Miranda (who co-wrote this movie’s music). So really this should have rang a lyrical bell.

96A: I worked on “Cab alternative” by trying to think of rivals to Uber, with three letters. Instead I should have been looking for alternatives to Cabernet, similarly shortened — in this case, ZIN.

106A: I was misdirected by this clue, “Consider it done”; since the entry appeared in quotations, I took it for a theme answer and left it until later in the game to fill in. It finally finished as I SHALL, which almost made the grade since there is an actual state concealed in there (ALabama). But the other rules of this theme are broken here, and it’s actually pretty hard not to use any of the 50 two-letter state abbreviations in nonthemed answers in a puzzle. Pulling that off would’ve been pretty amazing.

15D: “Firmly in place” was one of a handful of straight clues I didn’t get, for some reason. I guess I gravitate toward more chicanery on a Sunday and managed to fixate on some variation of tongue in cheek, but this was simply ANCHORED. I struggled with the across clues that furnished the first two letters of this answer, and a couple of other crosses were a bit tricky (including TD BANK, one of those entries that makes sense but makes for an illogical fill until it’s completed).

42D: The radio led me astray when I got to this clue, “Part of a recovery effort.” Too many disasters at once — hurricanes and earthquakes — had me racking my brain for something like “search and rescue” that would fit the grid. Instead the puzzle was hinting at a more personal cataclysm, and it took a while for me to fill out “AA MEETING”; another example of a clue with gnarly, unusual twinned letters to make you doubt yourself when solving.

52D: I got this in its entirety only from crosses, and still looked at it skeptically until checking out its etymology; TOP HOLE just made no sense to me for “First-rate, in British slang.” Turns out that it’s very similar in origin to top notch, both of them finding their roots in horse-jumping, where the best horses soar over the highest bar or rail of a fence, which is held in place by pegs in either a hole or a notch, sort of. I mean, pish posh, folks. Maybe you use “top hole” every day, but in my defense this is only the third usage in the puzzle since 1965. If you knew it then top hole, old chap!

65D: I consider this clue, in retrospect, to be the yin to 42-Down’s yang. “Getting help getting clean” made me think of renting a power washer before being IN REHAB.

All that British slang research brought to mind this little gem from our own archives. If you haven’t seen it already there are some top-hole touches:

I always bring my own soaps, like Dr. Orentreich’s silicon soap and Mario Badescu’s A.H.A.","Despite so much travel, she’s slow at packing. “I do not like packing. But I have to pack so often and so much. Every day in my car I have three outfits I have to bring. It’s really a pain. I’m pretty organized about it; it’s just time-consuming. Even in my own houses I always want something that’s not there, so I’m always packing. I am a bag lady.”

Here’s what she takes on every trip.

Wardrobe changes

“I’m not a light packer, so I will definitely pack enough variety of clothing to cope with weather, events and surprises. I’m not embarrassed to take two suitcases. My carry-on is the largest possible that will fit into the compartment. I really love the Rimowa luggage. I’ve actually Instagrammed me with seven suitcases when I had to go out and do my show with Snoop. I had 20 wardrobe changes.”

Three iPads

“One’s just for books, one’s for TV show series, and one’s for movies. I load them up with enough movies so that I have one per day. I don’t sleep well on land so I like to watch movies in the night. I have three because I’m always running out of space. I don’t like erasing all my movies.”

Shahtoosh

“I always take a very comfortable shawl, a shahtoosh. They weigh almost nothing and they’re as warm as a down comforter. It’s paper thin, it goes through a wedding ring.”

Workout gear

“I take a workout outfit so I can go to the gym in the hotel, with good footwear. I oftentimes take my Pilates ring and my yoga strap and a block to do stuff in my room if there’s no gym. I work out every day when I travel.”

Food

“If it’s a long flight I’ll take some very good food that I know I’ll want to eat on the plane. I might make a delicious smoked salmon sandwich on seven-grain bread; I might take a tabbouleh salad. I take homemade yogurt with apple sauce. I try to avoid plane food most of the time. I just don’t find it very appetizing. And my hard-boiled eggs are just so much better than any eggs on the plane. They’re from my own chickens. I take them for everybody I’m traveling with.”

Soap

“I bring all my own bath things. A lot of hotels put out soaps with so much perfume; they’re awful. I wish they would do unscented high-quality soaps and things.

Tricky Clues

1A: “Agcy. for Kennedy and Reagan” is TSA because the clue is referring to the airports, not the presidents after which they are named.

28A: PREGGERS makes its New York Times crossword debut today, clued as “With child, informally.”

122A: This was too good to pass up. At first, I thought these were the kind of chocolate cups you make using a balloon and melted chocolate, but it turns out that we’re talking about the universe’s gift to personkind, the REESE’s peanut butter cup. And the man who first got peanut butter in his chocolate was H.B. REESE. I made sure to indulge in a few of these cups, just to make absolutely sure they were still a thing. No need to thank me. I’m happy to do the research so you don’t have to.

11D: A pun that rhymes. “Divine bovine?” is a SACRED COW.

39D: I think this clue is a nod to Brendan Emmett Quigley’s 2001 debut of the entry “WHY, YOU LITTLE ...” and it’s a great one. The answer, “SON OF A ...,” is also fairly unique, as it was used once in a 1965 puzzle as a fill-in-the-blank clue referring to a biblical quote.

43D: Clue of the Day, in my opinion. “Several quarter turns?” does not refer to actually turning something manually or screwing something in. It refers to the action of a COIN TOSS, when a quarter is turning in the air. I love visually evocative clues like that.

80D: A “System of roots?” sounds on the surface like it refers to a plant. Today it refers to ETYMOLOGY, the study of the origins of words, their roots, and how language has changed over time.

Constructor Notes

Erik Agard: Music and wordplay are but two of Alex’s superpowers (you can see some of her punny drawings on her Instagram), so when this puzzle’s then-half-formed theme needed rescuing, I knew who to shine the Bat Signal for. Through a couple revisions and upwards of a hundred emails, the collaboration was always fun, and I’m looking forward to her next puzzle. Alex Briñas: Erik was the true superhero here — he zipped nimbly through the bulk of the work and picked up after all my snafus. I’m a super-newbie to everything in the crossword world, but I do enjoy myself a good pun every now and then, so this was fascinating and foreign and exciting and daunting all at once. And I owe much thanks to Erik for inviting me to sidekick this mission in the first place. For your enjoyment (we hope), here are some of the theme answers from the cutting room floor: [Human Torch’s favorite band?] (3,7,4) [Blade’s favorite band?] (7,7) [Wonder Twins’ favorite band?] (5) [Storm’s favorite rapper?] (6) [Beast’s favorite singer?] (6) [Wolverine’s favorite guitarist?] (5) [Lady Deathstrike’s favorite band?] (13) [Banshee’s favorite band?] (5,5)

That doesn’t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.",Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/the-office-gets-remade-again.html

Plath’s letters have been collected for the first time, edited by Peter K. Steinberg, an archivist specializing in Plath, and Karen V. Kukil, the editor of Plath’s journals and curator of the Plath collection at Smith College. The first volume — attractive, immense and done up in trendy millennial pink — is just out.

The era has passed in which those who held Ted Hughes responsible for Plath’s suicide would chisel her married name from her headstone. But the years have passed more slowly, you suspect, for the family and the Plath estate. Frieda Hughes, the couple’s daughter and only surviving child (their son, Nicholas, killed himself in 2009), begins the book of letters with a spectacularly defensive foreword — a tribute less to Plath than to Hughes:

“The reason my mother should be of interest to readers at all is due to my father, because, irrespective of the way their marriage ended, he honored my mother’s work and her memory by publishing ‘Ariel,’ ” she writes. “It seems to me that, as a result of their profound belief in each other’s literary abilities, my parents are as married in death as they once were in life.” There is the effect, slightly comic and horrifying, of the daughter presiding over the vow renewal ceremony for the ghosts of her parents.

But it does set the stage for the strangeness of these letters, first glimpsed when Plath’s mother, Aurelia, published a selection of them in “Letters Home” (1975). Her intention was to humanize Plath, to reveal her as a healthy all-American girl. Alas, it went very much the other way — the “psychic osmosis” between mother and daughter, of which Aurelia was so proud, was perceived to be pathological, and perhaps even the root cause of Plath’s depression.

Whatever the diagnosis, to speak of Plath’s letters is to speak of her relationship with Aurelia, to whom she wrote twice a day at times — long letters that swarmed to fill every inch of space on the page and trailed onto the envelopes.

This was, no doubt, lovely for her mother (and her biographers), but it can be rough going for even the committed Plathophile. We spend a small eternity at a summer camp where young Sylvia assuaged Aurelia’s anxieties with daily briefs on her diet and hygiene. In one moment of high drama, she longed for a toenail clipper.

As she grew up the reports to Aurelia continued but now included lists of her admirers and awards, invitations to the Yale junior prom, compliments from professors.

The journals, published unabridged in 2000, were, of course, a darker place. There her violent imagination could bloom. Her pet insult was “smiler” — for the false and appeasing; her own inclination as well, we learn in the letters. She would admit, in passing, to her loneliness in college before screwing on a smile: “My room is lovely.” “The campus is utterly lovely.” “The freshmen are dears.” “Lisa is very sweet.” Even a suicide attempt is glossed over. “My escapade,” she called it in a letter to a friend.

Her intense ambition was on full display, however. She even poked fun at it: “I’m chock-full of ideas for new poems. I can’t wait to get time to write them down. I can’t let Shakespeare get too far ahead of me, you know.”

The other great, governing hunger in her life was for a leading man, a colossus, which she found in Hughes, the hulking Heathcliff of her dreams. She met him in England, where she was on a Fulbright scholarship. She bit his cheek, he ripped off her earrings, they married four months later. In her letters to him, the determined peppiness finally fell away and the Plathian imagery — and nastiness — emerged. On a professor of hers: “I have a morbid desire to cut open her fat white flesh each time I see her and see if its onion juice or what that keeps her going.”

But these early letters reveal something the journals don’t: a flicker of uncertainty about Hughes that now seems prophetic. He “has done a kind of uncaring rip through every woman he’s ever met,” she wrote to her brother. To her mother: “He is a breaker of things and people.”

But she won’t be cowed. She’s conquered him, she reported two weeks later. “I have passed through the husk, the mask of cruelty, ruthlessness, callousness, in Ted.” She preened: “Every thing I do with and for Ted has a celestial radiance, be it only ironing or cooking.” She documented their days, their productivity with joy. She hoped for seven children.

It’s not Plath’s death necessarily, or even the dissolution of her marriage, but her doubleness that’s been the abiding mystery. In his foreword to her journals, Hughes wrote: “I never saw her show her real self to anybody — except, perhaps, in the last three months of her life.” It’s a line picked up by critics from Elizabeth Hardwick to Janet Malcolm, this belief in the authentic Plath, the aggressive genius lurking behind the polite banalities, that finally flowered in the final poems — the “blood jet,” she called them.

The achievement of this avalanche of letters — 1,300 pages and counting — is that it disabuses everyone of the notion that Plath wasn’t aware of her contradictions or in (some) control of them. She referenced her two selves every time she went from blonde to brunette (“I’m rather sure that my brown-haired personality will win out this year,” she wrote to a boyfriend. “Gone is the frivolous giddy gilded creature who careened around corners at the wheel of a yellow convertible.”) Her honors thesis was, in part, on Dostoevsky’s “The Double,” after all, in which a self splits, and one kills the other.

“How can you be so many women to so many people,” she once wrote in her journal, “oh you strange girl?”",Sylvia Plath’s Letters Reveal a Writer Split in Two,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/books/review-sylvia-plath-letters-volume-one.html

“It feels like a brutal reminder of another time,” said Jonathan Marc Sherman, a playwright and friend. “It’s going to be a long time for a lot of us to wrap our minds around this one.”

Best known for the 2010 Broadway musical “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson,” Mr. Friedman leaves behind several uncompleted shows, including a musical adaptation of “All the President’s Men” — a project he had excitedly presented in June to the book’s receptive authors, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.

Now his friends and family are struggling to rewind the events of the summer, asking what they, or Mr. Friedman, could have done in response to signs of trouble.

“I wish I could have done more,” said the director Michael Greif (“Dear Evan Hansen,” “Rent”). “I wish I had known more. I wish I could have interceded more. I wish that I could have found a way to let Michael let me be a better friend to him, and I regret that I wasn’t able to do that.”

Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater, where Mr. Friedman worked off and on for 20 years, called his death “a real warning shot across the bow for anybody who thinks this disease isn’t deadly any more.”

“It just killed one of the most brilliant and promising people in the American theater,” he said.

‘Things Were Getting Better’

Mr. Friedman had a new job this year, one seemingly perfect for a musical-theater obsessive. He was the artistic director of Encores! Off-Center, an annual New York City Center summer program that presents short-run concert revivals of Off Broadway shows.

“The guy was an encyclopedia,” said Anne Kauffman, who met Mr. Friedman in 1999 at the Williamstown Theater Festival, and who he chose to direct his first Encores! production, “Assassins.”

“He wanted his pals there — it felt like, we had been children together, and now he’d got a grown-up job, and he was like, ‘Hey, do this with me’,” she said.

Tall, gangly and gay, he was an outsized presence — exuberant and emotional, witty and irreverent, opinionated and self-doubting. “When he was at City Center, you knew he was in the halls,” said Arlene Shuler, the performing arts center’s president and chief executive.

But it was also obvious to his collaborators that he was not well. Always thin, he now seemed gaunt. He complained of recurrent gastrointestinal trouble.

Most disturbing, there were purple splotches on his face. Several people who saw him early this summer said they thought the spots looked like the lesions associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma, but then dismissed that thought.

“Of course the first thing you think of is KS, because of all those images from the ’80s, but then the other part of you is, ‘It’s 2017, so of course that’s not what it is; he has some other issue’,” said Trip Cullman, a director and close friend. “I was very concerned, and would try to bring it up as much as I could, but I also knew how much he valued privacy, and didn’t want to be pushy. I obviously very much regret that now.”

In mid-July, Mr. Friedman made it to the first two performances of “Assassins,” but with obvious difficulty.

“The day of the opening, we walked up five stairs, and got to the top, and Michael was completely winded,” said Sam Pinkleton, a choreographer and the associate artistic director of Encores! Off-Center. “Then he pulled me and others aside and told us that he was diagnosed positive. My gut response was, I know a lot of people who are H.I.V. positive, and this is not what they’re like — this is somebody whose body is in the process of being cannibalized.”

On July 14, Mr. Friedman showed up for a meet-and-greet with the cast of a second show, “The Bubbly Black Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin,” and then went straight to the hospital.

“He said he had HIV, he was going to the emergency room, and could I bring him a phone charger,” recalled Daniel Goldstein, a director and writer who also befriended him at Williamstown. “They had caught it at a rather advanced stage, but the drugs were working, and we all thought things were getting better.”

Mr. Friedman, who had health insurance as an employee of the Public Theater, where he was an artist-in-residence and director of an audience engagement program, had known he was H.I.V. positive only since early July, when he was tested by his primary care physician, according to his sister, Marion Friedman Young. He began taking antiretroviral medications that month.

His first hospital stay lasted 10 days, before he was sent home to recuperate. His immune system had been compromised, but his friends and family were hopeful that over time he would make a recovery. By text, he kept friends updated on his progress. By email, he was outlining plans for next summer.

“Every part of me expected him to break through the door of City Center, with an IV hooked up to his arm, shouting something, and the fact that he didn’t frightened me, a lot,” Mr. Pinkleton said. “This was somebody I’d watched be an aircraft carrier for 10 years, and he turned into a baby bird.”

On Aug. 19, he was readmitted to NYU Langone Medical Center with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He spent the rest of his life in the intensive care unit, intubated and periodically sedated. Family was with him daily; friends visited as much as possible.

When he was awake, he would converse by writing down his thoughts and showing them to visitors. But there were moments of stillness as well. “Often we were just being silent,” Mr. Goldstein said, “holding hands and watching the U.S. Open.”

In early September, his doctors detected another infection, and his body was not strong enough to fight it off. The consensus among his friends is that Mr. Friedman had waited too long to seek medical attention.

“As near as I can tell, he hadn’t actually been to a doctor or gotten tested for a couple of years, and only in July did he find out that he was H.I.V. positive,” Mr. Eustis said “That’s just staggering — staggeringly wrong of Michael, staggeringly upsetting.”

Upsetting, and poignant too. Mr. Friedman and several close collaborators were hoping to pursue a sequel to “A Chorus Line.” The original musical, about a group of auditioning dancers, was set in 1975; the sequel would have been set a decade later, as that same generation of dreamers was laid waste by AIDS.

‘Make This Piece for Him’

The cast of “The Abominables,” tricked out in hockey uniforms, was in-line skating around the stage at the Children’s Theater Company in Minneapolis, a few hours before opening. One of them was costumed as a Yeti.

It was Friday, Sept. 15, six days after Mr. Friedman died, and the week had been wildly emotional. On Sunday, the theater’s artistic director, Peter C. Brosius, had informed the cast that Mr. Friedman, the show’s composer and lyricist, had died the day before. He chose his words carefully, because many of the actors were children and had never met Mr. Friedman.

“The American theater has lost an original voice,” he recalled saying. “We’ve been given a great honor and responsibility to make this piece for him.”

Then on Tuesday, the show’s director and book writer, Steven Cosson, had set aside his own grief — he was Mr. Friedman’s most frequent collaborator and a close friend — to urge the cast to have fun with the show. “I didn’t want anyone to feel bad about enjoying this play,” Mr. Cosson said. “That’s why we made it, and that’s what he would want to happen.”

So now it was time to open, and it was hard to untangle the excitement from the sadness. “It’s on us to give it the life it deserves,” said Reed Sigmund, one of the adult performers.

“The Abominables,” as a musical for family audiences, was a new venture for Mr. Friedman, whose astonishing output had already included musicalizations of Shakespeare’s comedy “Love’s Labour’s Lost” and Jonathan Lethem’s novel “The Fortress of Solitude.”

He was a founding associate artist with The Civilians, a downtown documentary theater troupe, and with them he had honed his gift for making music out of everyday speech, writing songs for shows about evangelicals, gentrification and the pornography industry, among other subjects.

The Minneapolis theater — one of the nation’s leading children’s theaters — had commissioned the Civilians six years ago to produce a work with local flavor.

Informed by interviews with Minnesotans, “The Abominables” is a clever, zany and silly show about an adolescent hockey player whose ambitions are thwarted when a talented Yeti comes to town. It is also about the culture of success, and learning to accept defeat.

A few hours before the opening, his collaborators honored Mr. Friedman with teary speeches over a dinner (Minnesota-themed, with a Tater Tot hotdish). “He feels very present,” Mr. Cosson said. “I’m talking with him in my mind.”

The show’s New York-based costume designer, Jessica Pabst, was wistful as she sat in the theater’s 746-seat auditorium. “You don’t think of your contemporaries dying,” she said. “You think of people getting sick, and then they’ll get better. And I couldn’t wait to show him pictures of the Yeti.”

But Ms. Pabst said she took heart watching children respond to the show. “These are the next generation of Michael Friedman superfans,” she said. “These children will go home singing these songs, and that feels like an unbelievable legacy and gift.”

Unfinished

Mr. Friedman had much more he wanted to say.

“There is a mountain of stuff — notebooks and sheet music and ideas, an extraordinary archive of finished and half-finished works, and the kernels of ideas,” Mr. Cullman said.

Fully drafted are “The King of Kong,” a musical adaptation of the video game documentary, with Alex Timbers directing and Robert Askins writing, and “American Pop,” a cultural history written with Mr. Cullman on commission from the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. “All the President’s Men,” which Mr. Friedman was developing with the producers Ira Pittelman and Tom Hulce, was still in its early stages.

And then there were the still-under-discussion ideas: the “Chorus Line” sequel, with Mr. Cosson and Mr. Pinkleton, as well as a modern adaptation of “The Magic Flute,” for the Public Theater and the Metropolitan Opera.

“There is this grief at the work that won’t be finished — all the things he was talking about that I wanted to watch him work through,” said Will Frears, a director and writer and one of Mr. Friedman’s closest friends. “He wrote about difficult things in difficult ways, and my great wish is that the completed work moves forward and remains risky — that it doesn’t get turned into some nice warm thing, but remains an exhilarating and difficult look at the world.”

Now there will be memorials — the Public is planning one this month for friends and colleagues — and revivals; Mr. Eustis vows “to do everything I can to push his work to the forefront.” Kurt Deutsch of Sh-K-Boom/Ghostlight Records is working with Mr. Cosson to preserve unreleased songs; Ms. Kauffman is collecting audio recordings of Mr. Friedman teaching songs and giving advice to actors and directors.

One week after his death, on Sept. 16, several hundred of Mr. Friedman’s family and friends — theater world dignitaries, of course, but also his prom date, and a third grade classmate, and the high school choir teacher — gathered in the austere meetinghouse at Germantown Friends School, a private school in Philadelphia where Mr. Friedman had been educated from kindergarten through 12th grade.

He was remembered with stories, songs and reminiscences: he played a pig in a school musical; he started a madrigals club; he loved “My Spirit Sang All Day,” a composition by Gerald Finzi adapted from poetry by Robert Bridges. At one point, a playwright, Eisa Davis, posed a question: “I just wonder if Michael loved himself as much as we loved him?”

It was a Quaker meeting, full of silences between the speakers.

“I think, weirdly, silence is the thing Michael was most afraid of,” Mr. Goldstein said. “If there was space, he would fill it.”","‘Brilliant,’ 41 and Lost to AIDS: The Theater World Asks Why",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/theater/michael-friedman-aids-death-theater.html

When did the security guard arrive and what was he responding to?

Mr. Campos arrived on the 32nd floor shortly before 10 p.m. to investigate an alarm indicating that a door to a room — not Mr. Paddock’s — was open. While he was there, Mr. Campos heard drilling noises coming from Mr. Paddock’s room. Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said Mr. Paddock was most likely using a drill to set up cameras or to place a rifle.

What did the guard do after he arrived?

At 9:59 p.m., six minutes before Mr. Paddock began shooting at the crowd, Mr. Campos was investigating the drilling noise when Mr. Paddock fired roughly 200 bullets through the door of his room. One responding police officer told “60 Minutes” that the door looked like “Swiss cheese” afterward.

It is unclear where in the hallway Mr. Campos was standing and how close to the door he was when he took the fire. Mr. Campos, who was wounded in the right thigh, retreated from the doorway and immediately told casino security personnel that he had been shot. When the police arrived, Mr. Campos directed officers to Mr. Paddock’s room and helped hotel guests evacuate until he was told he needed to seek medical attention himself.

Sheriff Lombardo said last week, before the timeline changed, that Mr. Campos’s “bravery was amazing.” When the chronology was adjusted on Monday, the sheriff stressed that Mr. Campos had immediately alerted his bosses about the gunman and then protected a maintenance worker who arrived on that floor. It is not known when and how the hotel security officials informed the police that Mr. Campos had been shot.

How quickly did the police respond to the shooting?

A group of eight officers gathered at Mandalay Bay and began climbing the stairs within minutes of the shots being fired at the concert, police officials said. Two officers arrived at the 31st floor at 10:12 p.m. and announced over their radio that the gunfire was coming from one floor above them.

The gunfire stopped three minutes later, according to the police timeline, and two officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17 p.m. — roughly 18 minutes after Mr. Campos had been shot. Mr. Campos then told officers he had been shot and gave the exact location of Mr. Paddock’s room, the police said.

As eight more officers arrived, just before 10:30 p.m., they began clearing the hotel rooms, looking for any injured guests and watching for anyone assisting the gunman. Another team of eight officers arrived on the floor at 10:55 p.m. and the group breached Mr. Paddock’s room at 11:20 p.m., when they saw what one officer would later describe as an “armory” with roughly two dozen rifles.

Questions immediately arose about the police department’s response time and the 18 minutes between when Mr. Campos was shot and when the officers arrived on the floor.

“We’re talking about the 32nd floor of a massive hotel,” Todd R. Fasulo, an assistant sheriff, said in an interview on Tuesday. “It’s not like walking into a Walmart. You’ve got to get to the core of the hotel; you have to think about what you’re doing and account for safety.”

Could the police have responded differently?

Sheriff Lombardo and his top deputies have repeatedly praised officers who responded to the shooting, saying that they had acted “heroically” and did exactly what they were trained to do. The department will conduct an investigation to go over their response, Mr. Fasulo said.

The police do not know exactly how many officers responded to the shooting; many of them were off duty.

Mr. Fasulo said that, so far, “nothing gives me any indication that they did anything other than what they are trained to do, which is to formulate and execute a plan as quickly as they can.” He added that as the officers were forming their team, one turned to another and warned: “We don’t know what we’re getting into — there’s a possibility we’re going to take gunfire.”

“As a department we’re trained that we form up and we attack and we go after the threat,” Mr. Fasulo said. “We had multiple off-duty cops who instantly turned it on and did what they would do if they were on duty: run toward the shots.”

Why did the gunman stop shooting?

While the police know that Mr. Paddock shot himself in the head, they do not know precisely when he took his own life or why he stopped shooting.

“We probably will never know,” Mr. Fasulo said. “You can hypothesize all day long about that but unless we understand his head we can’t know for sure.”",Shift in Las Vegas Timeline Raises Questions About Police Response,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/shift-in-las-vegas-timeline-raises-questions-about-police-response.html

If we looked more recently, we’d see very different results. In 2011, the unintended pregnancy rate hit a 30-year low. And the teenage pregnancy rate and teenage birthrate right now are at record lows in the United States. This is largely explained by the use of reliable and highly effective contraception.

In addition to arguing against the positive results, the H.H.S. rule also argues that contraception is associated with negative health effects. First, it highlights the side effects of hormonal contraceptives. Those are real, and include spotting and nausea, with the potential for mood changes.

But if the government were to use the mere existence of side effects to decide not to cover therapies, there would be no therapies to cover. All medical treatments, including all drugs, have side effects. Every health decision weighs benefits and harms, and birth control provides benefits beyond preventing pregnancies, including reduced rates of some cancers, regular cycles and reduced bleeding and menstrual cramps.

More important, the report argues that enrolling families who object to contraception may “affect risky sexual behavior in a negative way.” The citation supporting this assertion is a law review article published in 2013 saying that much of the research in favor of contraception lacks proof of causality, and that other research supports the idea that normalizing sex through easier access to contraception increases the likelihood that teenagers will engage in risky sex.

In 2014, researchers published results from the Contraceptive CHOICE project, a study of more than 9,000 women, more than 4,000 of whom were 14 to 24, who were at risk of an unplanned pregnancy. They were given long-acting reversible contraception at no cost, and followed for two to three years to see what would happen. The number of women who reported recent multiple sexual partners went down, not up. There were no increases in the rates of sexually transmitted infections.

Further, if we can get beyond a war of handpicked studies, we can look at what has happened in the real world. The proportion of teenagers who “ever had sex” dropped to 41 percent in 2015 from 47 percent in 2011. The proportion who were “currently sexually active” dropped to 30 percent from nearly 34 percent. The proportion who “had sexual intercourse with four or more persons” dropped to less than 12 percent from 15 percent.

The percentage of those using long-acting birth control, however, has been increasing. “There is no evidence that contraception increases high-risk sexual behavior,” Dr. Jeffrey Peipert, chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Indiana University School of Medicine and author of the study, told me.

Of course, disparities exist in family planning as in almost any aspect of health care. A 2016 study in The New England Journal of Medicine showed that the unintended pregnancy rate among women who earn less than the federal poverty line was two to three times the national average in 2011. An earlier study showed that in the years before, that rate was up to five times higher.

Effective, long-acting birth control can be expensive. First-dollar coverage, or coverage without co-pays or deductibles, was what the Affordable Care Act required, a requirement the Trump administration’s new rule undoes. Such coverage can offer women who don’t have upward of $1,000 of disposable income options that they otherwise wouldn’t have. The proportion of women who had to pay out of pocket dropped from more than 20 percent before Obamacare to fewer than 4 percent in 2014. Women saved more than $1.4 billion in 2013 because of this change.

“From a societal perspective, contraception saves health care dollars,” Dr. Peipert said. “Every dollar of public funding invested in family planning saves taxpayers at least $3.74 in pregnancy-related costs. It seems clear that providing contraception is a cost-saving preventive service and benefits public health.”

Many things remain unclear with this new rule. We don’t know how many women will actually be affected by it. One survey showed that more than 10 percent of employers with more than 200 employees would stop covering contraception if it weren’t required by law. It’s not clear, though, how many would actually follow through. The administration estimates that only nine employers who use the accommodation process now will make use of this new rule to become fully exempt. It thinks fewer than 10 will end coverage based on “moral objections.” It believes no more than 120,000 women would be affected over all.

Regardless of the numbers, many women’s and public advocates assailed the new order as an attack on women’s rights. It’s notable that one of the arguments the administration uses to support the move is that “the government already engages in dozens of programs that subsidize contraception” for low-income women. The government is trying to reduce funding to those programs as well.

We aren’t going to settle many of those arguments here. But we can move the scientific and medical ones forward. There is ample evidence that contraception works, that reducing its expense leads to more women who use it appropriately, and that using it doesn’t lead to riskier sexual behavior.",Doubtful Science Behind Arguments to Restrict Birth Control Access,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/upshot/doubtful-science-behind-arguments-to-restrict-birth-control-access.html

On Tuesday, the day after the slightly surreal public tussle between Ivana and Melania Trump over who actually was first lady (Mrs. Trump #1 joked it was she; the current occupant of the White House was not amused), the official first lady made a visit to an opioid clinic in West Virginia, signaling that the drug epidemic would be a focus for the East Wing.

It was a classic first lady moment, and it’s clearly an important cause (less controversial, perhaps, than the cyberbullying idea), but also classic was Mrs. Trump’s choice of dress for the occasion: a green shirtdress from Cefinn, the brand created by Samantha Cameron.

Yes, that Samantha Cameron: the former first lady of Britain. Or the equivalent; there is no formal first lady title there.

Still, it was, in effect, an appearance that quietly doubled-down on the first lady messaging.

Earlier this year Ms. Cameron introduced Cefinn — the name derives from a combination of her children’s initials — some months after her husband, David, resigned as prime minister after the country voted to leave the European Union.

That makes it a relatively accessible public-image choice on the Trump continuum, another interesting signal from a first lady whose clothes, such as the $51,500 Dolce & Gabbana coat that she wore in May during the Group of 7 summit meeting in Sicily, have tended toward the gilded and out-of-reach. And, like the Timberland boots she wore this month in Puerto Rico, it demonstrates some sensitivity to the reality of the place she was visiting.

The skyscraper was born in the United States, but in recent years, it has grown and flourished in Asia. Countries there recognize that to be seen as a player on the global stage, it helps to have tall buildings.

Over a century ago, New York and Chicago demonstrated that the skyscraper is, fundamentally, a solution to an economic problem: how to allow for hundreds, if not thousands, of people and businesses to be at the same place at the same time. Urban clustering, especially in a high-tech world, is more important than ever. By promoting density, skyscrapers confer a competitive advantage and allow a city to become a beacon of commerce.

In April, President Xi Jinping of China announced plans for a new city, Xiongan, not far from Beijing. A kind of Chinese field of dreams, Xiongan is to be built on what is now hundreds of square miles of farmland and towns, house millions of people and be a center for technology jobs. Like the cities it’s being modeled after — Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, and Shanghai, particularly its Pudong neighborhood — it may someday claim the world’s tallest skyscrapers. The Ping An Finance tower in Shenzhen, completed this year, at 115 stories, is the fourth-tallest building in the world, while the Shanghai Tower, completed in 2015, at 128 stories, is the second-tallest skyscraper on the planet.

Since the 1990s, the world’s tallest buildings have been built in the East. The current prize holder — the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (828 meters, or about 2,717 feet, 2010) — will be soon be surpassed by the Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia (1,000 meters, or about 3,281 feet, 2020). Nine of the 10 world’s tallest buildings are in Asia. In addition, the continent now has more 150-meter (about 492 feet) or taller buildings than the rest of the continents combined.

Many people fear the companies will be able to translate their hold on key digital platforms into wholesale ownership of adjacent industries that depend on those platforms, giving them wider economic and social power.

The entertainment industry is a good place to assess those claims because in different ways, the Five have spent years building platforms for the distribution of art, culture and media. Facebook runs the news; Google’s YouTube has videos and music; Microsoft’s Xbox has games; Amazon runs books, movies and TV (and, through its web-hosting service, AWS, hosts much else, including Netflix); and Apple has pretty much of the same, plus all those apps.

Yet in entertainment, we also see the limits of their efforts to push into new territory. Though their technologies have altered nearly everything about how we buy and experience popular culture, the Five themselves have not been the greatest beneficiaries of the changes.

They are pouring money into entertainment, but they have been cornered by nimbler start-ups like Netflix and Spotify. Amazon has struggled to make a hit show, while Apple’s plans for original TV are perpetually around the corner. (It has now struck a deal to revive “Amazing Stories,” the 1980s Steven Spielberg series; there’s no word on when it will air.) All of the Five have labored to create some killer position in the tumultuous new marketplaces their platforms have enabled.

Several times in conversations with people in Hollywood, I heard the tech people referred to as “dumb money” — the sort of outsiders (in the past, they came from oil, then from finance) who parade through town looking to call the shots. One Hollywood executive who has worked often with tech companies told me: “I wouldn’t say we’ve looked at them with fear, no.”

The Five’s struggles in entertainment, if they persist, suggest that they can be as clueless about the changes wrought by technology as the rest of us — that they do not quite understand, and haven’t yet begun to master, how to translate their technological power into wider cultural power.

Not long ago, this story looked a lot more open-and-shut. With the iPod and iTunes, Apple acquired dominance over a music industry that was struggling to respond to the digital age. Amazon eclipsed Barnes & Noble as the biggest boogeyman of the indie bookstore; for years, it fought bruising battles with the publishing industry over sales contracts that publishers said were too onerous. Through YouTube, Google gained control over not just funny cat videos, but also the modern replacement for radio. (People watch a lot of music videos on YouTube.) And Facebook has become the world’s most popular source of news, a position that has consumed its leaders over much of the last year.

There’s no doubt that technology has upended the economics of modern cultural businesses. In a recent polemic, “Move Fast and Break Things,” Jonathan Taplin, the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California (and a former rock band manager and movie producer), points out that musicians could once make a decent living off their royalty checks.

Digital technology has now completely undercut that business. YouTube has made every song available online, and even though many artists are paid a cut of the ads placed on YouTube (the company said it paid out $1 billion last year), the money is nothing close to what artists got from selling records.

Mr. Taplin sees what has happened in music as a harbinger for much of the rest of culture. “The rise of the digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries in our country,” he wrote.

But there is another side to the story. As I’ve argued before, while musicians have had to find new sources of revenue, the rise of online subscriptions and a new consumer willingness to pay have led to an explosion of new cultural voices.

Meanwhile, some earlier doomsaying has not come true: Indie bookstores and print books are making a comeback, while publishers are enjoying record profits. And the tech giants’ eagerness to create entertainment marketplaces has led to a bonanza for some artists. To compete for new members, Apple, Tidal and other streaming services are paying out lavish bonuses; Apple paid Chance the Rapper $500,000 for two weeks of exclusive access to his latest album.

The tech-industry money train is making its biggest hauls in Hollywood. “There are so many new markets for talent and writers to go to, and the creators here love that,” said Marty Kaplan, a professor of entertainment, media and society at the U.S.C. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. “Instead of having seven buyers for your idea, there are now more like 20 — and that makes everybody happy.”

This story may sound puzzling. The tech giants are the most sophisticated media companies in the world, so why, after prying open their wallets, have they struggled to capture Hollywood?

It’s because technology is not all that matters. The Five acquired their power by mastering the tech industry. They achieved dominance in a field that’s won with information, data and precision.

But even though they now control valuable platforms, as they move to areas that require them to stretch their skills they are finding that they won’t be able to roll in and take over. Several people in Hollywood told me that many of the Five just didn’t seem to “get” the movie and TV business. They had brought Northern California’s tech ideas to Southern California’s entertainment party, and did not understand the value of imagination, talent and subjective inspiration.

This myopia is part of a pattern that will repeat itself often in this series. You see it in how Facebook got caught off guard by how it was used during the election, or in YouTube’s surprise that some of its biggest stars were pushing hateful ideas on its platform.

The tech giants have upended much of society, but even they have difficulty understanding and navigating the chaos of the new platforms they have built.

In labeling Mr. Corker “liddle,” the president was evidently returning to a theme. He considered Mr. Corker for secretary of state during the transition after last year’s election but was reported to have told associates that Mr. Corker, at 5-foot-7, was too short to be the nation’s top diplomat. Instead, Mr. Trump picked Rex W. Tillerson, who is several inches taller but whose own relationship with the president has deteriorated to the point that he was said to have called Mr. Trump a “moron.”

Mr. Tillerson initially did not deny it, but later he had a spokeswoman insist that he did not say it. Mr. Trump chose to believe the denial, or at least said he did, but in an interview published Tuesday, he insisted that even if it was true, he could prove that he was actually smarter than his secretary of state.

“I think it’s fake news,” Mr. Trump told Forbes magazine. “But if he did that, I guess we’ll have to compare I.Q. tests. And I can tell you who is going to win.”

Mr. Trump later denied that he had demeaned his secretary of state. “I didn’t undercut anybody. I don’t believe in undercutting people,” he told reporters, in a comment that must have amused the many people he has undercut since taking office.

At the time, Mr. Trump was sitting next to Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state who happened to be visiting the Oval Office on Tuesday.

He made no mention of the other dust-up in his household. In an interview aired on Monday to promote her new memoir, Ivana Trump, his first wife, told ABC News that “I’m basically first Trump wife, O.K.? I’m first lady, O.K.?”

That did not sit well with Melania Trump, his third wife and the actual first lady, who issued a retort through a spokeswoman dismissing what she called “attention-seeking and self-serving noise.”

Andy Cohen, the creator of the “Real Housewives” reality television show franchise, found that too rich. “This is actually happening,” he wrote on Twitter. “All the wives are fighting. Even I AM SPEECHLESS.”

Mr. Trump’s gibe at Mr. Corker echoed his name calling during the presidential campaign when he labeled Senator Marco Rubio of Florida “Little Marco,” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas “Lyin’ Ted” and Hillary Clinton “Crooked Hillary.” He has used belittling nicknames to diminish political foes since taking office, as well — think “Cryin’ Chuck” Schumer, “Psycho Joe” Scarborough and “Little Rocket Man” Kim Jong-un — but has generally avoided doing so with powerful Republican committee chairmen who control appointments and legislation.

It was not clear what Mr. Trump meant when he said The Times set up Mr. Corker by recording him. Angry that Mr. Corker had suggested he was an agent of “chaos,” Mr. Trump lashed out at the senator on Sunday by saying he “didn’t have the guts” to run for another term. A Times reporter then interviewed Mr. Corker by telephone and recorded the call with the senator’s knowledge and consent. Mr. Corker’s staff also recorded the call, and he said he wanted The Times to do the same.

“I know they’re recording it, and I hope you are, too,” Mr. Corker told the reporter.

During the interview, Mr. Corker said Mr. Trump’s advisers were struggling to keep the president under control. “I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it’s a situation of trying to contain him,” he said. He also said Mr. Trump’s reckless statements could put the country on a path “towards World War III.”

Mr. Trump on Tuesday rejected the suggestion that he was risking a nuclear war. “We were on the wrong path before,” he said, presumably referring to North Korea. “All you have to do is take a look. If you look over the last 25 years through numerous administrations, we were on a path to a very big problem, a problem like this world has never seen. We’re on the right path right now, believe me.”

But what a path. Ms. Ouellette, who has written or edited several books on reality television, including “Better Living Through Reality TV,” said Mr. Trump the president had gone even further than Mr. Trump the reality show star ever did.

“This has exceeded what would have been allowed on ‘The Apprentice,’” she said. “It’s almost a magnification. It’s like reality TV unleashed.

The first sign of trouble comes at the same time as a hint of potential salvation. In San Pedro Sula, Oribe Peralta gives Mexico a 1-0 lead over Honduras at about the same moment United States defender Omar Gonzalez swings his leg toward Trinidad forward Shahdon Winchester in Couva. Gonzalez and Winchester both are racing to be first to a routine cross, but Winchester gets there first and the ball ricochets off him, then off Gonzalez’s shin, and then in a spinning loop over goalkeeper Tim Howard.

The Americans are stunned, and suddenly — improbably — trailing by 1-0. “One of the most unlucky goals ever, I think,” Gonzalez says, “and it’s one that will haunt me forever.”

Bradley calls the goal “a killer.” On the sideline, Coach Bruce Arena fumes. “We foolishly brought Trinidad into the game,” he says after the match.

United States fans start rooting hard for Mexico and Costa Rica.

34’ Honduras Pulls Even

Bad news. Alberth Elis scores in San Pedro Sula, heading in a free kick at the back post to pull Honduras even.

36’ Costa Rica Helps U.S.

And suddenly, good news. In Panama City, Johan Venegas runs on to a through ball and deftly chips it over the sliding goalkeeper to give Costa Rica a 1-0 lead. A Panama loss guarantees the Americans at least a playoff spot.

37’ U.S. Goes Down, 0-2

The other games keep breaking the United States’ way. Carlos Vela restores Mexico’s lead against Honduras in San Pedro Sula. The goal is especially welcome to the Americans in Couva, where Alvin Jones’s screamer of a shot has just put Trinidad and Tobago ahead by 2-0 over a lethargic, and now extremely nervous, United States.

After Jones nearly fools Howard again from long range, the Americans are rattled, and the break is a welcome respite.

“We talked at halftime about a strong response,” Bradley says later, “and I still feel like everything was there for us. And it was.”

47’ U.S. Comes Out Swinging

The United States roars out of the locker room, with Christian Pulisic freeing himself to score less than 90 seconds into the second half. A few steps away, Jozy Altidore tells himself another goal is coming. “At that point in the game, you thought, maybe we have a chance here,” he says. But things are about to take a dark turn in Central America.

52’ Controversy in Panama City

Panamanian defender Román Torres heads a corner kick toward the back post, where it is knocked down amid a scramble. His teammate Blas Pérez tries to get to the ball, but a defender hauls him down, and another lying on the goal line blocks its path into the net. The ball never crosses the line, but the referee mistakenly allows the goal.

Instead of another corner kick, Panama has tied the score at 1-1. When an own goal a minute later in San Pedro Sula ties the score between Honduras and Mexico, American fans quickly start studying the qualifying math. If Panama and Honduras can score again, and the Americans can’t, the United States is out.

60’ Honduras Takes Lead Over Mexico

The first shoe drops in San Pedro Sula. Romell Quioto of Honduras slips behind Mexico’s back line and runs down a long pass. Spinning at the top of the penalty area, he turns and fires his team into the lead. The celebrations, given what that lead could mean, are suitably bonkers.

With a half-hour to play, Honduras can almost taste the World Cup, and now it’s Panama that really needs a goal. If Panama scores, the United States is out. If the United States scores, Panama is out.

“It didn’t matter,” Arena says of why he never checks the scores during the game. “It never mattered to us — the score of the other games — at any time today.”

72’ U.S. Makes Changes

Arena has already sent on a forward, Clint Dempsey, for a midfielder, Paul Arriola, at halftime. Now, still needing a second goal, he wants another set of fresh legs, so midfielder Kellyn Acosta comes on for left back Jorge Villafaña.

Another chance: Benny Feilhaber, who entered minutes earlier as Arena’s last throw of the dice, wins a header in the goal mouth but drives it downward, where Foncette bats it away.

Just then, in Panama City, Torres, the burly central defender from the Seattle Sounders, is chewing up turf as he runs down the center-forward channel like a striker ....

88’ Goal! Panama!

Torres scores a late winner for Panama. Bedlam in Panama City.

It’s all over but the shouting now, and Americans are doing most of that. In a split second, a difficult feat — qualifying for the World Cup — that has become something of a birthright for a generation of United States fans has vaporized.

90’ The Door Closes for U.S.

Five minutes of extra time for the Americans in Couva, but it produces only three yellow cards. In San Pedro Sula, there are seven minutes added, an agonizing wait for Hondurans eager to celebrate.

In Panama City, the whistle blows. A full stadium still smiling from Torres’s goal turns up the volume even more to celebrate the country’s first World Cup berth.

“We did it!” said Pérez, Panama’s 36-year-old striker. “As our national anthem says, ‘We have finally won.’ ” Torres, the newly shirtless national hero, poses for selfies with fans. The country’s president gives everyone Wednesday off, declaring it a national holiday.

They are roaring in San Pedro Sula, too. Mexico has been beaten, 3-2, but Honduras Coach Jorge Luis Pinto, the well-traveled Colombian manager who led Costa Rica to the quarterfinals in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, is pulling the handbrake. Honduras will face a home-and-home playoff against Australia in November. “We have won something, but let’s not go crazy,” Pinto said. “You have to go play the playoff.”

Meanwhile, in a tiny conference room at the Ato Boldon Stadium in Trinidad, and then along the edge of a single-lane delivery tunnel just outside the room’s glass door, the mood is much more grim. Arena, U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati and four senior players take turns choosing words to place in front of the term of the day: disappointment. Arena goes with “highly.” Gulati uses “extraordinarily.” Bradley, finally emerging from doping control nearly two hours after the final whistle, declares himself “incredibly” disappointed.

Arena gives a 10-minute news conference in which he says he accepts responsibility for the defeat, and the failure to qualify. Several United States players, including Dempsey and Pulisic, use the focus on Arena as cover to slip through the tunnel and onto the team bus — thereby avoiding reporters.

Gonzalez, stung with guilt, steps into a huddle of reporters.

“I just want to say sorry to the fans,” he says. “All the U.S. fans that were pulling for us, that wanted to go to Russia, that believed in us. We let down an entire nation today.”

No one seems to know how to follow up a statement like that, so Gonzalez drops his eyes, steps aside and walks the lonely road to the team bus. It waits to collect Altidore, and then Howard, before lurching away.","How the United States Missed the World Cup, Minute by Minute",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/sports/soccer/usmnt-world-cup.html

The Weinstein Company’s board said in a statement on Tuesday that it was “shocked and dismayed” by the allegations. “These alleged actions are antithetical to human decency,” the board said. One-third of the company’s all-male board had resigned on Friday.

Also on Tuesday, Georgina Chapman, Mr. Weinstein’s wife, told People magazine that she was leaving him. And the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts said it had decided to reject his earlier pledge to fund a $5 million endowment for female filmmakers.

Mr. Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was then in charge of Disney’s movie divisions, bought Miramax in 1993 for $80 million. At the time, Miramax was becoming a superpower in the art film business by turning offbeat, inexpensive movies into mainstream hits. It was in 1992, for instance, that Miramax released the micro-budgeted thriller “The Crying Game,” which collected $62 million at the box office, or $110 million in today’s dollars.

On Tuesday, Mr. Katzenberg released an email that he sent to Mr. Weinstein on Sunday and that said he was “sickened” by the allegations. “There appear to be two Harvey Weinsteins … one that I have known well, appreciated and admired and another that I have not known at all,” Mr. Katzenberg’s email said.

Robert A. Iger, Disney’s current chief executive, said in a separate statement, “Harvey Weinstein’s reported behavior is abhorrent and unacceptable, and it has no place in our society.” Disney sold Miramax in 2010 for $660 million.

The flurry of comments came five days after a New York Times investigation chronicled a hidden history of sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Weinstein, including settlements paid, often involving former employees, over three decades. On Sunday, the Weinstein Company fired him, citing “new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein.”

In response to the allegations, Mr. Weinstein has acknowledged that his behavior “caused a lot of pain.” But a spokeswoman, Sallie Hoffmeister, also said he “unequivocally denied” any allegations of nonconsensual sex.

Disney’s purchase of Miramax included provisions that shielded Miramax from corporate interference. The Weinsteins were given the ability to “greenlight” films with budgets of tens of millions of dollars without approval from Disney. Miramax also got to retain its own chief financial officer, head of human relations and general counsel.

According to reports at the time, the brothers demanded the autonomy, arguing that their films — which would include rough-and-rowdy titles like “Pulp Fiction,” released in 1994 — could not be incubated inside a corporate environment.

While with Disney, Miramax released more than 300 movies, which generated $5 billion in North American ticket sales and tallied at least 220 Academy Award nominations and 53 wins, including best picture Oscars for “Shakespeare in Love,” “The English Patient” and “Chicago.”

But Disney also clashed bitterly with the Weinsteins, who took advantage of their autonomy to start an expensive magazine, Talk, without approval and to move forward with the political documentary “Fahrenheit 9/11” despite being told that Disney would not distribute it. At the time, executives at Disney said Miramax had hidden its financing of that film by not including it on monthly reports about films in development; Miramax officials countered that they were aboveboard.","Disney, Hillary Clinton and the Obamas Condemn Weinstein",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/business/media/disney-hillary-clinton-and-the-obamas-condemn-weinstein.html

“Otherwise, someone else is going to be putting a plan in place for you.”Clients of a firm like Wilmington Trust are wealthy and receive a higher level of attention from advisers.
But there are plenty of web-based services that aim to help anyone plan.
They “stressed to us children that life is never guaranteed and one should always plan for the future,” she said.
“For practicality and having no children, I recognized that at some point in my life, I will need help,” she said.","Another option is disability insurance, which is intended for healthy working-age people, who are more likely to become disabled than die.

Disability insurance is more expensive than life insurance, but these two planning solutions require comparatively little effort. Most people understand they should have both forms of insurance, though not everyone chooses to buy it.

The planning becomes more complex with the so-called softer issues: the questions to which there are multiple but sometimes conflicting answers. Who should be contacted if something goes wrong? How do I want my personal possessions divided? What are my thoughts about going into a nursing home? Do I want to be resuscitated if I go into cardiac arrest? Any thoughts on a funeral?

“The best way to plan for an event you can’t control is to put your own plan in place,” said Sharon Klein, president of the New York metropolitan region for Wilmington Trust. “Otherwise, someone else is going to be putting a plan in place for you.”

Clients of a firm like Wilmington Trust are wealthy and receive a higher level of attention from advisers. But there are plenty of web-based services that aim to help anyone plan.

Everplans is one site. It guides users through a list of documents and discussions that need to be considered: wills, insurance, a health care directive, passwords for email and social media accounts, funeral planning. But it also has sections for storing keepsakes like family recipes or for leaving instructions about pet care or how things work in the home.

“We want to help people think of the unexpected,” said Abby Schneiderman, co-founder and co-chief executive of Everplans. “It could be anything unexpected. Natural disaster, flood, fire, illness, a death — you don’t know. The idea is: Don’t wait until it’s too late.”

The service, which costs individuals $75 a year, prods users to do more. It offers a 10-minute “just in case” plan that asks people to put down as much information as they know from memory, Ms Schneiderman said.

“We want to be a one-stop shop, but we also try to get people to take it a piece at a time,” she said. For instance, the service sends out electronic reminders to prompt users to take one more step.

Final Roadmap is another such site. It was born out of a nurse’s frustration with families being unprepared for the decisions and logistical considerations that happen at the end of life.

Steve Byrne, a co-founder of Final Roadmap, said the website, which charges a one-time fee of $249, held legal and financial documents, instructions for death, and messages for loved ones.

“All of those notifications can prevent problems that supersede money problems,” he said. Without proper instructions, those decisions “can blow up and result in siblings not ever talking to each other.”

Wealthier people tend to rely on advisers who are privy to a raft of information to help them, especially when it comes to tax planning, which could become more urgent if President Trump’s proposal to repeal the estate and other transfer taxes is passed. Adam von Poblitz, head of Citi Private Bank’s North American trust division, said the repeal of a tax that took 40 percent of a couple’s assets above the current $11 million exemption would increase the need for creating a trust because more money would pass to heirs.

“You need trusts to protect the assets from creditors but also from the beneficiaries themselves,” he said. “That protection aspect doesn’t go away” if the estate tax is repealed.

Not planning for the expected can also cause unnecessary confusion and stress.

“There’s a growing emphasis placed on how do you want to live the end of your days,” said Rachel J. Sherman, vice president of client service at Market Street Trust Company, which began as the family office for the founders of Corning Glass Works. “It needs more attention. People don’t want to be a burden.”

Monette Booth, 73, who lives in the Virgin Islands, said she had learned from her mother and aunt to keep her affairs in order. They “stressed to us children that life is never guaranteed and one should always plan for the future,” she said.

After her husband, Peter, a retired Corning executive, died in 2011, she stepped up her planning to ensure that she could grow old where she wanted, that she would not burden her relatives and that her assets would eventually be disposed of as she wished.

“For practicality and having no children, I recognized that at some point in my life, I will need help,” she said. “It’s taken a load off my mind to have made the decision.”

Ms. Booth said she had become part of a “circle of friends” in which she and others shared information that someone would need if one of them became incapacitated.

She said the planning was not difficult to contemplate. “I thought it made a lot of sense,” she said. “Otherwise, one is being an ostrich and not paying attention. This is part of an inevitable process.”

Most people are not this pragmatic, let alone proactive and organized. One solution for affluent people is a revocable trust, which can be used as a repository for financial assets but also documents to guide the family.

Ms. Klein of Wilmington Trust said many clients had revocable trusts drafted so that they became irrevocable in the event of disability or death. She said they could then function as a more sophisticated power of attorney; they could also help avoid the probate process of a will that delays access to the assets.

Yet deciding what to do to prepare, for example, for the possibility of becoming incapacitated by illness is a test of managing expectations around the unexpected. Jeffrey Maurer, chief executive of Evercore Wealth Management, said he presented the case rationally.

“My major concern for clients, friends and family, for myself, is what is the likelihood, if one were a gambling person, that I’m going to outlive my current cognitive abilities?” he said.

The answer determines what protections people should put in place, if they can afford them.

Plans can have limits. Barry Sinrod, who retired early as a market researcher and went on to write several best-selling books, said he and his wife, Shelly, had thought they planned well in case one of them became incapacitated. They even had a provision for assisted suicide.

His wife learned in 2003 that she had Parkinson’s disease but managed well until she learned that she had dementia. By 2010, he said, she did not know him or their children. He looked for someone to assist his wife in dying but found there was no one who would do it, because by that point, she was not competent to appear before a judge.

She died in 2014. “I said, I don’t want this to happen to me,” said Mr. Sinrod, 75, of Delray Beach, Fla.

When he met his second wife, whom he married in January, he brought up his desire to die with dignity, he said.

“Now, I have this document that says my second wife will take me to the Netherlands to die if my kids won’t take me,” Mr. Sinrod said. “My kids don’t like the idea of this, but they understand.”

Now his friends and family are struggling to rewind the events of the summer, asking what they, or Mr. Friedman, could have done in response to signs of trouble.

“I wish I could have done more,” said the director Michael Greif (“Dear Evan Hansen,” “Rent”). “I wish I had known more. I wish I could have interceded more. I wish that I could have found a way to let Michael let me be a better friend to him, and I regret that I wasn’t able to do that.”

Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater, where Mr. Friedman worked off and on for 20 years, called his death “a real warning shot across the bow for anybody who thinks this disease isn’t deadly any more.”

“It just killed one of the most brilliant and promising people in the American theater,” he said.

‘Things Were Getting Better’

Mr. Friedman had a new job this year, one seemingly perfect for a musical-theater obsessive. He was the artistic director of Encores! Off-Center, an annual New York City Center summer program that presents short-run concert revivals of Off Broadway shows.

“The guy was an encyclopedia,” said Anne Kauffman, who met Mr. Friedman in 1999 at the Williamstown Theater Festival, and who he chose to direct his first Encores! production, “Assassins.”

“He wanted his pals there — it felt like, we had been children together, and now he’d got a grown-up job, and he was like, ‘Hey, do this with me’,” she said.

Tall, gangly and gay, he was an outsized presence — exuberant and emotional, witty and irreverent, opinionated and self-doubting. “When he was at City Center, you knew he was in the halls,” said Arlene Shuler, the performing arts center’s president and chief executive.

But it was also obvious to his collaborators that he was not well. Always thin, he now seemed gaunt. He complained of recurrent gastrointestinal trouble.

Most disturbing, there were purple splotches on his face. Several people who saw him early this summer said they thought the spots looked like the lesions associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma, but then dismissed that thought.

“Of course the first thing you think of is KS, because of all those images from the ’80s, but then the other part of you is, ‘It’s 2017, so of course that’s not what it is; he has some other issue’,” said Trip Cullman, a director and close friend. “I was very concerned, and would try to bring it up as much as I could, but I also knew how much he valued privacy, and didn’t want to be pushy. I obviously very much regret that now.”

In mid-July, Mr. Friedman made it to the first two performances of “Assassins,” but with obvious difficulty.

“The day of the opening, we walked up five stairs, and got to the top, and Michael was completely winded,” said Sam Pinkleton, a choreographer and the associate artistic director of Encores! Off-Center. “Then he pulled me and others aside and told us that he was diagnosed positive. My gut response was, I know a lot of people who are H.I.V. positive, and this is not what they’re like — this is somebody whose body is in the process of being cannibalized.”

On July 14, Mr. Friedman showed up for a meet-and-greet with the cast of a second show, “The Bubbly Black Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin,” and then went straight to the hospital.

“He said he had HIV, he was going to the emergency room, and could I bring him a phone charger,” recalled Daniel Goldstein, a director and writer who also befriended him at Williamstown. “They had caught it at a rather advanced stage, but the drugs were working, and we all thought things were getting better.”

Mr. Friedman, who had health insurance as an employee of the Public Theater, where he was an artist-in-residence and director of an audience engagement program, had known he was H.I.V. positive only since early July, when he was tested by his primary care physician, according to his sister, Marion Friedman Young. He began taking antiretroviral medications that month.

His first hospital stay lasted 10 days, before he was sent home to recuperate. His immune system had been compromised, but his friends and family were hopeful that over time he would make a recovery. By text, he kept friends updated on his progress. By email, he was outlining plans for next summer.

“Every part of me expected him to break through the door of City Center, with an IV hooked up to his arm, shouting something, and the fact that he didn’t frightened me, a lot,” Mr. Pinkleton said. “This was somebody I’d watched be an aircraft carrier for 10 years, and he turned into a baby bird.”

On Aug. 19, he was readmitted to NYU Langone Medical Center with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He spent the rest of his life in the intensive care unit, intubated and periodically sedated. Family was with him daily; friends visited as much as possible.

When he was awake, he would converse by writing down his thoughts and showing them to visitors. But there were moments of stillness as well. “Often we were just being silent,” Mr. Goldstein said, “holding hands and watching the U.S. Open.”

In early September, his doctors detected another infection, and his body was not strong enough to fight it off. The consensus among his friends is that Mr. Friedman had waited too long to seek medical attention.

“As near as I can tell, he hadn’t actually been to a doctor or gotten tested for a couple of years, and only in July did he find out that he was H.I.V. positive,” Mr. Eustis said “That’s just staggering — staggeringly wrong of Michael, staggeringly upsetting.”

Upsetting, and poignant too. Mr. Friedman and several close collaborators were hoping to pursue a sequel to “A Chorus Line.” The original musical, about a group of auditioning dancers, was set in 1975; the sequel would have been set a decade later, as that same generation of dreamers was laid waste by AIDS.

‘Make This Piece for Him’

The cast of “The Abominables,” tricked out in hockey uniforms, was in-line skating around the stage at the Children’s Theater Company in Minneapolis, a few hours before opening. One of them was costumed as a Yeti.

It was Friday, Sept. 15, six days after Mr. Friedman died, and the week had been wildly emotional. On Sunday, the theater’s artistic director, Peter C. Brosius, had informed the cast that Mr. Friedman, the show’s composer and lyricist, had died the day before. He chose his words carefully, because many of the actors were children and had never met Mr. Friedman.

“The American theater has lost an original voice,” he recalled saying. “We’ve been given a great honor and responsibility to make this piece for him.”

Then on Tuesday, the show’s director and book writer, Steven Cosson, had set aside his own grief — he was Mr. Friedman’s most frequent collaborator and a close friend — to urge the cast to have fun with the show. “I didn’t want anyone to feel bad about enjoying this play,” Mr. Cosson said. “That’s why we made it, and that’s what he would want to happen.”

So now it was time to open, and it was hard to untangle the excitement from the sadness. “It’s on us to give it the life it deserves,” said Reed Sigmund, one of the adult performers.

“The Abominables,” as a musical for family audiences, was a new venture for Mr. Friedman, whose astonishing output had already included musicalizations of Shakespeare’s comedy “Love’s Labour’s Lost” and Jonathan Lethem’s novel “The Fortress of Solitude.”

He was a founding associate artist with The Civilians, a downtown documentary theater troupe, and with them he had honed his gift for making music out of everyday speech, writing songs for shows about evangelicals, gentrification and the pornography industry, among other subjects.

The Minneapolis theater — one of the nation’s leading children’s theaters — had commissioned the Civilians six years ago to produce a work with local flavor.

Informed by interviews with Minnesotans, “The Abominables” is a clever, zany and silly show about an adolescent hockey player whose ambitions are thwarted when a talented Yeti comes to town. It is also about the culture of success, and learning to accept defeat.

A few hours before the opening, his collaborators honored Mr. Friedman with teary speeches over a dinner (Minnesota-themed, with a Tater Tot hotdish). “He feels very present,” Mr. Cosson said. “I’m talking with him in my mind.”

The show’s New York-based costume designer, Jessica Pabst, was wistful as she sat in the theater’s 746-seat auditorium. “You don’t think of your contemporaries dying,” she said. “You think of people getting sick, and then they’ll get better. And I couldn’t wait to show him pictures of the Yeti.”

But Ms. Pabst said she took heart watching children respond to the show. “These are the next generation of Michael Friedman superfans,” she said. “These children will go home singing these songs, and that feels like an unbelievable legacy and gift.”

Unfinished

Mr. Friedman had much more he wanted to say.

“There is a mountain of stuff — notebooks and sheet music and ideas, an extraordinary archive of finished and half-finished works, and the kernels of ideas,” Mr. Cullman said.

Fully drafted are “The King of Kong,” a musical adaptation of the video game documentary, with Alex Timbers directing and Robert Askins writing, and “American Pop,” a cultural history written with Mr. Cullman on commission from the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. “All the President’s Men,” which Mr. Friedman was developing with the producers Ira Pittelman and Tom Hulce, was still in its early stages.

And then there were the still-under-discussion ideas: the “Chorus Line” sequel, with Mr. Cosson and Mr. Pinkleton, as well as a modern adaptation of “The Magic Flute,” for the Public Theater and the Metropolitan Opera.

“There is this grief at the work that won’t be finished — all the things he was talking about that I wanted to watch him work through,” said Will Frears, a director and writer and one of Mr. Friedman’s closest friends. “He wrote about difficult things in difficult ways, and my great wish is that the completed work moves forward and remains risky — that it doesn’t get turned into some nice warm thing, but remains an exhilarating and difficult look at the world.”

Now there will be memorials — the Public is planning one this month for friends and colleagues — and revivals; Mr. Eustis vows “to do everything I can to push his work to the forefront.” Kurt Deutsch of Sh-K-Boom/Ghostlight Records is working with Mr. Cosson to preserve unreleased songs; Ms. Kauffman is collecting audio recordings of Mr. Friedman teaching songs and giving advice to actors and directors.

One week after his death, on Sept. 16, several hundred of Mr. Friedman’s family and friends — theater world dignitaries, of course, but also his prom date, and a third grade classmate, and the high school choir teacher — gathered in the austere meetinghouse at Germantown Friends School, a private school in Philadelphia where Mr. Friedman had been educated from kindergarten through 12th grade.

He was remembered with stories, songs and reminiscences: he played a pig in a school musical; he started a madrigals club; he loved “My Spirit Sang All Day,” a composition by Gerald Finzi adapted from poetry by Robert Bridges. At one point, a playwright, Eisa Davis, posed a question: “I just wonder if Michael loved himself as much as we loved him?”

It was a Quaker meeting, full of silences between the speakers.

“I think, weirdly, silence is the thing Michael was most afraid of,” Mr. Goldstein said. “If there was space, he would fill it.”","‘Brilliant,’ 41 and Lost to AIDS: The Theater World Asks Why",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/theater/michael-friedman-aids-death-theater.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Intel said its intent “was to convey the performance capabilities of our processors through the visual metaphor of a sprinter,” but acknowledged, “Unfortunately, our execution did not deliver our intended message and in fact proved to be insensitive and insulting.”

Dove, May 2011

In 2011, Dove was criticized for another ad: this one showing three women standing side by side, each with lighter skin than the woman next to her. Behind them were signs reading “before” and “after”; the “before” sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the “after” sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.

Edelman, the public relations company representing Dove, said in a statement to Gawker: “All three women are intended to demonstrate the ‘after’ product benefit. We do not condone any activity or imagery that intentionally insults any audience.”

The fact that the most recent ad was Dove’s second to cause offense was not lost on social media users.

Popchips, May 2012

Popchips drew fire in 2012 for an ad in which Ashton Kutcher played several characters — including a Bollywood producer named Raj, complete with brownface and an Indian accent.

Popchips initially urged viewers to watch the ad in the humorous “spirit it was intended.” Later, its chief executive, Keith Belling, said in a statement: “Our team worked hard to create a lighthearted parody featuring a variety of characters that was meant to provide a few laughs. We did not intend to offend anyone. I take full responsibility and apologize to anyone we offended.”

Qiaobi, May 2016

In a 2016 commercial for the Chinese company Qiaobi’s laundry detergent, an Asian woman shoves a detergent pod into a black man’s mouth and puts him in a washing machine, from which he emerges as a light-skinned Asian.

A spokeswoman for Qiaobi, Xu Chunyan, was unapologetic. “We did this for some sensational effect,” she said at the time. “If we just show laundry like all the other advertisements, ours will not stand out.”

Nivea, April 2017

In April, the skin care company Nivea released a deodorant ad that read, “White is purity.” White supremacists on the internet took note, with one 4chan user writing, “Nivea has chosen our side.”

A representative of Nivea’s parent company, Beiersdorf, said it had “never intended to hurt anybody or to raise any wrong interpretation.”

But, like Dove, Nivea had offended before.

Six years earlier, after apologizing for an ad that showed a black man preparing to throw away his old Afro-wearing head behind the words “Re-civilize yourself,” it promised to review “current development and approval processes” in order to “avoid any kind of future misleading interpretations.”",Dove Drops an Ad Accused of Racism,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/dove-ad-racist.html

The record features big talk about populism and political realignment, plus a dismissal of the white identitarians and racists drawn to his flame as just incidental idiots ... but it never seems to cash out in anything except a return to empty, race-baiting culture war.

At the White House, Bannon did not manage to inject much heterodoxy into any part of the same old, same old Republican agenda. But he did encourage the president to pick racialized fights at every chance. On the evidence so far, his new grass-roots populism promises to be more of the same: a notional commitment to some nebulous new agenda, with white-identity politics and the fear of liberalism supplying the real cultural-political cement.

Especially because the would-be senators he’s recruiting are a mix of cynics and fanatics who seem to share no coherent vision, just a common mix of ambition and resentment. A nationalist-populist realignment might be possible in theory, and Trump may have even shown how it could work — but if you believe figures like Roy Moore and Erik Prince are going to succeed where Trump is obviously failing, I have some affidavits attesting to Harvey Weinstein’s innocence to sell you.

Which is not to say Bannon is delusional. He and his allies are the latest group to recognize the void at the heart of the contemporary Republican Party, the vacuum that somebody, somehow needs to fill. The activists and enforcers of the Tea Party era tried with a libertarian style of populism. Paul Ryan tried with his warmed-over Jack Kempism. My friends the “reform conservatives” tried with blueprints for tax credits and wage subsidies. They all failed, and the Bannon crew actually got furthest, in the sense that they got the most unlikely figure imaginable elected president on something resembling their platform.

But now they, too, need to reckon with a reality that has confounded every kind of Republican reformer since Barack Obama was elected: Our politics are probably too polarized, our legislative branch too gridlocked, and the conservative movement too dysfunctional and self-destructive to build a new agenda from the backbenches of Congress up, or even from the House speaker or Senate majority leader’s office.

Our system isn’t really all that republican anymore; it’s imperial, and even an incompetent emperor like Trump is unlike to restore the legislative branch to its former influence. So if you want to remake the Republican Party as something other than a shambolic repository for anti-liberalism, the only way it’s likely to happen is from the top down — with the election of an effective, policy-oriented conservative president (which Donald Trump is not), surrounded by people who understand the ways of power (which Bannon, for all his bluster, didn’t) and prepared to both negotiate with Democrats and bend his own party to his will.

I don’t pretend to know if such a presidency will ever happen. But if I were Steve Bannon, or any other Republican with a vision for the G.O.P. future beyond the hapless “governance” on display today, I would not be wasting my time trying to elect a few cranks and gadflies who will make Mitch McConnell’s life more difficult.

Instead I would be looking for the thing that too many people deceived themselves into believing Trump might be, and that Bannonite populism for all its potential strength now lacks: a leader.",The Bannon Revolution,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/opinion/steve-bannon-revolution.html

He had traveled from his small town in Utah to the Catskill Mountains, to a celebration of photography where he studied with such masters of photojournalism as Mary Ellen Mark, Greg Heisler and Jodi Cobb.

A local high school band in Jeffersonville was playing a thunderous welcome as he entered a large, partly built barn. Inside he was greeted by the festival’s mastermind: Eddie Adams, the Pulitzer Prize-winning war photographer.

“Everybody who was anybody was there and I didn’t even know they existed,” said Mr. Rasmussen, now the director of photography for digital and print media at ESPN. “I went to this small agricultural college in Utah and didn’t know anybody, but in less than a week I left there with four or five lifelong friends. Sometimes you spend your whole life seeking your community and for me that was the moment that I found it.”

Mr. Rasmussen will return to Jeffersonville this weekend for the 30th Eddie Adams Workshop, which has since become one of the most important stops for up-and-coming photojournalists.

Mr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers. Some things have changed since the first session — Kodak slide film gave way to digital imagery in the late 1990s and audio and video have been added. Some sponsors have fallen away as the industry has withered, and while tuition is still free, students pay $375 for lodging.

The workshop is structured much as it was 30 years ago, with 10 groups of 10 students managed by a well-known photographer as team leader, a photo editor and a producer. This year, all the teams are led by photographers who were once students in the workshop.

For Jimmy Colton, a well-traveled photo editor who will be attending his 27th consecutive session this week, the workshop is about family. He calls himself Uncle Jimmy, and considers all 2,700 students he has worked with to be his nieces and nephews. The barn is also a place of family ghosts for Mr. Colton, whose brother Jay, and father, Sandy, both volunteered as photo editors before their deaths.

The core values of the workshop continue to be “a level of ethics beyond reproach, having great concern for your subjects and treating everyone as you would like to be treated,” Mr. Colton said.

Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography. But progress on rebuilding the ramshackle structures was slow as assignment work kept him busy. It was after he met Alyssa in 1983 that the plans for a free, merit-based workshop came together. They married shortly after the first workshop.

“This workshop is not a ‘how to,’ it’s more inspirational and aspirational,” Ms. Adams said. “This is a place where you can let your hair down and experiment a little as a student.”

The workshop does not romanticize photojournalism, and it acknowledges the price many photojournalists have paid while covering conflict. An annual memorial service for photographers who have died during war recognizes friends of Mr. Adams who were killed in Vietnam, like Henri Huet and Larry Burrows, as well as more recent casualties like Chris Hondros, who attended the 1993 workshop. An annual Award is given to a student by the Chris Hondros Foundation.

Recognizing colleagues who have been killed emphasizes that “the truth matters, pictures matter, and you can make a difference with your pictures not just in war,” said Nancy Andrews, who attended the first workshop in 1988 and has volunteered as a photo editor and will be a team leader this year. She returns for the sense of community and generosity, she said.

“I’m actually improved when you, my colleague, or you, my student, make a great picture” said Ms. Andrews, who was a Washington Post staff photographer and director of photography at The Detroit Free Press. “It’s not like there are finite numbers of great pictures out there and you stole one of them so now I can’t get one. It elevates the profession and I might be better as a result.”

Admission to the workshop, for students and professionals with less than three years’ experience is through portfolios judged by a panel of photo editors.

Not being included can be a difficult blow.

Ruth Fremson was among those young photographers who did not make the cut in the late 1980s. She remembers the rejection well, though she has since been part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams as a staff photographer for The Associated Press and starting in 2000 at The New York Times. While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.

She has been a team leader at the workshop the last two years and is returning this weekend as a kitchen volunteer to help prepare food for the students.

“It’s such a gift to be able to participate in it because the team leaders and volunteers get as much out of the workshop as the students,” she said. “I’ve had the benefit of many great mentors who have championed my career and this is a great place to pay it forward.”

“I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did,” Ms. Jolie said in an email. “This behavior towards women in any field, any country is unacceptable.”

A New York Times investigation last week chronicled a hidden history of sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Weinstein and settlements he paid, often involving former employees, over three decades up to 2015. By Sunday evening, his entertainment company fired him.

On Tuesday, The New Yorker published a report that included multiple allegations of sexual assault, including forced oral and vaginal sex. The article also included accounts of sexual harassment going back to the 1990s, with women describing how intimidating Mr. Weinstein was.

Several days ago, additional actresses began sharing with The Times on-the-record stories of casting-couch abuses. Their accounts hint at the sweep of Mr. Weinstein’s alleged harassment, targeting women on the way to stardom, those who had barely acted and others in between. Fantasies that the public eagerly watched onscreen, the women recounted, sometimes masked the dark experiences of those performing in them.

The encounters they recalled followed a similar narrative: First, they said, Mr. Weinstein lured them to a private place to discuss films, scripts or even Oscar campaigns. Then, the women contend, he variously tried to initiate massages, touched them inappropriately, took off his clothes or offered them explicit work-for-sex deals.

In a statement on Tuesday, his spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. He will not be available for further comments, as he is taking the time to focus on his family, on getting counseling and rebuilding his life.”

Even in an industry in which sexual harassment has long persisted, Mr. Weinstein stands out, according to the actresses and current and former employees of the film companies he ran, Miramax and the Weinstein Company. He had an elaborate system reliant on the cooperation of others: Assistants often booked the meetings, arranged the hotel rooms and sometimes even delivered the talent, then disappeared, the actresses and employees recounted. They described how some of Mr. Weinstein’s executives and assistants then found them agents and jobs or hushed actresses who were upset.

His alleged behavior became something of a Hollywood open secret: When the comedian Seth MacFarlane announced Oscar nominees in 2013, he joked, “Congratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.” The audience laughed. According to a 2015 memo by a former Weinstein Company executive that The Times previously disclosed, the misconduct continued.

More established actresses were fearful of speaking out because they had work; less established ones were scared because they did not. “This is Harvey Weinstein,” Katherine Kendall, who appeared in the film “Swingers” and television roles, remembers telling herself after an encounter in which she said Mr. Weinstein undressed and chased her around a living room. Telling others meant “I’ll never work again and no one is going to care or believe me,” she reasoned at the time, she said in a recent interview.

Ms. Paltrow, 45, is now an entrepreneur, no longer dependent on securing her next acting role. But she emphasized how much more vulnerable she felt at 22, when Mr. Weinstein had just signed her up for a star-making part. On a trip to Los Angeles, she received a schedule from her agents for the hotel meeting with Mr. Weinstein.

There was no reason to suspect anything untoward, because “it’s on the fax, it’s from C.A.A.,” she said, referring to Creative Artists Agency, which represented her.

When Mr. Weinstein tried to massage her and invited her into the bedroom, she immediately left, she said, and remembers feeling stunned as she drove away. “I thought you were my Uncle Harvey,” she recalled thinking, explaining that she had seen him as a mentor.

After she told Mr. Pitt about the episode, he approached Mr. Weinstein at a theater premiere and told him never to touch Ms. Paltrow again. Mr. Pitt confirmed the account to The Times through a representative.

Soon after, Mr. Weinstein called Ms. Paltrow and berated her for discussing the episode, she said. (She said she also told a few friends, family members and her agent.) “He screamed at me for a long time,” she said, once again fearing she could lose the role in “Emma.” “It was brutal.” But she stood her ground, she said, and insisted that he put the relationship back on professional footing.

Even as Ms. Paltrow became known as the “first lady of Miramax” and won an Oscar for “Shakespeare in Love” in 1999, very few people knew about Mr. Weinstein’s advances. “I was expected to keep the secret,” she said.

Like several of the other women interviewed for this article, she felt she had to suppress the experience. She praised Mr. Weinstein publicly, posed for pictures with him and played the glowing star to his powerful producer. Yet their work relationship grew rockier over the years, she said, and she distanced herself. “He was alternately generous and supportive and championing, and punitive and bullying,” she said.

Now, with the process of tallying the size and scope of Mr. Weinstein’s abuse allegations underway, Ms. Paltrow and others said they wanted to support women who had already come forward and help those in similar situations feel less alone.

“We’re at a point in time when women need to send a clear message that this is over,” Ms. Paltrow said. “This way of treating women ends now.”

That doesn’t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.",Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/the-office-gets-remade-again.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

As of Oct. 6, wildfires had raced through 8.5 million acres, well above the last decade’s average of six million per year.","“We always thought the alert system would give us time, but there was no notice, no warning,” said Maureen Grinnell, 77, who lived in the hills north of Napa with her husband, Sheldon, 89, who uses a walker. “I was watching a movie with my 19-year-old granddaughter and I smelled smoke, and I looked out the window to see flames approaching.”

From that moment, they stayed with the house seven to 10 minutes, she said — just long enough to load the three of them, a dog and a handful of belongings into a car.

“By the time I started to back the car out of the garage, the house was already on fire,” Ms. Grinnell said. “I drove down the road through smoke with flames on both sides. It almost looked like the burning of Atlanta in ‘Gone With the Wind.’”

Pamela Taylor, 66, at first watched the fire from the mobile home park in Santa Rosa where she lived, thinking it was not near enough to pose a threat — and then, suddenly, it was. “A gigantic fireball jumped across the freeway to the trees around the trailer park,” she said, and within minutes, trailers and cars were ablaze, and people were fleeing.

“There was no turning the gas off. There was just running,” she said.

James Harder and his friends managed to save his business, James Cole Winery, a small-scale maker of high-priced cabernets, even as the nearby Signorello Estate winery burned. Mr. Harder said he saw a wall of flame 20 to 30 feet high descending a hillside toward his property, embers whipping toward him, and formed a bucket brigade with six other people, working through the night, scooping water from a 10,000-gallon tank meant to irrigate his vines.

“We just thought, ‘Keep working, keep working,’” he said. “We would have lost everything if not for our friends.”

All around them, in some of the most expensive real estate in the country, they could see neighbors’ houses going up in flames, their propane tanks exploding with ground-shaking force.

Next door, the gate to the Signorello property was open on Tuesday and a sign said “Open,” but no one was there. The reception area was destroyed, fires still burned from gas pipes there, and ash covered an infinity pool with a commanding view of the valley. But in the bar area, a refrigerator held a wheel of manchego cheese, beer bottles and soda cans, still intact.

How much of the season’s grape harvest was destroyed remains unclear.

Across the state, 17 large wildfires were still burning Tuesday, covering 115,000 acres, Chief Pimlott said. An unusually wet winter produced ample brush, and the state’s hottest summer on record dried it to tinder, setting the stage for a rough October, a month usually marked by dry air and high winds from the north and east.

The entire American West has experienced a particularly brutal wildfire season, even as people in the Southeast have suffered the floods and winds of hurricanes. As of Oct. 6, wildfires had raced through 8.5 million acres, well above the last decade’s average of six million per year.

Most of the current California wildfires are in the north, including a large one in Mendocino County and several others in the Sierra Nevada, the north coast and the San Joaquin Valley. But in Southern California, a fire that broke out Monday in the Anaheim Hills burned through thousands of acres and about a dozen homes, sending smoke pouring into Orange County and closing the 91 freeway, the main route into the county from the east.

The winds whipping the flames in the area north of San Francisco Bay came from the north, and thousands of firefighters labored to build fire breaks on the southern flanks of the blazes to hold them back from populated areas. Supported by aircraft dropping water and fire retardant — ranging from helicopters to a Boeing 747 tanker — fire crews used bulldozers, chain saws and shovels to clear trees and brush, hoping to create fire breaks and starve the blazes of fuel.

A thick layer of smoke shrouded the region, and the Environmental Protection Agency rated the air quality as “unhealthy,” “very unhealthy,” and even “hazardous” in places. Many of the people taken to area hospitals were treated for smoke inhalation, and people walked through their neighborhoods and evacuation centers wearing paper masks, in hopes of protecting their lungs.",Northern California Wildfires Ravage Wine Country; 17 Are Dead,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/california-fires.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

(Anyone? Anyone? Gertrude Jekyll?) But I had no idea that “flame” in Greek meant PHLOX. This is a great crossword word, no? Also a pretty plant if you can see beyond the mildew.

53A: Since this puzzle was solving fairly straight, I wasn’t at sufficient goofball level to see how “become lightheaded” could mean GO BLONDE. I figured it out after a few crosses but I think this is also a total gem of a clue.

58A: The first challenge for some of us when encountering “Dress-up at a comic con” might be figuring out the ol’ comic con part. Is this term widely known at this point? New York’s goes back to 2006 and it looks like the San Diego Comic Convention started in 1971. The art of dressing as featured characters is COSPLAY, a term coined in Japan in the ’80s. I would say something about nothing new under the sun, as we’ve been playing masquerade as a species for millenniums, but these costumes are really something else. New York’s con is in less than a week, guys! Come to think of it, maybe Sam has sequestered himself in his sewing room.

23D: Like the above example, this clue, “Secondary personas in role-playing game lingo” called for some knowledge of the way the kids talk. I knew this had to be “avis,” in this case pronounced with a short a, cute and short for “avatars,” and I was wrong. This grid calls for ALTS, and uses a new clue for a chestnut entry.

37D: Who’s been on the cover of British Vogue more than anyone else? One of their brand new contributing editors, natch, and Naomi Campbell didn’t fit. KATE MOSS did.

39D: I couldn’t really wrap my head around the grammar and meaning of “Track prize” for the longest time. At first I was looking for a verb, something like following one’s dream. Then I switched to a trophy or some such award, and it took forever to realize that in this case track was a racetrack, and we were talking about horse races, which get run as STAKES. This seems to be a grande olde worde from when betting folks in the Middle Ages stuck their wager, maybe a fat chicken or cute child, onto a stick and tried their luck.

Constructor Notes

From Crack Teammate #1, M.L.G.:

My seed entry for this themeless was the RIJKSMUSEUM, a place I hope to see in person someday. It was inspired by my visit to a special exhibit at the Dayton Art Institute, Rembrandt and the Golden Age of Dutch Art: Treasures from the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. My first themeless grid with this seed entry was submitted in July of 2016. I received a rejection in August noting that Will really liked some of the grid fill including this seed entry, but there was too much crosswordese. I asked Jeff for his assistance in reworking the grid. He pointed out I had too many three letter entries. He noted it was best not to go above 12 for a themeless grid. After numerous back and forths using a grid of Jeff’s design we submitted a revised grid a few weeks later. We received an email in November accepting the revised grid. Jeff worked the NYT debut words COSPLAY, MAMA BIRD, BEER BRAT and GO BLONDE into the grid and my contribution in addition to RIJKSMUSEUM, was OBAMA ERA. I was surprised to see the clue we had for TOMY, “Big name in toys headquartered in Japan”, was replaced by the partial TO MY. I did like the edited change of clues for EARS and DJS to “Reception figures” as well as the clue change for HARRY from a name to “Badger”. I hope you’ve enjoyed your Saturday solving experience.

And, from Crack Teammate #2, J.C.:

I like trying multiple dozens of versions of every region within a themeless. Luckily, ML graciously puts up with my OCD about exploring the entire solution space. We saved so many versions that I didn’t remember which one we finally submitted. Thankfully, ML has a good eye for what’s the best trade-off between strong entries and gluey short ones. Looking back on it, I would have tried to open up the NW and SE corners, which feel more disconnected from the rest of the puzzle than I like. It did let us easily try many dozens of versions in each area, but with so few entries connecting everything up, hopefully solvers don’t get stumped on LAKSHMI or RIJKSMUSEUM.

For those of us wondering where the time went this week, here is a little video of a mama robin:

Perhaps you’ve never seen “The Phantom of the Opera,” but you are left with the letter pattern _ _ _ IS after confidentially filling in INERT and STAYS at 38/39D. Well, what’s the first five-letter city ending in IS that comes to mind? You may come up initially with both PARIS and TUNIS, and can check the first letter with the crossing clue “Totally captivated” at 25D.

Joy Behar: I started doing The New York Times puzzle right after college, when I found myself working a job that had a lot of down time. It was difficult at first, and still is, especially on Saturday, when the puzzle is very challenging. I found that if I stuck with it, I could finish it. This proved to be a good lesson for other chores and projects. In recent years, I found my name used in the puzzles. I figured they needed the vowels. Even so, it was a thrill. As far as construction, once we landed on a theme (comedians), it was not too difficult to come up with puns for comedians’ names. The grid’s restrictions didn’t allow as many names as I would have liked, but that’s life in the crossword world. The best part of doing the puzzle every day is that it provides a distraction like no other: From politics, the phone and the refrigerator. So thank you. Lynn Lempel: This collaboration was something of a blind date set up by Will, and it was all done via email. We both decided from Day 1 that the theme would be comedians, but it took a while to get from there to this puzzle. At first we thought of using names like (Lucille) BALL, (Bob) HOPE, and (Chris) ROCK that could be used in everyday phrases — and we batted around some possibilities. We also considered a few ideas that included revealers. But then, among ideas for those themes, Joy included PRYOR COMMITMENT … and I knew immediately that she’d come up with something different and perfect. She’d found our theme angle for sure, and her example was even 15 letters for a terrific central grid-spanner. After emailing back and forth, we decided on this set. Three of the five theme entries (PRINZE, PRYOR, and IDLE) were Joy’s ideas, and all but one of the theme clues were hers (all but BARR). Unfortunately, BARR HOPPING didn’t fit. A few names that didn’t work were Chaplin/chaplain, Marx/marks, and Bee/be. I did the grid, which Joy approved. And I wrote clues that she then went through and edited, preferring to make them more challenging. Will changed very few of them. If you guessed that Joy wrote the great clue for GO APE, you’d be right. Also the ones for RESCUE DOG and HELIX, just to name two that I especially liked. Working on this with Joy was great fun. Her emails were guaranteed to include some funny choices I never would have thought of. I loved the way the puzzle turned out. I hope all of you solvers do, too.

Thank you, Ms. Behar and Ms. Lempel, for such a lovely Tuesday puzzle. Truly hope to see more from you, whether it be on television or in print.

In 1848, the Mexican-American War ended and the Gold Rush began.

Californians were hungry for stability in the western lands ceded by Mexico.

So it was that a constitutional convention was called in Monterey to establish the contours of a state government.

The 48 delegates reflected California’s immigrant character. Most came from states east of the Mississippi, six were California born, and the rest came from Spain, Ireland, Scotland, France and Switzerland.

The men deliberated for six weeks in Colton Hall, the first American public building in California. They chose San Jose as the state capital, and the Sierra Nevada as the state’s eastern border.

After heated debate, slavery was forbidden.

And on this week in 1849, they signed California’s first Constitution, written on parchment in both English and Spanish. Statehood was granted by Congress a year later.

Bayard Taylor, a traveling journalist, described the signing ceremony in Monterey.

As the delegates affixed their names to the document, an American flag was hoisted and 31 gunshots, for each U.S. state plus one, echoed through the hills.

With the final boom, there was a shout: “That’s for California!”

Then there’s the fact that when Grant moved into the White House, he had a statue of Thomas Jefferson, the slave owner, removed from the north lawn and sent to the Capitol.

Not everything in “Grant” carries this much resonance and weight. Chernow likes extreme research; if a Civil War luminary had hemorrhoids, you can read about them here. This is also at least his second book to take an interest in false teeth. For “Washington,” he actually spent some time at Mount Vernon gazing at his subject’s grizzly choppers. Here he tells a story about Grant’s leaving his teeth in a hotel and having an employee throw them away. It’s not clear what happened after that.

But “Grant” is vast and panoramic in ways that history buffs will love. Books of its caliber by writers of Chernow’s stature are rare, and this one qualifies as a major event. Chernow grapples with an enormous amount of material, while mostly sustaining a tight focus. He manages to put on Grant goggles and deal primarily with this one soldier’s role in the military, this one leader’s role in the Civil War. And then the role of one president — branded a political amateur — in leading a country still coming apart at the seams.

Raised in Ohio and educated at West Point, Grant had the humility to do any kind of labor he could find, and the family to make him want to keep working. His father, Jesse, never stopped exploiting Ulysses, whether making him work in a tannery as a boy (a stomach-turning job for him) or using the Grant presidency as a marketing gimmick for his business. His mother, upon greeting her son, the victorious general, said flatly: “Well, Ulysses, you’ve become a great man, haven’t you?” And then she went back to doing housework.

Grant’s drinking is handled so repetitively that the subject begins to pall. In his early days, he drank heavily enough to be forced out of his job as an Army quartermaster after only five months. Chernow contends that it was once a binge problem — a way for Grant to unwind when he wasn’t leading an army into battle — but that he later learned to control it. The evidence consists of countless stories in which Grant asked that his wine glass be turned upside down at dinner. And both Grant’s wife, Julia (who favored dresses with bows in the back), and a designated watcher tried to monitor his behavior.

The book includes an awful lot of instances when Grant slipped up in his abstinence, but Chernow is deeply in his subject’s camp, always ready to play apologist about the drinking and other troubling behaviors. Grant once issued an order expelling Jews from a Southern military district but Chernow thinks this may have had something to do with Oedipal rage against his father, who once went to Mississippi with three Jewish cotton traders who … does it matter? The book points out that Grant also went to a synagogue dedication and sat through a lot of talk in Hebrew.

That story is well known. But Chernow has found many others from new and obscure sources. He also offers something he has found wanting in previous biographies of Grant: “a systematic account of his relations with the four million slaves, whom he helped to liberate, feed, house, employ, and arm during the war, then shielded from harm when they became American citizens.”

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said.
“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said.","Having spent 15 years photographing child marriages around the world, Stephanie Sinclair is uniquely positioned to understand its lasting impact on communities and, especially, on the girls who were forced to wed against their will. “You can’t expect individuals who have been through significant abuse to just act normal as soon as they get out of that situation,” she said. “They need to be nurtured, to be given the time and the tools to heal.”

With this in mind, Ms. Sinclair last year started the Tehani Photo Workshop — named after an 8-year-old Yemeni bride — in partnership with the Samburu Girls Foundation. The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said. Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls. “The independence that comes with a such a career, the knowledge you acquire through meeting other people, and the freedom the camera gives you to express yourself can’t be underplayed,” she said. “Instinctively, I knew that a photo workshop could nurture the girls in a unique way.”

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

Pearson of Canada told a group of American students in 1963. The quote, reprinted in the June 10th issue of The New York Times of that year, still rings true today, especially as a Canadian like myself goes through thousands of images of Canada from the newspaper’s archives.

Earlier this year, the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto received a donation of 24,804 images from a collector, Chris Bratty, who had purchased the collection with the intention of donating it. Selected by a team led by two gallerists, Steven Kasher and Stephen Bulger, the pictures range from World War I to the late 1990s, from hockey players to lumberjacks. A selection is currently on view in an exhibition at the center and in a book, both entitled “The Faraway Nearby.”

“When I heard of the collection, I immediately wanted to acquire it,” said Paul Roth, an American who is the center’s director. “For all the strengths of our holdings — including the Black Star and the Berenice Abbott archives — we don’t have a tremendous amount of Canadian photojournalism. This helps us fill that gap. And, since it comes from a major U.S. newspaper, it brings up the question of how one country covers another, which fits within our mandate of interrogating different aspects of the medium.”

The expected tropes are there: Canada as a winter wonderland; as a safe, polite neighbor who reveres hockey. But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes. In one photo, Nikita S. Khrushchev laughs at a joke told by Mr. Pearson — the opposite of the famous “Kitchen Debate” moment by Elliott Erwitt, in which then-Vice President Richard Nixon castigates the Soviet leader. In another, Fidel Castro holds Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau’s youngest son, Michel Charles-Émile, during a four-day state visit. Or, Canada the troubled young nation deploying the Army to confront Quebec’s sometimes-violent calls for independence.

“The type of coverage we see speaks of a dual fascination between how familiar Canada feels, and yet how unfamiliar it sometimes appears,” Mr. Roth surmised. “I suspect that The New York Times had to ponder how to cover a country that was so close. Should they concentrate on the differences or highlight the similarities? When stories involved people or goods crossing the border, which was often the case, were they to be considered national or international news?”

Besides snow and hockey, evidence of Canada’s subordination to the British monarchy seemed of particular interest. The New York Times dedicated space daily to Princess Elizabeth’s first tour of Canada in 1951 (Slide 9) and continued to chronicle the royal family’s subsequent visits.

Mr. Trudeau also drew a lot of attention, more than any of his predecessors and successors, that is, until his son Justin ran for the same office and won in 2015. A reproduction of a spread published during the 1972 election is revealing. Within “The World” section, the article isn’t under a rubric with the country’s name, as is customary, but simply “Trudeau,” and a headline declaring “A Swinger Shows His Sober Side.” A full column is dedicated to a collage of images showing the candidate dancing, riding a motorcycle, playing hockey and pedaling a unicycle before concluding with a somber close-up portrait.

Mounting the exhibition, Denise Birkhofer — an American who recently settled in Toronto and co-curated the show with Gerald McMaster, an Indigenous Canadian of Plains Cree and Blackfoot descent — pondered how The New York Times’s fondness for certain subjects and visual archetypes might have shaped a national identity. That’s hard to answer, partly because of the variety of photographers who contributed to the paper’s Canadian coverage.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said. “Not all were Americans. Sometimes staff photographers were sent to cover a story, but other times it came from local publications or freelancers. There were also images made by Canadian agencies or corporations, such as the National Film Board and the Canadian Pacific Railway.”

Photo

Most surprisingly, during World War I, the images the paper used to showcase Canada’s participation in the war effort were supplied by Canadian entities, whose work had to be vetted by the nation’s official censors. Its goal was to avoid criticism of military endeavors by showing the conflict in a romanticized light. In other words, said Gaëlle Morel, the Ryerson Image Center exhibitions curator, “The New York Times — a private commercial enterprise — obeyed the censorship requirements of a foreign country.” In other words, the country’s image, as seen in The Times, reflected an official, sanitized perspective.

Mr. Roth said the collection has greater meaning given Canada’s sesquicentennial this year. “More than a time for celebration and patriotism, it is an occasion to think about complicated questions relating to the identity of the nation,” he said. “All countries should be interested in how they’re viewed by other states. We should strive to get past the mythologies that are created to promote tourism or to reinforce patriotic values, especially nowadays. Doing so requires unpacking widely held cultural assumptions. And that’s exactly what we can do thanks to this archive. While it doesn’t tell a single story, it does help us understand what the Canadian mythologies are.”

South Plains, whose emergence as the junior college Warriors was detailed by The New York Times, won its first 29 games of the season, averaged nearly 100 points per game and reached the semifinals of the national tournament.

Now on the cusp of his 18th season at South Plains, Green has a new roster, with only three returning players, and more size. (“We built through the draft,” he said, deadpan.) But his best player, the high-scoring guard Jordan Brangers, is back for another season, and Green plans to stick with much of his Warriors-centric offense.

“Oh, yeah,” he said. “I’m a groupie.”

After the Warriors welcomed Green’s request to visit their training camp, he feels as if he has an even better gauge for how they operate. Kerr has a fairly open policy when coaches express an interest in sneaking backstage to catch a glimpse of his basketball cyborgs.

“We don’t have any secrets,” Kerr said, “and if these guys are interested in coming to watch us practice, there’s no harm in it and there’s a lot of benefit. I like for them to see what we’re doing, and if it helps them and their teams and their players develop, I’m all for it.”

Bruce Fraser, one of Kerr’s assistants, said he often wondered how much other coaches gained from watching the Warriors practice. They dribble around traffic cones. They shoot 3-pointers and play loud music.

“I don’t know if underwhelmed is the word,” Fraser said, “but you may look out there and say: ‘Is that all they do?’”

He added that much of the Warriors’ offense was so nuanced that it must be difficult for someone to just pop in for a day or two and acquire a ton of insight.

Still, that did not appear to be the case for a shooting coach from Belgium, who peppered Fraser with questions for about 20 minutes after a recent practice. And it certainly was not true of Green, whose depth of knowledge about the Warriors runs so deep that he can watch a game live on TV and identify whether Kerr has plugged in a new play.

At practice, Green said, a couple of things stood out to him from the start. The first, he said, was the Warriors’ chemistry. At different moments, Kerr would bring everyone together so they could talk. Green was not privy to their conversations — the balcony was out of eavesdropping range — but it looked like democracy in action.

Then there were the high-fives. So many high-fives.

“You couldn’t walk by somebody without acknowledging them or being acknowledged,” Green said. “And it wasn’t just players. All the coaches, all the staff members — everyone. It sounds kind of crazy, but I’d never seen so many high-fives.”

Beyond the emphasis on team-building, Green was struck by the Warriors’ focus on fundamentals: dribbling, shooting, passing. For a solid chunk of each practice that Green attended, the players threw dozens of passes against large pitch-back nets that were configured with targets. The Warriors love to pass, but Kerr wants them to be more precise.

“You can see on tape if a guy is catching the ball at his shoelaces instead of in his shooting pocket,” Kerr said recently. “There’s a dramatic difference in his makes and misses when you get a good pass or a bad pass, so we’re trying to work on that.”

Photo

Green also noticed that the Warriors were efficient. Nobody stood around doing nothing. Assistants divided the team up to work on various offensive sets at different baskets. One coach was in charge of practicing out-of-bounds plays. Players cycled through the stations. Green got a little jealous.

“We can’t do that because I don’t have 22 assistants,” he said. (He has two.)

“I also don’t have three courts,” he added. (He has one.)

But as he watched All-Stars like Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson during their individual shooting drills, Green was struck by their meticulous approach. They were craftsmen. No wasted movement. Just shot after shot, and only the types of shots they would attempt in games.

“These guys are serious about improving their skills,” Green said. “You read these articles about LeBron James and his summer workouts, and you don’t ever know for sure. But if you actually go and watch, these guys are serious. They are serious about keeping their jobs and getting better.”

After one of the practices, Kerr worked his way up to the balcony. Green introduced himself.

“Oh!” Kerr told him. “You’re that coach from Texas.”

They made small talk about mutual acquaintances. As an assistant at the University of Houston in the 1980s, Green had coached Randy Brown, a guard who later played for the Chicago Bulls alongside Kerr. (“Great teammate,” Kerr said.) Green also mentioned that Emmanuel Omogbo, one of his former players at South Plains, was on the Warriors’ summer league team.

Kerr talked a bit about his offense and his personnel. Green enjoyed the conversation. He followed it up with a trip to California’s wine country. He was not in top shape the next morning.

Back at South Plains last week for his team’s first practice of the season, Green told his players about the Warriors’ penchant for high-fives. The message carried only so much weight.

“Two of my guys got into it before the day was over,” he said with a hint of resignation.

Green also remembered that he had some old equipment tucked away: traffic cones. He had his players dust them off.",Traffic Cones and High-Fives: A Glimpse Behind the Warriors’ Curtain,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/sports/basketball/golden-state-warriors-practice-secrets-kerr.html

Plath’s letters have been collected for the first time, edited by Peter K. Steinberg, an archivist specializing in Plath, and Karen V. Kukil, the editor of Plath’s journals and curator of the Plath collection at Smith College. The first volume — attractive, immense and done up in trendy millennial pink — is just out.

The era has passed in which those who held Ted Hughes responsible for Plath’s suicide would chisel her married name from her headstone. But the years have passed more slowly, you suspect, for the family and the Plath estate. Frieda Hughes, the couple’s daughter and only surviving child (their son, Nicholas, killed himself in 2009), begins the book of letters with a spectacularly defensive foreword — a tribute less to Plath than to Hughes:

“The reason my mother should be of interest to readers at all is due to my father, because, irrespective of the way their marriage ended, he honored my mother’s work and her memory by publishing ‘Ariel,’ ” she writes. “It seems to me that, as a result of their profound belief in each other’s literary abilities, my parents are as married in death as they once were in life.” There is the effect, slightly comic and horrifying, of the daughter presiding over the vow renewal ceremony for the ghosts of her parents.

But it does set the stage for the strangeness of these letters, first glimpsed when Plath’s mother, Aurelia, published a selection of them in “Letters Home” (1975). Her intention was to humanize Plath, to reveal her as a healthy all-American girl. Alas, it went very much the other way — the “psychic osmosis” between mother and daughter, of which Aurelia was so proud, was perceived to be pathological, and perhaps even the root cause of Plath’s depression.

Photo

Whatever the diagnosis, to speak of Plath’s letters is to speak of her relationship with Aurelia, to whom she wrote twice a day at times — long letters that swarmed to fill every inch of space on the page and trailed onto the envelopes.

This was, no doubt, lovely for her mother (and her biographers), but it can be rough going for even the committed Plathophile. We spend a small eternity at a summer camp where young Sylvia assuaged Aurelia’s anxieties with daily briefs on her diet and hygiene. In one moment of high drama, she longed for a toenail clipper.

As she grew up the reports to Aurelia continued but now included lists of her admirers and awards, invitations to the Yale junior prom, compliments from professors.

The journals, published unabridged in 2000, were, of course, a darker place. There her violent imagination could bloom. Her pet insult was “smiler” — for the false and appeasing; her own inclination as well, we learn in the letters. She would admit, in passing, to her loneliness in college before screwing on a smile: “My room is lovely.” “The campus is utterly lovely.” “The freshmen are dears.” “Lisa is very sweet.” Even a suicide attempt is glossed over. “My escapade,” she called it in a letter to a friend.

Her intense ambition was on full display, however. She even poked fun at it: “I’m chock-full of ideas for new poems. I can’t wait to get time to write them down. I can’t let Shakespeare get too far ahead of me, you know.”

The other great, governing hunger in her life was for a leading man, a colossus, which she found in Hughes, the hulking Heathcliff of her dreams. She met him in England, where she was on a Fulbright scholarship. She bit his cheek, he ripped off her earrings, they married four months later. In her letters to him, the determined peppiness finally fell away and the Plathian imagery — and nastiness — emerged. On a professor of hers: “I have a morbid desire to cut open her fat white flesh each time I see her and see if its onion juice or what that keeps her going.”

But these early letters reveal something the journals don’t: a flicker of uncertainty about Hughes that now seems prophetic. He “has done a kind of uncaring rip through every woman he’s ever met,” she wrote to her brother. To her mother: “He is a breaker of things and people.”

But she won’t be cowed. She’s conquered him, she reported two weeks later. “I have passed through the husk, the mask of cruelty, ruthlessness, callousness, in Ted.” She preened: “Every thing I do with and for Ted has a celestial radiance, be it only ironing or cooking.” She documented their days, their productivity with joy. She hoped for seven children.

It’s not Plath’s death necessarily, or even the dissolution of her marriage, but her doubleness that’s been the abiding mystery. In his foreword to her journals, Hughes wrote: “I never saw her show her real self to anybody — except, perhaps, in the last three months of her life.” It’s a line picked up by critics from Elizabeth Hardwick to Janet Malcolm, this belief in the authentic Plath, the aggressive genius lurking behind the polite banalities, that finally flowered in the final poems — the “blood jet,” she called them.

The achievement of this avalanche of letters — 1,300 pages and counting — is that it disabuses everyone of the notion that Plath wasn’t aware of her contradictions or in (some) control of them. She referenced her two selves every time she went from blonde to brunette (“I’m rather sure that my brown-haired personality will win out this year,” she wrote to a boyfriend. “Gone is the frivolous giddy gilded creature who careened around corners at the wheel of a yellow convertible.”) Her honors thesis was, in part, on Dostoevsky’s “The Double,” after all, in which a self splits, and one kills the other.

General Fang, however, seems to have fallen afoul of Mr. Xi, for reasons that are not fully apparent.
It could also be a way for Mr. Xi to extend his influence beyond a second term.
“China’s military modernization is targeting capabilities with the potential to degrade core U.S. military-technological advantages,” the Pentagon’s annual report to Congress on China’s military abilities asserted.
But experts already credit with Mr. Xi with making significant progress in creating a leaner, more modern, more professional force.","Since coming to power in 2012, Mr. Xi has used a crackdown on corruption to purge commanders deemed corrupt or disloyal. The moves have given Mr. Xi, whose father was an important figure in China’s revolutionary army, a degree of authority over the People’s Liberation Army that had eluded previous civilian leaders.

Mr. Xi “has been able to take political control of the military to an extent that exceeds what Mao and Deng have done,” said Tai Ming Cheung, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies China’s defense forces. “He has already demonstrated ahead of the congress his ability to elevate key commanders that are close to him.”

The abrupt disappearance of the two generals before the congress underlined how ruthlessly Mr. Xi was willing to act. He is now poised to cement his control by installing a new cohort of civilian and military leaders loyal to him and his vision for the Chinese military.

Before his abrupt removal, General Fang, 66, had seemed positioned for promotion at the congress. He had recently laid out China’s stance on North Korea to his visiting American counterpart and was enforcing Mr. Xi’s overhaul. He even accompanied Mr. Xi to Florida in April for a summit meeting with President Trump at his golf resort in Palm Beach.

General Fang, however, seems to have fallen afoul of Mr. Xi, for reasons that are not fully apparent. He has been put under investigation on suspicion of abuses of office, two former officials in Beijing said, confirming reports that first appeared in several overseas news outlets. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing recrimination for discussing internal affairs. One said General Zhang, 66, was also under investigation.

They are not the first commanders purged under Mr. Xi. There have been trials of dozens of high-ranking officers, including the two highest-ranking generals ever toppled for corruption in modern China: Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou, two former vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission, the party committee that commands China’s armed forces.

“Strong Military,” an eight-part documentary series shown on Chinese television in recent weeks, said that Mr. Xi had to act urgently because bribery and embezzlement in the top ranks had corroded morale and threatened battle-readiness in the armed forces.

One episode showed the confessions of Generals Guo and Xu as well as a luxurious compound that another fallen general had turned into his private playground.

“The problems of corruption and work style in the armed forces weren’t just harming the image of the military, they were badly damaging morale in the ranks,” Wan Minggui, a commissar in the Chinese military, says in the documentary. “It really had reached the point where something had to be done.”

For Mr. Xi, gaining firmer control of the military could help ensure his grip on power during his second terms as party leader and president, which he is all but certain to receive at this month’s party congress and a session of China’s legislature next year.

It could also be a way for Mr. Xi to extend his influence beyond a second term. Two predecessors, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, wielded influence after retiring from other official posts by staying in charge of the Central Military Commission, which Mr. Xi now leads.

The party congress, scheduled to open Oct. 18, could fill the 11-member commission with younger commanders loyal to Mr. Xi or shrink the size of the commission to enhance his say. Separately, dozens of other rising military officers are likely to be promoted to the Central Committee, the party’s highest organ, whose some 200 voting members oversee governance of the entire nation, not just the military.

“The control of the military is an ironclad insurance policy for Xi,” said Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in California who studies Chinese politics. “If Xi has complete control of the military, nobody dares lift a finger.”

Mr. Xi’s reshuffling of the military leadership is also aimed at accelerating the changes he has sought in the People’s Liberation Army, which, for all its size and influence, had become sclerotic and inward-looking.

Since late 2015, Mr. Xi has reorganized the army to weaken the traditional land forces and shift more resources to the technology-dependent naval, air and missile forces. Seven military regions — the heart of the old arm-focused system — were replaced with five new theater commands, and the army is cutting 300,000 enlisted soldiers and officers, paring the military to two million personnel.

Mr. Xi wants to create an integrated armed forces that can enforce China’s claims to disputed islands in the East and South China Seas, offset American influence and protect China’s growing interests as far away as Africa, Latin America and the polar regions.

It is a military that, while not yet a rival to the United States, could soon be one.

“China’s military modernization is targeting capabilities with the potential to degrade core U.S. military-technological advantages,” the Pentagon’s annual report to Congress on China’s military abilities asserted.

China’s military spending, officially $144 billion in 2016, still lags far behind the more than $600 billion spent last year by the United States. China, though, spends nearly three times as much as Russia, and its annual defense budgets are expected to continue to grow 7 percent per year on average, the report said.

“If I look out to 2025, and I look at the demographics and the economic situation, I think China probably poses the greatest threat to our nation,” Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified at his Senate reconfirmation hearing.

The biggest challenges to Mr. Xi’s military modernization may involve updating attitudes as well as technology. It could take years for new commanders to overcome rivalries and learn to operate jointly in the fog of war. But experts already credit with Mr. Xi with making significant progress in creating a leaner, more modern, more professional force.

“No one had the political mojo to pull it off until Xi Jinping, and Xi Jinping only had an anticorruption campaign to use as a hammer,” said James Mulvenon, a specialist on China’s military at SOS International, a firm that provides security services and advice. “The P.L.A. has known that they have to go to a joint force structure and get rid of the military regions for 25 years, but they had not been able to generate the political will to be able to do that. He was able to do it.”","Xi Jinping Presses Military Overhaul, and Two Generals Disappear",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/world/asia/xi-jinping-military-china-purge.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

KUB was at first focused solely on townhouse development in Brooklyn. But one Saturday in 2014, the firm’s founders learned that 150 Wooster was for sale. They made an offer that day, and closed on the property soon after, for nearly $51 million.

Years of approval-seeking followed. New York’s City Council had to agree to a zoning change, a move that also relaxed the requirement that residents had to be artists. That requirement dates to the early 1970s, when many painters and sculptors began relocating to commercial structures in the then-shabby neighborhood.

The city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission also had to sign off on the facade, which has cream-colored, thin Danish bricks and a ribbed steel cornice that resembles an egg-slicer. Having a designer like Mr. Schillberg in-house, as opposed to using one employed by an outside firm, made the approval process smoother and faster, Mr. Katz said.

An earlier condo proposal for the site from MTM Associates, an entity linked to Maclaren, the baby-stroller company that once had a showroom in the small building on the property, had run into opposition from neighbors, who sued to stop it. The City Council later rejected the rezoning that the project required.

For its part, KUB has taken steps to mollify some of those neighbors, including positioning 150 Wooster so that its walls do not block windows at 152 Wooster, according to residents of that building.

The apartments at 150 Wooster, each of which takes up at least a full floor and has four bedrooms and four-and-a-half baths, are inspired by the roomy lofts for which SoHo is famous.

Living rooms are spacious, at about 800 square feet, and most have four windows. Also, the almost industrial-size, six-burner Wolf ranges made of steel in the kitchens are meant to recall the restaurant-grade appliances SoHo pioneers once purchased at supply stores on the nearby Bowery, Mr. Schillberg said.

All apartments also have gas fireplaces, with plaster finishes that recall adobe, the popular Santa Fe building material. Brass is also prevalent, including for the sinks in powder rooms and inlays in white-oak floors.

Master closets, with about 90 square feet of space, and in some cases, frosted-glass windows, are also notable. Each apartment also comes with a laundry room, with a sink and counter for folding.

For struggling artists, the apartments, which are being marketed by CORE New Development, are likely out of reach. Their starting price is about $13 million, or about $3,200 a square foot. Sales begin this fall. In comparison, the average price of new condos in SoHo — an admittedly short list — was $9.8 million on Oct. 6, according to Streeteasy.com.

KUB principals acknowledge the Manhattan-wide slowdown affecting ultraluxury properties could be a concern. But since 150 Wooster is a new product — a relative rare commodity in the neighborhood — the hope is that it will buck the trend. Other condos there, like 63 Greene Street, are conversions.

There have been other local ground-up examples in the last few years, like 52 Wooster Street and 42 Crosby Street. But they tend to be located in the southern part of the neighborhood, unlike No. 150, which is more in the heart of the district, the developers said.

Many obstetricians resist giving epidural anesthesia during the late stage of delivery because they believe it lengthens the duration of labor. But a clinical trial by Chinese researchers has found that it does not.

The study, in Obstetrics & Gynecology, randomized 400 women in labor to receive either a standard epidural anesthetic or a saline solution in an identical container. Neither the patients nor the health care providers knew who was receiving which.

The average time from full dilation of the cervix to delivery was 51 minutes in the saline group and 52 minutes in the women who got the anesthetic, a difference of no clinical significance.

The number of cesarean sections, the number of forceps deliveries and the number of episiotomies were almost identical in the two groups. Seventeen of the obstetricians in the saline group stopped the infusion to speed labor, compared with 21 in the epidural group, again an insignificant statistical difference.

The only difference between groups was that the women who received the anesthetic expressed greater satisfaction with their pain control.

“Turning off the anesthesia won’t help,” said the senior author, Dr. Philip E. Hess, an associate professor of anesthesia at Harvard. “If you decide you want an epidural for pain relief, you should not be concerned that it’s going to prevent a vaginal delivery or cause any negative effect on labor.”",Epidurals Do Not Prolong Labor,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/well/family/epidurals-do-not-prolong-labor.html

All of Japan’s major carmakers — Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota — are looking into their use of Kobe Steel materials.
The improperly certified metals had been shipped to about 200 companies, but Kobe Steel declined to reveal their names.","Last week, Nissan Motor said unqualified staff members had carried out inspections at its factories, prompting the carmaker to recall 1.2 million vehicles, though it was not clear if the quality of the vehicles had been affected. Mitsubishi Motors and Suzuki Motor both admitted last year that they had been exaggerating the fuel economy of their vehicles by cheating on tests.

Perhaps the biggest blow to Japan’s reputation for quality has come from Takata, the airbag maker that was at the center of the largest auto safety recall in history, involving tens of millions of vehicles. Its faulty airbags have been blamed for more than a dozen deaths. Takata declared bankruptcy in June.

Toshiaki Oguchi, director of Governance for Owners Japan, a corporate watchdog, said that Japanese companies were generally diligent about quality, but that when cheating occurred — because of competitive pressure or other factors — it could too easily go unchecked. Japanese companies, he said, tend to discourage thorough examination or criticism, either from employees or from independent outsiders.

“When something goes wrong, companies always hire a committee of outsiders to examine what happened,” Mr. Oguchi said. “But why not be proactive? Why not have people reviewing procedures all the time?”

The extent of the problems at Kobe Steel are still unfolding.

Kobe Steel said on Sunday that employees at four of its factories had altered inspection certificates on aluminum and copper products from September 2016 to August this year. The changes, it said, made it look as if the products met manufacturing specifications required by customers — including for vital qualities like tensile strength, a measure of stiffness — when they did not.

On Wednesday, the company said it was investigating possible data falsification involving another product, powdered steel, which is used mostly to make gears. The company said the powdered steel it was examining had been sold to one customer it did not name.

Kobe Steel added that it was examining other possible episodes of data falsification going back 10 years. The company did not provide significant details on the discrepancies, making it difficult to immediately determine if they posed a safety threat. No deaths or safety incidents have been attributed to Kobe Steel.

The company’s share price dropped sharply on Tuesday, the first day of trading after a holiday, and as of Wednesday morning in Tokyo had lost about one-third of its value since last week.

“The falsification problem has become an issue that could destroy international faith in Japanese manufacturing,” the Japanese financial newspaper Nikkei said in an article on Tuesday.

Even as Japan has given up its lead in technologies like televisions, cellphones and computers, it still excels in highly valued products used behind the scenes, including precision machinery, specialty chemicals, sensors and cameras.

Quality helps Japan preserve its markets overseas despite intense competition. Although China is the world’s largest steel maker, Japan still exports large amounts of iron and steel there.

One of the products at the center of the scandal, rolled aluminum, is widely used in the transportation industry because it is light. The lighter a car, train or airplane, the less fuel required to propel it.

Global manufacturers are now trying to assess their exposure, as they dig through an extensive supply chain.

A big car company like G.M. buys millions of tons of steel a year from a dozen or two dozen producers, in a variety of grades and forms. Steel can be sourced from different mills and shipped to any number of plants worldwide. G.M., for example, has 12 vehicle assembly plants and six stamping plants in the United States alone, all of which take deliveries of steel from many different producers.

All of Japan’s major carmakers — Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota — are looking into their use of Kobe Steel materials. Toyota called the data falsification a “grave issue” and said it was looking into the problem and considering how best to respond, a statement echoed by other carmakers. Ford and General Motors are trying to determine whether they have used the company’s products.

Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which makes equipment for Shinkansen high-speed trains in Japan, said it was investigating. JR Tokai, a railway company that operates the busiest Shinkansen route in Japan, between Tokyo and Osaka, said that the data discrepancies “do not present a problem in terms of design standards,” but that it was nonetheless considering whether to replace certain train components.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries uses aluminum from Kobe Steel in a midsize aircraft it is developing, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, as well as aircraft components it supplies to Boeing. Mitsubishi Heavy said it was investigating. Boeing said in a statement, “Nothing in our review to date leads us to conclude that this issue presents a safety concern, and we will continue to work diligently with our suppliers to complete our investigation.”

Kobe Steel’s problem points to “a common organization issue,” said Shin Ushijima, a lawyer who serves as president of the Japan Corporate Governance Network. He drew parallels between Kobe Steel and Takata and Mitsubishi, as well as with financial-reporting improprieties at Toshiba, which admitted to overstating profit in 2015.

“Boards aren’t doing their jobs,” he said. “This isn’t an issue that can be solved by the president resigning. There needs to be wholesale change.”

He added, “The Kobe Steel case is a test of whether we’ve learned anything from Toshiba and these other issues.”

Kobe Steel said it had confirmed data falsification affecting roughly 19,300 tons of flat-rolled and extruded aluminum products, 19,400 units of aluminum casting and forgings, and 2,200 tons of copper products. The amount was about 4 percent of the company’s output of those products from September 2016 to August.

The company said that it had received no reports from customers of problems with the affected products, and that the falsification had been discovered during an internal review. The improperly certified metals had been shipped to about 200 companies, but Kobe Steel declined to reveal their names.

It said “tens” of employees and managers had been directly involved in the falsification, although no penalties against the employees were immediately announced.

PhotoIn an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well.","From grizzled cotton farmers to quiet small-town buildings and roadside stands, Walker Evans built his reputation on chronicling America’s out-of-the-way places and people. And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common. Born Walker Evans III, the scion of a prominent family, he grew up in privilege, attending Phillips Academy and then Williams College, dropping out after one year.

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

Photo

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

“My fascination for fashion photography emerged because of my complete disbelief at how widely ignored the genre was in academia,” said Ms. Shinkle, a reader in photography at the University of Westminster, London.
Photo“The history of fashion photography is the history of a growing confidence in its ability to comment explicitly on the wider world,” Ms. Shinkle noted.

“Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said.","With so many exhibits and monographs devoted to fashion photography and its leading practitioners, it’s hard to imagine that it wasn’t that long ago that the genre was seldom the focus of highbrow studies. Yet, that’s what Eugénie Shinkle discovered when she began researching it almost a decade ago.

“My fascination for fashion photography emerged because of my complete disbelief at how widely ignored the genre was in academia,” said Ms. Shinkle, a reader in photography at the University of Westminster, London. “Apart from a handful of exceptions, there was a real reluctance amongst scholars to engage with it in a serious way,” she said. “Unapologetically commercial, it had been reduced to ‘only advertising.’ And, until recently — that is until it started appearing in galleries — it was considered to be ephemeral. Because it wasn’t meant to last and because it wasn’t created with any kind of critical or artistic intent, people didn’t believe its history should be approached in that way.”

After publishing “Fashion as Photograph: Viewing and Reviewing Images of Fashion” in 2008, which examined why the genre deserves intellectual scrutiny, she’s now releasing “Fashion Photography: The Story in 180 Pictures,” a compendium of important figures who help chart the genre’s evolution. From Camille Silvy, a diplomat turned studio photographer in the 1850s, to the contemporary creative couple of Maurice Scheltens and Liesbeth Abbenes, who specialize in abstract still lives, the volume published by Aperture chronicles various movements and turning points.

“The history of fashion photography is the history of a growing confidence in its ability to comment explicitly on the wider world,” Ms. Shinkle noted. “Initially, it was reluctant to engage explicitly with politics, but since the end of the ’60s it has become more openly, overtly and unabashedly political.”

After World War II, photographers like Henry Clarke subtly alluded to the changing role of women in society by portraying them as “independent and in control,” writes Ms. Shinkle. Artists like William Klein parodied fashion conventions and encouraged his peers to engage in self-criticism. Even Richard Avedon proved to be a revelation: “I learned to appreciate his depth and talent by seeing how he was able to reinvent himself halfway through his career and noticing how ardently he campaigned for the use of models of color. Creatively, and politically, he’s one of the most important fashion photographers of the 20th century.”

By the ’90s, thanks in no small part to the nonconformist British magazine “The Face,” the grunge movement — which challenged gender norms, capitalism and the ideals of social respectability — appeared in mainstream publications and paved the way for today’s more cerebral work. Collier Schorr’s images, for example, question gender fluidity, notions of desire and how identity is constructed, while Chen Man speaks up creatively about China’s complexities.

Photo

Looking at the people in the volume, it also become more apparent how conservative the industry has been. Most photographers listed are Western-educated white men. This is due in part to the author’s and publisher’s decision to keep close reins on what was considered a primer. “We focused on the West because that’s where the major fashion houses and publications have historically been located,” Ms. Shinkle said. “I had to make that decision early on. Did I want to include more vernacular practices like that of Cameroonian photographer Samuel Fosso, who has been doing amazing fashion-inspired work since the ’70s? Or, did I want to restrict it to so-called pure fashion photography?”

In doing so, she revealed how difficult it has been for traditionally marginalized groups to be taken seriously. Case in point: Women, in the early 20th century, were rarely behind the camera. Yva, Madame D’Ora and Toni Frissell were trailblazers working “at a time when that was not what a well-bred women did, because photography was seen as a technical job.” To showcase them and highlight their technical prowess and unique perspectives is to revise history, which too often ignored them. Similarly, the inclusion of the Harlem Renaissance photographer James Van Der Zee, well known in the African-American community, but virtually unknown at the time outside of it, “points out how exclusive and white-centric the industry was in those years.”

While there’s now a more diverse roster, there’s still a long way to go. “Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said. “It’s representative and it popularizes certain tendencies in ways that no other type of photography can because it’s so ubiquitous.”

Correction: Sept. 27 2017:

An earlier version of this article misstated the academic title held by Ms. Shinkle. She is a reader in photography, not a professor of Photographic Theory and Criticism.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect.
Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.
“The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said.","Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

Many people fear the companies will be able to translate their hold on key digital platforms into wholesale ownership of adjacent industries that depend on those platforms, giving them wider economic and social power.

The entertainment industry is a good place to assess those claims because in different ways, the Five have spent years building platforms for the distribution of art, culture and media. Facebook runs the news; Google’s YouTube has videos and music; Microsoft’s Xbox has games; Amazon runs books, movies and TV (and, through its web-hosting service, AWS, hosts much else, including Netflix); and Apple has pretty much of the same, plus all those apps.

Yet in entertainment, we also see the limits of their efforts to push into new territory. Though their technologies have altered nearly everything about how we buy and experience popular culture, the Five themselves have not been the greatest beneficiaries of the changes.

They are pouring money into entertainment, but they have been cornered by nimbler start-ups like Netflix and Spotify. Amazon has struggled to make a hit show, while Apple’s plans for original TV are perpetually around the corner. (It has now struck a deal to revive “Amazing Stories,” the 1980s Steven Spielberg series; there’s no word on when it will air.) All of the Five have labored to create some killer position in the tumultuous new marketplaces their platforms have enabled.

Several times in conversations with people in Hollywood, I heard the tech people referred to as “dumb money” — the sort of outsiders (in the past, they came from oil, then from finance) who parade through town looking to call the shots. One Hollywood executive who has worked often with tech companies told me: “I wouldn’t say we’ve looked at them with fear, no.”

The Five’s struggles in entertainment, if they persist, suggest that they can be as clueless about the changes wrought by technology as the rest of us — that they do not quite understand, and haven’t yet begun to master, how to translate their technological power into wider cultural power.

Not long ago, this story looked a lot more open-and-shut. With the iPod and iTunes, Apple acquired dominance over a music industry that was struggling to respond to the digital age. Amazon eclipsed Barnes & Noble as the biggest boogeyman of the indie bookstore; for years, it fought bruising battles with the publishing industry over sales contracts that publishers said were too onerous. Through YouTube, Google gained control over not just funny cat videos, but also the modern replacement for radio. (People watch a lot of music videos on YouTube.) And Facebook has become the world’s most popular source of news, a position that has consumed its leaders over much of the last year.

There’s no doubt that technology has upended the economics of modern cultural businesses. In a recent polemic, “Move Fast and Break Things,” Jonathan Taplin, the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California (and a former rock band manager and movie producer), points out that musicians could once make a decent living off their royalty checks.

Digital technology has now completely undercut that business. YouTube has made every song available online, and even though many artists are paid a cut of the ads placed on YouTube (the company said it paid out $1 billion last year), the money is nothing close to what artists got from selling records.

Mr. Taplin sees what has happened in music as a harbinger for much of the rest of culture. “The rise of the digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries in our country,” he wrote.

But there is another side to the story. As I’ve argued before, while musicians have had to find new sources of revenue, the rise of online subscriptions and a new consumer willingness to pay have led to an explosion of new cultural voices.

Meanwhile, some earlier doomsaying has not come true: Indie bookstores and print books are making a comeback, while publishers are enjoying record profits. And the tech giants’ eagerness to create entertainment marketplaces has led to a bonanza for some artists. To compete for new members, Apple, Tidal and other streaming services are paying out lavish bonuses; Apple paid Chance the Rapper $500,000 for two weeks of exclusive access to his latest album.

The tech-industry money train is making its biggest hauls in Hollywood. “There are so many new markets for talent and writers to go to, and the creators here love that,” said Marty Kaplan, a professor of entertainment, media and society at the U.S.C. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. “Instead of having seven buyers for your idea, there are now more like 20 — and that makes everybody happy.”

This story may sound puzzling. The tech giants are the most sophisticated media companies in the world, so why, after prying open their wallets, have they struggled to capture Hollywood?

It’s because technology is not all that matters. The Five acquired their power by mastering the tech industry. They achieved dominance in a field that’s won with information, data and precision.

But even though they now control valuable platforms, as they move to areas that require them to stretch their skills they are finding that they won’t be able to roll in and take over. Several people in Hollywood told me that many of the Five just didn’t seem to “get” the movie and TV business. They had brought Northern California’s tech ideas to Southern California’s entertainment party, and did not understand the value of imagination, talent and subjective inspiration.

This myopia is part of a pattern that will repeat itself often in this series. You see it in how Facebook got caught off guard by how it was used during the election, or in YouTube’s surprise that some of its biggest stars were pushing hateful ideas on its platform.

The tech giants have upended much of society, but even they have difficulty understanding and navigating the chaos of the new platforms they have built.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said.","“We worry when you look hard at us, but we are also touchy about being overlooked,” then-Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson of Canada told a group of American students in 1963. The quote, reprinted in the June 10th issue of The New York Times of that year, still rings true today, especially as a Canadian like myself goes through thousands of images of Canada from the newspaper’s archives.

Earlier this year, the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto received a donation of 24,804 images from a collector, Chris Bratty, who had purchased the collection with the intention of donating it. Selected by a team led by two gallerists, Steven Kasher and Stephen Bulger, the pictures range from World War I to the late 1990s, from hockey players to lumberjacks. A selection is currently on view in an exhibition at the center and in a book, both entitled “The Faraway Nearby.”

“When I heard of the collection, I immediately wanted to acquire it,” said Paul Roth, an American who is the center’s director. “For all the strengths of our holdings — including the Black Star and the Berenice Abbott archives — we don’t have a tremendous amount of Canadian photojournalism. This helps us fill that gap. And, since it comes from a major U.S. newspaper, it brings up the question of how one country covers another, which fits within our mandate of interrogating different aspects of the medium.”

The expected tropes are there: Canada as a winter wonderland; as a safe, polite neighbor who reveres hockey. But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes. In one photo, Nikita S. Khrushchev laughs at a joke told by Mr. Pearson — the opposite of the famous “Kitchen Debate” moment by Elliott Erwitt, in which then-Vice President Richard Nixon castigates the Soviet leader. In another, Fidel Castro holds Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau’s youngest son, Michel Charles-Émile, during a four-day state visit. Or, Canada the troubled young nation deploying the Army to confront Quebec’s sometimes-violent calls for independence.

“The type of coverage we see speaks of a dual fascination between how familiar Canada feels, and yet how unfamiliar it sometimes appears,” Mr. Roth surmised. “I suspect that The New York Times had to ponder how to cover a country that was so close. Should they concentrate on the differences or highlight the similarities? When stories involved people or goods crossing the border, which was often the case, were they to be considered national or international news?”

Besides snow and hockey, evidence of Canada’s subordination to the British monarchy seemed of particular interest. The New York Times dedicated space daily to Princess Elizabeth’s first tour of Canada in 1951 (Slide 9) and continued to chronicle the royal family’s subsequent visits.

Mr. Trudeau also drew a lot of attention, more than any of his predecessors and successors, that is, until his son Justin ran for the same office and won in 2015. A reproduction of a spread published during the 1972 election is revealing. Within “The World” section, the article isn’t under a rubric with the country’s name, as is customary, but simply “Trudeau,” and a headline declaring “A Swinger Shows His Sober Side.” A full column is dedicated to a collage of images showing the candidate dancing, riding a motorcycle, playing hockey and pedaling a unicycle before concluding with a somber close-up portrait.

Mounting the exhibition, Denise Birkhofer — an American who recently settled in Toronto and co-curated the show with Gerald McMaster, an Indigenous Canadian of Plains Cree and Blackfoot descent — pondered how The New York Times’s fondness for certain subjects and visual archetypes might have shaped a national identity. That’s hard to answer, partly because of the variety of photographers who contributed to the paper’s Canadian coverage.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said. “Not all were Americans. Sometimes staff photographers were sent to cover a story, but other times it came from local publications or freelancers. There were also images made by Canadian agencies or corporations, such as the National Film Board and the Canadian Pacific Railway.”

Photo

Most surprisingly, during World War I, the images the paper used to showcase Canada’s participation in the war effort were supplied by Canadian entities, whose work had to be vetted by the nation’s official censors. Its goal was to avoid criticism of military endeavors by showing the conflict in a romanticized light. In other words, said Gaëlle Morel, the Ryerson Image Center exhibitions curator, “The New York Times — a private commercial enterprise — obeyed the censorship requirements of a foreign country.” In other words, the country’s image, as seen in The Times, reflected an official, sanitized perspective.

Mr. Roth said the collection has greater meaning given Canada’s sesquicentennial this year. “More than a time for celebration and patriotism, it is an occasion to think about complicated questions relating to the identity of the nation,” he said. “All countries should be interested in how they’re viewed by other states. We should strive to get past the mythologies that are created to promote tourism or to reinforce patriotic values, especially nowadays. Doing so requires unpacking widely held cultural assumptions. And that’s exactly what we can do thanks to this archive. While it doesn’t tell a single story, it does help us understand what the Canadian mythologies are.”

They wait on a platform at the Milan train station in 1970, their many suitcases secured with rope, their bags filled to the brim. A box of panettone, a Milanese holiday specialty, accompanies this family of travelers, suggesting Christmastime. Dressed for the cold, the family of five — parents, children, and an older woman wearing black from head to toe — gaze to the right, pondering perhaps their unknown destinies. We see them in Gianni Berengo Gardin’s photograph, shot at mid-distance from above, a portrait of Italy as a migrant nation.

I know these people.

No, they are not my family, but they could be. My parents left their respective mountain towns for New York City two decades earlier than those in the photo, fleeing the destruction, the penury and the hopelessness of post-World War II Italy.

The family on the platform could have easily been one of the multitudes of migrating Italians I encountered on trains when I lived in Milan and Bologna in the mid-1970s, traveling between their hometowns and northern Italian cities, Switzerland, Germany, and other enchanted places of drudgery, sacrifice and desires, temporary stops along an unending journey toward security.

Indeed, Italians keep leaving now, not with the same desperation of the undereducated masses that changed the course of nations in North and South America beginning in the 19th century, but with college degrees and smartphones in hands, grasping for opportunities their country remains incapable of providing.

These images from the mid-20th century capture the ubiquity and possibility of travel and escape, from the gaggle of scugnizzi (street urchins) hitching a ride on the back of a Neapolitan tram to a couple cuddling in their bathing suits, nestled between train tracks. I know them too, having met them in my own travels across the peninsula, heard about them in family stories on both sides of the Atlantic, and encountered them through the countless viewings of films by the likes of Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, and Michelangelo Antonioni.

The 31 black-and-white images displayed in the London gallery exhibition of Gardin’s work, “The Italians,” are, for the most part, those he made in the midcentury, when Italy hovered between agrarian provincialism and an internationally touted cosmopolitanism. The meta-image of an Asian tourist posing for a photographic portrait against a Mediterranean backdrop highlights Italy as destination, in stark disparity to the fleeing migrant family.

Contrasts are a leitmotif for Gardin, as seen with the seven girls in communion whites delighted by a dark-haired dog before them, or the jangle of men on a train, caught in mirrored reflections. The pairing of Italy with style and leisure is found in the photos of an elegantly veiled woman in sunglasses and pearls aboard what appears to be a Venetian water taxi, and the portly man in bathing trunks beatifically splayed on an outcrop, the sea below a resounding swirl.

Photo

Gardin is a master of the patterned panorama, vistas of startling beauty shot from above: In one image a donkey-driven plow cuts a billowing swath across an astonishingly stark landscape and in another, two men scurry across a plank in a flooded Piazza San Marco. These are captured flashes of haunting revelation.

His images are not merely of the real, the documented — they are also reveries of the imagination. Lovers, clothed but barefoot, embrace on a beach. A blanket, a pair of shoes and vinyl records in the foreground.

I know them, too.

But her repetitive, intrusive thoughts are her true torment. She’s obsessed with — and repulsed by — the ecosystem of bacteria that seethes inside her, and the bacteria that live without. She can’t stop worrying about the rumble in her gut, or the breeding microbes therein, or the possibility of contracting an infection involving clostridium difficile, or the prospect of sweating, or not being able to stop sweating, or touching someone who is sweating. She has to fight off the insistent, unignorable urge to put hand sanitizer in her mouth. Sometimes the urge wins.

We spend long stretches inside Aza’s head, listening to these swift and unsteady thoughts. The rational part of her, the one that sees a therapist and fitfully takes medication, tries to talk herself down. But her mind is in the throes of a civil war.

“Please let me go,” Aza tells her unwanted thoughts at a particularly helpless moment. “I’ll do anything. I’ll stand down.”

If Green were writing in his usual register, he’d interrupt Aza’s descents into these cognitive spirals — or “light-swallowing wormholes,” as she once calls them — with a bit of humor. But he seems to have made a decision: If Aza can’t find relief, neither can we.

The first few chapters of “Turtles All the Way Down” are a little crude, a little awkward and a little slow to get off the ground — it’s as if Green needed extra time on the runway to overcome the weight of a success like “The Fault in Our Stars,” which became a touchstone for teenagers everywhere. (It has been rated 2,529,550 times on Goodreads, a number that continues to spin forward even as I type, like the odometer of a spaceship.) The premise: An Indianapolis billionaire has skipped town just before the police come to get him for bribery and fraud. A $100,000 reward is on offer to anyone who’s got the skinny on his whereabouts. Aza’s best friend, Daisy (the tornado), remembers that Aza knows this guy’s son. Wouldn’t he know something? And wouldn’t a hundred grand be grand?

Aza does know his son. She’d met him years ago at “Sad Camp,” a summer program for kids who’d lost one or both of their parents. Aza had lost her father; Davis, the billionaire’s son, lost his mother. Now it seems that both of his parents are gone.

So Aza reluctantly agrees to pay Davis a visit, and the novel — boom — begins in earnest. The two feel an ancient kinship, a bonding of broken souls. He’s terrified that his identity is inseparable from his money; she’s terrified that her identity is inseparable from her thoughts — aren’t people the sum of their thoughts? If they aren’t, what are they? “If you can’t pick what you do or think about,” she explains to him, “then maybe you aren’t really real, you know?”

A sweet, conventional love story begins. But it hits a bittersweet, unconventional dead end. Aza can’t kiss Davis without panicking. All those microbes. “I’m not gonna un-have this,” she miserably explains of her condition.

Still they bond. And Aza and Daisy try to solve the mystery of Davis’s father’s disappearance. At one point, Daisy gives Aza hell — doesn’t she see how her mental illness has made her self-absorbed? — and it’s awful. Then it isn’t. The friendships in Green’s novels are stirring and powerful. They’re one of the reasons we show up to read them.

“You are my favorite person,” Daisy tells Aza after they’ve reconciled. “I want to be buried next to you. We’ll have a shared tombstone.”

But the real question is: How does such a story end for Aza?

If an author has integrity, it should end plausibly. Green has integrity. He also has O.C.D. He’s tweeted about it; he’s discussed it on his famous video blog with his brother, Hank. Watch his entry from July 25 sometime.

I still wasn’t prepared for the ending of this novel. It’s so surprising and moving and true that I became completely unstrung, incapable of reading it to my husband without breaking down. One needn’t be suffering like Aza to identify with it. One need only be human.

At the James Cole Winery, in Napa, the co-owner James Harder and his family evacuated Sunday night after the fire demolished the eight-foot fence surrounding the vineyard. Neighboring homes were burning to the ground, as was the nearby Signorello winery.

“We thought our property was gone,” Mr. Harder said.

But then the winds shifted. He and several friends returned to James Cole and formed a “bucket brigade” to put out remaining flames, saving all but a few small outbuildings.

On Tuesday, Mr. Harder returned through “very dangerous smoke and haze” with a rented truck to rescue grapes that had been waiting in bins and barrels to ferment. The winery still had five acres of unpicked grapes and 10 tons of the fruit in the cellar.

“We tasted some, and they were still pretty good,” Mr. Harder said. “But we smell like smoke, so we don’t know what we’re really tasting.”

The wine industry in Napa County supports 46,000 jobs locally through the 700 grape growers and 475 wineries operating in the area, the vast majority of them family owned, according to the Napa Valley Vintners trade group.

For now, wineries are trying to hook up generators for electricity and will most likely be out of operation for four or five days, said Pete Richmond, who runs Silverado Farming Company, a vineyard management firm.

“The biggest issue is trying to reach out to people to contact them to come back to work, because a lot have evacuated and cell service is miserable,” he said. “And we’re trying to reach places, but the roads are still closed and we don’t know when we’ll have access to them.”

Last year, California wineries drew 23.6 million visits and $7.2 billion in tourist expenditures, according to the Wine Institute. The area is known for its cabernet sauvignon grapes, which currently fetch more than $8,000 a ton, according to an annual report from the Silicon Valley Bank.

Wineries that lost vineyards will have to wait three to five years to nurse the soil back to health and coax out a viable crop of grapes, said Karissa Kruse, president of the Sonoma County Winegrowers.

Surviving grapes may suffer smoke taint — a smoky flavor that makes them unusable for fine wine, she said. Wineries damaged or destroyed by the fire could lose vast reserves of wines aging in barrels and bottles. The repercussions of the fire on wine stored in barrels and tanks is unclear.

Still, Ms. Kruse pointed to some silver linings. In most cases, the flames destroyed the brush planted between the rows of grapes, and not the resilient vines themselves. And record-breaking temperatures in September meant that fewer grapes were left exposed to the fires.

“For the most part, the vintage is in, and we should still have a viable wine community as we move forward,” Ms. Kruse said. “We all grumbled that the Labor Day heat was going to define the 2017 vintage, but it expedited the harvest, which we now look at as such a blessing.”","In California Wine Country, Wildfires Take a Toll on Vintages and Tourism",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/business/wineries-california-wildfire.html

The last time I went, these hot-and-cold shrimp weren’t on the menu. I hope they are using their time away to think about the choices they’ve made.

Nothing else was so misconceived. But spicy avocado dip punched the lights out of a delicately flaky Chinese scallion pancake with basil in place of scallions. Nondescript cheese, bland mushrooms and a pointless egg dragged down a pizza with a very good, light crust. And Manhattan clam chowder, repurposed as a sauce for a fine, clean-tasting hunk of pan-seared salmon, was the answer to a question nobody asked.

The only reason I can think of for hijacking red chowder like this is to make a connection with New York. But with a few exceptions, Public Kitchen doesn’t explore the city’s food in a coherent or illuminating way. And it doesn’t come close to hitting, as the website puts it, “all of the cultures that make up the eclectic mix and melting pot that is New York City.” Thai flavors animate one side dish, roasted carrots in red curry paste and coconut milk. But the main cuisines brought into play are Italian and Chinese, as if it were still 1970.

A good menu doesn’t need a theme to hang together, of course. The pastry chef, Eric Kalaboke, found a through line in slightly old-fashioned favorites like a fruit cobbler capped with sweet sticks of puff pastry, an extremely endearing chocolate layer cake with blackberry sorbet and peanut butter ice cream, and a quietly spectacular tartufo resting in sour-cherry syrup. As for the wine list, it does a great job of presenting reasonably priced bottles from all over, made by some of the leading producers in their regions. This is a nice surprise in a hotel that seems to have been built as a backdrop for the cocktail lifestyle.

And if your big idea is New York City, you’re probably better off underplaying it than going all out like the Grill, where they all but park a Checker cab next to your table. There are no lectures at Public Kitchen, blessedly, no footnotes or history lessons. The closest I got to an elucidation of the menu was when a server said, “Everything is individually portioned and meant to be shared with the table” — a Zen koan for our time.

Still, it’s a sign of trouble that what Public Kitchen is trying to pull off doesn’t come across clearly. You can have a meal that is mostly very good, or one that is decidedly mixed, but either way you will probably walk out not entirely sure what sets this restaurant apart, other than Mr. Vongerichten’s sensibility.

He doesn’t layer flavors like anyone else. These days he doesn’t have as many imitators as he used to, either, although his spicy tuna tartare slicked with sesame oil will be with us forever. He trots it out again at Public Kitchen, over sliced avocado, with an undulated rice cracker that left oil on my fingers.

It’s hard to tell whether he’s repeating himself, making a sly comment on how pervasive the dish is in New York, or both.

When Will Shortz ran Brian Greer’s American crossword debut in The New York Times in June, we learned that Mr. Greer, a former crossword editor for The Times of London, had succeeded in also having a cryptic crossword run on the same day, with the same Harry Potter-based theme, in The Times.

That’s a good thing, because I’ve been told there will be a fairly large number of British people making the crossing on the Times Journeys trans-Atlantic crossword cruise in December, so I can say that I am conversant. Or at least sound like I am.

Am I an expert? Not at all. But it’s a vastly different mental tug-of-war between the solver, setter and editor than the American-style crosswords I’m used to, and it’s a very pleasurable break for me.

But you’ll want to book before you hit about 10 days out from Christmas Day, Mr. Surry said.

“Based on Hopper’s historical data, the best time to book Christmas flights is about 83 days before departure, which is the first week of October. Prices begin rising by about $4 per day around Thanksgiving, and then by about $7 per day in the final two weeks,” Mr. Surry said.

Does It Matter Which Day I Book?

There are several different theories about which day of the week, and time of day, has the most affordable fares. For example, Priceline.com data shows that the cheapest day of the week to purchase is Friday, despite the majority of tickets being purchased on a Tuesday.

But there might not be a whole lot to gain from focusing on the day of the week.

“Pricing is extremely nuanced,” Mr. Surry said. “Everyone wants a golden rule about when to buy, but it really depends on your route, dates and demand.”

“If you have flexibility, in general it will pay to extend your trip,” Mr. Surry said.

Regarding Thanksgiving, the most expensive day to depart is the Wednesday before, which should not come as a surprise as it’s also one of the busiest travel days of the year. But if you are able to leave on the Monday or the Thursday of that week you can save around $50 on the first leg of your trip. The same goes for your return day. The busiest and most expensive day to come back is Sunday. But you can save around $160 by returning on Wednesday, Nov. 29, instead, Mr. Surry said.

For Christmas this year, the cheapest days to depart are Saturday, Dec. 16, or Tuesday, Dec. 19, which can save you about $110 compared to traveling on the busiest day, which is Friday, Dec. 22. The most popular return day is New Year’s Day, and returning on Thursday, Jan. 4, instead could save you around $100, according to Hopper’s data.

Does It Matter Where I’m Going?

Yes, data for domestic flights show that some destination cities are more expensive to travel to than others, which can be tied to demand.

Priceline.com found that the most popular travel route for both Thanksgiving and Christmas is New York City to Florida (Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando). For Christmas travel, these destination cities are also among the ones with the highest “holiday premium,” as Hopper terms it, meaning the greatest increase in price compared to non-holiday travel.

No matter where you are traveling from for the Christmas holiday, you can expect to pay up to 82 percent more for a fare to Miami ($383 instead of $211), according to Hopper. Fort Lauderdale and Orlando see spikes of over 60 percent.

For Thanksgiving, you can expect to spend 40 percent more than usual for trips to Denver and Boston.

What Priestley wants you to understand in “Time and the Conways” is that such men are not the creators of rotten societies.","Though the Roundabout production, which opened on Tuesday evening, stars Elizabeth McGovern as the materfamilias, the story really is Kay’s. (She is played well, if with an overly neurotic edge, by Charlotte Parry.) It is Kay who mediates the two halves of the title. During the 1919 scenes she is occasionally stopped in her tracks by presentiments of what’s in store around the corner. It may even be that the 1937 scene is merely her dream — or nightmare.

For us it is a bit of both. Parts of “Time and the Conways” come off as obvious exercises in dramatic irony, as tedious as those charades. Other parts look at the world as it really is and are freshly gripping.

So give credit to the Roundabout for producing this thoughtful revival of an ambitious, vexing, multilayered drama. Still, there’s a reason it has not appeared on Broadway since its 1938 American premiere. Too often it feels like an elaborate mechanism for deploying once-fashionable cosmological ideas.

Influenced by the popular philosopher J. W. Dunne, and particularly his 1927 treatise “An Experiment With Time,” Priestley sought a dramatic structure that would demonstrate the idea that all parts of our lives occur simultaneously, even if we usually see only the current “cross section.” If we could instead grasp the whole thing, he argues, or at least have faith that it exists, we might stop acting as if “we were all in a panic on a sinking ship.”

The argument is flaky. Worse, it isn’t convincing on the play’s own terms. The evidence Priestley presents in the 1937 scene in no way bears out the belief expounded by placid Alan (Gabriel Ebert) that time is a “dream” moving us safely “from one peephole to the next.” Rather, the plot seems to support Kay’s view of time as “a great devil in the universe,” ruining everything indiscriminately.

Rebecca Taichman’s lovely staging does what it can visually to correct, or at least finesse, this problem. The simple morning-room set by Neil Patel performs a terrific bit of symbolic reconfiguration to accommodate the play’s porous sense of time, and Ms. Taichman, a recent Tony winner for “Indecent,” does haunting things with the characters who briefly step beyond time altogether. The costumes, lighting, wigs and makeup — and especially Matt Hubbs’s sound design and the original music by Dustin O’Halloran — also contribute to a vision that is almost brutally nostalgic.

And yet all this loving attention to the play’s philosophical superstructure does little to alleviate the stiffness of the actual scenes, which are filled with the kind of canned dialogue and bald exposition that Monty Python and other English satirists would come to savage a few decades later.

Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that the performances — including that of Ms. McGovern, who lately played a mother of similar vintage but more anodyne personality on “Downton Abbey” — are often overstated. That the problem affects both newcomers like Cara Ricketts, a Stratford Festival find, and New York stage regulars like Anna Camp, suggests direction that aims to score points and then rescore them as if in doubt of the audience’s comprehension.

When, for instance, in the 1919 scenes, a romantic opportunity is scotched or a guest insulted, the action is heavily underlined to make sure that the consequences in 1937 will line up. They would have anyway.

Priestley and the production are working too hard; he would be more successful integrating plot and metaphysics in his other so-called Time Plays, especially “An Inspector Calls,” revived on Broadway to great acclaim in 1994. But even in “Time and the Conways” he is more than a philosophical faddist and domestic dramatist: He is an astute social critic.

When the revival focuses on that, it achieves its greatest depth. The interval from 1919 to 1937 was, after all, unkind to more than the Conways; it was unkind to all of England. The chance to remake the country into a fairer one, in which social stratification and wealth inequality might be mitigated, was squandered, and by the time the Depression (which the British called The Great Slump) arrived, the middle and working classes were enemies instead of comrades. Even as one of the Conway children bemoans the situation, another helps break a railwaymen’s strike — and finds doing so “a great lark.”

Priestley connects this chaotic brew of entitlement and resentment to the rise of Nazism elsewhere in Europe. It’s no accident that it’s the gauche Mr. Beevers, a despised outsider with the wrong accent, who grimly explains to the impoverished Conways that their cavalier assumptions of privilege are now worthless. They no longer live at the end of the old war, he tells them, but “just before the next” one.

It’s a terrifying comment, especially as delivered by Steven Boyer, the “Hand to God” star unrecognizable here as a distinctly Bannonesque spoiler.

Steven L. Hall, a former chief of Russian operations at the C.I.A., said his former agency never used Kaspersky software, but other federal agencies did.","Like most security software, Kaspersky Lab’s products require access to everything stored on a computer in order to scour it for viruses or other dangers. Its popular antivirus software scans for signatures of malicious software, or malware, then removes or neuters it before sending a report back to Kaspersky. That procedure, routine for such software, provided a perfect tool for Russian intelligence to exploit to survey the contents of computers and retrieve whatever they found of interest.

The National Security Agency and the White House declined to comment for this article. The Israeli Embassy declined to comment, and the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Russian hackers had stolen classified N.S.A. materials from a contractor using the Kaspersky software on his home computer. But the role of Israeli intelligence in uncovering that breach and the Russian hackers’ use of Kaspersky software in the broader search for American secrets have not previously been disclosed.

Kaspersky Lab denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, the Russian hacking. “Kaspersky Lab has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,” the company said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. Kaspersky Lab also said it “respectfully requests any relevant, verifiable information that would enable the company to begin an investigation at the earliest opportunity.”

The Kaspersky-related breach is only the latest bad news for the security of American intelligence secrets. It does not appear to be related to a devastating leak of N.S.A. hacking tools last year to a group, still unidentified, calling itself the Shadow Brokers, which has placed many of them online. Nor is it evidently connected to a parallel leak of hacking data from the C.I.A. to WikiLeaks, which has posted classified C.I.A. documents regularly under the name Vault7.

For years, there has been speculation that Kaspersky’s popular antivirus software might provide a back door for Russian intelligence. More than 60 percent, or $374 million, of the company’s $633 million in annual sales come from customers in the United States and Western Europe. Among them have been nearly two dozen American government agencies — including the State Department, the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Justice Department, Treasury Department and the Army, Navy and Air Force.

The N.S.A. bans its analysts from using Kaspersky antivirus at the agency, in large part because the agency has exploited antivirus software for its own foreign hacking operations and knows the same technique is used by its adversaries.

“Antivirus is the ultimate back door,” Blake Darché, a former N.S.A. operator and co-founder of Area 1 Security. “It provides consistent, reliable and remote access that can be used for any purpose, from launching a destructive attack to conducting espionage on thousands or even millions of users.”

On Sept. 13, the Department of Homeland Security ordered all federal executive branch agencies to stop using Kaspersky products, giving agencies 90 days to remove the software. Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine C. Duke cited the “information security risks” presented by Kaspersky and said the company’s antivirus and other software “provide broad access to files” and “can be exploited by malicious cyber actors to compromise” federal computer systems.

That directive, which some officials thought was long overdue, was based, in large part, on intelligence gleaned from Israel’s 2014 intrusion into Kaspersky’s corporate systems. It followed months of discussions among intelligence officials, which included a study of how Kaspersky’s software works and the company’s suspected ties with the Kremlin.

“The risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky,” D.H.S. said in its statement, “could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security.”

Kaspersky Lab did not discover the Israeli intrusion into its systems until mid-2015, when a Kaspersky engineer testing a new detection tool noticed unusual activity in the company’s network. The company investigated and detailed its findings in June 2015 in a public report.

The report did not name Israel as the intruder but noted that the breach bore striking similarities to a previous attack, known as “Duqu,” which researchers had attributed to the same nation states responsible for the infamous Stuxnet cyberweapon. Stuxnet was a joint American-Israeli operation that successfully infiltrated Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility, and used malicious code to destroy a fifth of Iran’s uranium centrifuges in 2010.

Kaspersky reported that its attackers had used the same algorithm and some of the same code as Duqu, but noted that in many ways it was even more sophisticated. So the company researchers named the new attack Duqu 2.0, noting that other victims of the attack were prime Israeli targets.

Among the targets Kaspersky uncovered were hotels and conference venues used for closed-door meetings by members of the United Nations Security Council to negotiate the terms of the Iran nuclear deal — negotiations from which Israel was excluded. Several targets were in the United States, which suggested that the operation was Israel’s alone, not a joint American-Israeli operation like Stuxnet.

Kaspersky’s researchers noted that attackers had managed to burrow deep into the company’s computers and evade detection for months. Investigators later discovered that the Israeli hackers had implanted multiple back doors into Kaspersky’s systems, employing sophisticated tools to steal passwords, take screenshots, and vacuum up emails and documents.

In its June 2015 report, Kaspersky noted that its attackers seemed primarily interested in the company’s work on nation-state attacks, particularly Kaspersky’s work on the “Equation Group” — its private industry term for the N.S.A. — and the “Regin” campaign, another industry term for a hacking unit inside the United Kingdom’s intelligence agency, the Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ.

Israeli intelligence officers informed the N.S.A. that in the course of their Kaspersky hack, they uncovered evidence that Russian government hackers were using Kaspersky’s access to aggressively scan for American government classified programs, and pulling any findings back to Russian intelligence systems. They provided their N.S.A. counterparts with solid evidence of the Kremlin campaign in the form of screenshots and other documentation, according to the people briefed on the events.

It is not clear whether, or to what degree, Eugene V. Kaspersky, the founder of Kaspersky Lab, and other company employees have been complicit in the hacking using their products. Technical experts say that at least in theory, Russian intelligence hackers could have exploited Kaspersky’s worldwide deployment of software and sensors without the company’s cooperation or knowledge. Another possibility is that Russian intelligence officers might have infiltrated the company without the knowledge of its executives.

But experts on Russia say that under President Vladimir V. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, businesses asked for assistance by Russian spy agencies may feel they have no choice but to give it. To refuse might well invite hostile action from the government against the business or its leaders. Mr. Kaspersky, who attended an intelligence institute and served in Russia’s Ministry of Defense, would have few illusions about the cost of refusing a Kremlin request.

Steven L. Hall, a former chief of Russian operations at the C.I.A., said his former agency never used Kaspersky software, but other federal agencies did. By 2013, he said, Kaspersky officials were “trying to do damage control and convince the U.S. government that it was just another security company.”

He didn’t buy it, Mr. Hall said. “I had the gravest concerns about Kaspersky, and anyone who worked on Russia or in counterintelligence shared those concerns,” he said.",How Israel Caught Russian Hackers Scouring the World for U.S. Secrets,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/technology/kaspersky-lab-israel-russia-hacking.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

By contacting registered runners, the scientists recruited 11 experienced runners preparing for the marathon distance and another 11, similar in age, weight and racing experience, enrolled in the half. All were following training programs provided by the race organizers, with the marathoners completing more weekly mileage.

The day before the race, the scientists had the runners visit the lab, where they drew blood and checked for baseline indications of dehydration and biochemical markers of muscle damage.

The scientists also asked each runner to perform several standing vertical leaps. This test indicates how much force the leg muscles can generate. When muscles are tired, people cannot jump as high. The scientists noted the maximum height each runner could achieve.

The next morning, just before the race start, the runners reported to a medical tent where they were weighed and fitted with patches to measure perspiration rates.

Then, they ran. All finished their race, whether it was the half or full marathon. Afterward, they returned to the tent to be reweighed, provide more blood, answer a few questions about how they felt and repeat the vertical leaps.

Finally, the researchers compared data.

The half-marathon runners, not surprisingly, proved to have had an easier time. They had lost body weight from sweating but were not seriously dehydrated. They also had elevated levels of blood markers related to muscle damage, compared to the day before. But their levels were much lower than in the blood of the racers completing the full 26.2 miles. The half-marathon runners also could jump higher after the race than the marathon racers. Their legs, by all indications, were still relatively fresh.

Perhaps most interesting, the half-marathon runners had managed to maintain a steady pace throughout their race. In fact, most had sped up slightly near the end. Their average pace for the final five kilometers tended to be a few seconds faster than for their opening five kilometers.

The marathon runners, on the other hand, had slowed. Most had run at a steady pace for the first 13.1 miles, but then began to brake progressively, so that their final five kilometers were significantly slower than the same distance at the start. Those runners with the highest subsequent blood markers of muscle damage had the greatest decline in pace. They also reported much more soreness in their legs after the race than the half-marathon runners.

These findings, on their face, may seem predictable. Most of us might expect that running a full marathon should be more tiring than striding half as far, and that the more your muscles hurt, the slower you will be.

But, says Juan del Corso, a professor of physiology at Camilo José Cela University in Madrid, who led the study, there were surprises in the data. For one thing, none of the volunteers in either race became clinically dehydrated. So dehydration had not made the marathoning difficult.

More fundamentally, the marathon racers, on paper, should have been prepared for the rigors of the distance, he says. They had run more mileage during training than the half-marathoners. Despite the rigorous runs, however, their legs were not fully prepared for the marathon, he says. Their muscles became slightly damaged and grew sore, particularly in the second half of the race, and their pace slowed.

The implication of these results, he says, is that “just running long distances is not enough to prepare the leg muscles for the great demands of an endurance event like the marathon.” Instead, he says, targeted strength training of the lower body might be needed to inoculate the muscles against the slight tearing and other damage that otherwise occurs during the hours of pounding in a marathon.

Of course, this study was small, short-term and examined only a few aspects of distance running. But its underlying message seems applicable to all of us training for a distance race.

“Gym training,” including the use of machines and free weights to develop strength and power in the muscles of your legs, “can very much help to prepare muscles for the stress imposed by these long races,” Dr. del Corso says.

If Thaler’s work is essential for understanding how the market can go astray, Jacobs’s emphasis on the relational nature of thinking is essential for understanding why there is so much bad thinking in political life right now.

Jacobs makes good use of C. S. Lewis’s concept of the Inner Ring. In every setting — a school, a company or a society — there is an official hierarchy. But there may also be a separate prestige hierarchy, where the cool kids are. They are the Inner Ring.

There are always going to be people who desperately want to get into the Inner Ring and will cut all sorts of intellectual corners to be accepted. As Lewis put it, “The passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things.”

People will, for example, identify and attack what Jacobs calls the Repugnant Cultural Other — the group that is opposed to the Inner Ring, which must be assaulted to establish membership in it.

Jacobs notices that when somebody uses “in other words” to summarize another’s argument, what follows is almost invariably a ridiculous caricature of that argument, in order to win favor with the team. David Foster Wallace once called such people Snoots. Their motto is, “We Are the Few, the Proud, the More or Less Constantly Appalled at Everyone Else.”

Jacobs nicely shows how our thinking processes emerge from emotional life and moral character. If your heart and soul are twisted, your response to the world will be, too. He argues that by diagnosing our own ills, we can begin to combat them. And certainly I can think of individual beacons of intellectual honesty today: George Packer, Tyler Cowen, Scott Alexander and Caitlin Flanagan, among many.

But I’d say that if social life can get us into trouble, social life can get us out. After all, think of how you really persuade people. Do you do it by writing thoughtful essays that carefully marshal facts? That works some of the time. But the real way to persuade people is to create an attractive community that people want to join. If you do that, they’ll bend their opinions to yours. If you want people to be reasonable, create groups where it’s cool to be reasonable.

Jacobs mentions that at the Yale Political Union members are admired if they can point to a time when a debate totally changed their mind on something. That means they take evidence seriously; that means they can enter into another’s mind-set. It means they treat debate as a learning exercise and not just as a means to victory.

How many public institutions celebrate these virtues? The U.S. Senate? Most TV talk shows? Even the universities?

Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, saying that she would have simply dismissed the case and allowed the appeals court decision to remain on the books.

Still being considered — at least for now — is a case from the federal appeals court in San Francisco, which concerned both the travel ban against the six countries and a suspension of the nation’s refugee program. The refugee suspension is due to expire this month. Once that happens, the court is likely to dismiss that case, too.

Soon after Mr. Trump took office, he issued his first travel ban, causing confusion and protests at airports nationwide and drawing immediate challenges in court. Several federal judges blocked aspects of the order, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, affirmed one of those injunctions.

Rather than appeal that loss to the Supreme Court, the administration issued a revised executive order in March. It limited travel from six predominantly Muslim countries and suspended the country’s refugee program. After two appeals courts blocked the order, the Supreme Court agreed in June to hear the administration’s appeals, scheduling arguments for Oct. 10.

Over the summer, the two sides continued to tangle in court over what aspects of the second travel ban could be enforced in the meantime. In its June order, the Supreme Court said that people with “a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States” could continue to enter the country. In rulings issued in July and September, the justices upheld broad restrictions against refugees entering the United States but allowed grandparents and other relatives of American residents to travel here.

The executive orders Mr. Trump issued in January and March were temporary. In late September, he issued a new proclamation imposing an indefinite ban on travel from seven countries and restrictions on two others. The new policy included limits on travel from two countries that are not predominantly Muslim, North Korea and Venezuela.

The new policy prompted the Supreme Court to cancel oral arguments in the two cases and to ask the parties for briefs on whether they were moot. The administration said they were, and it urged the court to vacate the appeals court decisions.

Some wineries in the fire’s path escaped serious harm.

Darioush Winery, in Napa, lost half of its Persian-inspired landscaping to the flames, but the winery was still standing and the wines were in good condition, said Dan de Polo, president of the winery.

“It’s dynamic and messy right now,” he said of the fires. “There are still a lot of dangerous zones.”

At the James Cole Winery, in Napa, the co-owner James Harder and his family evacuated Sunday night after the fire demolished the eight-foot fence surrounding the vineyard. Neighboring homes were burning to the ground, as was the nearby Signorello winery.

“We thought our property was gone,” Mr. Harder said.

But then the winds shifted. He and several friends returned to James Cole and formed a “bucket brigade” to put out remaining flames, saving all but a few small outbuildings.

On Tuesday, Mr. Harder returned through “very dangerous smoke and haze” with a rented truck to rescue grapes that had been waiting in bins and barrels to ferment. The winery still had five acres of unpicked grapes and 10 tons of the fruit in the cellar.

“We tasted some, and they were still pretty good,” Mr. Harder said. “But we smell like smoke, so we don’t know what we’re really tasting.”

The wine industry in Napa County supports 46,000 jobs locally through the 700 grape growers and 475 wineries operating in the area, the vast majority of them family owned, according to the Napa Valley Vintners trade group.

For now, wineries are trying to hook up generators for electricity and will most likely be out of operation for four or five days, said Pete Richmond, who runs Silverado Farming Company, a vineyard management firm.

“The biggest issue is trying to reach out to people to contact them to come back to work, because a lot have evacuated and cell service is miserable,” he said. “And we’re trying to reach places, but the roads are still closed and we don’t know when we’ll have access to them.”

Last year, California wineries drew 23.6 million visits and $7.2 billion in tourist expenditures, according to the Wine Institute. The area is known for its cabernet sauvignon grapes, which currently fetch more than $8,000 a ton, according to an annual report from the Silicon Valley Bank.

Wineries that lost vineyards will have to wait three to five years to nurse the soil back to health and coax out a viable crop of grapes, said Karissa Kruse, president of the Sonoma County Winegrowers.

Surviving grapes may suffer smoke taint — a smoky flavor that makes them unusable for fine wine, she said. Wineries damaged or destroyed by the fire could lose vast reserves of wines aging in barrels and bottles. The repercussions of the fire on wine stored in barrels and tanks is unclear.

Still, Ms. Kruse pointed to some silver linings. In most cases, the flames destroyed the brush planted between the rows of grapes, and not the resilient vines themselves. And record-breaking temperatures in September meant that fewer grapes were left exposed to the fires.

“For the most part, the vintage is in, and we should still have a viable wine community as we move forward,” Ms. Kruse said. “We all grumbled that the Labor Day heat was going to define the 2017 vintage, but it expedited the harvest, which we now look at as such a blessing.”","In California Wine Country, Wildfires Take a Toll on Vintages and Tourism",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/business/wineries-california-wildfire.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

While Mr. Puigdemont is facing a fight for his own political survival — hard-line separatists have denounced his failure to deliver a clear message of independence — Mr. Rajoy appears to have consolidated his power base in Madrid, where he has been in charge of a minority government since late 2016.

Spain’s main opposition Socialist party expressed support for Mr. Rajoy as he discussed using Article 155, an idea it has been more reluctant to endorse in the past.

Pedro Sánchez, the Socialist leader, told a news conference that his party also supported Mr. Rajoy in his demands “to clarify and get out of the quagmire in which Mr. Puigdemont has put Catalan politics.”

In return, Mr. Sánchez said that he had reached an agreement with Mr. Rajoy to form a commission on changing the Constitution because “the Spain of 2017 is not the same as that of 1978,” when the document enshrined Spain’s return to democracy.

The commission is not expected to complete its preliminary report for six months, however, so its work is likely to have little influence on the conflict with the Catalan separatists.

Mr. Rajoy is under intense pressure from his own lawmakers to stop Catalan secessionism in its tracks, but he is also aware that strong reprisals against the region’s leader, Carles Puigdemont, could galvanize the independence movement.

The comments on Wednesday represented the first formal response to the events of the previous evening, when Mr. Puigdemont appeared to declare independence from Spain in an address to the Catalan Parliament, before immediately suspending that decision to allow for more “dialogue” with Madrid.

Further muddying the waters, Mr. Puigdemont and separatist lawmakers later signed a declaration of independence, a process set in motion after a highly disputed referendum on Oct. 1 that went ahead despite being suspended by the Spanish Constitutional Court.

Most Madrid-based newspapers and television morning talk shows ridiculed Mr. Puigdemont’s speech on Tuesday and described his call for negotiations with Madrid as an act of desperation.

The headline in the newspaper El Mundo described the night’s events as “farce and blackmail.” Susanna Griso, a news anchor on the television channel Antenna 3, said the Catalan parliamentary session swung “between tragedy and comedy.”

Spanish legal experts said that Mr. Puigdemont and his separatist lawmakers had violated the Constitution by signing a declaration of independence, and speculated that the move would almost certainly compel Mr. Rajoy to intervene forcefully in Catalonia.

“Let’s be clear: A region doesn’t have the competence to declare any kind of independence,” Ignacio Gordillo, a former prosecutor for Spain’s national court, told Antenna 3. “You cannot negotiate with criminals.”

Mr. Rajoy, who has stood firm against the separatists, has a battery of potential emergency measures available to him: not just Article 155, but also a national emergency law that his government enacted in 2015.

However, he also has a long record as a cautious politician who has stayed on the front line of Spanish politics for two decades by steering clear of difficult decisions and letting rivals dig themselves into holes instead. He said on Wednesday that he would “continue to act with prudence,” and put the onus on Mr. Puigdemont to explain himself.

Article 155, which requires Senate approval, would allow Mr. Rajoy to suspend, for as long as he believes necessary, the political institutions of Catalonia, including its regional government and Parliament. His government could also take over the leadership of the region’s autonomous police force and its public broadcaster.

Separately, public prosecutors could open criminal proceedings against Mr. Puigdemont and his government. On Monday, Pablo Casado, the spokesman for Mr. Rajoy’s governing party, warned that Mr. Puigdemont could be imprisoned for insurrection.

Still, Ignacio González Vega, spokesman for a Spanish association of judges, warned on Wednesday that “a political issue cannot be resolved only by applying laws.” He also told Antenna 3 that Mr. Rajoy “will have to step in with a lot of sensitivity, because these measures are very serious.”",Spain Asks Catalonia: Did You Declare Independence or Not?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/world/europe/catalonia-spain-independence-mariano-rajoy.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

LAS VEGAS — The slot machines and blackjack tables are filling up again at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, a golden tower on the southern end of the Vegas Strip. It’s taken days for any sense of normalcy to return to the place where last Sunday, an itinerant gambler, Stephen Paddock, used assault rifles to rain bullets down on a country music festival, killing 58 and injuring more than 500, one of the deadliest mass shootings in United States history.

I arrived in town a little more than 12 hours after Mr. Paddock’s deadly rampage, which ended when he fatally shot himself in the head. The Mandalay Bay, which I’ve visited several times as an off-and-on boxing writer, was as quiet as I’d ever seen it. Barely anyone was gambling. People were milling about the lobby, some trying to get back into rooms they had been evacuated from the night before. Others waited to check in for what was supposed to be a fun-filled trip.

Along with more than a dozen other New York Times journalists dispatched here, I immediately hopped into what has become an all too familiar routine of covering mass shootings. We had to piece together everything we could about what had happened that night. That meant interviewing people who were in the hotel or at the country music concert. And trying to chat up hotel employees, who might be able to offer any details about Mr. Paddock and his stay here: How did he sneak in around two dozen rifles? Did any housekeepers clean his room? Anyone carry his bags? What did he order from room service? What did his hotel suite look like?

This is difficult information to get in the aftermath of a tragedy. For one, many people were traumatized and found it hard to discuss what had transpired. One man from Massachusetts said he was cutting his trip short, and I heard many others echo his feeling of being shaken up.

Once again, he rails against the constraints of an increasingly depersonalized British health care system, which mummifies its doctors in spools of red tape. Once again, he describes his operating theater in all of its Grand Guignol splendor, with brains swelling beyond their skulls and suction devices “slurping obscenely” as tumors evade his reach.

Some of the procedures are surprisingly crude. They’re basically carpentry with blood. (Carpentry, the old-fashioned kind, is actually one of Marsh’s most passionate hobbies.)

But in this book, Marsh has retired, which means he’s taking a thorough inventory of his life. His reflections and recollections make “Admissions” an even more introspective memoir than his first, if such a thing is possible. And because he’s getting older, his own mortality has become a central preoccupation — if his brain were a pie chart, death would be a fairly substantial slice.

Much of “Admissions” also takes place abroad, because Marsh spends the first phase of his retirement in Nepal, working alongside his friend Dev, who has set up a private hospital for neurosurgery in Kathmandu. Marsh has thus been turned into a foreign correspondent, reporting on how medicine is practiced in this poor, polyethnic country, recently ravaged by civil war. Among his most sobering observations: “Only in America have I seen so much treatment devoted to so many people with such little chance of making a useful recovery.”

Yet the reasons are different. The patients Dev treats don’t feel entitled to these operations so much as dazzled by them, with an “exaggerated faith” in their success. “They have no conception of brain damage,” Dev tells Marsh. “They think that if the patient is alive they might recover.” Many patients (or their families) refuse to accept it when Dev tells them that an operation is not worth it or too dangerous.

It’s a tragedy. The results of a superfluous brain surgery — or a botched one — are grim, and if Dev’s procedures go awry, the angriest families don’t just complain or sue, as they do in England. They threaten violence. Dev’s daughter was once kidnapped at gunpoint for a ransom.

“Admissions” contains other cross-cultural musings. Marsh riffs on the excesses of American medicine, which continue to amaze him. Shortly before retiring, he visited the Texas Medical Center in Houston, where he was shown an electric screwdriver for securing titanium plates into the skull. It was state-of-the-art, likely expensive; he estimated it would save five seconds over a manual one. He was similarly shocked (and spooked) when he saw trainees practicing surgery on a severed head — where did they get it? No one had a clue. When Marsh returned to England two weeks later, he told a colleague about it.

“Only one?” the colleague replied. “I had 15 heads, freeze-dried, flown in from the U.S. for my skull base workshop last year.”

The most startling aspect of “Admissions,” however, has nothing to do with medicine. It’s how Marsh portrays himself. As a young man, he writes, he was close to suicidal and spent time in a psychiatric hospital. At the same time, he adds, he “always was a tremendous show-off.”

He also struggled with aggression and he continues to do so — he’s competitive and impatient and has a bad temper. He had an adulterous affair at some point, and at another went through a bitter divorce. He ended his career in an almost vaudevillian gesture of ignominy, tweaking the nose of a male nurse who refused to remove a patient’s nasogastric tube.

He also ended a long, meaningful friendship with a Ukrainian surgeon he had annually visited and assisted. Though he probably did so for the right reasons. The particulars are best left to be read.

Marsh’s retirement is busy but anxious. For the first time, he feels a real kinship with his patients. The older he gets, the more likely it becomes that he’ll have to face the same irresolvable dilemmas they did about prolonging life. “We have to choose between probabilities, not certainties, and that is difficult,” he writes. “How probable is it that we will gain how many extra years of life, and what might the quality of those years be?”

He’s terrified of dying in a hospital, cared for by fleets of indifferent strangers. He opens “Admissions” by telling us he’s acquired a suicide kit, in case his death is painful and slow, and he closes with a civilized discussion of euthanasia. But he confesses he doesn’t know if he’d ever have the courage to hasten his own death. Which may be his most profound admission of all.","A Surgeon Not Afraid to Face His Mistakes, In and Out of the Operating Room",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/books/review-admissions-life-as-brain-surgeon-henry-marsh.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The record features big talk about populism and political realignment, plus a dismissal of the white identitarians and racists drawn to his flame as just incidental idiots ... but it never seems to cash out in anything except a return to empty, race-baiting culture war.

At the White House, Bannon did not manage to inject much heterodoxy into any part of the same old, same old Republican agenda. But he did encourage the president to pick racialized fights at every chance. On the evidence so far, his new grass-roots populism promises to be more of the same: a notional commitment to some nebulous new agenda, with white-identity politics and the fear of liberalism supplying the real cultural-political cement.

Especially because the would-be senators he’s recruiting are a mix of cynics and fanatics who seem to share no coherent vision, just a common mix of ambition and resentment. A nationalist-populist realignment might be possible in theory, and Trump may have even shown how it could work — but if you believe figures like Roy Moore and Erik Prince are going to succeed where Trump is obviously failing, I have some affidavits attesting to Harvey Weinstein’s innocence to sell you.

Which is not to say Bannon is delusional. He and his allies are the latest group to recognize the void at the heart of the contemporary Republican Party, the vacuum that somebody, somehow needs to fill. The activists and enforcers of the Tea Party era tried with a libertarian style of populism. Paul Ryan tried with his warmed-over Jack Kempism. My friends the “reform conservatives” tried with blueprints for tax credits and wage subsidies. They all failed, and the Bannon crew actually got furthest, in the sense that they got the most unlikely figure imaginable elected president on something resembling their platform.

But now they, too, need to reckon with a reality that has confounded every kind of Republican reformer since Barack Obama was elected: Our politics are probably too polarized, our legislative branch too gridlocked, and the conservative movement too dysfunctional and self-destructive to build a new agenda from the backbenches of Congress up, or even from the House speaker or Senate majority leader’s office.

Our system isn’t really all that republican anymore; it’s imperial, and even an incompetent emperor like Trump is unlike to restore the legislative branch to its former influence. So if you want to remake the Republican Party as something other than a shambolic repository for anti-liberalism, the only way it’s likely to happen is from the top down — with the election of an effective, policy-oriented conservative president (which Donald Trump is not), surrounded by people who understand the ways of power (which Bannon, for all his bluster, didn’t) and prepared to both negotiate with Democrats and bend his own party to his will.

I don’t pretend to know if such a presidency will ever happen.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Today we get to watch a face-off between the good guys and the bad guys, courtesy of David J. Kahn.

Today’s Theme

The GUNFIGHT AT / THE O.K. CORRAL (28D and 62A) took place in October 1881, and was a 30-second shootout between the lawmen of Tombstone, Ariz., and a group of outlaws called the Cowboys (in those days, it was considered an insult to call a law-abiding cattleman a “cowboy”). Mr. Kahn was able to get only one law man (DOC HOLLIDAY) and one bad guy (IKE CLANTON) into his grid for space reasons.

In addition, we have four entries forming a circular “corral” of sorts (31A, 37D, 52A and 35D). All of them are synonyms for the word “O.K.,” but all are clued as something different, neatly hiding the connection to the theme in plain sight. That’s a pretty nice bonus.

Tricky Clues

1A: I had MACAU and MACAW (wrong, Deb! That’s a bird) before MACAO.

49A: Do you get tripped up by clues where the first word is actually a proper name? “Banks of Chicago” sounds as if it refers to places in Chicago where you can keep your money, but we’ve got only a five-letter slot. The constructor and editors have sneakily used the capital-letter-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence rule against you. “Banks” refers to the baseball player ERNIE Banks.

Constructor Notes

I guess I can say with a smile that this is just an O.K. puzzle. This worked only because I was able to find 4 four-letter synonyms for O.K. that could be clued otherwise, which is why “so-so,” at first an obvious synonym, wasn’t included. I also wanted to include a gunfighter on each side. Fun fact: Kirk Douglas, who played Doc Holliday in the 1957 movie, celebrated his centennial last year.

Ms. Leroy wrote over 100 letters home during her three years in Vietnam, one almost every 10 days, and they show how she was processing her experiences and navigating professional challenges.
It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.
While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists.
“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967.","Catherine Leroy was 21 when she arrived in Vietnam in 1966 with only a hundred dollars, a Leica M2 and a limited professional portfolio. Over the next three years covering the war, she built an exceptional body of work: surviving and documenting a capture by the North Vietnamese Army, parachuting in combat operations with the 173rd Airborne, and being published on the covers of major magazines, including Life and Paris Match.

She was also the only female photojournalist then working in Vietnam, after the death of Dickey Chapelle, who was killed by a grenade in 1965.

Ms. Leroy wrote over 100 letters home during her three years in Vietnam, one almost every 10 days, and they show how she was processing her experiences and navigating professional challenges. They are candid and revealing, attesting to her resiliency, exposing insecurities, and showing her in moments of triumph, despair, optimism or courage.

Photo

Despite her many strong images, Ms. Leroy had remained relatively unknown, partly because she wasn’t a self-promoter, and partly because women photographers have often been excluded from the medium’s history, especially war photography. Now a selection of those letters are featured on a new website, accompanied by some of her archive and details from her life. It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.

Most of the letters are to her mother, Denise, focusing at first on topics that read like holiday postcards – gifts she hoped to send home, people she met, her tan. To her father, Jean, she wrote mostly about business — publications that bought her work, logistics and future plans. She frequently reassures them, noting in one letter to her mother that “if anything happens to me, you’ll be informed within 24 hours. So don’t worry if I sometimes leave you without any news.”

Her tone changed over time. In the early letters, she was unsure whether she should stay or go home, even as she felt less insecure about her technical skills. She spoke of the relationships she was forming with the military and about daily life. On Sept. 4, 1966, a few months after her initial arrival, she wrote to her mother:

I celebrated my 22nd birthday at the Da Nang press office in the company of lots of Marines. I had left Saigon a few days earlier with an AP reporter for an operation near the DMZ. On this occasion he opened a bottle of French champagne when we got back. I only got back last night, Saturday, very tired…I’m getting an iron reputation with the marines. I’m very proud of it. I’m leaving tomorrow, Tuesday, morning for the Delta. Subject: a village a few days from the election. The war seems to be calming down, as always happens just before political events. The Delta is the key region. I’ll stay there two or three days. After that, I don’t know. I’m preparing a few photos of me taken in various locations and will send them to you. I haven’t forgotten your wig, I’ll take care of it too. Don’t be angry with me. I’m always away: back in Saigon for two days, get something cleaned, tidy up, wash, everything is dirty.

As her confidence grew, she wrote about her professional successes. But the letters also showed low moments, like being unable to get the pictures she wanted in the field or leaving an envelope of her best prints in a taxi after fending off a robbery attempt from the driver.

The letters testify to the challenges women encountered in the field. While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists. Robert Pledge, president of the board of the Catherine Leroy Fund, a not-for-profit organization in Paris dedicated to her work, said many prominent photojournalists questioned why a young woman wanted to cover war.

She wrote about how people were nice when they first thought she was an unintimidating, five-foot-tall, pigtailed girl. But when they realized she was a serious photographer, their opinions changed. “Many were very, very negative and very nasty with her,” said Mr. Pledge, who is also co-founder and director of Contact Press Images.

Writing to her father on May 13, 1967, after noting her successes in being published in leading magazines, she marveled how “I’m getting telegrams from people who I didn’t know existed for years, while at the same time I’m hated more than ever by known and unknown enemies in Saigon, American civilians, as well as servicemen in Saigon.”

One photographer told Mr. Pledge that the male photographers “were really nasty chauvinistic pigs.” That same photographer, who now is a filmmaker, called her late in life to apologize.

Still, she found the opportunities available to her in Vietnam surpassed anything back home in France. Like parachuting with the 173rd Airborne Brigade — the 85th jump she had taken in her life, after receiving her parachuting license as a teenager.

“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967. “I’m very proud to have jumped with the Americans here, it’s a big professional success in every way. I now know that I will be able to work in the United Sates one day without too much problem.” She wrote how she planned to submit her work to major competitions. “I’ve always thought I should succeed because I never gave in,” she continued.

Many consider Ms. Leroy as the most daring of all photographers in Vietnam, and she most likely spent the most time in combat because she needed the money. Being broke meant traveling with soldiers, sharing rations and sleeping in the countryside.

As Mr. Pledge noted, “If Robert Capa was saying that it’s not good enough because it’s not close enough — she was very close.”

So it’s not surprising that we humans are unable to make something like time or the marking of time bend to our collective wills. For centuries, different countries used different calendars, and even the old Julian calendar had its problems.

That is why, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII ordered that everyone stop messing around and use one calendar. Even then, the later a country switched over, the more days had to be dropped in order to stay in sync with the vernal equinox and the winter solstice. This resulted in a lot of confusion for a while, including the month of September 1752 in North America, which looked like this and which children across the continent still whisper about as “The Best Start to the School Year Ever.”

KUB was at first focused solely on townhouse development in Brooklyn. But one Saturday in 2014, the firm’s founders learned that 150 Wooster was for sale. They made an offer that day, and closed on the property soon after, for nearly $51 million.

Years of approval-seeking followed. New York’s City Council had to agree to a zoning change, a move that also relaxed the requirement that residents had to be artists. That requirement dates to the early 1970s, when many painters and sculptors began relocating to commercial structures in the then-shabby neighborhood.

The city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission also had to sign off on the facade, which has cream-colored, thin Danish bricks and a ribbed steel cornice that resembles an egg-slicer. Having a designer like Mr. Schillberg in-house, as opposed to using one employed by an outside firm, made the approval process smoother and faster, Mr. Katz said.

An earlier condo proposal for the site from MTM Associates, an entity linked to Maclaren, the baby-stroller company that once had a showroom in the small building on the property, had run into opposition from neighbors, who sued to stop it. The City Council later rejected the rezoning that the project required.

For its part, KUB has taken steps to mollify some of those neighbors, including positioning 150 Wooster so that its walls do not block windows at 152 Wooster, according to residents of that building.

The apartments at 150 Wooster, each of which takes up at least a full floor and has four bedrooms and four-and-a-half baths, are inspired by the roomy lofts for which SoHo is famous.

Living rooms are spacious, at about 800 square feet, and most have four windows. Also, the almost industrial-size, six-burner Wolf ranges made of steel in the kitchens are meant to recall the restaurant-grade appliances SoHo pioneers once purchased at supply stores on the nearby Bowery, Mr. Schillberg said.

All apartments also have gas fireplaces, with plaster finishes that recall adobe, the popular Santa Fe building material. Brass is also prevalent, including for the sinks in powder rooms and inlays in white-oak floors.

Master closets, with about 90 square feet of space, and in some cases, frosted-glass windows, are also notable. Each apartment also comes with a laundry room, with a sink and counter for folding.

For struggling artists, the apartments, which are being marketed by CORE New Development, are likely out of reach. Their starting price is about $13 million, or about $3,200 a square foot. Sales begin this fall. In comparison, the average price of new condos in SoHo — an admittedly short list — was $9.8 million on Oct. 6, according to Streeteasy.com.

KUB principals acknowledge the Manhattan-wide slowdown affecting ultraluxury properties could be a concern. But since 150 Wooster is a new product — a relative rare commodity in the neighborhood — the hope is that it will buck the trend. Other condos there, like 63 Greene Street, are conversions.

There have been other local ground-up examples in the last few years, like 52 Wooster Street and 42 Crosby Street. But they tend to be located in the southern part of the neighborhood, unlike No. 150, which is more in the heart of the district, the developers said.

And it gave us another reminder that Mr. Trump is hellbent on abdicating the leadership on climate change Mr. Obama worked so hard to achieve — first with a suite of regulatory measures and then by making an emissions-reduction pledge at the 2015 Paris climate summit meeting strong enough to induce 194 other nations to sign on to what had all the makings of a historic global agreement.

Under that agreement, nations submitted voluntary pledges to curb their emissions in the near term and to ratchet up their efforts in the future; the idea was to limit the rise in global warming to well below two degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. To that end, Mr. Obama promised that the United States, which accounts for one-fifth of the world’s emissions, would lower its emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The administration later published a report sketching out various technological pathways to cutting emissions 80 percent or more by 2050.

Then along came Mr. Trump, who in March ordered the destruction or delay of nearly every building block that supported Mr. Obama’s pledge — rules aimed at increasing fuel efficiency of cars and trucks; rules aimed at limiting emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from oil and gas wells; rules aimed at increasing the energy efficiency of appliances; and most important of all, the Clean Power Plan. Not long afterward, Mr. Trump commanded his secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke, to reverse Mr. Obama’s efforts to limit oil and gas exploration in Arctic waters and on sensitive federal lands, a task to which Mr. Zinke has fallen with great enthusiasm and which, if successful, will further increase the carbon emissions the world is trying to limit.

Given all these orders, Mr. Trump’s decision in June to withdraw from the Paris agreement, though deeply demoralizing to the entire world, seemed in practical terms almost superfluous.

Some experts say that all is not lost, that it is still possible for the United States to hit its Paris targets. Aggressive state and local policies as well as market forces and technological improvements have already reduced emissions about 12 percent below 2005 levels. These include a huge switch to gas from coal, which once supplied more than half the country’s electricity and now supplies only a third; the steadily dropping cost of wind and solar energy; and more efficient vehicles, buildings and appliances. Further progress along these lines, without any federal help, could yield a total emissions reduction of 15 to 19 percent. One particularly bright note is that many states, including California and New York, are already moving ahead of the targets set by the Clean Power Plan.

Those same experts, however, also concede that federal help is crucial, both in limiting emissions from existing sources and in promoting alternative fuels and new technologies. This administration shows no interest in either. Mr. Pruitt, in fact, used the occasion of his triumphant dismissal of the Clean Power Plan to say he would love to get rid of the federal subsidies that have been and remain vital to the development of wind and solar power, while saying nary a word about the lavish subsidies for the oil industry.

Like some of Mr. Trump’s other rollbacks, the power plant decision will be fought in court by some states and by environmental groups. The E.P.A. is required by law to regulate carbon dioxide emissions in some fashion, but so far Mr. Pruitt has not proposed a substitute plan. The betting is that if he does, it won’t amount to much, surely not the closing of any coal-fired plants.

When did the security guard arrive and what was he responding to?

Mr. Campos arrived on the 32nd floor shortly before 10 p.m. to investigate an alarm indicating that a door to a room — not Mr. Paddock’s — was open. While he was there, Mr. Campos heard drilling noises coming from Mr. Paddock’s room. Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said Mr. Paddock was most likely using a drill to set up cameras or to place a rifle.

What did the guard do after he arrived?

At 9:59 p.m., six minutes before Mr. Paddock began shooting at the crowd, Mr. Campos was investigating the drilling noise when Mr. Paddock fired roughly 200 bullets through the door of his room. One responding police officer told “60 Minutes” that the door looked like “Swiss cheese” afterward.

It is unclear where in the hallway Mr. Campos was standing and how close to the door he was when he took the fire. Mr. Campos, who was wounded in the right thigh, retreated from the doorway and immediately told casino security personnel that he had been shot. When the police arrived, Mr. Campos directed officers to Mr. Paddock’s room and helped hotel guests evacuate until he was told he needed to seek medical attention himself.

Sheriff Lombardo said last week, before the timeline changed, that Mr. Campos’s “bravery was amazing.” When the chronology was adjusted on Monday, the sheriff stressed that Mr. Campos had immediately alerted his bosses about the gunman and then protected a maintenance worker who arrived on that floor. It is not known when and how the hotel security officials informed the police that Mr. Campos had been shot.

How quickly did the police respond to the shooting?

A group of eight officers gathered at Mandalay Bay and began climbing the stairs within minutes of the shots being fired at the concert, police officials said. Two officers arrived at the 31st floor at 10:12 p.m. and announced over their radio that the gunfire was coming from one floor above them.

The gunfire stopped three minutes later, according to the police timeline, and two officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17 p.m. — roughly 18 minutes after Mr. Campos had been shot. Mr. Campos then told officers he had been shot and gave the exact location of Mr. Paddock’s room, the police said.

As eight more officers arrived, just before 10:30 p.m., they began clearing the hotel rooms, looking for any injured guests and watching for anyone assisting the gunman. Another team of eight officers arrived on the floor at 10:55 p.m. and the group breached Mr. Paddock’s room at 11:20 p.m., when they saw what one officer would later describe as an “armory” with roughly two dozen rifles.

Questions immediately arose about the police department’s response time and the 18 minutes between when Mr. Campos was shot and when the officers arrived on the floor.

“We’re talking about the 32nd floor of a massive hotel,” Todd R. Fasulo, an assistant sheriff, said in an interview on Tuesday. “It’s not like walking into a Walmart. You’ve got to get to the core of the hotel; you have to think about what you’re doing and account for safety.”

Could the police have responded differently?

Sheriff Lombardo and his top deputies have repeatedly praised officers who responded to the shooting, saying that they had acted “heroically” and did exactly what they were trained to do. The department will conduct an investigation to go over their response, Mr. Fasulo said.

The police do not know exactly how many officers responded to the shooting; many of them were off duty.

Mr. Fasulo said that, so far, “nothing gives me any indication that they did anything other than what they are trained to do, which is to formulate and execute a plan as quickly as they can.” He added that as the officers were forming their team, one turned to another and warned: “We don’t know what we’re getting into — there’s a possibility we’re going to take gunfire.”

“As a department we’re trained that we form up and we attack and we go after the threat,” Mr. Fasulo said. “We had multiple off-duty cops who instantly turned it on and did what they would do if they were on duty: run toward the shots.”

Why did the gunman stop shooting?

While the police know that Mr. Paddock shot himself in the head, they do not know precisely when he took his own life or why he stopped shooting.

“We probably will never know,” Mr. Fasulo said. “You can hypothesize all day long about that but unless we understand his head we can’t know for sure.”",Shift in Las Vegas Timeline Raises Questions About Police Response,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/shift-in-las-vegas-timeline-raises-questions-about-police-response.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

DURHAM, N.C. — Forty years ago, when I was living in exile with my family in Amsterdam, my thoughts would often turn to the boys and girls back home in Chile, my small nieces and nephews so far away from us. I would worry how they might be coping with the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.

One afternoon those concerns came into sharp relief. Nathalie, the 6-year-old sister of my wife, Angelica, had come from London to visit our small apartment a mile or so away from where Anne Frank had once dreamed of freedom in a Netherlands occupied by the Nazis. Frank’s diary does not mention if she ever played a game that children everywhere indulge in and that Nathalie was enthralled by: She liked to make believe she was the mommy and demanded that our son Rodrigo, who was her nephew, though four years older, be the daddy. The two kids hid inside their “house” (a sheet covering a table that served both as my desk and for our meals), pretending they were adults, and candidly repeated words they had overheard adults uttering.

Such innocence filled me with tenderness and yet also evoked a bizarre sense of dread because I could not help wondering about children like them entertaining themselves in a similar manner in our distant and dangerous Santiago. How would that game be twisted and corrupted if it was enacted by the sons and daughters of parents who were part of the resistance movement, hiding from General Pinochet’s secret police? What secret sorrows and dread would those youngsters express? What had they heard their father and mother discussing in the night when they thought their offspring were asleep, the words that hovered in the air while the children eavesdropped on a potential violent outcome to their existence? What to do if the men who had power over life and death came knocking at the door one dawn? How can they tell who is an enemy and who is a friend?

Those corrosive questions led me to write a story that explored how children might react when thrust into a situation of mortal peril that they can only vaguely understand as they play “waiting for the enemy.” The story was constructed from the perspective of a Chilean boy around Rodrigo’s age who, as he realizes the perils threatening him and his vulnerable family, is obliged to grow up much too fast. When Chile returned to democracy in 1990 and children could return to play the games that others of their age engage in elsewhere without a second thought, I felt relieved that I would never again have to write a story fraught with such daunting events.

Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com.

‘Liddle’ Bob Corker

President Trump’s feud with Senator Bob Corker continued on Tuesday, when Mr. Trump tweeted to suggest that Mr. Corker, a Republican, had been tricked by The New York Times into saying disparaging things about the president. On “The Late Late Show,” James Corden took aim at Mr. Trump from a variety of angles.

“So that’s where we’re at: Donny made fun of Little Bobby for being short. And if you’ve just tuned in, I’m not reporting things my 6-year-old saw on the playground today. I’m sharing news from the White House.” — JAMES CORDEN “In that tweet, Trump insinuates that The New York Times set up Bob Corker by recording him, but the transcript actually shows that they had Corker’s full consent. And when Trump heard that, he said, ‘Wait — what’s consent?’” — JAMES CORDEN

Mr. Corden also addressed another internecine fight that’s occupying Mr. Trump’s time.

“In an interview today, Trump addressed the rumors that his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, called him a moron, by saying, quote, ‘If he did that, I guess we’ll have to compare I.Q. tests, and I can tell you who is going to win.’ Yeah, I can also tell you who’s going to win: It’s not the guy who spells ‘little’ like this.” — JAMES CORDEN

Sidestepping the Weinstein Story

The New Yorker on Tuesday published an unsparing investigation into the film producer Harvey Weinstein’s conduct with female actors and models, including accusations that he raped multiple women. But the late-night shows seemed reluctant to deal with the reports, and only some addressed them at all. Even those shows that did failed to spend much time on the revelations or mention the most unsettling accusations.

“The New Yorker today released audio of fired Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein begging a model to come into his room and watch him shower. And by the looks of him, I’m guessing that shower never happened.” — SETH MEYERS “Another big story is this Harvey Weinstein scandal. Today some very serious allegations came out about his sexual misconduct. You can tell they’re bad because Anthony Weiner just unfriended him.” — JIMMY FALLON

Facebook News

Stephen Colbert discussed Elon Musk’s suggestions that artificial intelligence could pose a greater threat to humanity than North Korea’s nuclear program. Mark Zuckerberg had called that claim “pretty irresponsible,” leading Mr. Musk to tweet a spicy, dismissive response.

“Hey Elon, it’s not Mark Zuckerberg’s fault that he’s misinformed. He gets his news from Facebook.” — STEPHEN COLBERT

The Punchiest Punchlines (Stephen Miller Edition)

“According to reports, White House aide Stephen Miller tried to run in a girls’ track event while he was in high school, in order to prove men are better athletes than women — totally forgetting that seeing Stephen Miller just makes women run faster.” — SETH MEYERS

“President Trump is back to golfing, and he played with Lindsey Graham yesterday and said that it was ‘wet and windy.’ Luckily some people from Puerto Rico came and threw their paper towels at him.” — JIMMY FALLON
