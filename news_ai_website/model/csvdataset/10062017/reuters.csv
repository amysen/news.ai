FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) is poised to agree a deal to buy assets from insolvent Air Berlin (AB1.DE), a person familiar with the matter told Reuters, ahead of a deadline on Thursday.

Germany’s largest airline is set to buy Air Berlin’s Niki leisure unit, its LG Walter regional airline and some additional short-haul aircraft, the source said on Wednesday.

“The deal with Lufthansa is done, there is agreement,” the person said, adding that no contract had been signed yet.

Lufthansa declined to say whether it was set to sign a deal, saying only it was confident it would meet the deadline for negotiations.

Air Berlin, which has struggled to turn a profit over the last decade, filed for insolvency on Aug. 15, and a government loan has kept its planes in the air while it negotiates with potential buyers over parts of its business.

It said late last month that negotiations with Lufthansa and Britain’s easyJet (EZJ.L) would continue until Oct. 12.

The operations up for grabs also include access to take-off and landing slots at Air Berlin’s hubs in Tegel in the German capital and Duesseldorf.

EasyJet, which has a base at Berlin’s Schoenefeld airport, has been discussing acquiring 27 to 30 planes, though a media report earlier this week said talks could fail.

EasyJet said it would not comment on ongoing discussions and would provide a further update in due course if necessary.

Meanwhile German family-owned logistics firm Zeitfracht said it had made a new offer for Air Berlin’s cargo marketing platform and its maintenance business with a partner.

It declined to provide further details. A person familiar with the matter said that Zeitfracht’s new bid was made jointly with maintenance group Nayak and its owners.

Air Berlin, Germany’s second largest carrier, will cease operating flights this month, capping a turbulent summer for European carriers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contentious new U.S. demands are set to hit NAFTA negotiating tables on Wednesday, threatening to push modernization talks toward collapse as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau again tries to remind U.S. President Donald Trump of the trade pact’s merits.

Trudeau will meet with Trump and trade-focused U.S. lawmakers on the North American Free Trade Agreement while hundreds of negotiators, government officials and lobbyists from Canada, Mexico and the United States descend on a hotel in Arlington, Virginia for a fourth round of talks.

“We’re going to be talking about NAFTA and the fact it has led to great opportunities for our citizens,” Trudeau said on Tuesday night in conciliatory remarks at a Fortune magazine dinner honoring women, where he sat next to Ivanka Trump.

He added that he would “look for areas of agreement” with President Trump to improve outcomes for both countries.

The Canadian leader’s visit comes amid increasing acrimony over NAFTA renegotiations, with Trump making fresh threats to terminate the 23-year-old agreement and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday accusing Trump’s administration of trying to sabotage the talks with “poison pill proposals.”

Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray warned that an end to NAFTA would mark a breaking point in U.S.-Mexican relations and affect bilateral cooperation in non-trade areas.

The NAFTA talks are likely to stall in the face of aggressive U.S. demands to sharply increase content requirements for autos and auto parts, trade experts say.

The Washington round promises to be difficult, with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announcing early on Wednesday that talks would be extended by two days to Oct 17.

Lighthizer also said the three nations have completed their negotiations regarding company competition policy, reaching agreement on a chapter that provides goes beyond previous U.S. trade deals to ensure “certain rights and transparency under each nation’s competition laws.”

People briefed on the new U.S. proposals to be presented this week said that USTR is seeking to sharply lift North American content threshold for autos and auto parts to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent, with a 50 percent U.S.-specific content requirement.

“These will be met with widespread opposition from Canada and Mexico. I think it’s just a bridge too far,” said Wendy Cutler, the Asia Society’s Washington policy director and former chief U.S. negotiator for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal canceled by Trump.

Other contentious U.S. proposals opposed by Canada, Mexico and U.S. business interests include a five-year sunset provision, radical changes to NAFTA’s dispute arbitration systems, changes to intellectual property provisions and new protections for U.S. seasonal produce growers.

In his meeting with Trump, Trudeau is expected to remind the president that Canada is the United States’ biggest export customer, with largely balanced two-way goods and services trade, and is not the cause of U.S. manufacturing jobs lost under NAFTA, Canadian officials said.

Mexico has that distinction, with far lower wages that have lured U.S. auto plants and other manufacturers across its northern border, resulting in a $64 billion trade surplus with the United States last year that Trump administration officials have vowed to slash.

The government proposes spending an additional 15 billion euros on training over five years, with employers saying they cannot fill vacancies despite a jobless rate of close to 10 percent, higher than in many European countries.

President Emmanuel Macron also wants to bring the national unemployment insurance fund, currently jointly run by unions and employers, under the state’s control.

Macron, a former banker whose other labor market reform plans have been condemned by some trade union leaders as a deathknell for high French standards of labor protection, wants to make a professional training program less bureaucratic.

He also wants the state to have more say over how much the unemployed get in benefits and for how long, which is currently largely set by unions and employers,

On Thursday the government is due to open talks with union leaders before deciding how to overhaul training and unemployment insurance.

Training is already funded to the tune of some 30 billion euros annually, financed in part by a levy on wage-earners, but is widely criticized for not benefiting workers that need it most.

Meanwhile, unions and employers are protective of their decades-old grip over the unemployment insurance benefits system worth billions of euros.

Macron angered unionists last week with comments he made during a visit to a car parts factory, where scuffles erupted between police and workers protesting over job losses.

“Instead of kicking up a bloody mess, some of them would be better off going to see if they can get a job over there,” he said, alluding to vacancies that a nearby aluminum factory was battling to fill.

Opponents accused Macron of showing contempt toward the workforce.

Nonetheless, business owners say the skills gap is a problem.

“We just can’t get people into factories,” Pierre Tisseau, whose company makes house terraces in Cholet in western France, told Reuters.

Tisseau said he hoped reforms to professional training would help him fill vacancies he has struggled to plug since 2008.

The local branch of the Medef business federation in Cholet said 9,000 people were looking for work but that firms were finding it hard to fill 1,500 vacancies in sectors such as construction, transport and the agri-foods.

Macron defied street protests led by the Communist Party-rooted CGT union to drive through employment law reforms that critics say will weaken collective bargaining and give more power to companies to set out work conditions.","After 'bloody mess' jab, Macron eyes training, job insurance reform",https://www.reuters.com/article/france-reform-training/after-bloody-mess-jab-macron-eyes-training-job-insurance-reform-idINKBN1CG1YY?il=0

OTTAWA (Reuters) - When Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meets President Donald Trump on Wednesday, he will try to persuade the U.S. leader to focus on Mexico as a source of potential problems at talks to update NAFTA.

Although Trudeau officials were confident Trump would mostly target Mexico as the three nations started to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, Washington has slapped duties on Canadian Bombardier airliners and lumber exports in recent months and talked tough on dairy and wine.

Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Trudeau would “explain really clearly to the President ... that Canada is not America’s problem”.

Freeland, who says Canada buys more from the United States than China, Britain and Japan combined, told CTV television on Sunday that Trudeau’s message to Trump at their White House meeting would be “We are your biggest client.”

Trump has threatened to scrap the 1994 pact unless changes are made to address issues such as a $64 billion deficit with Mexico. Negotiators start the fourth of seven planned rounds of talks near Washington on Wednesday.

Freeland describes the U.S. administration as the most protectionist since the 1930s while noting the United States runs a surplus in the trade of goods and services with Canada.

Canada has so far shunned confrontation with Washington, stressing instead the merits of NAFTA and free trade. By no means everyone south of the border is convinced.

Chris Sands, a professor at the Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said Canada’s problems marked “a new era of tough love” with Washington.

“It turns out Trump is an economic nationalist ... and it’s come as a bit of a surprise to the Canadians that they have been so much on the hot seat,” he said.

Trudeau officials deny Trump is targeting Canada as part of the NAFTA talks, saying the airliner and softwood disputes have been rumbling on for years.

Mexico has been more assertive with Washington, talking openly about abandoning NAFTA if need be or slashing imports of U.S. grain.

Andres Rozental, a former Mexican deputy foreign minister involved in the original NAFTA talks, said Ottawa had assumed traditionally close ties with the United States would insulate them from problems with NAFTA.

REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission’s attempts to intervene in Russia’s plans for a new gas pipeline to Germany have been dealt a blow by legal advice, according to EU diplomats and a document seen by Reuters.

Brussels, backed by some EU member states, is concerned the Nord Stream 2 pipeline will increase the bloc’s reliance on Russian gas and cut gas transit revenues for Ukraine, damaging its fragile economy. So the Commission is seeking a mandate from EU members to hold talks with Russia.

But Germany, the EU’s biggest economy and the end-point for the pipeline planned to deliver 55 billion cubic meters of gas a year, believes Brussels should not get involved.

According to an opinion by the legal service of the European Council, a body where EU nations meet, the Commission’s proposed mandate for talks with Russia failed to establish “any legal need to negotiate” and contained “mere political arguments.”

The opinion also took aim at the Commission’s concern that the pipeline would increase dependence on Russia’s state-owned gas firm Gazprom (GAZP.MM). This “is at the very least counter intuitive,” the document, dated Sept. 27, said.

“It pretty much kills the mandate,” one EU official said.

With the opinion suggesting the Commission may need unanimous backing from EU members for its plan, another EU official said: “I see very little room for moving forward, and in the meantime, the pipeline will be built.”

Eastern European and Baltic Sea states fear the project strengthens Russia’s hand, while Germany and other beneficiaries in northern Europe see a commercial payoff.

Both sides, however, fear the potential loss for Ukraine of some $2 billion per year of Russian gas transit fees will undermine its war-torn economy, complicating the bloc’s investment in reforms there.

Many see the project at odds with sanctions Western countries have imposed on Moscow over its role in the conflict in Ukraine.

“Our main concern is how to stabilize Ukraine,” said an EU diplomat. But he added: “Apart from Russia, there aren’t many gas-rich countries left close to Germany ... Nord Stream 2 is unsavory, but the right thing to do.”

The opinion, the latest legal tussle over the pipeline, will make it harder for the EU’s 28 members to find common ground when they debate the issue on Thursday, EU sources said.

Germany has seized on it as proof EU regulators should not meddle, while others accuse Berlin of strong-arming EU institutions.

“Our German colleagues are crowing right now,” said an EU diplomat, whose country backs the Commission bid.

Another was defiant: “We are not rolling over yet,” the diplomat said. “This is not a legal issue but about taking care of geopolitics.”

Poland, one of the pipeline’s fiercest opponents, plans to put forward its own legal opinion this week, one of its diplomats said, dismissing the Council document as “just an opinion.”

Within a bloc still reeling from Brexit, EU officials say there is little appetite for divisive initiatives and the Commission will not move ahead without a strong mandate. It is also wary of any future court challenge, they added.

‘UP TO MERKEL’

German energy groups Uniper (UN01.DE) and Wintershall (BASFn.DE) are not alone in having a stake in the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline, which will pump Russian gas via the Baltic Sea.

Austria’s OMV (OMVV.VI), Anglo-Dutch group Shell (RDSa.L), and France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA) are also invested.

Several EU diplomats said German counterparts were under pressure to sweep away an issue that could interfere with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s efforts to build a new coalition, including with the Green party, after Sept. 24 elections.

Merkel says she sees no need for the EU to get involved, and her government has sought assurances from Moscow that it will keep pumping gas through Ukraine after its gas transit contract expires in 2019.

Those in Brussels who do not want to see the EU bid fail worry the bloc will loose leverage to seek such assurances.

“Then it will be up to Merkel to negotiate Ukraine transits with Russia,” one EU official said.","Up against Germany, EU bid for gas talks with Moscow falters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-gazprom-nordstream/up-against-germany-eu-bid-for-gas-talks-with-moscow-falters-idUSKBN1CG1ZO?il=0

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Software produced by Microsoft Corp has been acquired by state organizations and firms in Russia and Crimea despite sanctions barring U.S-based companies from doing business with them, official documents show.

The acquisitions, registered on the Russian state procurement database, show the limitations in the way foreign governments and firms enforce the U.S. sanctions, imposed on Russia over its annexation of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.

Some of the users gave Microsoft fictitious data about their identity, people involved in the transactions told Reuters, exploiting a gap in the U.S. company’s ability to keep its products out of their hands.

The products in each case were sold via third parties and Reuters has no evidence that Microsoft sold products directly to entities hit by the sanctions.

“Microsoft has a strong commitment to complying with legal requirements and we have been looking into this matter in recent weeks,” a Microsoft representative said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters.

“We have robust trade compliance processes around the world to help ensure that our partners comply with all conditions including immediate halting of suspected improper sales by partners, and strong measures to try to prevent banned customers from accessing and using our products and services.”

All state organizations and state firms are obliged to disclose purchases they make on the procurement database. People involved in five of the transactions confirmed to Reuters the software had been acquired.

The Reuters review of the database found state entities in Russia and Crimea that are subject to sanctions have acquired more than 5,000 Microsoft products worth about 60 million rubles ($1.03 million).

The sum is relatively small but such software is vital for many firms and organizations in Russia and Crimea to operate. The database also does not include private companies, so the scale of the problem could be much bigger.

Related Coverage Factbox: Entities subject to sanctions that bought Microsoft products

Among entities hit by sanctions that acquired Microsoft products was Almaz-Antey, manufacturer of the BUK surface-to-air missile. Dutch prosecutors say a BUK missile brought down a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet over east Ukraine in July 2014, though Russia denies its forces shot down the plane.

Other Microsoft buyers, the database shows, include Glavgosexpertiza, a state design agency involved in work on a new bridge from Russia to Crimea and the “Krym” health spa in Crimea owned by Russia’s defense ministry.

The arms manufacturer, Almaz-Antey, did not respond to a request for comment. The defense ministry’s health spa in Crimea declined to comment. Glavgosexpertiza said “the company operates within the Russian legal framework”.

COMPLIANCE CRACKDOWN

One set of U.S. sanctions prohibits the export by a U.S. entity of any goods, services or technology to Crimea.

Other sanctions bar U.S firms from carrying out transactions with companies or individuals on a list of “specially designated nationals” deemed by Washington to be linked to the Russian government and its activities in Ukraine.

Microsoft did not directly respond to detailed questions about specific users of its products and the compliance procedures it has in place.

The products acquired by organizations hit by sanctions include “Open License Program” services, where the user must provide Microsoft with the company’s full name and address.

Almaz-Antey, Glavgosexpertiza and the defense ministry spa acquired “Open License Program” products, the database showed.

After the sanctions were introduced, Microsoft took steps to prevent entities hit by sanctions acquiring its products, according to five sources involved in the software re-selling trade and a former Microsoft employee in Russia.

But people involved in transactions say ways can be found to circumvent obstacles.

The “Morye” shipyard, based in Crimea, bought 150 Windows Server, SQL Server and Office licenses in June 2016 from OOO Web-Potok, a firm registered in Moscow, the procurement database shows. All the products were “Open License Program” services.

The shipyard fell under the general prohibition on transactions by U.S. firms with entities in Crimea and is now on the “special designated nationals” list.

“If we bought directly from Microsoft, there would be sanctions,” a shipyard employee, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said by telephone. “But there were no problems with (buying third-party from) Russian firms.”

The shipyard declined to comment. Reuters called telephone numbers listed for the supplier, OOO Web-Potok, but the people who answered said they worked for a different company.

Another way to circumvent the restrictions on Crimea-based entities is for the user, when registering the product with Microsoft, not to provide a Crimean address, three people involved in the trade said.

They said addresses in Russia’s Krasnodar region, across the Kerch Strait from Crimea, were commonly used instead.

A supplier who worked with a company on the U.S. “specially designated nationals” list said a supplier and a client could circumvent restrictions by registering Microsoft products to a subsidiary or parent company of the end user.","Exclusive: Despite sanctions, Russian organizations acquire Microsoft software",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-russia-microsoft/exclusive-despite-sanctions-russian-organizations-acquire-microsoft-software-idUSKBN1CG0NS

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will make a working visit to Britain in early 2018, with a full state visit to follow later at an unspecified date, the London Evening Standard newspaper reported on Wednesday.

Prime Minister Theresa May’s office declined to comment on the report, and said its position on the state visit had not changed. The offer had been extended, accepted by Trump, and no dates had been arranged.

May invited Trump for a state visit during a trip to Washington in January, shortly after he was inaugurated as president. The plan has proved controversial in Britain, with mass protests expected to greet the U.S. leader.

The Evening Standard, which is edited by George Osborne, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, fired by May last year, reported that diplomats were discussing plans for a pared-down working visit, devoid of the pomp of a full state visit.

Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper said it was likely to form part of a tour of several countries by the U.S. president.

The Guardian newspaper reported in June that Trump’s state visit had been postponed indefinitely after he told May during a phone conversation that he did not want to come if there were going to be large-scale protests.

The White House denied that report and May’s Downing Street office said plans for the state visit had not changed.

The British government regards its close ties with Washington as a “special relationship” and a pillar of its foreign policy as it prepares to leave the European Union.

But May’s haste in visiting Trump so early in his term and inviting him for a state visit, which typically involves lavish pageantry and events hosted by Queen Elizabeth, was criticised by some in Britain.

Trump’s pledge during his campaign to stop Muslims from entering the United States caused outrage in Britain, going as far as a debate in parliament about whether Trump should be banned from the country.",Trump to make working visit to UK in early 2018 - report,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-usa/trump-to-make-working-visit-to-uk-in-early-2018-report-idUKKBN1CG18U

HSBC will have demonstrated the same values if John Flint, head of retail banking and wealth management, replaces Stuart Gulliver when he steps down as chief executive next year. The consummate company man, who has spent nearly three decades at the sprawling Asia-focused lender, is awaiting approval from regulators, according to the Sunday Times. Installing Flint would continue the bank’s tradition of appointing insiders as CEO.

Such lack of radical change is hardly galling. HSBC has already broken with convention by installing Mark Tucker, an outsider, as chairman. The bank’s shareholders want a low-risk, diversified bank that produces steady payouts. After nearly seven years of restructuring and selling assets, Gulliver has largely achieved this. HSBC had a solid capital ratio of 14.7 percent at the end of June, well in excess of its 13 percent target, underpinning dividends. HSBC shares have outperformed the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index by a whopping 45 percent over the past two years and trade at a relatively healthy 1.2 times book value.

The bank’s net operating income – which deducts bad debt provisions but not expenses – has fallen by an average of 5.8 percent a year since 2011 as Gulliver sold businesses and shed low-returning assets. Tucker, newly recruited from AIA, could be forgiven for plotting a change of tack. Under his watch assets at the Asian insurer grew by 38 percent to $185 billion over the past five financial years, according to Eikon data. HSBC’s balance sheet shrank by 11 percent over the same period.

The bank is placing some bets: for example, it is redeploying $100 billion in risk-weighted assets to Asia, specifically the Pearl River Delta region in Southern China, in a quest to sign up middle-class customers. Investors who recall HSBC’s disastrous 2003 purchase of Household International – a bid to capture a bigger piece of the then-booming U.S. property market – might point to the perils of chasing debt-fuelled growth.

There is also more cleaning up to do. The bank has yet to make a compelling case for keeping a foothold in Mexico. Its 19 percent stake in China’s Bank of Communications also looks increasingly superfluous. Further disposals may disappoint those questing for headline-grabbing enlargement.

LISBON (Reuters) - Former Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates was indicted on graft and money laundering charges on Wednesday in the country’s biggest corruption investigation, which prosecutors say exposed his illicit links to a business elite targeted by the inquiry.

Neither Socrates, a Socialist, nor his lawyers were available for comment but he has denied any wrongdoing on many occasions, calling the accusations politically-motivated.

A more than 4,000-page indictment issued after a four-year inquiry accuses Socrates of playing a pivotal role and receiving millions of euros in a scheme involving the disgraced former heads of the Espirito Santo banking empire and of Portugal Telecom, the country’s main telecom operator.

Both entities have since ceased to exist, inflicting billions of euros in losses on taxpayers and shareholders, and their former top brass have been accused of other crimes in separate high-profile investigations.

Socrates, who was premier from 2005 to 2011, was arrested in 2014 on suspicion of corruption and spent months in prison before being shifted to house arrest while prosecutors and police continued investigating to yield the formal indictment.

He is now charged with three counts of passive corruption while holding political office, 16 counts of money-laundering, nine counts of forging documents and three counts of tax fraud. The alleged crimes occurred between 2006 and 2015.

A trial date for Socrates has not yet been set.

Prosecutors said Socrates, as prime minister and afterward, gave illicit commercial benefits to a large construction company, LENA, in return for payments received via middlemen, who were also indicted, via a Swiss bank account.

A former top-level manager at state-owned bank Caixa Geral de Depositos has also been charged with facilitating payments.

Ricardo Salgado, former CEO of Banco Espirito Santo (BES) and head of the Espirito Santo banking clan, is charged with paying Socrates for using his clout as prime minister to sway Portugal Telecom to follow a strategy defined by Salgado.

Salgado is also accused of paying Portugal Telecom former CEO Zeinal Bava and chairman Henrique Granadeiro - both of whom were also indicted.

BES, which was a major shareholder in Portugal Telecom, collapsed in 2014 under a mountain of debt, causing a default of nearly 1 billion euros at Portugal Telecom, which has since been sold off.

ATHENS (Reuters) - A Greek court on Wednesday backed the extradition to Moscow of a Russian citizen who also faces being sent to the United States on allegations of laundering billions of dollars in bitcoin.

Alexander Vinnik, the suspected mastermind of a $4 billion bitcoin laundering ring, is one of seven Russians arrested or indicted worldwide this year on U.S. cybercrime charges.

Judges ruled last week that he should be extradited to the United States, a decision Russia criticized as unjust and illegal and which Vinnik is challenging at Greece’s supreme court.

Should it decide to uphold the ruling to extradite him to the United States, the final decision is in the hands of Greece’s justice minister, who can approve extradition to one country and block the other.

Vinnik denies all charges against him. But he has agreed to be returned to Russia where he is to be tried on lesser fraud charges.

“That is his wish - to be extradited to Russia and to give his account before the Russian judicial authorities,” Alexandros Lykourezos, the lawyer leading Vinnik’s defense, told reporters after the ruling in Thessaloniki.

In the United States, where he faces up to 55 years in prison, Vinnik is accused of running BTC-e -- a digital currency exchange used to trade bitcoin -- to facilitate crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking since 2011.

He has told Greek judges that he was a technical consultant to BTC-e and not its operator.

Vinnik was arrested while on holiday in a seaside village in Greece in July. Russia then sought his extradition as it has done with other nationals wanted by the United States.

The supreme court hearing is expected within the next three weeks, Lykourezos said.","U.S., Russia in extradition tug-of-war over bitcoin fraud suspect in Greece",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CG0T8-OCATC

ZURICH (Reuters) - The possibility of a World Cup without Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi turned out to be a false alarm, yet next year’s tournament will still have a major absentee after the United States’ extraordinary failure to qualify on Tuesday.

Panama, meanwhile, showed it is perfectly possible for small nations to qualify without expanding the finals to 48 teams, which is planned for the 2026 edition, as they joined Iceland in reaching the tournament for the first time.

South American champions Chile, like African counterparts Cameroon, missed out on a ticket to Russia -- and, bizarrely, their elimination was the result of a successful protest made to FIFA about opponents fielding an ineligible player.

Twenty-three of the 32 finalists have now been decided while the remainder will be settled in November with four European playoffs, two intercontinental playoffs and the final round of African qualifiers, where three groups are still open.

Brazil, who will be making their 21st World Cup appearance, remain the only ever-present side at the finals and had qualified long before Tuesday’s drama.

Ronaldo and Messi, who have won FIFA’s World Player of the Year award between them since 2008, went into the final group matches uncertain of whether they would take part next year.

Those fears were allayed as Messi’s hat-trick led Argentina to a 3-1 win at high altitude in Ecuador to ensure their place and Portugal made it with a 2-0 win over Switzerland.

The U.S., one of FIFA’s most important members in commercial terms, were not so lucky as a shock 2-1 defeat in Trinidad and Tobago, combined with wins for Panama and Honduras, ended their run of seven successive finals appearances.

The Netherlands, semi-finalists in 2014 and runners-up in 2010, will also miss out while four-times champions Italy, who last failed to qualify in 1958, face a two-leg playoff in November.

The impact of the U.S.’s absence will be felt at broadcasters Fox, who take over coverage of the World Cup from ESPN starting with the 2018 tournament and a host of sponsors, such as Nike, who had been hoping for plenty of World Cup exposure.

SMALLER NATIONS

Panama’s first-ever qualification for the finals prompted President Juan Carlos Varela to declare a national holiday, describing it on Twitter as an “historic day for the country”.

But their 2-1 win over Costa Rica also highlighted global soccer body FIFA’s surprising decision not to use goal-line technology in the qualifiers, as the ball did not appear to fully cross the line for their first goal.

Panama’s success also strengthened the hand of those who argue that the expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams is not necessary to allow more smaller countries to take part.

On Monday, Iceland, with a population of less than 350,000, became the smallest nation ever to qualify for the finals while Cape Verde, with a population of 550,000, are still in contention for one of the African places.

A bigger World Cup may also devalue the qualifying competition, particularly in South America where two points separated five teams battling for two direct places and a playoff spot before Tuesday’s enthralling finale.

An evening of unremitting tension ended with Uruguay, Argentina and Colombia joining Brazil in Russia, while Peru’s 1-1 draw was enough to land them in fifth place - the playoff spot - and continue dreaming of a first appearance since 1982.

Peru sneaked ahead of Chile on goal difference after their southern neighbors lost 3-0 to Brazil and dropped to sixth. They were also indebted to Venezuela who stopped Paraguay from taking the playoff spot with a shock 1-0 win in Asuncion.

Earlier in the competition, Chile got an extra two points after protesting that Bolivia fielded an ineligible player -- Paraguay-born Nelson Cabrera -- during a 0-0 draw in Santiago.

FIFA agreed and awarded them a 3-0 walkover win -- but then did the same for Peru who lost 2-0 to Bolivia and therefore gained three extra points, compared to Chile’s two.

In the 1960’s and 1970’s, the central goal was preventing North Korean founder Kim Il Sung from redeploying his army south of the 38th parallel. For the last 25 years, however, the focus of U.S. policymakers has been something even more difficult: the denuclearization of the Kim dynasty.

Pyongyang’s two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July, its testing of a Hwasong-12 missile over Japan in August and the September 3 test of what Pyongyang claimed was a hydrogen bomb have only accelerated the sense of urgency in Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo about the need for a strong collective response.

The U.S. foreign policy community has many recommendations on the table but few easy answers. A preventive military strike is not plausible given its devastating cost - Brigadier General Rob Givens (retired) estimates that 20,000 people would perish in Seoul in the first day of a conflict. Even though the U.N. Security Council voted Monday to step up sanctions against Pyongyang, economic restrictions have limited impact. Pyongyang is a master of sanctions evasion, devising ever new and effective ways to keep their weapons programs funded.

What may work, however, is a new U.S. approach that learns from its failures - as well as its successes during the Cold War - while tempering expectations on what can be achieved.

The Kim dynasty has long sought recognition as a nuclear weapons state, a demand that would be a political minefield for even the most popular U.S. president to meet. But North Korea is a nuclear state whether Washington offers formal recognition or not. The only way for the U.S. to improve its North Korea policy is by acknowledging that Pyongyang will be nuclear-capable for many years to come and is highly unlikely to eliminate its nuclear weapons program regardless of what Washington offers. This isn’t about what Kim Jong Un wants, but rather what is most likely to serve U.S. national security.

While openly recognizing North Korea as a nuclear power would cause tremors throughout Asia, Trump ought to do it anyway. As soon as he does, the U.S. can re-focus attention from a denuclearization objective that is increasingly impossible to imagine toward an old-fashioned strategy of deterrence and containment. “We know how to contain and degrade enemies who want to do us harm,” Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest told me. “We just need to open a history book and reread what works and apply it for the 21st century.”

For Washington, deterrence and containment would mean building an anti-North Korea alliance of diverse states in and outside the region with the common objective of minimizing Pyongyang’s ability to threaten its neighbors. As former State Department official Richard Sokolsky told me in an email: “If we could deter the likes of Stalin and Mao, we can do the same with Kim.”

As politically risky as this decision would be, effective deterrence would require Trump to establish a reliable channel of communication with the North - similar to the U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-China hotlines during the Cold War - in order to clear up misunderstandings that will inevitably arise and to deliver a unified message of what Washington will tolerate. The signal to the leadership in Pyongyang should be as unambiguous as possible: while Washington does not seek an armed conflict with the North, the U.S. military will respond to any provocation that dangerously impacts the interests of the U.S. or its allies. The message would aim to trade coexistence between the U.S. and North Korea for as long as Kim Jong Un refrains from launching an attack against his neighbors. Given Kim’s preoccupation with self-preservation - there is no evidence to date he is bent on suicidal self-destruction - this arrangement may be pragmatic enough for the young dictator to explore.

Because the Kim dynasty has been accused of exporting and cooperating with countries like Iran and Syria on nuclear designs, missile technology, and possibly chemical weapons development, the Security Council ought to deliver a similar message to Pyongyang that a continuation of this behavior would be grounds for an even tougher and more comprehensive boycott of what it can import and export.

While China remains resistant to cutting off all oil imports to the North or squeezing its economy to the point of collapse, Washington may be willing to enlist Beijing’s help in areas where Beijing is more likely to agree, such as preventing the proliferation of dual use nuclear and missile technology transiting North Korean territory. Stemming the flow of these materials would minimize the spread of weapons of dangerous items to other proliferators, an objective that the Chinese appear to share.

Washington also needs to encourage a stronger South Korea-Japan relationship. Historical rivalries between these two states cannot obstruct the regional intelligence sharing essential to promoting a unity of purpose in East Asia. The Trump administration needs to spend far more diplomatic capital on alliance-building than it has to date. Open talk about scrapping the free trade agreement only destabilizes the kinds of partnerships that form the bedrock of an anti-Pyongyang alliance. Washington can and should allow the South Koreans to take more responsibility for its external defense, but it can do so without giving Pyongyang a reason to believe that its nuclear development is causing divisions among its adversaries.

Despite an inconsistent qualifying campaign, the Americans entered the Ato Boldon Stadium needing only a win of any sort over the bottom team in the CONCACAF final qualifying group to punch their ticket to Russia.

But two first-half goals - an Omar Gonzalez own goal in the 17th minute and an Alvin Jones effort 20 minutes later - proved too much for the Americans to overcome despite Christian Pulisic’s strike after the break.

Instead, Panama qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time with their 2-1 victory over Costa Rica, while Honduras beat Mexico 3-2 to pip the United States to a playoff place against Australia.

“Clearly very disappointing,” U.S. coach Bruce Arena told reporters.

”We had everything there for us today. There are no excuses for us not getting the second goal and at least a point out of the game.

“It’s a blemish for us. We should not be staying home for this World Cup and I take the responsibility for that.”

It was a stunning turn of events for the U.S., who were supposed to be rebuilding their programme after hiring Arena last year.

Weathering some bumps in the road, the Americans pulled off an emphatic 4-0 win over Panama last week to take a two-point edge over both Panama and Honduras and regain control of their destiny.

But the U.S. got off to an ominous start against the Soca Warriors when defender Gonzalez tried to clear the ball only for it to loop up and over goalkeeper Tim Howard and into the net.

“The guy hit an early cross, and when I went to clear it, he touched it first and it hit off my shin and it happened to go right over Tim Howard,” Gonzalez said.

“It’s one of the most unlucky goals ever. It’s one that will haunt me forever. I never thought I would see this day, it’s the worst day of my career.”

Jones doubled the lead when he unleashed a piledriver of a shot from well outside the penalty area that flew past Howard and into the net just inside the far post.

The U.S. responded in the second half when Pulisic also scored from outside the box in the 47th minute to give the visitors hope that they might at least rescue a draw that would have secured them the playoff spot.

The desperate effort to level up the match fell short, though, despite the best efforts of 34-year-old Clint Dempsey who nearly scored twice in the final 20 minutes.

Benny Feilhaber also had a header ricochet off the post in the 88th minute but the hosts held firm to condemn the Americans to a fourth defeat in 10 matches in the final round of qualifying.",United States miss out on World Cup after Trinidad loss,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-worldcup-tto-usa/united-states-miss-out-on-world-cup-after-trinidad-loss-idUKKBN1CG082

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian authorities have agreed to regulate the crypto-currency market and hope to set out how this regulation will work by the end of the year, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday.

Crypto-currencies such as bitcoin enable individuals to transfer value to each other and pay for goods and services bypassing banks and the mainstream financial system.

They count technology enthusiasts, speculators attracted by big price swings and libertarians skeptical of government monetary policy among their fans worldwide. But banks have mostly steered clear of crypto-currencies, and some governments and central banks have been strongly critical of them.

On Tuesday President Vladimir Putin chaired a meeting of senior Russian officials on the issue, and said the crypto-currencies were risky and used for crime. Russia’s central bank has said it would block websites selling bitcoin and its rivals to households.

“The president has spoken of the problems related to crypto-currencies. These are difficulties regarding ... money laundering and cases that are related to identification issues,” TASS news agency quoted Siluanov as saying on Wednesday.

“That’s why we have agreed that the state should regulate the issuing of crypto-currencies, their mining and turnover. The state should take all this under control,” said Siluanov, who attended Tuesday’s meeting with Putin.

Siluanov’s comments echoed his earlier calls to control and supervise the market for virtual currencies. Siluanov said his ministry would work with the central bank on regulating crypto-currencies in Russia.

Siluanov’s deputy Alexei Moiseev said on Wednesday that Russia’s Federal Tax Service could also be involved as Moscow wants to collect taxes from those who mine crypto-currencies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contentious new U.S. demands are set to hit NAFTA negotiating tables on Wednesday, threatening to push modernization talks toward collapse as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau again tries to remind U.S. President Donald Trump of the trade pact’s merits.

Trudeau will meet with Trump and trade-focused U.S. lawmakers on the North American Free Trade Agreement while hundreds of negotiators, government officials and lobbyists from Canada, Mexico and the United States descend on a hotel in Arlington, Virginia for a fourth round of talks.

“We’re going to be talking about NAFTA and the fact it has led to great opportunities for our citizens,” Trudeau said on Tuesday night in conciliatory remarks at a Fortune magazine dinner honoring women, where he sat next to Ivanka Trump.

He added that he would “look for areas of agreement” with President Trump to improve outcomes for both countries.

The Canadian leader’s visit comes amid increasing acrimony over NAFTA renegotiations, with Trump making fresh threats to terminate the 23-year-old agreement and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday accusing Trump’s administration of trying to sabotage the talks with “poison pill proposals.”

Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray warned that an end to NAFTA would mark a breaking point in U.S.-Mexican relations and affect bilateral cooperation in non-trade areas.

The NAFTA talks are likely to stall in the face of aggressive U.S. demands to sharply increase content requirements for autos and auto parts, trade experts say.

The Washington round promises to be difficult, with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announcing early on Wednesday that talks would be extended by two days to Oct 17.

Lighthizer also said the three nations have completed their negotiations regarding company competition policy, reaching agreement on a chapter that provides goes beyond previous U.S. trade deals to ensure “certain rights and transparency under each nation’s competition laws.”

People briefed on the new U.S. proposals to be presented this week said that USTR is seeking to sharply lift North American content threshold for autos and auto parts to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent, with a 50 percent U.S.-specific content requirement.

“These will be met with widespread opposition from Canada and Mexico. I think it’s just a bridge too far,” said Wendy Cutler, the Asia Society’s Washington policy director and former chief U.S. negotiator for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal canceled by Trump.

Other contentious U.S. proposals opposed by Canada, Mexico and U.S. business interests include a five-year sunset provision, radical changes to NAFTA’s dispute arbitration systems, changes to intellectual property provisions and new protections for U.S. seasonal produce growers.

In his meeting with Trump, Trudeau is expected to remind the president that Canada is the United States’ biggest export customer, with largely balanced two-way goods and services trade, and is not the cause of U.S. manufacturing jobs lost under NAFTA, Canadian officials said.

Mexico has that distinction, with far lower wages that have lured U.S. auto plants and other manufacturers across its northern border, resulting in a $64 billion trade surplus with the United States last year that Trump administration officials have vowed to slash.

Trudeau in April urged Trump not to withdraw from NAFTA due to the pain it would cause on both sides of the border.",NAFTA talks hit contentious phase as Canadian PM fights for trade pact,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CG0DV-OCATP

O leilão de venda da fatia do governo paulista na Cesp estava previsto para setembro, mas foi suspenso em meio a um temor de falta de interessados, com potenciais compradores queixando-se porque os contratos das hidrelétricas da empresa vencem entre 2020 e 2028, prazo considerado curto para investimentos em energia, vistos como de longo prazo.

“É uma possibilidade. Lá atrás não houve uma convergência entre a posição de São Paulo e do Ministério da Fazenda sobre como dividir os benefícios...mas isso sempre é possível buscar uma convergência, e agora São Paulo vai tentar isso”, disse Pedrosa.

A Reuters publicou em setembro que o governo paulista negociava com a União uma solução para as concessões da Cesp a fim de renovar o interesse na privatização da companhia.

A Cesp opera 1,65 gigawatt em hidrelétricas no Estado de São Paulo, e a possibilidade de o comprador da empresa renovar no futuro os contratos dessas usinas em troca do pagamento de uma outorga à União poderia favorecer a arrecadação do Tesouro e ao mesmo tempo elevar o valor da Cesp para investidores.

“Estamos discutindo com eles um cronograma de trabalho...já existe cobertura legal para esse movimento....a União pode arrecadar, é uma oportunidade”, acrescentou Pedrosa.

Ele lembrou ainda que uma eventual renovação dos contratos das usinas não seria realizada em um modelo em que a energia é vendida a preço regulado, o chamado “regime de cotas”.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Geneva prosecutors are investigating after toilets in a bank and three restaurants were blocked by about $100,000 in high-denomination euro banknotes, they said on Monday.

“We are not so interested in the motive but we want to be sure of the origin of the money,” spokesman Vincent Derouand said, adding that neither throwing money away nor blocking a toilet was a crime.

The Tribune de Geneve newspaper, which first reported the unusual deposit, said the first blockage occurred in the toilet serving the vault at UBS bank (UBSG.S) in Geneva’s financial district, and three nearby bistros found their facilities bunged up with 500-euro notes a few days later.

Derouand said two people had agreed to compensate the restaurants for the costs of the blockage, and the restaurants had withdrawn a complaint that they made when the incident happened in May.

The cash was confiscated during the investigation and it was unclear who would get it if it was found to be lawful. There was no immediate reason to think it was dirty money, Derouand said.

The European Central Bank said last year it had decided to discontinue the 500-euro note because of concerns that it was being used too often for illicit activities including money laundering.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s top e-commerce firm, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd [BABA.N], is launching a $15 billion drive to build overseas research hubs as the deep-pocketed firm looks to compete with global leaders in e-commerce, logistics and cloud technology.

The Alibaba ‘Damo’ academy would launch eight research bases in China, Israel, the United States, Russia and Singapore and was hiring 100 researchers to work on artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing and fintech, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.

“The Alibaba DAMO Academy will be at the forefront of developing next-generation technology that will spur the growth of Alibaba and our partners”, Chief Technology Officer Jeff Zhang said.

The Chinese giant and its affiliates have undergone a rapid expansion in the past year, bringing it into direct competition with U.S. e-retailer Amazon.com Inc [AMZN.O], as well as global payments, cloud and logitics firms.

Since last year Alibaba has invested roughly $2 billion to acquire a majority stake in Singapore-based retailer Lazada.com, creating a network of e-commerce hubs across Southeast Asia in partnership with payment affiliate Ant Financial.

It has also pursued a 1.2 billion bid for U.S. money transfer service MoneyGram, in a pending deal that has come under scrutiny from critics who say it poses a national security threat.

Along with an existing data science research lab in California, Alibaba has opened new data centers in Europe, the United States, the Middle East, Australia, Japan, India and Indonesia since 2016, in a bid to boost its cloud business.

The investment also comes as Beijing prioritises state funding in quantum computing, AI and big data, urging provincial governments, universities, the military and private firms to play a bigger role in developing advanced technology in areas where China trails developed countries.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to dramatically increase the country’s nuclear arsenal, he said in a meeting with his national security advisers in July, NBC News reported on Wednesday, citing three officials who were present in the room.

Trump’s reported comments come as tensions remained high with North Korea and as Trump is expected to make an announcement on whether to decertify the international deal surrounding Iran’s nuclear program.

The president spoke on July after he was shown a chart indicating the stockpile of U.S. nuclear weapons had slid from a high of 32,000 in the 1960s. Trump said he wanted to have that same number now, NBC reported.

The United States currently has about 4,000 nuclear warheads earmarked for use in its military stockpile, according to the Federation of American Scientists.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran’s moderate president gave a full-throated defense of his one-time rivals in the Revolutionary Guards on Wednesday, as the country’s pragmatist and hardline factions rallied together in the face of threats from Donald Trump.

The U.S. president is expected to “decertify” Iran’s nuclear deal with global powers this week and add its Revolutionary Guards military force to Washington’s black list of terrorist groups under a strategy to increase pressure on Tehran.

The threat of U.S. action has united the two main factions of Iran’s leadership, with the pragmatists led by President Hassan Rouhani who seek greater openness to the West demonstrating their support for the hardline Guards.

During a cabinet meeting shown on state television on Wednesday, Rouhani said U.S. action against the Guards would be a “mistake beyond mistakes”.

“They think that the Guards are a military entity. The Revolutionary Guards are not a military entity. They’re in the heart of the people. The Revolutionary Guards, in all the days of danger, have defended our national interests,” he said.

“We’re one society. We’re Iran. There are no differences between different factions in confronting the plots of our enemies,” he added.

Rouhani, the architect of Iran’s 2015 deal with global powers to curb its nuclear program in return for the lifting of international sanctions, won re-election in a landslide five months ago on a platform promising greater openness to the world and reform at home.

During an unprecedentedly bitter campaign, he repeatedly spoke out in public against the political influence of the Guards, accusing them of backing his hardline opponent to defend their economic interests.

In recent days, however, the threat of new action from Washington has prompted a public display of unity from the rival factions among Iran’s rulers.

“Today, the president of America has created conditions where Iran is more united than ever. Today, those who oppose the nuclear deal and those who support it are side by side. We all have one voice,” Rouhani said.

Newspapers on Tuesday ran pictures of the urbane, U.S.-educated Foreign Minister Javad Zarif laughing and hugging the commander of the guards, Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari.

Zarif brief lawmakers on Wednesday about the expected U.S. action and about Iran’s plans for a response, according to members of parliament quoted in state media.

“In the closed session Zarif emphasized that if the Americans take any steps against the nuclear deal that the Islamic Republic of Iran will give them a more crushing response,” Shahbaz Hassanpour, a lawmaker representing the city of Sirjan, told the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).

Lawmakers did not disclose the specific actions that Zarif had discussed as plans for Iranian retaliation.

Trump’s expected move to decertify the nuclear deal would not by itself withdraw the United States from the agreement, but would pass that decision on to Congress, requiring lawmakers to decide within 60 days whether to re-impose sanctions.

The nuclear deal is supported by Washington’s European allies Britain, France and Germany, as well as by Russia and China, all of which say Iran has complied so far.

Adding the Guards to the terrorism blacklist could have economic consequences, since the elite military force also has a vast business empire in Iran. International banks are required to make sure their clients are not blacklisted.

Washington has already blacklisted other entities and individuals for supporting Guards’ activities, but has not yet blacklisted the Guards themselves.

During the meeting with Zarif, parliament members expressed their support for the Guards, Hassanpour said. Zarif also noted during the session that European countries will continue backing the nuclear deal regardless of what actions the U.S may take, Hassanpour told IRNA.",Iran president defends Guards in show of unity anticipating Trump,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear/iran-president-defends-guards-in-show-of-unity-anticipating-trump-idUSKBN1CG1D3?il=0

MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy took the first step on Wednesday towards suspending Catalonia’s political autonomy and ruling the region directly to thwart a push for independence.

He demanded that the regional government clarify whether it now considered itself independent following a speech by Catalan president Carles Puigdemont on Tuesday night.

This requirement is a necessary step before triggering Article 155 of the constitution, which would allow Madrid to suspend the region’s political autonomy.

Rajoy’s move could deepen the confrontation between Madrid and Catalonia but it also signals a way out of Spain’s biggest political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981.

The prime minister would be likely to call a snap regional election after activating the constitutional mechanism allowing him to do so.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence from Spain on Tuesday night but then immediately suspended it and called for talks with the Madrid government.

“The cabinet has agreed this morning to formally request the Catalan government to confirm whether it has declared the independence of Catalonia, regardless of the deliberate confusion created over its implementation,” Rajoy said in a televised address after a cabinet meeting to consider the government’s response.

Without giving a specific deadline for the Catalan government to reply, Rajoy said: “The answer from the Catalan president will determine future events, in the next few days.”

It is not yet clear if and when the Catalan government would answer the requirement but it now faces a conundrum, political analysts say.

If Puigdemont says he did declare independence, the government would likely trigger Article 155. If he says he did not declare it, then far-left party CUP would likely withdraw its support to his minority government.

“Rajoy has two objectives: if Puigdemont remains ambiguous, the pro-independence movement will get more fragmented; if Puigdemont insists on defending independence then Rajoy will be able to apply Article 155,” said Antonio Barroso, deputy director of London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence.

“Either way Rajoy’s aim would be to first restore the rule of law in Catalonia and this could at some point lead to early elections in the region”.

DIALOGUE CALL DISMISSED

Puigdemont had been widely expected to unilaterally declare Catalonia’s independence on Tuesday after the Catalan government said 90 percent of Catalans had voted for a breakaway in an Oct. 1 referendum that Spain had declared illegal and which most opponents of independence boycotted.

Madrid responded angrily to Puigdemont’s speech, saying the Catalan government could not act on the results of the referendum.

“Neither Mr. Puigdemont nor anyone else can claim, without returning to legality and democracy, to impose mediation... Dialogue between democrats takes place within the law,” Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said.

Invoking Article 155 to ease Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades would make prospects of a negotiated solution to the Catalonia crisis even more remote.

A spokesman for the Catalan government said earlier on Wednesday that if Madrid went down this road, it would press ahead with independence.

“We have given up absolutely nothing...We have taken a time out...which doesn’t mean a step backwards, or a renunciation or anything like that,” Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull told Catalunya Radio.

Socialist opposition leader Pedro Sanchez said he would back Rajoy if he had to activate Article 155 and said he had agreed with the prime minister to open a constitutional reform within six months to discuss how Catalonia could fit better in Spain.

It was not clear how the Catalan government would respond to the offer.

MARKET RELIEF

Puigdemont’s speech also disappointed supporters of independence, thousands of whom watched proceedings on giant screens outside parliament before sadly leaving for home.

Financial markets, however, were encouraged that an immediate declaration of independence had been avoided.

Following Puigdemont’s speech, Spain’s benchmark IBEX share index rose as much as 1.6 percent, outperforming the pan-European STOXX 600 index. The rally pushed the main world stocks index, the MSCI’s 47-country ‘All-World’ index, to a record high.

Spain’s 10-year government bond yield -- which moves inversely to the price -- dropped 5 basis points to 1.65 percent in early trade, according to Tradeweb data.

In Brussels, there was relief that the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy now had at least bought some time to deal with a crisis that was still far from over.

One EU official said Puigdemont “seems to have listened to advice not to do something irreversible”.

The Catalan crisis has deeply divided the northeastern region itself as well as the Spanish nation. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of about 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.

The stakes are high -- losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.

LONDON (Reuters) - Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar after Arab countries imposed restrictions on trade with the tiny Gulf state and the company is looking at alternative shipping routes.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.","Maersk says unable to ship Qatar bound cargo from UAE, seeks alternatives",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-shipping/maersk-says-unable-to-ship-qatar-bound-cargo-from-uae-seeks-alternatives-idUSKBN18X1YS

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer resumed their battle for the year-end number one ranking with imperious victories to reach the third round of the Shanghai Masters on Wednesday.

Top seed Nadal extended his winning streak to 13 matches with a 6-2 6-1 demolition of American Jared Donaldson in the Qi Zhong Stadium before world number two Federer, to the delight of his sizeable Chinese fan club, got the better of Argentina’s Diego Schwartzman 7-6(4) 6-4.

Nadal, who leads Federer by 2,370 points going into the home straight of a season in which the two old rivals have shared out the game’s biggest prizes, was unstoppable against Donaldson and needed only 54 minutes to prevail.

“It was a very quick match in all aspects,” Nadal, bidding to end a year on top for the fourth time in his career, said.

”If the year-end ranking happens, it will be, I think, a very important achievement for me.

“With so many years of difference I think it’s something very difficult. But there remains work to do.”

He last finished the year as world number one in 2013.

Federer shows no sign of giving up the chase but had to battle hard against Schwartzman -- letting slip a break in the first set to get dragged into a tiebreak.

The 36-year-old Swiss always had an extra shot in his locker though and, having taken the opener, broke serve straight away in the second set to move towards victory.

He finished off the contest with his 14th ace, setting up a third round clash against Ukraine’s Alexandr Dolgopolov.

“It was a good win, very happy with my first match,” Federer said. “I knew he was dangerous. I could have closed the first set out earlier but I started the second set very well.”

A new supervisory framework will be introduced in the coming months that will force insurers to boost capital significantly as well as improve internal risk controls, said the sources, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.

The moves are aimed at triggering consolidation in the insurance industry and forcing weaker companies to merge with stronger ones, industry analysts said.

“They (central bank officials) said half of the companies that are here today will not be here,” one of the sources said. “They want stronger companies in the market.”

The proposed changes were discussed during a meeting between officials of the Saudi Arabia Monetary Authority (SAMA) and senior insurance executives this week, the people said.

SAMA did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Current requirements for companies to have at least 100 million Saudi riyals ($27 million) of capital for insurance activities in Saudi Arabia, or 200 million for reinsurance activities, are likely to be significantly increased, the sources said.

The Saudi insurance sector has come under pressure as the economy has slipped into recession this year, with health insurance suffering in particular as expatriates have left the kingdom and hospital costs have risen, the sources said.

ABRUPT LIBERALIZATION

That pressure has exacerbated problems stemming from the sector’s abrupt liberalization a decade ago, when the central bank licensed some 30 insurance firms in an attempt to encourage the sector and cut the economy’s reliance on oil.

Ten of the companies licensed at that time are now unprofitable. Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperative Insurance and Reinsurance Co (MedGulf) 8030.SE, one of the most troubled, posted accumulated losses in the second quarter that surpassed 73 percent of its capital. Over the last year, 11 firms have been temporarily suspended from issuing new insurance policies, some more than once. Among them was Sharia-compliant insurer SABB Takaful 8080.SE, which earlier this month was stopped from issuing or renewing insurance or savings products. The biggest Saudi insurance companies by assets, Company for Cooperative Insurance 8010.SE and Bupa Arabia for Cooperative Insurance Co 8210.SE, are not among those facing problems.

Saudi Arabia’s insurance market is fragmented, with only a few companies dominating the sector and an abundance of smaller firms unable to make inroads.

Excluding the top five insurers, market share for the remaining 29 firms is below 37 percent, said Mohammed Ali Londe, a Dubai-based credit analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. The figure drops under 24 percent when excluding the top 10 insurers in the market, he said.

SCRAMBLING TO COMPETE

That has left smaller companies scrambling to compete on prices amid limited appetite for their products, with insurance penetration in Saudi Arabia among the lowest in the region and globally at 1.5 percent of GDP.

SAMA’s solution is to engineer mergers among these smaller companies or acquisitions by larger and healthier ones, although it is difficult to force companies into this, the sources said.

“Their hope is that if the companies merge, there will be more economies of scale and so on,” said the source, adding: “But if you put two bad apples together, you may just end up with one even bigger bad apple,”

The central bank is wary of letting the companies fail, the sources said, as more than half of the shares are owned by politically sensitive retail investors in a market unaccustomed to liquidations.

The capital position of companies has improved due to rights issues, however there are still a handful of companies that need to significantly improve their solvency, S&P Global Ratings’ London-based analyst David Anthony told Reuters.

MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy took the first step on Wednesday toward suspending Catalonia’s political autonomy and ruling the region directly to thwart a push for independence.

He demanded that the regional government clarify whether it now considered itself independent following a speech by Catalan president Carles Puigdemont on Tuesday night.

This requirement is a necessary step before triggering Article 155 of the constitution, which would allow Madrid to suspend the region’s political autonomy.

Rajoy’s move could deepen the confrontation between Madrid and Catalonia but it also signals a way out of Spain’s biggest political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981.

The prime minister would be likely to call a snap regional election after activating the constitutional mechanism allowing him to do so.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence from Spain on Tuesday night but then immediately suspended it and called for talks with the Madrid government.

“The cabinet has agreed this morning to formally request the Catalan government to confirm whether it has declared the independence of Catalonia, regardless of the deliberate confusion created over its implementation,” Rajoy said in a televised address after a cabinet meeting to consider the government’s response.

Without giving a specific deadline for the Catalan government to reply, Rajoy said: “The answer from the Catalan president will determine future events, in the next few days.”

It is not yet clear if and when the Catalan government would answer the requirement but it now faces a conundrum, political analysts say.

If Puigdemont says he did declare independence, the government would likely trigger Article 155. If he says he did not declare it, then far-left party CUP would likely withdraw its support to his minority government.

“Rajoy has two objectives: if Puigdemont remains ambiguous, the pro-independence movement will get more fragmented; if Puigdemont insists on defending independence then Rajoy will be able to apply Article 155,” said Antonio Barroso, deputy director of London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence.

“Either way Rajoy’s aim would be to first restore the rule of law in Catalonia and this could at some point lead to early elections in the region”.

DIALOGUE CALL DISMISSED

Puigdemont had been widely expected to unilaterally declare Catalonia’s independence on Tuesday after the Catalan government said 90 percent of Catalans had voted for a breakaway in an Oct. 1 referendum that Spain had declared illegal and which most opponents of independence boycotted.

Madrid responded angrily to Puigdemont’s speech, saying the Catalan government could not act on the results of the referendum.

“Neither Mr. Puigdemont nor anyone else can claim, without returning to legality and democracy, to impose mediation... Dialogue between democrats takes place within the law,” Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said.

Invoking Article 155 to ease Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades would make prospects of a negotiated solution to the Catalonia crisis even more remote.

A spokesman for the Catalan government said earlier on Wednesday that if Madrid went down this road, it would press ahead with independence.

“We have given up absolutely nothing...We have taken a time out...which doesn’t mean a step backwards, or a renunciation or anything like that,” Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull told Catalunya Radio.

Socialist opposition leader Pedro Sanchez said he would back Rajoy if he had to activate Article 155 and said he had agreed with the prime minister to open a constitutional reform within six months to discuss how Catalonia could fit better in Spain.

It was not clear how the Catalan government would respond to the offer.

MARKET RELIEF

Puigdemont’s speech also disappointed supporters of independence, thousands of whom watched proceedings on giant screens outside parliament before sadly leaving for home.

Financial markets, however, were encouraged that an immediate declaration of independence had been avoided.

Following Puigdemont’s speech, Spain’s benchmark IBEX share index rose as much as 1.6 percent, outperforming the pan-European STOXX 600 index. The rally pushed the main world stocks index, the MSCI’s 47-country ‘All-World’ index, to a record high.

Spain’s 10-year government bond yield -- which moves inversely to the price -- dropped 5 basis points to 1.65 percent in early trade, according to Tradeweb data.

In Brussels, there was relief that the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy now had at least bought some time to deal with a crisis that was still far from over.

One EU official said Puigdemont “seems to have listened to advice not to do something irreversible”.

The Catalan crisis has deeply divided the northeastern region itself as well as the Spanish nation. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of about 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.

The stakes are high -- losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.

Gusts of up to 50 miles per hour (80 kph) and 10 percent humidity are forecast for later on Wednesday and into Thursday for the region, where 17 fires have forced 20,000 people to flee their homes in one of the deadliest wildfire outbreaks in California history, fire officials said.

“The potential for new fires that could grow exponentially as these fires did in such a short time period is there,” said Lynne Tolmachoff, spokeswoman for California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

The weather had given firefighters a reprieve on Tuesday as cooler temperatures, lower winds and coastal fog let them make headway against the fires that had burned 115,000 acres.

New evacuation orders were posted overnight across Sonoma County, north of San Francisco.

At least 11 people have been killed by that fire alone, officials said.

“We have no idea what’s there or if there’s anything to go back to,” Irene Fonzeca said outside the shelter holding a breathing mask as smoke and light ash blanketed downtown Santa Rosa.

Lola Ogunyemi se viu no centro de uma polêmica internacional causada por um vídeo de 3 segundos publicado na página da Dove Estados Unidos no Facebook em que aparecia retirando uma camiseta para revelar uma mulher branca, que também tirava sua camisa, revelando uma mulher asiática.

“Eu não acho que foi racista”, disse, em entrevista à BBC, nesta quarta-feira.

Muitos usuários do Facebook e do Twitter disseram que o vídeo sugeria que pessoas brancas são mais limpas ou mais bonitas que pessoas negras e relacionaram o comercial a propagandas de sabão do século 19, que mostravam pessoas negras se lavando para se tornar brancas.

Entretanto, Lola disse que os trechos do vídeo compartilhados na internet durante o fim de semana --que, em sua maioria, mostravam apenas ela e a mulher branca, deixando de fora a mulher asiática- -causaram a impressão errada.

Ela disse que havia uma versão de 30 segundos feita para a TV que contava com outras imagens e com um slogan que deixavam muito mais claro que a intenção era dizer que todas as mulheres merecem produtos de qualidade.

Trump, a Republican, escalated his feud with the National Football League in a Twitter post asking if the league should get tax breaks while some athletes kneel in protest when the “Star-Spangled Banner” is played at the start of each game.

“Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!” Trump wrote on Twitter.

The world’s top-grossing sports league gave up its tax-free status two years ago. Its owners are preparing to address the anthem issue at their fall meeting in New York Oct. 17-18, NFL chief spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday.

“Everyone at this point is frustrated by the situation,” Lockhart said. “The commissioner and the owners do want the players to stand. We think it is an important part of the game.”

The protests, in a league where African-Americans make up the majority of players, have continued through the season, with some players taking a knee when the anthem is played and others standing arm-in-arm in solidarity.

Current policy calls for players to stand for the anthem and face the flag, but no player has been disciplined for a protest, Lockhart said.

“We need to move past this controversy, and we want to do that together with our players,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell wrote in a memo to team owners.

The White House supported the idea of asking players to stand, said spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.

“We are glad to see the NFL taking positive steps in that direction,” she said at a news briefing.

Asked to explain Trump’s comment on the NFL and taxes, Sanders said, “The federal tax law doesn’t apply here, but certainly we know that they receive tax subsidies on a variety of different levels.”

The NFL Players Association, when asked for a reaction to possible changes to anthem rules, said in an email “we do not have a response at this time.”

Trump last month called on NFL team owners to fire players who kneel during the anthem to protest police violence against black Americans.

Critics contend Trump is fanning the controversy to distract from issues including devastation in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, tensions with North Korea and difficulties in pushing healthcare and tax overhauls through the U.S. Congress.

Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, speaking on KRLD-FM in Dallas on Tuesday, reiterated his stance that if any of his players chose to demonstrate during the anthem, they would not play.

“If you do not honor and stand for the flag in the way that a lot of our fans feel that you should ... if that’s not the case, then you won’t play,” said Jones.

“That’s nothing new as far as that being my wish or the way I want the Cowboys. As far as whether or not I will basically institute or do what I said I would just say. ... I would ask anybody to look at my record relative to what I say I’m going to do.”

Vice President Mike Pence walked out of a NFL game on Sunday after some players knelt, an action some critics called a publicity stunt.

Trump won the presidency with less support from black voters than any other president in at least four decades.

Trump has squared off against the NFL before, having owned a team in the upstart United States Football League in the 1980s. That league folded in 1985 after an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL failed.

Trump has refused to disclose his own tax history, departing from a practice of U.S. presidents going back more than 40 years.

LONDON (Reuters) - A special production of the 1960s rock musical “Hair”, tweaked for the age of Trump, premieres in London this week to mark the ground-breaking show’s 50th anniversary.

The show, staged in London’s Vaults theatre, features updates to the dialogue and song lyrics written by James Rado, who wrote the show with Germoe Ragni in the 1960s, to comment on contemporary politics.

Among the updates, characters sing about making “America stronger,” - a reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan. The new production also features new scenes and other dialogue.

“I think what Jim (Rado) wanted to do was just make it a little bit more apparent and clear that America and other Western countries, including Britain, haven’t necessarily moved forward as quickly as we’d hoped,” director Jonathan O‘Boyle, told Reuters.

It was highly controversial upon its first release for its full-frontal nudity, liberal depiction of drug taking and irreverent treatment of the American flag, which was displayed up-side down and laid on the floor.

The show had lengthy runs on Broadway and on London’s West End, and songs like “Aquarius” and “Good Morning Starshine” helped the original Broadway cast recording sell almost three million copies.

Despite the social and political changes since the show’s creation, its themes of racism, fears of nuclear war - and it’s irreverent treatment of the American flag - mean that is still relevant to the current political discussion.

“Everything that hippies were fighting for then, is still needing to be fought for today,” said Andy Coxon, who plays hippy George Berger. “You’d be surprised how much things haven’t changed. A lot has, we still have a way to go.”

And would the U.S. president himself, currently embroiled in a row over American football players kneeling during the playing of the national anthem in protest, approve of the show?

“He’d probably hate it,” said O‘Boyle.","""Hair"" gets a little new styling for the age of Trump",https://in.reuters.com/article/britain-theatre-hair/hair-gets-a-little-new-styling-for-the-age-of-trump-idINKBN1CG1BE

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks set a record high on Wednesday, as relief that Catalonia had put off any plans to break away from Spain followed a two-decade peak for Asia’s biggest share market and more upbeat predictions for the global economy.

Spanish stocks and bonds rallied and the euro reached a two-week high in early European trading after Catalonia’s leader, Carles Puigdemont, declined to make a formal declaration of independence on Tuesday. That disappointed many pro-independence supporters but pleased financial markets.

A 1.5 percent jump in Spain's IBEX .IBEX helped MSCI's 47-country world stocks index .MIWD00000PUS touch a record high.

The biggest surge came from Spanish banks, which rallied as much as 4 percent .IBEXIB. Spanish government bond yields - a gauge of political tension - saw their second-biggest decline in a month [GVD/EUR].

“There was a chance Puigdemont would have made a decisive declaration, so now yields are dropping because there is room for negotiation left,” said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk.

The euro climbed as high as $1.18345 against the dollar, a two-week top. The U.S. currency was down for a fourth day running and on its worst run since July.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s feud with Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, an influential fellow Republican, has raised concern that Trump’s proposed tax-code overhaul would fail .

“Squabbles surrounding Trump’s efforts come as no surprise, but it is still not helping the dollar,” said Yukio Izhizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.

The early Spanish gains bolstered already-confident markets. The International Monetary Fund pushed up its forecasts for global growth on Tuesday, helping Wall Street to its latest record high.

Asian shares then climbed to their highest in a decade as Japan's Nikkei .N225 reached its strongest since 1996, despite more losses for scandal-hit Kobe Steel (5406.T) [.T]. South Korean stocks .KOPSI reached a new record top.

“A risk-on mood has set in and money is flowing out of bond funds into equities funds,” said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management.

“One of the biggest drivers of global equities is the United States, and some of the macro data coming out from there has been quite positive. There is also this view that China is traveling much better than many people had expected.”

FED MINUTES

The dollar was under pressure amid uncertainty over who will be the next Federal Reserve chair, with the predictions market site, PredictIt, favoring Fed Governor Jerome Powell as the most likely candidate.

Powell is regarded as more hawkish than incumbent Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February, but analysts say he probably wouldn’t look to unwind stimulus as aggressively as some of the candidates on the list.

Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan, who votes this year on Fed policy, had also said overnight that he wants to see more signs of upward inflation before raising interest rates again.

The weaker dollar helped commodities and emerging markets, which borrow heavily in the U.S. currency.

Emerging market stocks sailed to six-year highs. U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 42 cents to $51.34 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 added 25 cents to $56.86, on signs of tighter supply.

Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

While President Donald Trump’s aides work on relaxing domestic regulations on drone sales to select allies, Washington will also seek to renegotiate a 1987 missile-control pact with the aim of loosening international restrictions on U.S. exports of unmanned aircraft, according to government and industry sources.

At home, the U.S. administration is pressing ahead with its revamp of drone export policy under heavy pressure from American manufacturers and in defiance of human rights advocates who warn of the risk of fueling instability in hot spots including the Middle East and South Asia.

The changes, part of a broader effort to overhaul U.S. arms export protocols, could be rolled out by the end of the year under a presidential policy decree, the administration officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

The aim is to help U.S. drone makers, pioneers in remote-controlled aircraft that have become a centerpiece of counterterrorism strategy, reassert themselves in the overseas market where China, Israel and others often sell under less-cumbersome restrictions.

Simplified export rules could easily generate thousands of jobs, but it’s too early to be more specific, said Remy Nathan, a lobbyist with the Aerospace Industry Association. The main beneficiaries would be top U.S. drone makers General Atomics, Boeing (BA.N), Northrop Grumman (NOC.N), Textron (TXT.N) and Lockheed Martin (LMT.N).

“This will allow us to get in the game in a way that we’ve never been before,” said one senior U.S. official.

‘BUY AMERICAN’ AGENDA

Regulations are expected to be loosened especially on the sale of unarmed intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance drones, the most sophisticated of which carry high-resolution cameras and laser-guided targeting systems to aid missiles fired from warplanes, naval vessels or ground launchers.

Deliberations have been more complicated, however, on how to alter export rules for missile-equipped drones like the Predator and Reaper. Hunter-killer drones, which have essentially changed the face of modern warfare, are increasingly in demand and U.S. models considered the most advanced.

The push is not only part of Trump‘s “Buy American” agenda to boost U.S. business abroad but also reflects a more export-friendly approach to weapons sales that the administration sees as a way to wield influence with foreign partners, the senior official said.

Under a draft of the new rules, a classified list of countries numbering in double digits would be given more of a fast-track treatment for military drone purchases, a second senior official said. The favored group would include some of Washington’s closest NATO allies and partners in the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence alliance: Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, according to the industry source.

Rachel Stohl, director of the conventional defense program at the Stimson Center in Washington, said if U.S. drone export rules become too lenient, they could give more governments with poor human rights records the means to “target their own civilians.”

Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, revised the policy for military drone exports in 2015. But U.S. manufacturers complained it was still too restrictive compared with main competitors China and Israel.

U.S. drone makers are vying for a larger share of the global military drone market. Even before the coming changes, the Teal Group, a market research firm, has forecast sales will rise from $2.8 billion in 2016 to $9.4 billion in 2025.

Linden Blue, CEO of privately held General Atomics, the U.S. leader in military drones, visited the White House recently to lobby for his industry, a person familiar with the discussions said.

Among the U.S. changes will be a formal reinterpretation of the “presumption of denial”, a longstanding obstacle to most military drones sales, that would make it easier and faster to secure approval, the officials said.

Britain, and only recently Italy, are the only countries that had been allowed to buy armed U.S. drones.

A long-delayed $2 billion sale to India of General Atomics’ Guardian surveillance drones finally secured U.S. approval in June. But New Delhi’s request for armed drones has stalled.

A major hurdle to expanded sales of the most powerful U.S. drones is the Missile Technology Control Regime, or MTCR, a 1987 accord signed by the United States and 34 other countries, which set rules for the sale and purchase of missiles.

It categorizes drones with a range greater than of 185 miles (300 km) and a payload above 1,100 pounds (500 kg) as cruise missiles, requiring extremely tight import/export controls. To gain an international stamp of approval for the relaxed U.S. export rules, U.S. officials want the MTCR renegotiated.

State Department officials attending an annual meeting of the missile-control group in Dublin next week will present a “discussion paper” proposing that sales of drones – which did not exist when the agreement was created – be treated more leniently than the missile technology that the MTCR was designed to regulate, according to a U.S. official and industry sources.

There is no guarantee of a consensus. Russia, which has NATO members along its borders, could resist such changes, the U.S. official said.

CHINA AND ISRAEL

China, which is not an MTCR signatory, has pushed ahead with drone sales to some countries with close ties to Washington, such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria, but which have failed to pass U.S. regulatory muster.

Chinese models such as the CH-3 and CH-4 have been compared to the Reaper but are much cheaper. U.S. officials said Beijing sells them with few strings attached.

The Chinese foreign ministry insists it takes a “cautious and responsible attitude” to military drone exports.

Israel, which is outside the MTCR but has pledged to abide by it, competes with U.S. manufacturers on the basis of high-tech standards. But it will not sell to neighbors in the volatile Middle East. Israel sold $525 million worth of drones overseas in 2016, according defense ministry data.

Wednesday’s verdict would not be applied retrospectively, however, said the court, which based its conclusions on India’s Child Marriage Prohibition Act.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that a man is committing rape if he engages in sexual intercourse with his wife who is aged between 15 and 18, a landmark decision that will affect millions of child brides.

The legal age of consent is 18 years. The law regards even consensual sex with a woman under 16 as rape, but an exception had been made for intercourse between a man and his wife who is between 15 and 18.

Marital rape is not a crime in India, where the government has said criminalising marital rape could destabalise marriages and make men vulnerable to harrassment by their wives.

The Supreme Court ruled the age of consent was 18 for “all purposes” after hearing a petition by Independent Thought, a non-profit group that sought to criminalise sex with underaged wives.

“Sexual intercourse by a married man with their minor wife below 18 years is rape,” the court said in its judgment, which was welcomed by women’s rights campaigners.

“I am very happy with the supreme court judgment,” Vikram Srivastava, a lawyer for Independent Thought, told Reuters.

“The judgment gives a boost to the national campaign of ‘Beti bachao and beti padhao,'” he added, using a Hindi phrase meaning ‘Save the girl child and educate the girl child’.

The additional solicitor general, P.S. Narasimha, who represented the government, declined to comment.

Wednesday’s verdict would not be applied retrospectively, however, said the court, which based its conclusions on India’s Child Marriage Prohibition Act.

Though illegal, child marriage is deeply rooted in India. Factors such as poverty, weak law enforcement, patriarchal social norms and concerns about family honour are often blamed.

Marriages in India are considered to involve a child if the woman is below 18 or the man younger than 21. Men both above and below the legal age may marry child brides.

India’s 2011 census showed child marriage had declined marginally from a decade earlier but more than 5 million girls were still married before the legal age of 18.

More than a quarter of Indian women between 20 and 24 said they were married before 18, and a fifth of men between 25 and 29 said they married below the legal age, the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights and the charity Young Lives said in a recent report analysing the census data.

The number of underage brides has declined 0.3 percent in rural areas since 2001, but in urban areas it increased 0.7 percent, the report said.

The study, the first to break down India’s census data on child marriage, found that nearly one in four girls in rural areas and one in five in urban areas married before 18.

Despite efforts to empower girls and women and toughen penalties, India is among the top 10 countries with the highest rates of child marriage, along with Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Niger and South Sudan.",Supreme Court rules sex with an underage wife is rape,https://www.reuters.com/article/india-rape/supreme-court-rules-sex-with-an-underage-wife-is-rape-idINKBN1CG1C4

Em agosto as vendas varejistas recuaram 0,5 por cento, informou o Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) nesta quarta-feira, após estabilidade em julho e alta nos três meses anteriores.

É o resultado mais fraco para agosto desde 2015, quando caiu 0,6 por cento, e a leitura foi bem pior do que a expectativa em pesquisa da Reuters de alta de 0,2 por cento.

Sobre o mesmo mês de 2016, as vendas apresentaram alta de 3,6 por cento, também abaixo da expectativa de avanço de 4,5 por cento mas no melhor resultado desde maio de 2014 (+4,6 por cento).

“A queda de agosto é mais uma acomodação. Mais parece um ajuste depois de altas do que uma reversão de tendência para o setor varejista”, afirmou a gerente do IBGE Isabella Nunes.

De acordo com o IBGE, sete das oito atividades pesquisadas apresentaram recuo nas vendas, sendo a mais forte em equipamentos e material para escritório, informática e comunicação, de 6,7 por cento.

As vendas de combustíveis e lubrificantes recuaram 2,9 por cento no mês. Em agosto, os preços dos combustíveis aumentaram 6,67 por cento, em meio a 19 reajustes de preços da gasolina dentro da nova política da Petrobras, apontou o IBGE ao divulgar os dados de inflação daquele mês.

Já as vendas de hipermercados, supermercados, produtos alimentícios, bebidas e fumo caíram 0,3 por cento em agosto sobre julho.

A única atividade a registrar aumento nas vendas foi a de móveis e eletrodomésticos, de 1,7 por cento, no quarto mês seguido de ganhos.

“A atividade que tem desempenho melhor é aquela que tem a ver com a queda de juros, com a disponibilidade do FGTS e com a inflação menor”, completou Isabella.

O varejo ampliado, que inclui veículos e material de construção, subiu 0,1 por cento em relação a julho, influenciado tanto pela alta de 2,8 por cento em veículos e motos, partes e peças, quanto pelo avanço de 1,8 por cento nas vendas de material de construção.

O resultado do varejo acompanhou o da indústria em agosto, que interrompeu quatro meses seguidos de alta porém em movimento que também não tende a atrapalhar o ritmo de recuperação do setor.

O ambiente de inflação e juros baixos no país favorecem o comércio, aliado recentemente à melhora do mercado de trabalho, o que dá base para a recuperação da economia após a recessão que afetou o país.

Em setembro, a confiança do consumidor brasileiro apurada pela Fundação Getulio Vargas voltou a avançar após três quedas seguidas, diante da melhora da percepção sobre o mercado de trabalho.","Varejo no Brasil surpreende e cai em agosto, mas movimento não é tendência, diz IBGE",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idBRKBN1CG1OG-OBRDN

The Argentina international was injured in a car crash during a day off in the Netherlands and missed City’s last Premier League game at Chelsea, a 1-0 win, and his country’s World Cup qualifiers.

“Exactly how many days he will be off, I don’t know right now,” City manager Pep Guardiola had said after the accident, adding that he had “no problem” with Aguero being in Amsterdam for a concert.

“I think the players have to rest mentally and physically. They can enjoy their lives. I want my players to have fun. If they decide to go there, they decide to go there. It is OK for me.”

Fans had feared City’s top scorer with seven goals in all competitions this season would be out for a lengthy spell, but will be encouraged by his return to the training pitch.

Aguero, who is one goal short of Eric Brook’s all-time City scoring record of 177, participated in a light session with a physio monitoring him.

Midfielder Fabian Delph also had a workout in the morning session, after suffering a minor injury in the win at Chelsea.

(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is betting it can get its money-making mojo back by pitching creative deals to big, complex clients, marking a return to its investment banking roots as trading revenue slows.

The Wall Street bank is forming a group, known internally as the Innovation Lab, focused on generating compelling deal ideas for companies like Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) or Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp’s (9984.T) $93 billion investment fund, people familiar with the matter said.

The new “brain trust,” as one insider called it, is aimed at supercharging investment banking revenue as trading, for many years Goldman’s profit engine, has faltered amid regulations and market trends that hurt the bank more than rivals.

From 2009-2016, Goldman’s annual trading revenue fell by more than $18 billion, or 32 percent, while investment banking revenue rose by $1.3 billion, or 26 percent. That trend has accelerated this year.

Analysts expect Goldman to reveal more trading pain when it reports third-quarter results on Tuesday, building on two consecutive quarters of declines.

After facing angry questions from shareholders, Goldman last month unveiled a plan to boost annual revenue by $5 billion.

Management has emphasized Goldman’s roots as a strategic adviser to corporations, wealthy families and investment funds, and has also expanded into areas like consumer lending.

But while fees from those services can be more reliable than trading, analysts say Goldman will not replace the income from its stock and bond market heyday any time soon.

“Many investors still view it as a ‘show me’ story because the initiatives are in businesses that are highly competitive,” said Steven Chubak, a banking analyst with Instinet.

A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment on the new group.

Led by Goldman dealmakers Brian DeCenzo and James Morris, the group will perform a different role than traditional bankers focused broadly on pitching mergers and acquisitions to big companies, the people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media.

The group is expected to come up with out-of-the box ideas and focus on clients who want to acquire or make big investments in businesses across industries, and do not fit neatly into individual categories, like technology or industrials, that sector bankers already cover.

Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses across aerospace, energy industrials, financials, transportation, consumer products and food. Meanwhile, SoftBank’s Vision Fund has invested in companies ranging from satellite startup OneWeb to asset manager Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG.N).

On top of spotting deal opportunities, the new team will analyze broad trends like the impact of oil prices across various sectors.

DeCenzo and Morris were previously part of Goldman’s financial sponsors group, which scouts deals for private equity firms.

The group is the latest change under new management of the investment bank, which earlier this year elevated Gregg Lemkau and Marc Nachmann as co-heads alongside John Waldron.

Under their leadership, the business has added bankers to cities like Atlanta and Dallas to serve local clients more closely, and hired dealmakers at the partner level from Wall Street rivals. They have also installed programmers alongside dealmakers to increase productivity and give clients better advice.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s pound steadied on Wednesday, holding just above a one-month low hit as investors grew concerned on whether entrenched expectations of higher UK interest rates were reasonable given a backdrop of uncertain Brexit negotiations.

Noises around Brexit negotiations grew louder after finance minister Philip Hammond declared the government was planning for all possibilities, including Britain’s leaving with no agreement on the terms of its departure.

However, that had little impact on sterling with the currency hemmed in tight trading ranges as investors worried that a sharp turnaround in sterling in the currency markets to net long positions may come under pressure.

David Cheetham, the chief market analyst for XTB trading, warned that the high levels of speculative positioning risked weakening the pound.

“Recent events are unlikely to cause major downside for sterling on their own but they are weighing on the pound, and the alarming frequency with which they are occurring only increases the chances of another major political blow for the market,” he said.

Sterling GBP=D3 was broadly flat at $1.3195 after two sessions of gains. It briefly hit a day's low of $1.3176 after Hammond's comments.

Strategists said the speech had only minimal impact with markets more focused on the strong data this week and broad expectations of interest rate hikes baked into the currency markets.

“I don’t think Hammond’s speech about a ‘no deal’ is a major factor. Actions speak louder than words to the market. There has been virtually no practical preparation of a ‘no deal’ scenario,” said Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at Societe Generale.

Despite falling projections for British economic growth, futures markets are pricing in 50 basis points of Bank of England rate increases over the next year IRPR, the most in the developed world apart from Canada.

But the outlook appeared fragile, with some market watchers including such as Morgan Stanley preferring to sell sterling on rallies on Brexit worries.

A 2-1 defeat to an already eliminated Trinidad and Tobago meant the U.S. finished an embarrassing fifth out of six teams in their CONCACAF qualifying group.

Mexico topped the standings with Costa Rica in second place while the third automatic spot went to Panama.

The Central American nation reached the World Cup for the first time in their history thanks to a last gasp 2-1 win over Costa Rica, while Honduras ended fourth and will play Australia over two legs for a place in Russia next year.

The impact of the U.S’s absence will be felt at broadcasters Fox, who take over coverage of the World Cup from ESPN starting with the 2018 tournament and a host of sponsors, such as Nike, who had been hoping for plenty of World Cup exposure.

But on a deeper level, the outcome raises a host of questions about whether American soccer truly is progressing.

The country did not feature in any World Cup from 1954 to 1986, but after making it to Italia 90 and then hosting the tournament themselves in 1994, the game appeared to be on the rise.

The U.S reached the quarter-finals in 2002 and more recently impressed in Brazil four years ago by reaching the second round, finishing above Portugal in their group.

On the domestic front, Major League Soccer, which began in 1996, has produced a stable league for the first time in North America and has grown to 22 teams, many playing in new soccer specific stadiums.

NO EXCUSES

“This is an utter embarrassment, with the amount of money that is in Major League Soccer and in this sport, you can’t get a draw against Trinidad? You don’t deserve to go the World Cup” said former U.S. striker Taylor Twellman, now a television pundit for ESPN.

“If this failure does not wake up everyone from U.S Soccer (Federation) to Major League Soccer to ‘pay to play’ (youth soccer), to broadcasters, everything, then we are all insane.”

“That should never have happened with the billion dollars plus that is going into MLS and youth soccer development but it did and every single person should look themselves in the mirror,” he added.

But in the immediate aftermath of the defeat coach Bruce Arena, who was brought back in November last year following the firing of German Juergen Klinsmann, rejected the idea that major change was needed.

”There’s nothing wrong with what we’re doing,“ Arena was quoted as saying by Sports Illustrated (www.si.com). ”Certainly, I think if our league continues to grow it benefits the national team program. We have some good players coming up. Nothing has to change.

“To make any kind of crazy changes I think would be foolish. We’re building a consistent professional league. We have players playing abroad of a certain quality. There’s enough there. There’s no excuses for us to not qualify for the World Cup.”

U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati, who is expected to face a challenge to his leadership with two potential candidates having expressed an interest in standing against him in the next elections, also questioned the need for change.

“You don’t make wholesale changes based on the ball being two inches wide or two inches in. We’ll look at everything, obviously, and all our programs, both the national team and all the development stuff,” he said.

“But we’ve got a lot of pieces in place that we think are very good and have been coming along. Tonight obviously wasn’t what we hoped for.”",Stunned U.S face major questions after World Cup debacle,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1CG1HQ-OCASP

BEIJING/SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Some of China’s top oil refineries are having to take the highly unusual step of cutting operations during what is typically the peak demand summer season when hot weather drives up power usage and families take to the road during school holidays.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

The government proposes spending an additional 15 billion euros on training over five years, with employers saying they cannot fill vacancies despite a jobless rate of close to 10 percent, higher than in many European countries.

President Emmanuel Macron also wants to bring the national unemployment insurance fund, currently jointly run by unions and employers, under the state’s control.

Macron, a former banker whose other labor market reform plans have been condemned by some trade union leaders as a deathknell for high French standards of labor protection, wants to make a professional training program less bureaucratic.

He also wants the state to have more say over how much the unemployed get in benefits and for how long, which is currently largely set by unions and employers,

On Thursday the government is due to open talks with union leaders before deciding how to overhaul training and unemployment insurance.

Training is already funded to the tune of some 30 billion euros annually, financed in part by a levy on wage-earners, but is widely criticized for not benefiting workers that need it most.

Meanwhile, unions and employers are protective of their decades-old grip over the unemployment insurance benefits system worth billions of euros.

Macron angered unionists last week with comments he made during a visit to a car parts factory, where scuffles erupted between police and workers protesting over job losses.

“Instead of kicking up a bloody mess, some of them would be better off going to see if they can get a job over there,” he said, alluding to vacancies that a nearby aluminum factory was battling to fill.

Opponents accused Macron of showing contempt toward the workforce.

Nonetheless, business owners say the skills gap is a problem.

“We just can’t get people into factories,” Pierre Tisseau, whose company makes house terraces in Cholet in western France, told Reuters.

Tisseau said he hoped reforms to professional training would help him fill vacancies he has struggled to plug since 2008.

The local branch of the Medef business federation in Cholet said 9,000 people were looking for work but that firms were finding it hard to fill 1,500 vacancies in sectors such as construction, transport and the agri-foods.

Macron defied street protests led by the Communist Party-rooted CGT union to drive through employment law reforms that critics say will weaken collective bargaining and give more power to companies to set out work conditions.","After 'bloody mess' jab, Macron eyes training, job insurance reform",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-france-reform-training/after-bloody-mess-jab-macron-eyes-training-job-insurance-reform-idUKKBN1CG1Z0

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling bloc could come close to keeping its two-thirds “super” majority in an Oct. 22 lower house election, defying some predictions of substantial losses and solidifying his grip on power, a survey published by the Nikkei business daily on Wednesday showed.

Abe’s conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its more dovish junior partner, the Komeito, are likely to secure more than 290 seats in the 465-seat chamber, the Nikkei said.

The ruling bloc had a two-thirds “super majority” in the lower house before the chamber was dissolved. The number of seats has been cut from 475 as part of electoral reforms.

A strong showing by Abe’s coalition would boost his chances of winning a third term as LDP leader from next September, putting him on track to become Japan’s longest-serving premier.

Abe called the snap election amid confusion in the opposition camp and after an uptick in his ratings, which had been hurt earlier this year by suspected cronyism scandals, in hopes of gaining a fresh mandate after nearly five years in power.

But the outlook has been clouded by the emergence of popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike’s Party of Hope, a fledgling party that the former LDP lawmaker and defense minister calls a reformist, conservative alternative to Abe’s LDP.

The Nikkei said Koike’s party was on track to get around 69 seats, with a forecast range of 46-110.

Another new party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, formed from the liberal wing of the failed opposition Democratic Party, was set to win more than 40 seats, it said.

The Democrats, faced with rock bottom ratings and internal dissension, have said they would run no candidates of their own, freeing many to run on the Party of Hope ticket.

PRO-CONSTITUTION REVISION FORCES

The Asahi newspaper also forecast a strong showing by the ruling bloc, with the LDP set to win well over the 233 seats needed to have a simple majority on its own. It said Koike’s Party of Hope was struggling but was likely to get more than 57 seats. About 40 percent of voters were undecided, the Asahi said.

The Nikkei also forecast that parties in favor of revising the post-war, pacifist constitution - Abe’s long-held goal - were on track to win more than two-thirds.

That includes the LDP and Koike’s Party of Hope as well as another smaller right-leaning party, the Japan Innovation Party.

Amending the constitution, a politically controversial move never yet taken, requires a two-thirds majority in both chambers and a majority in a public referendum.

Koike’s party had raised expectations that it would cut into the LDP’s conservative base. But her decision not to run for a lower house seat herself and refusal to say whom her party would support for premier after the election appears to have eroded the party’s momentum.

Competition among a fragmented opposition, which also includes the Japanese Communist Party, in many districts means the anti-LDP vote could be split, a plus for Abe’s party.

Abe has led the LDP to four landslide wins since he took the helm of the party in 2012, but turnout has been low and the LDP has typically won with about 25 percent of eligible votes. The others either stayed home or backed opposition parties.

The premier has been touting the success of his “Abenomics” recipe of hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and promised structural reforms, while Koike argues that reforms have been too slow in a fast-changing global economy.

The world’s third-largest economy is on track for its longest expansion since World War Two, and the jobless rate was at a 23-year low of 2.8 percent in August while wages are starting to rise a bit. But Abe’s reflationary policies have not yet sparked a sustainable recovery led by the private sector.",Japan PM's ruling bloc seen nearing 2/3 majority in Oct 22 lower house poll: Nikkei,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-japan-election/japan-pms-ruling-bloc-seen-nearing-2-3-majority-in-october-22-lower-house-poll-nikkei-idUKKBN1CG1W5

REUTERS/Steve Crisp

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - There’s no such thing as a founder who goes quietly. Weinstein Co, the film studio that ousted one of its two eponymous brothers amid sexual-harassment allegations, now joins other companies like Fox News and Uber that parted company with influential bosses who misbehaved, or stood idly by while others did. There’s dual risk, both from what the departing founder takes away and what they leave behind.

Harvey Weinstein’s exit followed charges that the executive producer of “The King’s Speech” and “Django Unchained” settled with women who claimed he sexually harassed them over three decades. Weinstein initially responded with a statement pledging to conquer his demons, and flagging up the culture of the 60s and 70s when rules were “different”. His private production company’s board pushed him out anyway.

After the purge comes the refurb. This is always more intricate when the departing boss is a founder. Think about Uber, whose prime mover Travis Kalanick was pushed out by investors concerned by the frat-boy behaviour of company managers. The ride-hailing app has now limited Kalanick’s remaining shareholder powers, appointed a clean-cut new chief, and brought in a new investor, SoftBank.

A deep clean is also still under way at Twenty-First Century Fox, where the controlling Murdoch family had to step in and fix its TV station’s culture after late founder Roger Ailes was purged amid a sexual-harassment scandal.

Weinstein Co will face two familiar problems. Influential industry figures perpetuate internal ways of operating that tend to outlive them. Like Uber’s Kalanick or Dov Charney, the ousted founder of failed fashion chain American Apparel, Weinstein grew out of an industry with a reputation for poor treatment of women. Things may change – and scandals help – but only glacially.

The other problem is that founders can take away the spark or contacts that helped their firms in the first place. Weinstein Co will be run by the other brother, Bob, and Chief Operating Officer David Glasser while an internal investigation proceeds. But will it be as effective without its formative double act? Such uncertainties may explain why boards often miss the moment when a founders’ comportment goes from a foible to a liability.

ATHENS (Reuters) - A Greek court on Wednesday backed the extradition to Moscow of a Russian citizen who also faces being sent to the United States on allegations of laundering billions of dollars in bitcoin.

Alexander Vinnik, the suspected mastermind of a $4 billion bitcoin laundering ring, is one of seven Russians arrested or indicted worldwide this year on U.S. cybercrime charges.

Judges ruled last week that he should be extradited to the United States, a decision Russia criticized as unjust and illegal and which Vinnik is challenging at Greece’s supreme court.

Should it decide to uphold the ruling to extradite him to the United States, the final decision is in the hands of Greece’s justice minister, who can approve extradition to one country and block the other.

Vinnik denies all charges against him. But he has agreed to be returned to Russia where he is to be tried on lesser fraud charges.

“That is his wish - to be extradited to Russia and to give his account before the Russian judicial authorities,” Alexandros Lykourezos, the lawyer leading Vinnik’s defense, told reporters after the ruling in Thessaloniki.

In the United States, where he faces up to 55 years in prison, Vinnik is accused of running BTC-e -- a digital currency exchange used to trade bitcoin -- to facilitate crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking since 2011.

He has told Greek judges that he was a technical consultant to BTC-e and not its operator.

Vinnik was arrested while on holiday in a seaside village in Greece in July. Russia then sought his extradition as it has done with other nationals wanted by the United States.

The supreme court hearing is expected within the next three weeks, Lykourezos said.","U.S., Russia in extradition tug-of-war over bitcoin fraud suspect in Greece",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-russia-cyber-extradition/u-s-russia-in-extradition-tug-of-war-over-bitcoin-fraud-suspect-in-greece-idUSKBN1CG0T8

The 70-year-old retired banker said he is unhappy with infighting and turnover in the White House. He does not like Trump’s penchant for traveling to his personal golf resorts. He wishes the president would do more to fix the healthcare system, and he worries that Trump might back down from his promise to force illegal immigrants out of the country.

“Every president makes mistakes,” Wilson said. “But if you add one on top of one, on top of another one, on top of another, there’s just a limit.”

Trump, who inspired millions of supporters last year in places like Morgan County, has been losing his grip on rural America.

According to the Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll, the Republican president’s popularity is eroding in small towns and rural communities where 15 percent of the country’s population lives. The poll of more than 15,000 adults in “non-metro” areas shows that they are now as likely to disapprove of Trump as they are to approve of him.

In September, 47 percent of people in non-metro areas approved of Trump while 47 percent disapproved. That is down from Trump’s first four weeks in office, when 55 percent said they approved of the president while 39 percent disapproved.

The poll found that Trump has lost support in rural areas among men, whites and people who never went to college. He lost support with rural Republicans and rural voters who supported him on Election Day.

And while Trump still gets relatively high marks in the poll for his handling of the economy and national security, rural Americans are increasingly unhappy with Trump’s record on immigration, a central part of his presidential campaign.

Forty-seven percent of rural Americans said in September they approved of the president’s handling of immigration, down from 56 percent during his first month in office.

Poll respondents who were interviewed by Reuters gave different reasons for their dissatisfaction with the president on immigration.

A few said they are tired of waiting for Trump to make good on his promise to build a wall along America’s southern border, while others said they were uncomfortable with his administration’s efforts to restrict travel into the United States.

“There should be some sort of compromise between a free flow of people over the border and something that’s more controlled,” said Drew Carlson, 19, of Warrensburg, Missouri, who took the poll.

But Trump’s “constant fixation on deportation is a little bit unsettling to me.”

The Trump administration would not comment about the Reuters/Ipsos poll.

To be sure, Trump is still much more popular in rural America than he is elsewhere.

Since he took office, “I like him less, but I support him more,” said Robert Cody, 87, a retired chemical engineer from Bartlesville, Oklahoma who took the poll.

Cody said that Trump may rankle some people with the way he talks and tweets, but it is a small price to pay for a president who will fight to strip away government regulations and strengthen the border.

DROPPING OFF THE SCREEN

When Trump called the election a ”last shot“ for the struggling coal industry and when he called for protecting the nation’s southern border with a “big, fat, beautiful wall”, he was speaking directly to rural America, said David Swenson, an economist at Iowa State University.

“Feelings of resentment and deprivation have pervaded a lot of these places,” Swenson said. “And here comes a candidate (Trump) who’s offering simplistic answers” to issues that concern them.

Rural Americans responded by supporting Trump over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 26 percentage points during the election, an advantage that helped tip the balance in battleground states, such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Trump won by less than 1 percentage point.

But after 10 months, many are still waiting to see concrete changes that could make life easier in rural America, said Karl Stauber, who runs a private economic development agency serving a patchwork of manufacturing communities in south central Virginia.

“Rural people are more cynical about the federal government than people in general are,” Stauber said. “They’ve heard so many promises, and they’ve not seen much done.”

Despite all the talk of bringing manufacturing jobs back, Stauber said he has not seen any companies which have relocated to his region, or anyone expand their workforce, due to new federal policies.

“It just seems like we’ve dropped off the screen,” he said.

According to the poll, Trump’s overall popularity has dropped gradually, and for different reasons, this year.

Rural Americans were increasingly unhappy with Trump’s handling of healthcare in March and April after he lobbied for a Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare and cut coverage for millions of Americans.

In May and June, they were more critical of Trump’s ability to carry out U.S. foreign policy, and they gave him lower marks for “the way he treats people like me.”

In August, they were increasingly unhappy with “the effort he’s making to unify the country” after he blamed “both sides” for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which a suspected white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States. It asked people to rate the president’s performance and the results were filtered for people who lived in zip codes that fell within counties designated as “non-metro” by the federal government.

The poll combined the results of “non-metro” respondents into nine, four-week periods. Each period included between 1,300 and 2,000 responses and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.",Trump's popularity is slipping in rural America: poll,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ruralamerica-poll/trumps-popularity-is-slipping-in-rural-america-poll-idUSKBN1CE162

MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy took the first step on Wednesday toward suspending Catalonia’s political autonomy and ruling the region directly to thwart a push for independence.

He demanded that the regional government clarify whether it now considered itself independent following a speech by Catalan president Carles Puigdemont on Tuesday night.

This requirement is a necessary step before triggering Article 155 of the constitution, which would allow Madrid to suspend the region’s political autonomy.

Rajoy’s move could deepen the confrontation between Madrid and Catalonia but it also signals a way out of Spain’s biggest political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981.

The prime minister would be likely to call a snap regional election after activating the constitutional mechanism allowing him to do so.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence from Spain on Tuesday night but then immediately suspended it and called for talks with the Madrid government.

“The cabinet has agreed this morning to formally request the Catalan government to confirm whether it has declared the independence of Catalonia, regardless of the deliberate confusion created over its implementation,” Rajoy said in a televised address after a cabinet meeting to consider the government’s response.

Without giving a specific deadline for the Catalan government to reply, Rajoy said: “The answer from the Catalan president will determine future events, in the next few days.”

It is not yet clear if and when the Catalan government would answer the requirement but it now faces a conundrum, political analysts say.

If Puigdemont says he did declare independence, the government would likely trigger Article 155. If he says he did not declare it, then far-left party CUP would likely withdraw its support to his minority government.

“Rajoy has two objectives: if Puigdemont remains ambiguous, the pro-independence movement will get more fragmented; if Puigdemont insists on defending independence then Rajoy will be able to apply Article 155,” said Antonio Barroso, deputy director of London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence.

“Either way Rajoy’s aim would be to first restore the rule of law in Catalonia and this could at some point lead to early elections in the region”.

DIALOGUE CALL DISMISSED

Puigdemont had been widely expected to unilaterally declare Catalonia’s independence on Tuesday after the Catalan government said 90 percent of Catalans had voted for a breakaway in an Oct. 1 referendum that Spain had declared illegal and which most opponents of independence boycotted.

Madrid responded angrily to Puigdemont’s speech, saying the Catalan government could not act on the results of the referendum.

“Neither Mr. Puigdemont nor anyone else can claim, without returning to legality and democracy, to impose mediation... Dialogue between democrats takes place within the law,” Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said.

Invoking Article 155 to ease Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades would make prospects of a negotiated solution to the Catalonia crisis even more remote.

A spokesman for the Catalan government said earlier on Wednesday that if Madrid went down this road, it would press ahead with independence.

“We have given up absolutely nothing...We have taken a time out...which doesn’t mean a step backwards, or a renunciation or anything like that,” Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull told Catalunya Radio.

Socialist opposition leader Pedro Sanchez said he would back Rajoy if he had to activate Article 155 and said he had agreed with the prime minister to open a constitutional reform within six months to discuss how Catalonia could fit better in Spain.

It was not clear how the Catalan government would respond to the offer.

MARKET RELIEF

Puigdemont’s speech also disappointed supporters of independence, thousands of whom watched proceedings on giant screens outside parliament before sadly leaving for home.

Financial markets, however, were encouraged that an immediate declaration of independence had been avoided.

Following Puigdemont’s speech, Spain’s benchmark IBEX share index rose as much as 1.6 percent, outperforming the pan-European STOXX 600 index. The rally pushed the main world stocks index, the MSCI’s 47-country ‘All-World’ index, to a record high.

Spain’s 10-year government bond yield -- which moves inversely to the price -- dropped 5 basis points to 1.65 percent in early trade, according to Tradeweb data.

In Brussels, there was relief that the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy now had at least bought some time to deal with a crisis that was still far from over.

One EU official said Puigdemont “seems to have listened to advice not to do something irreversible”.

The Catalan crisis has deeply divided the northeastern region itself as well as the Spanish nation. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of about 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.

The stakes are high -- losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.

Some of Catalonia’s largest companies have moved their head offices out of the region and others were set to follow if he had declared independence.",Spain takes step toward direct rule over Catalonia's independence move,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CG15M

NEW DELHI/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - An Indian taxi company has stepped up its legal challenge against local competitor Ola and U.S. rival Uber, alleging the firms are abusing their market position, and believes that planned investments in both by Japan’s SoftBank underscore its view.

The head of India’s Meru Cabs said the company has filed four new complaints with the country’s antitrust watchdog, claiming that Uber and Ola are abusing their dominance in four different cities by burning vast sums of investor funds to distort the market.

“Even before there is any merger or alliance between the two through global investors, there is already a unified monopoly,” Meru’s CEO Nilesh Sangoi said.

Though Meru lost an earlier antitrust suit versus Ola, lawyers and industry sources said that moves by SoftBank - already a major investor in Ola - to pour some $10 billion into Uber along with other investors could strengthen the local cab service’s case.

Sangoi told Reuters that Uber and Ola have been altering driver incentives and passenger fares in tandem.

“Our existing cases get strengthened” with the SoftBank investment, he said, but added the Japanese firm’s plans weren’t cited in the latest complaints.

Ola, Uber and SoftBank declined to comment for this article. The new Meru complaints have not previously been reported.

Ola on Wednesday said it has raised $1.1 billion from investors led by China’s Tencent Holdings and SoftBank.

Ola operates in over 100 Indian cities and Uber in about 30, and both firms have burnt millions of dollars to lure riders and drivers in a bid to outdo each other.

DOMINANCE TEST

Meru was the only major organized player until a few years ago and currently operates in 24 cities. But it has no direct backing of large foreign investors and it has previously filed anti-competitive cases against Uber and Ola.

In July, the CCI ruled against Meru on its allegations that Ola was abusing its dominance in Bengaluru city’s taxi market. It ruled Uber too was a significant market player and there was no concept in current law to establish collective dominance of companies.

A Meru source said a SoftBank investment in both Uber and Ola may change that scenario.

An employee speaks over his phone as he sits at the front desk inside the office of Ola cab service in Gurugram, previously known as Gurgaon, on the outskirts of New Delhi, India, April 20, 2016. REUTERS/Anindito Mukherjee

Not everyone agrees, however.

Mohit Saraf, a senior partner at Indian law firm Luthra & Luthra, said while SoftBank’s Uber investment would spark antitrust issues in India, the CCI would need to assess whether Uber and Ola dominate the overall taxi market which is replete with local operators of yellow-and-black colored cabs.

Another source aware of the legal challenges said the CCI would need to delve into how much control SoftBank has at Ola and Uber, if the deal goes through, and the extent to which the Japanese firm has a say in their operations.

The antitrust cases in India, nevertheless, are set to further intensify the showdown between ride-hailing firms and local players in India’s $12 billion taxi market.

Uber is already bogged down by anti-monopoly concerns in neighboring China, where the commerce ministry last year began investigating its deal with Didi Chuxing that created a roughly $35 billion giant dominating the China car-hailing market.

Chinese media in July said the probe was ongoing.

SOFTBANK‘S RIDE-HAILING PLANS

SoftBank is poised to take two board seats at Uber should plans succeed to buy up shares from both existing investors and current and former employees in the coming weeks.

People close to the firm are divided on whether SoftBank wants to consolidate rivals or simply cross-pollinate lessons among the group. SoftBank aims to do one or the other, said an Uber investor who has held discussions with SoftBank.

SoftBank has previously failed to consolidate investments in India with its attempt to fold Snapdeal into Flipkart earlier this year falling apart in July.

SoftBank Vision Fund CEO Rajeev Misra recently told India’s Economic Times he hopes “to make peace” between Uber and Ola in the country.

A Singapore-based banker said SoftBank was playing a “high risk strategy” which could turn out to be very profitable if it works out.

BERLIN (Reuters) - A co-leader of Germany’s Greens, a possible partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s next government, said on Wednesday the next head of the Eurogroup should support a shift away from austerity and toward investment and more fiscal solidarity.

The Greens are set to start exploratory talks next week with Merkel’s conservatives on forming a coalition government that also includes the pro-business, fiscally hawkish Free Democrats (FDP) after an election in September.

Unlike the FDP, who have cautioned against proposals by French President Emmanuel Macron for deeper fiscal integration in the single currency bloc, the Greens support common tax collection and an investment pact within the 19-country euro zone.

In January, Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem will step down as president of the Eurogroup, an informal body that plays a key role in shaping the economic policy of the bloc. The group will vote for a new chairman at a meeting in December.

“The upcoming leadership switch at the Eurogroup should be used as an opportunity for a new start in European fiscal and economic policy,” Greens co-chief Simone Peter said in a statement.

“Europe will gain from more solidarity. Europe’s fiscal policy needs a shift away from austerity toward a common pact for tax collection and investments, which would trigger social and ecological innovations.”

Like his German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble, Dijsselbloem opposes so-called transfers from richer euro zone states to poorer ones like Greece.

“It would be good for Europe if the chairman of the Eurogroup holds the position of European Finance Minister who reports to the European Parliament,” Peter said.

“French President Macron has put good proposals on the table, which should be taken on by the next government and should not be torpedoed as former Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble did” to previous proposals.

Schaeuble has agreed to step down after the Sept. 24 election that weakened Merkel’s conservatives. He will become president of the German parliament.

FDP leader Christian Lindner last week called for a tougher stance on fiscal and euro zone policy, without yet making a bid for control of the finance ministry.",German Greens want anti-austerity Eurogroup head,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-politics-greens-euro-zone/german-greens-want-anti-austerity-eurogroup-head-idUKKBN1CG20P

MADRID (Reuters) - Barcelona are ready to mount a new bid for Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho in January, the club said on Wednesday.

O voto foi proferido durante julgamento pelo plenário do Supremo de uma ação movida por três partidos políticos, que terá repercussão direta no caso do senador Aécio Neves (PSDB-MG), afastado do Senado há duas semanas pela Primeira Turma do STF.

Em seu voto, o relator da ação votou no sentido de que a ação dos partidos PP, PSC e Solidariedade em busca de considerar ilegal a adoção de medidas cautelares exclusivamente pelo Judiciário é totalmente improcedente.

Fachin afirmou que é “evidentemente inaplicável” que a adoção de medidas cautelares seja submetida ao crivo da Câmara dos Deputados ou do Senado. “Entendo que é evidentemente inaplicável para medidas cautelares penais”, disse o relator da ação.

Para o ministro do Supremo, há uma “marcante e significativa diferença” entre a possibilidade de que os parlamentares sustem uma decisão do Supremo, nos casos da prisão em flagrante por crime inafiançável ou em situações de perda de mandato, de uma eventual adoção de medida cautelar determinada pela Corte.

Os partidos autores da ação pretendem que decisões do STF com aplicação de medidas cautelares contra parlamentares sejam enviadas para a Câmara ou Senado a fim de que os parlamentares decidam em até 24 horas sobre a sua aplicação, conforme previsto expressamente na Constituição para o caso de prisão em flagrante de parlamentar por crime inafiançável.

Fachin observou que não se pode ter uma “interpretação extensiva” nos casos de imposição de medidas cautelares porque não há previsão na Constituição. O relator argumentou ainda que isso não significa qualquer tipo de fragilização das prerrogativas do mandato de um parlamentar.

No voto, o ministro do STF também destacou que uma eventual submissão de decisões em medidas cautelares determinadas pelo Poder Judiciário significaria uma ampliação da imunidade do parlamentar sem respaldo legal. “É uma ofensa ao postulado republicano e uma ofensa à Constituição”, avaliou.

Logo após o voto de Fachin, a presidente do Supremo, Cármen Lúcia, decidiu suspender o julgamento para ser retomado no início da tarde a partir do voto dos demais ministros da Corte.

A expectativa é que a maioria do STF concorde com a adoção de medidas cautelares, desde que a Câmara ou o Senado avalize a decisão posteriormente. Seria uma solução intermediária entre a proibição total de o Judiciário afastar parlamentares ou a permissão para esse Poder tomar esse tipo de decisão mesmo sem o aval do Legislativo.

Após a posição da Primeira Turma de afastar Aécio, o Senado ensaiou entrar em confronto com o Supremo ao votar, em plenário, um requerimento para reverter a medida. Mas os presidente da Casa, Eunício Oliveira (PMDB-CE), e do STF, Cármen Lúcia, entraram em campo na busca de uma solução para o impasse.",Fachin vota a favor de STF decretar medidas cautelares contra parlamentares sem aval do Congresso,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idBRKBN1CG1ZA-OBRDN

(Reuters) - Nick Kyrgios said a stomach bug and a shoulder problem had forced him to retire after losing the first set in his Shanghai Masters first-round match against American Steve Johnson on Tuesday.

The mercurial Australian, who lost to Rafa Nadal in the China Open final on Sunday, took a 4-2 lead in the tiebreak before Johnson fired a series of winners to take the set 7-6(5).

Kyrgios then ran up to his opponent, shook his hand and walked off court to boos from the crowd, leaving Johnson and chair umpire Fergus Murphy confused.

Local media reported that Kyrgios received two code violations during the set and was docked a point in the tiebreak.

Reports also said he told officials he would quit if he lost the set, but Kyrgios took to Twitter to apologize to his fans.

“I’ve been battling a stomach bug for the past 24 hours and I tried to be ready but I was really struggling on the court today which I think was pretty evident from the first point,” Kyrgios said.

“My shoulder started to hurt in the practice which didn’t help either and once I lost the first set I was just not strong enough to continue because I’ve not eaten much in the past 24 hours,” he added.

”I‘m hoping to be okay for the doubles and will make a decision tomorrow morning, hopefully off of a good night’s sleep which I didn’t get last night.

“I‘m gutted to be honest to be honest as I was keen to keep the good momentum that I built in Beijing going and finish the year strong. I’ll do what I can to make sure I do.”

Kyrgios was fined $16,500 by the ATP last year for deliberately throwing a game away during his second-round defeat by Mischa Zverev in Shanghai.

(Reuters) - Wall Street’s main indexes were little changed at open on Wednesday, as a jump in shares of consumer staples were offset by a drop in financials on the eve of their financial reports.

Kroger (KR.N) rose nearly 7 percent after the grocery chain said it would explore a potential sale of its convenience stores business.

That led the consumer staples index .SPLRCS up 0.36 percent. But those gains were offset by a 0.5 percent drop in financials.

Wall Street banks JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) both report on Thursday. But, analysts warn bank results will be held back by a lack of volatility compared to a year ago.

“Third quarter results of large banks are expected to be tepid,” said Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research. “Trading revenue (will be) down due to low volatility and loan growth remaining flat to slightly negative.”

With the S&P 500 up 14 percent in 2017, investors are betting on strong earnings growth across the S&P 500.

“It’s only a question of valuations, if they’ve gotten a little bit ahead of themselves, even though the earnings story remains positive,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

“Time will tell.”

At 9:36 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 4.04 points, or 0.02 percent, at 22,834.72, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 0.73 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,549.91 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 4.12 points, or 0.06 percent, at 6,583.13.

The dollar .DXY dipped to a 12-day low on worries that a feud with influential Tennessee Senator Bob Corker would undermine President Donald Trump’s efforts to pass tax changes.

FED AHEAD

Of interest will be minutes, due at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), of the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting, when it left interest rates unchanged but signaled one more hike was still on the cards by the end of 2017.

Worried by signs the U.S. economy had peaked, the Fed has slowed since raising rates twice within three months at the start of this year.

“There may not be any new information, but the market will be susceptible to any sort of negative headline that might come out,” Brown said.

Seven of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher.

General Electric (GE.N) slipped about 1 percent after JPMorgan said a dividend cut was “increasingly likely” and cut its price target on the stock.

J&J (JNJ.N) rose 1.5 percent after Jefferies upgraded the stock to “buy”.

Micron Technology (MU.O) dipped 1.17 percent after launching a $1 billion stock offering to cut debt.

REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three congressional committees are scuffling over a former British spy’s reports that are central to investigations into U.S. allegations that Russia tried to help Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, people involved in the inquiries said.

The dossier assembled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele outlined Russian financial and personal links to Trump’s campaign and associates. The Senate Intelligence Committee and special counsel Robert Mueller are looking into possible collusion between Russia and Trump’s campaign and Mueller’s investigators have met with Steele.

However, the Republican chairmen of the House Intelligence and Senate Judiciary committees are challenging the dossier’s credibility and one has implied that Russians may have played a role in its preparation, sources familiar with the inquiries said.

The duel is not purely partisan. Senator Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Mark Warner, the committee’s ranking Democrat, are leading what other committee members from both parties called a serious effort to pursue the allegations dug up by Steele.

“As I understand it, a good deal of his information remains unproven, but none of it has been disproven, and considerable amounts of it have been proven,” Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an interview with Reuters. He did not elaborate.

Russia has repeatedly denied any interference in last November’s election won by businessman Trump, a Republican, against Democrat and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign or associates.

In a report published in January four U.S. intelligence agencies said they took the dossier’s allegations seriously.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley has been the harshest public critic of Steele, suggesting that Russia might have somehow had influence with Fusion GPS, the U.S. opposition research firm that hired Steele, and that they may have broken U.S. law.

The dossier was first commissioned on behalf of Trump opponents in the Republican primary and then Democrats took it up when Trump became the presidential nominee. Steele met with FBI representatives before the election to discuss his findings.

In a March 6 letter to then-FBI Director James Comey, Grassley wrote: “The idea that the FBI and associates of the Clinton campaign would pay Mr. Steele to investigate the Republican nominee for president in the run-up to the election raises further questions about the FBI’s independence from politics, as well as the Obama administration’s use of law enforcement and intelligence agencies for political ends.”

FILE PHOTO - Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) gives an update on the ongoing investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election at the Capitol Building in Washington, U.S., October 4, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein

Whitehouse, however, said that a July 27 Judiciary Committee hearing called by Grassley was part of a Republican effort to discredit Steele by creating “confusion” and the false impression that Russia paid Steele for the dossier.

“It could not have been clearer that there is no evidence of any Russian role behind the Steele dossier,” Whitehouse said.

A Judiciary Committee aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: “The American people need to be able to trust that the FBI and Justice Department are operating free from political influence. That’s what this investigation is about, and we will follow the facts wherever they lead.”

Despite recusing himself in April from the House Intelligence Committee investigation, the Republican chairman, Devin Nunes, is also trying to discredit Steele’s work, sources familiar with the probe said.

FILE PHOTO - Ranking Member Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) speaks at a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism hearing about Russian election interference on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S. March 15, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein

On Tuesday, Nunes subpoenaed the partners who run Fusion GPS, the U.S. opposition research firm that hired Steele, a source familiar with the matter said.

“This is a blatant attempt to undermine the reporting of the so-called ‘dossier,’ even as its core conclusion of a broad campaign by the Russian government to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election has been confirmed by the U.S. intelligence community and is now widely accepted as fact,” Joshua Levy, counsel to Fusion GPS, said in a statement.

Committee Democrat Eric Swalwell also fired back, saying Nunes told Congress he had recused himself and that issuing the subpoenas would violate that recusal.

“It is also a way to go it alone, not work with Democrats, and it looks like he is trying to again undermine the investigation,” Swalwell said.

Nunes also used his power last month to issue subpoenas to the FBI and Justice Department, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, demanding that they surrender their files on Steele, his dossier, and their investigations into his work.

So far, the Justice Department and FBI have not turned over the information Nunes requested because of the FBI investigation, which is supervised by special counsel Mueller.

Sally Ann Johnson, 41, for more than seven years provided what she described as healing services to a resident of the island of Martha’s Vineyard, who was more than 70 years old when she first met the spiritual healer, according to court papers.

Johnson, who ran businesses including Psychic Match Inc and Flatiron Psychic, admitted in Boston federal court that she tried to impede the administration of tax laws.

Johnson, who told the court she never passed the second grade, called herself a Romani “spiritual consultant.” She said in court she had not paid taxes in connection with the money she received as income as well as a gift.

“I honestly did not do the right thing,” she said.

Johnson, who has resided in New York, Florida, Illinois and at times Massachusetts, faces up to three years in prison.

She is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 17. Her lawyers declined to comment.

According to court papers, Johnson at various times lived with the unnamed woman on Martha’s Vineyard, a favorite vacation spot for the rich and famous.

In an effort to evade the IRS’s scrutiny, Johnson, using the alias Angela Johnson, directed the woman to make payments in the name of Sally Johnson and another of her businesses, Stones of the World, charging papers said.

Johnson directed the woman to wire payments to three different bank accounts including one in the name of an associate who used at least two aliases, court papers said.

Johnson made significant cash withdrawals from those accounts and also accrued charges on a credit card held in the woman’s name, according to charging documents.",Exorcism excise: U.S. psychic pleads guilty to $3.5 million tax evasion,https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKBN1CA2LA

CWU and Royal Mail have been embroiled in a dispute over the British postal company’s plans to replace its defined benefit pension scheme, a move intended to prevent its annual contributions from ballooning to over 1 billion pounds by 2018.

Around 90,000 Royal Mail workers are in the plan, whose closure to new members in 2008 resulted in about 40,000 workers joining a less generous defined contribution plan.

CWU, which has over 100,000 members in Royal Mail, has argued that company’s move to replace the scheme would result in members losing, on average, up to a third of their future pensions.

Both sides have failed to agree on new pension terms since April, and CWU said last week that members would start a 48-hour strike on Oct. 19 that analysts and experts say could cause major disruptions to deliveries.

Royal Mail responded by saying it would use all legal options at its disposal to halt the strike. The group on Monday sought a High Court injunction so that the contractual external mediation process could be followed.

On Wednesday, a Royal Mail spokesman told Reuters that the court was yet to confirm the hearing date.

Nevertheless Moldova this year introduced a new electoral law that a pan-European rights body ruled could make the system more susceptible to undue influence by vested interests.

Moldova’s economy grew 4.1 percent last year, recovering from a contraction of 0.4 percent in 2015 due in part to an economic crisis in nearby Russia that hit exports and remittances from Moldovans working there.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks set a record high on Wednesday, as relief that Catalonia had put off any plans to break away from Spain followed a two-decade peak for Asia’s biggest share market and more upbeat predictions for the global economy.

Spanish stocks and bonds rallied and the euro reached a two-week high in early European trading after Catalonia’s leader, Carles Puigdemont, declined to make a formal declaration of independence on Tuesday. That disappointed many pro-independence supporters but pleased financial markets.

A 1.5 percent jump in Spain's IBEX .IBEX helped MSCI's 47-country world stocks index .MIWD00000PUS touch a record high.

The biggest surge came from Spanish banks, which rallied as much as 4 percent .IBEXIB. Spanish government bond yields - a gauge of political tension - saw their second-biggest decline in a month [GVD/EUR].

“There was a chance Puigdemont would have made a decisive declaration, so now yields are dropping because there is room for negotiation left,” said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk.

The euro climbed as high as $1.18345 against the dollar, a two-week top. The U.S. currency was down for a fourth day running and on its worst run since July.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s feud with Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, an influential fellow Republican, has raised concern that Trump’s proposed tax-code overhaul would fail .

“Squabbles surrounding Trump’s efforts come as no surprise, but it is still not helping the dollar,” said Yukio Izhizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.

The early Spanish gains bolstered already-confident markets. The International Monetary Fund pushed up its forecasts for global growth on Tuesday, helping Wall Street to its latest record high.

Asian shares then climbed to their highest in a decade as Japan's Nikkei .N225 reached its strongest since 1996, despite more losses for scandal-hit Kobe Steel (5406.T) [.T]. South Korean stocks .KOPSI reached a new record top.

“A risk-on mood has set in and money is flowing out of bond funds into equities funds,” said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management.

“One of the biggest drivers of global equities is the United States, and some of the macro data coming out from there has been quite positive. There is also this view that China is traveling much better than many people had expected.”

FED MINUTES

The dollar was under pressure amid uncertainty over who will be the next Federal Reserve chair, with the predictions market site, PredictIt, favoring Fed Governor Jerome Powell as the most likely candidate.

Powell is regarded as more hawkish than incumbent Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February, but analysts say he probably wouldn’t look to unwind stimulus as aggressively as some of the candidates on the list.

Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan, who votes this year on Fed policy, had also said overnight that he wants to see more signs of upward inflation before raising interest rates again.

The weaker dollar helped commodities and emerging markets, which borrow heavily in the U.S. currency.

Emerging market stocks sailed to six-year highs. U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 42 cents to $51.34 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 added 25 cents to $56.86, on signs of tighter supply.

BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - European countries are scrambling to cobble together a package of measures they hope will keep the Iran nuclear deal on track if U.S. President Donald Trump ignores their pleas and decertifies the landmark 2015 agreement this week.

The package would include a strong statement backing the deal by European powers, together with efforts to lobby the U.S. Congress and put wider pressure on Iran, officials said.

But without strong U.S. support for the deal, senior officials in Berlin, Paris and London say it may be only a matter of time before the pact between Tehran and six world powers unravels, with grave consequences for Middle East security, nonproliferation efforts and transatlantic ties.

The two-year-old agreement, under which Iran agreed to freeze its nuclear program for 15 years in exchange for sanctions relief, is viewed in Europe as a rare triumph of international diplomacy in the Middle East.

As tensions over North Korea’s nuclear activities risk boiling over into all-out war, any move by the United States to undermine the Iran deal is seen in Europe as utter folly.

European capitals have been delivering this message to the White House and Congress in one of the most intense lobbying campaigns in recent memory. In the past weeks, European ambassadors have met dozens of U.S. lawmakers. And on Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May lobbied Trump by phone.

Despite this, Trump is expected declare this week that Iran is not complying with the pact. He is also due to unveil a tough new strategy toward Iran - including designating its Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization - that could sink the deal.

“If the feeling is the United States no longer supports the agreement then the political reality is that the deal will be in serious jeopardy and its implementation will be very difficult,” a senior French diplomat told Reuters.

A decision by Trump to decertify would not automatically kill the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The expectation is that Trump would kick the ball to Congress, which would then have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions lifted as part of the JCPOA.

THREE-PRONGED RESPONSE

European officials said they were preparing a three-pronged strategy if this does occur.

First, Berlin, London and Paris would issue statements reaffirming their commitment to the deal.

Second, they would redouble efforts to lobby Congress, which appears keen to keep the deal, against any rash moves.

And third, they would present measures to pressure Iran over its ballistic missile program and destabilizing policies in the Middle East -- areas that fall outside the narrowly-focused nuclear deal.

French President Emmanuel Macron alluded to this at the United Nations last month. Diplomats said the package was still in the works and they had not yet briefed Brussels on it.

With the third step, the Europeans hope to build a bridge to Washington while keeping the JCPOA intact. But a German diplomat said ratcheting up pressure on Tehran was like walking a tightrope: push too hard and the whole deal could fall apart.

“We all knew the JCPOA wasn’t perfect, but by calling its benefits into question I see us only losing,” said a senior European diplomat who has been involved in negotiations with Iran since 2003, well before Washington joined the talks under President Barack Obama.

If Trump follows through on his threats it will be the second time in four months that he has distanced the United States from a major multilateral agreement despite intense lobbying by partners and members of his own cabinet.

But in Europe, the Iran move would be seen as far more damaging than Trump’s decision in June to pull out of the Paris climate accord.

“The threat from Iran in terms of nuclear proliferation is more immediate. This is far more dangerous,” said Elmar Brok, a veteran foreign policy expert in the European Parliament and party ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

European officials and analysts fear a breakdown of the JCPOA could lead to an arms race in the Middle East, a military conflict between Iran and Israel and an escalation of regional proxy wars between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

They fear it would also doom any chances, no matter how slim, for a negotiated deal with North Korea.

ALL ABOUT WAR

“At the end of the day it’s all about the risk of war,” said Francois Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

There is also the danger of a further deterioration in transatlantic ties, especially if Washington targets European firms that do business in Iran.

Were that to happen, the EU ambassador to Washington, David O‘Sullivan, has said Brussels would revert to a 1990s-era law that shields European companies from extraterritorial sanctions.

Even if the EU were to take such a step, the senior French diplomat said European companies could think twice about their Iran commitments.

Among firms that have announced big deals in Iran since the JCPOA went into force are planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA), French energy group Total (TOTF.PA) and Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE).

“One of the big difficulties of the agreement is ensuring the economic operators have confidence in the system and key to that is confidence in the United States,” the diplomat said.

Any signs that European companies are pulling back could prompt the Iranians to reassess the merits of the nuclear deal.

“The agreement with Iran is like a delicate plant,” said Omid Nouripour, an Iranian-born lawmaker with the German Greens party, which is expected to be part of Merkel’s next coalition government.

“It is a sign of what diplomacy can achieve but it is fragile. The American president doesn’t appear to believe in diplomacy. He seems intent on crushing this plant.”","Fearing Trump torpedo, Europe scrambles to save Iran deal",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-europe/fearing-trump-torpedo-europe-scrambles-to-save-iran-deal-idUSKBN1CG1XY

Dies sei “nicht vertrauensbildend und keine Grundlage für gute und vertrauliche Verhandlungen”. Union wie FDP betonten zugleich ihre Differenzen mit den Grünen.

Nach Ansicht Kubickis, der in Schleswig-Holstein im Frühjahr eine Jamaika-Koalition mitverhandelt hat, sind Sondierungsgespräche im kleinen Kreis nötig. “Sonst wird es schwer, eine vernünftige Grundlage zu finden.” CDU und CSU wollen in die Gespräche insgesamt 28 Politiker entsenden, die Grünen 14. Aus der FDP hieß es, man halte dies nicht für klug. Den Liberalen schwebten Delegationen mit einer Handvoll oder einem halben Dutzend Unterhändler vor. Die FDP will ihr Verhandlungsteam spätestens bei den Gremiensitzungen am Montag festlegen.

FDP-Chef Christian Lindner sagte in Wien, ein “Teambuilding” oder dergleichen gebe es mit den Grünen bislang nicht. Es handele sich bei ihnen um einen respektierten Partner und Wettbewerber, der fundamental andere Auffassungen habe. So wollten sie 2030 den Verbrennungsmotor verbieten, obwohl ökologisch gar nicht sicher sei, dass ein Elektromotor überzeugender sei. “Leider haben die Grünen die Neigung, nicht nur das Ziel vorzugeben, sondern mit Subventionen und Verboten, Steuern, Gesetzen und Bürokratismus auch noch den Weg bestimmen zu wollen”, sagte Lindner.

CSU-Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt sagte den Zeitungen der “Funke”-Mediengruppe, die Grünen müssten akzeptieren, dass ihre Chance darin bestehe, einer bürgerlichen Regierung von CDU, CSU und FDP beizutreten. Er fügte hinzu: “Wir werden keine linken Spinnereien dulden.” Göring-Eckardt entgegnete: “Wir lassen uns davon nicht provozieren, aber wir werden das im ersten Gespräch in der nächsten Woche ansprechen.” Damit es überhaupt zu einer Jamaika-Koalition kommen könne, sei die gegenseitige Anerkennung der jeweils unterschiedlichen Identität eine elementare Grundvoraussetzung, sagte sie den Funke-Zeitungen. “Es ist nicht besonders klug, über die Identität möglicher zukünftiger Partner noch vor dem ersten gemeinsamen Gespräch herzuziehen.”

Dobrindt sagte, eine Schnittmenge zwischen den Wahlprogrammen der Grünen und der Unionsparteien sei fast nicht vorhanden. Im Augenblick sei man weit weg von einem positiven Ergebnis. Kubicki lehnte eine zeitliche Rücksichtnahme auf die Union bei den Verhandlungen strikt ab. “Nur weil die Union drei Wochen vertrödelt hat, werden wir uns nicht treiben lassen”, sagte er dem Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND).

NEW DELHI/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Indian taxi company Meru Cabs has stepped up its legal challenge against local competitor Ola and U.S. rival Uber, alleging the firms are abusing their market position, and believes that planned investments in both by Japan’s SoftBank underscore its view.

The head of Meru Cabs said the company has filed four new complaints with the country’s antitrust watchdog, claiming that Uber and Ola are abusing their dominance in four different cities by burning vast sums of investor funds to distort the market.

“Even before there is any merger or alliance between the two through global investors, there is already a unified monopoly,” Meru’s CEO Nilesh Sangoi said.

Though Meru lost an earlier antitrust suit versus Ola, lawyers and industry sources said that moves by SoftBank - already a major investor in Ola - to pour some $10 billion into Uber along with other investors could strengthen the local cab service’s case.

Sangoi told Reuters that Uber and Ola have been altering driver incentives and passenger fares in tandem.

“Our existing cases get strengthened” with the SoftBank investment, he said, but added the Japanese firm’s plans weren’t cited in the latest complaints.

Ola, Uber and SoftBank declined to comment for this article. The new Meru complaints have not previously been reported.

Ola on Wednesday said it has raised $1.1 billion from investors led by China’s Tencent Holdings and SoftBank.

Ola operates in over 100 Indian cities and Uber in about 30, and both firms have burnt millions of dollars to lure riders and drivers in a bid to outdo each other.

DOMINANCE TEST

Meru was the only major organized player until a few years ago and currently operates in 24 cities. But it has no direct backing of large foreign investors and it has previously filed anti-competitive cases against Uber and Ola.

In July, the CCI ruled against Meru on its allegations that Ola was abusing its dominance in Bengaluru city’s taxi market. It ruled Uber too was a significant market player and there was no concept in current law to establish collective dominance of companies.

A Meru source said a SoftBank investment in both Uber and Ola may change that scenario.

Not everyone agrees, however.

Mohit Saraf, a senior partner at Indian law firm Luthra & Luthra, said while SoftBank’s Uber investment would spark antitrust issues in India, the CCI would need to assess whether Uber and Ola dominate the overall taxi market which is replete with local operators of yellow-and-black coloured cabs.

Another source aware of the legal challenges said the CCI would need to delve into how much control SoftBank has at Ola and Uber, if the deal goes through, and the extent to which the Japanese firm has a say in their operations.

The antitrust cases in India, nevertheless, are set to further intensify the showdown between ride-hailing firms and local players in India’s $12 billion taxi market.

Uber is already bogged down by anti-monopoly concerns in neighbouring China, where the commerce ministry last year began investigating its deal with Didi Chuxing that created a roughly $35 billion giant dominating the China car-hailing market.

Chinese media in July said the probe was ongoing.

SOFTBANK‘S RIDE-HAILING PLANS

SoftBank is poised to take two board seats at Uber should plans succeed to buy up shares from both existing investors and current and former employees in the coming weeks.

People close to the firm are divided on whether SoftBank wants to consolidate rivals or simply cross-pollinate lessons among the group. SoftBank aims to do one or the other, said an Uber investor who has held discussions with SoftBank.

SoftBank has previously failed to consolidate investments in India with its attempt to fold Snapdeal into Flipkart earlier this year falling apart in July.

SoftBank Vision Fund CEO Rajeev Misra recently told India’s Economic Times he hopes “to make peace” between Uber and Ola in the country.

A Singapore-based banker said SoftBank was playing a “high risk strategy” which could turn out to be very profitable if it works out.

LA RISPOSTA DEL GOVERNO

** Il premier spagnolo Mariano Rajoy ha convocato per oggi una riunione d‘emergenza dell‘esecutivo per decidere la risposta del governo centrale alla dichiarazione. Ieri serra Rajoy ha avuto un incontro con il leader socialista Pedro Sanchez.

** Rajoy potrebbe fare ricorso alla cosiddetta ‘opzione nucleare’, l‘articolo della costituzione spagnola che permette di rimuovere il governo locale e indire nuove elezioni.

** Prima di tale opzione, mai utilizzata prima, il governo Rajoy potrebbe chiedere un voto parlamentare per provare a persuadere Puigdemont ad abbandonare la strada indipendentista.

** Un discorso di Rajoy è in agenda oggi alle 16,00 durante una sessione straordinaria del parlamento spagnolo.

** Qualunque strada scelga, Rajoy sarà probabilmente oggetto di critiche, per aver usato il pugno di ferro oppure per non aver reagito in maniera abbastanza dura contro i separatisti.

** Un‘ulteriore possibilità è che nella partita entri la magistratura, chiamando Puigdemont e altri politici a Madrid a deporre.

DIALOGO

** Al momento un vero dialogo tra l‘autorità centrale e quella catalana per la risoluzione della crisi rimane altamente improbabile.

** Puigdemont e altri politici regionali hanno firmato ieri un documento in cui si proclama la “piena sovranità” per la Catalogna, anche se non è chiaro se l‘iniziativa abbia un qualche valore legale.

** Puigdemont ha annunciato che gli effetti della dichiarazione di indipendenza della Catalogna sono al momento sospesi per concedere tempo al dialogo.

** Il governo centrale ha tuttavia risposto immediatamente che ogni forma di dialogo dovrà avvenire “entro la legge” e che Puigdemont non ha titoli per chiedere colloqui.

** Nel frattempo il Cup (Candidatura d‘Unitat Popular) -- partito anticapitalista di estrema sinistra che fa parte del fronte indipendentista e della maggioranza che sostiene Puigdemont -- ha dichiarato che ora la palla è nel campo di Madrid e che sta a Rajoy fare un passo nella loro direzione.

DICHIARAZIONE FORMALE D‘INDIPENDENZA

** La dichiarazione d‘indipendenza di ieri è largamente simbolica in quanto non è stata formalmente avallata dal parlamento regionale.

** Il Cup, la cui influenza politica è ampiamente superiore rispetto alle limitate dimensioni del partito, insiste che si tenga il voto del parlamento regionale, come previsto dalla legge catalana.

** Il Cup ha per ora confermato il proprio appoggio al governo regionale ma ha posto un limite di un mese per i colloqui.

** Nel caso in cui i colloqui non dovessero partire, il Cup e Junts pel Si (Uniti per il Sì), un altro dei partito pro indipendenza, chiederanno probabilmente al parlamento di Barcellona di approvare formalmente la dichiarazione di indipendenza di ieri.

** Tale dichiarazione verrebbe immediatamente bloccata dalla Corte costituzionale spagnola e obbligherebbe il governo di Madrid a inasprire ulteriormente la propria risposta legale e politica alla crisi.

ELEZIONI REGIONALI

** Se i colloqui non si svolgeranno e la dichiarazione d‘indipendenza verrà messa al voto del parlamento catalano, il Cup ritirerà il proprio sostengo al governo locale, facendo scattare nuove elezioni nella regione.

** A indire nuove elezioni potrebbe essere anche lo stesso Puigdemont, con lo scopo di rafforzare la propria posizione, attualmente indebolita, o il governo di Madrid, se riterrà che Puigdemont e le autorità catalane abbiano oltrepassato il segno, ad esempio chiedendo la dichiarazione di indipendenza formale da parte del parlamento.

Entre as opções possíveis, a ministra afirmou que estão na mesa hipóteses como o enquadramento de parte da dívida de mais de 10 bilhões de reais da Oi com a Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel) nas regras de financiamento previstas na Medida Provisória 780, o chamado Refis das autarquias.

LONDON (Reuters) - Workers at Bombardier’s Northern Irish plant called on British Prime Minister Theresa May to be more visible in her attempts to save their jobs after the United States imposed tariffs on planes made by the Canadian aerospace firm.

The United States has backed a complaint brought by Boeing (BA.N) that Bombardier (BBDb.TO) received illegal subsidies and dumped planes at “absurdly low” prices, imposing duties of nearly 300 percent on its C-series aircraft.

Britain is confident that it can successfully fight the ruling, which jeopardizes some 4,200 jobs in Northern Ireland, where it is the biggest manufacturing employer.

“We do feel that the levies that are put on are unfair and will be detrimental to jobs in Northern Ireland,” Ron McDowell, 42, who has been an aerospace fitter for 25 years, told Reuters outside parliament in London, where workers had gathered for a protest.

“What we want is for Theresa May to come out publicly rather than speaking behind closed doors.”

McDowell was one of around 20 protesters who stood behind a sign saying “Back Bombardier: Defend our jobs, skills and communities.”

May and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed Bombardier in a call on Tuesday, after business secretary Greg Clark outlined to lawmakers the government’s case against the suit.

Britain and the trade union Unite argue that Boeing’s case is without merit because it does not make a plane comparable to Bombardier’s C-series.

May has emphasized the strength of Britain’s alliance with the United States since Trump came to power as it prepares to leave the European Union, its biggest trading partner.

However, Jimmy Kelly of the Unite union said the dispute emphasized how Trump’s protectionist policies might undermine May’s hopes for a good trading relationship.

“I just don’t fall for Theresa May saying ‘well I’ve contacted Donald Trump’ and ‘I’ve phoned Donald Trump’. He’s parroting ‘USA, USA, USA’. And post-Brexit, why would he be changing his tune?” he said.

Reuters analysis of federal jobs data shows that out of 656,000 new manufacturing jobs created between 2010 and 2014, two thirds can be attributed to foreign direct investment.

More recent jobs numbers are not yet available, but over $700 billion in foreign capital has poured in over the last two years bringing total foreign investment to $3.7 trillion at the end of 2016, a world record.

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks set a record high on Wednesday, as relief that Catalonia had put off any plans to break away from Spain followed a two-decade peak for Asia’s biggest share market and more upbeat predictions for the global economy.

Spanish stocks and bonds rallied and the euro reached a two-week high in early European trading after Catalonia’s leader, Carles Puigdemont, declined to make a formal declaration of independence on Tuesday. That disappointed many pro-independence supporters but pleased financial markets.

A 1.5 percent jump in Spain's IBEX .IBEX helped MSCI's 47-country world stocks index .MIWD00000PUS touch a record high.

The biggest surge came from Spanish banks, which rallied as much as 4 percent .IBEXIB. Spanish government bond yields - a gauge of political tension - saw their second-biggest decline in a month [GVD/EUR].

“There was a chance Puigdemont would have made a decisive declaration, so now yields are dropping because there is room for negotiation left,” said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk.

The euro climbed as high as $1.18345 against the dollar, a two-week top. The U.S. currency was down for a fourth day running and on its worst run since July.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s feud with Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, an influential fellow Republican, has raised concern that Trump’s proposed tax-code overhaul would fail .

“Squabbles surrounding Trump’s efforts come as no surprise, but it is still not helping the dollar,” said Yukio Izhizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.

The early Spanish gains bolstered already-confident markets. The International Monetary Fund pushed up its forecasts for global growth on Tuesday, helping Wall Street to its latest record high.

Asian shares then climbed to their highest in a decade as Japan's Nikkei .N225 reached its strongest since 1996, despite more losses for scandal-hit Kobe Steel (5406.T) [.T]. South Korean stocks .KOPSI reached a new record top.

“A risk-on mood has set in and money is flowing out of bond funds into equities funds,” said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management.

“One of the biggest drivers of global equities is the United States, and some of the macro data coming out from there has been quite positive. There is also this view that China is traveling much better than many people had expected.”

FED MINUTES

The dollar was under pressure amid uncertainty over who will be the next Federal Reserve chair, with the predictions market site, PredictIt, favoring Fed Governor Jerome Powell as the most likely candidate.

Powell is regarded as more hawkish than incumbent Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February, but analysts say he probably wouldn’t look to unwind stimulus as aggressively as some of the candidates on the list.

Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan, who votes this year on Fed policy, had also said overnight that he wants to see more signs of upward inflation before raising interest rates again.

The weaker dollar helped commodities and emerging markets, which borrow heavily in the U.S. currency.

Emerging market stocks sailed to six-year highs. U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 42 cents to $51.34 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 added 25 cents to $56.86, on signs of tighter supply.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Software produced by Microsoft Corp has been acquired by state organizations and firms in Russia and Crimea despite sanctions barring U.S-based companies from doing business with them, official documents show.

The acquisitions, registered on the Russian state procurement database, show the limitations in the way foreign governments and firms enforce the U.S. sanctions, imposed on Russia over its annexation of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.

Some of the users gave Microsoft fictitious data about their identity, people involved in the transactions told Reuters, exploiting a gap in the U.S. company’s ability to keep its products out of their hands.

The products in each case were sold via third parties and Reuters has no evidence that Microsoft sold products directly to entities hit by the sanctions.

“Microsoft has a strong commitment to complying with legal requirements and we have been looking into this matter in recent weeks,” a Microsoft representative said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters.

“We have robust trade compliance processes around the world to help ensure that our partners comply with all conditions including immediate halting of suspected improper sales by partners, and strong measures to try to prevent banned customers from accessing and using our products and services.”

All state organizations and state firms are obliged to disclose purchases they make on the procurement database. People involved in five of the transactions confirmed to Reuters the software had been acquired.

The Reuters review of the database found state entities in Russia and Crimea that are subject to sanctions have acquired more than 5,000 Microsoft products worth about 60 million rubles ($1.03 million).

The sum is relatively small but such software is vital for many firms and organizations in Russia and Crimea to operate. The database also does not include private companies, so the scale of the problem could be much bigger.

Related Coverage Factbox: Entities subject to sanctions that bought Microsoft products

Among entities hit by sanctions that acquired Microsoft products was Almaz-Antey, manufacturer of the BUK surface-to-air missile. Dutch prosecutors say a BUK missile brought down a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet over east Ukraine in July 2014, though Russia denies its forces shot down the plane.

Other Microsoft buyers, the database shows, include Glavgosexpertiza, a state design agency involved in work on a new bridge from Russia to Crimea and the “Krym” health spa in Crimea owned by Russia’s defense ministry.

The arms manufacturer, Almaz-Antey, did not respond to a request for comment. The defense ministry’s health spa in Crimea declined to comment. Glavgosexpertiza said “the company operates within the Russian legal framework”.

COMPLIANCE CRACKDOWN

One set of U.S. sanctions prohibits the export by a U.S. entity of any goods, services or technology to Crimea.

Other sanctions bar U.S firms from carrying out transactions with companies or individuals on a list of “specially designated nationals” deemed by Washington to be linked to the Russian government and its activities in Ukraine.

Microsoft did not directly respond to detailed questions about specific users of its products and the compliance procedures it has in place.

The products acquired by organizations hit by sanctions include “Open License Program” services, where the user must provide Microsoft with the company’s full name and address.

Almaz-Antey, Glavgosexpertiza and the defense ministry spa acquired “Open License Program” products, the database showed.

After the sanctions were introduced, Microsoft took steps to prevent entities hit by sanctions acquiring its products, according to five sources involved in the software re-selling trade and a former Microsoft employee in Russia.

But people involved in transactions say ways can be found to circumvent obstacles.

The “Morye” shipyard, based in Crimea, bought 150 Windows Server, SQL Server and Office licenses in June 2016 from OOO Web-Potok, a firm registered in Moscow, the procurement database shows. All the products were “Open License Program” services.

The shipyard fell under the general prohibition on transactions by U.S. firms with entities in Crimea and is now on the “special designated nationals” list.

“If we bought directly from Microsoft, there would be sanctions,” a shipyard employee, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said by telephone. “But there were no problems with (buying third-party from) Russian firms.”

The shipyard declined to comment. Reuters called telephone numbers listed for the supplier, OOO Web-Potok, but the people who answered said they worked for a different company.

Another way to circumvent the restrictions on Crimea-based entities is for the user, when registering the product with Microsoft, not to provide a Crimean address, three people involved in the trade said.

They said addresses in Russia’s Krasnodar region, across the Kerch Strait from Crimea, were commonly used instead.

A supplier who worked with a company on the U.S. “specially designated nationals” list said a supplier and a client could circumvent restrictions by registering Microsoft products to a subsidiary or parent company of the end user.","Exclusive: Despite sanctions, Russian organizations acquire Microsoft software",https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-russia-microsoft/exclusive-despite-sanctions-russian-organisations-acquire-microsoft-software-idINKBN1CG0PL

BOSTON (Reuters) - Mitch Golden scrutinizes hedge fund managers and their investment ideas in a variety of settings from the back of a motor scooter in Ho Chi Minh City to a park bench in New York’s Central Park. The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Slideshow (2 Images)

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

“It is nice that I get to have someone like David Einhorn and other members of the investment team pick apart their ideas,” he said.",Scooters instead of boardroom 'kabuki': how one fund manager picks winners,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-greenlightmasters/scooters-instead-of-boardroom-kabuki-how-one-fund-manager-picks-winners-idUSKBN1930DA

Paris (Reuters) - Bei Airbus geht eine Ära zu Ende: Verkaufschef John Leahy geht Unternehmenskreisen zufolge zum Jahresende in den Ruhestand.

Der 67 Jahre alte New Yorker steht seit 1994 an der Spitze der Vertriebs-Organisation von Airbus, zuvor hatte er den US-Markt für den europäischen Flugzeugbauer aufgerollt. In dieser Zeit hat Leahy mehr als 15.500 Flugzeuge zum Listenpreis von 1,7 Billionen Dollar verkauft - so viel wie kein anderer in der Branche. Leahy hatte in diesem Jahr schon angedeutet, dass er bald in Rente gehen und für seinen Stellvertreter Kiran Rao Platz machen würde. Der genaue Zeitpunkt war aber noch unklar. Vorstandschef Tom Enders habe ihn in einer internen Veranstaltung angekündigt, sagtem Insider. Öffentlich gemacht hat Airbus den Abschied bisher nicht.

Der Amerikaner hinterlässt Airbus einen Rekord-Auftragsbestand. Doch zuletzt waren die Bestellungen ins Stocken geraten, in diesem Jahr liegt der französisch-deutsche Konzern zum ersten Mal seit langem hinter dem Erzrivalen Boeing aus den USA. Auf der Luftfahrtmesse in Dubai im November will Leahy - quasi als letzte Amtshandlung - den Abwärtstrend bei den Bestellungen für das Großraumflugzeug A380 stoppen. Eigentlich wollte er dort gar nicht mehr auftreten. Doch Leahy hofft dort auf Aufträge von Emirates - blieben sie aus, drohe dem A380 laut Branchenkreisen sogr das Aus.

Tim Clark, der Chef der arabischen Fluggesellschaft, wollte sich zu seinen Plänen für die Messe in Dubai nicht äußern, macht sich aber auf einen angriffslustigen Leahy gefasst: “Er will, dass wir eine Unmenge von A380 bestellen, bevor er geht, damit er unter Fanfarenklängen gehen kann”, sagte er Reuters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to dramatically increase the country’s nuclear arsenal, he said in a meeting with his national security advisers in July, NBC News reported on Wednesday, citing three officials who were present in the room.

Trump’s reported comments come as tensions remained high with North Korea and as Trump is expected to make an announcement on whether to decertify the international deal surrounding Iran’s nuclear program.

The president spoke on July after he was shown a chart indicating the stockpile of U.S. nuclear weapons had slid from a high of 32,000 in the 1960s. Trump said he wanted to have that same number now, NBC reported.

The United States currently has about 4,000 nuclear warheads earmarked for use in its military stockpile, according to the Federation of American Scientists.

FILE PHOTO: A US Air Force missile maintenance team removes the upper section of an intercontinental ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead in an undated USAF photo at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana. REUTERS/USAF/Airman John Parie/handout via Reuters

In a post on Twitter on Wednesday, the president said, “Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a ‘tenfold’ increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction, made up to demean. NBC = CNN!”

Trump said in an interview with Reuters in February that he wanted to ensure that the U.S. nuclear arsenal was at the “top of the pack.”

Although U.S. presidents have modernized weapons stockpiles over the years, adding to the nuclear arsenal or building a prohibited type of weapon would be a violation of treaty agreements, according to NBC.

After the meeting, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson referred to Trump as a “moron,” according to NBC. U.S. news reports have painted the relationship between Trump and Tillerson as tense.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - A long-delayed election in Democratic Republic of Congo to replace President Joseph Kabila cannot take place until at least April 2019, the electoral commission said, a schedule certain to enrage opponents who say Kabila is clinging to power.

The polls were originally scheduled for November 2016. The schedule outlined by the electoral commission would torpedo an agreement between Kabila’s representatives and his opponents that the election would take place before the end of this year.

Dozens of people died last year in protests against Kabila’s refusal to step down at the end of his term. Parts of the country are in the hands of insurgents who say they will not stop fighting while he remains in power.

Congo’s electoral commission said in a statement following a meeting with civil society representatives on Tuesday that it would need at least 504 days to organise the poll once voter registration is completed.

Enrolment began in parts of the country’s insurrection-ravaged Kasai region in mid-September and the commission says it will, in principle, take about three months. That means the vote could not be organised until April 2019 at the earliest.

The commission is expected to release a calendar for the presidential and other elections this month.

The opposition accuses Kabila of trying to cling to power by postponing elections until he can find a way to remove constitutional term limits that prevent him from standing for re-election, as his counterparts in neighbouring Rwanda and Congo Republic have done.

Kabila, who took power after his father Laurent Kabila was assassinated in 2001, denies he intends to remain in office, and says the election delays are due to difficulties enrolling millions of voters and mobilising hundreds of millions of dollars in financing.

Congo has never experienced a peaceful transition of power and Kabila’s refusal to step down last year has fuelled mounting insecurity across the country, where millions died in regional conflicts between 1996-2003, most from hunger and disease.

An insurrection in Kasai has killed up to 5,000 people and displaced 1.4 million more since last August, and militia violence has also spiked in the eastern borderlands, where dozens of armed groups are active.","No Congo election until mid-2019, says electoral commission",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CG1KO-OZATP

Em agosto as vendas varejistas recuaram 0,5 por cento, informou o Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) nesta quarta-feira, após estabilidade em julho e alta nos três meses anteriores.

É o resultado mais fraco para agosto desde 2015, quando caiu 0,6 por cento, e a leitura foi bem pior do que a expectativa em pesquisa da Reuters de alta de 0,2 por cento.

Sobre o mesmo mês de 2016, as vendas apresentaram alta de 3,6 por cento, também abaixo da expectativa de avanço de 4,5 por cento mas no melhor resultado desde maio de 2014 (+4,6 por cento).

“A queda de agosto é mais uma acomodação. Mais parece um ajuste depois de altas do que uma reversão de tendência para o setor varejista”, afirmou a gerente do IBGE Isabella Nunes.

De acordo com o IBGE, sete das oito atividades pesquisadas apresentaram recuo nas vendas, sendo a mais forte em equipamentos e material para escritório, informática e comunicação, de 6,7 por cento.

As vendas de combustíveis e lubrificantes recuaram 2,9 por cento no mês. Em agosto, os preços dos combustíveis aumentaram 6,67 por cento, em meio a 19 reajustes de preços da gasolina dentro da nova política da Petrobras, apontou o IBGE ao divulgar os dados de inflação daquele mês.

Já as vendas de hipermercados, supermercados, produtos alimentícios, bebidas e fumo caíram 0,3 por cento em agosto sobre julho.

A única atividade a registrar aumento nas vendas foi a de móveis e eletrodomésticos, de 1,7 por cento, no quarto mês seguido de ganhos.

“A atividade que tem desempenho melhor é aquela que tem a ver com a queda de juros, com a disponibilidade do FGTS e com a inflação menor”, completou Isabella.

O varejo ampliado, que inclui veículos e material de construção, subiu 0,1 por cento em relação a julho, influenciado tanto pela alta de 2,8 por cento em veículos e motos, partes e peças, quanto pelo avanço de 1,8 por cento nas vendas de material de construção.

O resultado do varejo acompanhou o da indústria em agosto, que interrompeu quatro meses seguidos de alta porém em movimento que também não tende a atrapalhar o ritmo de recuperação do setor.

O ambiente de inflação e juros baixos no país favorecem o comércio, aliado recentemente à melhora do mercado de trabalho, o que dá base para a recuperação da economia após a recessão que afetou o país.

Trump, a Republican, escalated his feud with the National Football League in a Twitter post asking if the league should get tax breaks while some athletes kneel in protest when the “Star-Spangled Banner” is played at the start of each game.

“Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!” Trump wrote on Twitter.

The world’s top-grossing sports league gave up its tax-free status two years ago. Its owners are preparing to address the anthem issue at their fall meeting in New York Oct. 17-18, NFL chief spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday.

“Everyone at this point is frustrated by the situation,” Lockhart said. “The commissioner and the owners do want the players to stand. We think it is an important part of the game.”

The protests, in a league where African-Americans make up the majority of players, have continued through the season, with some players taking a knee when the anthem is played and others standing arm-in-arm in solidarity.

Current policy calls for players to stand for the anthem and face the flag, but no player has been disciplined for a protest, Lockhart said.

“We need to move past this controversy, and we want to do that together with our players,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell wrote in a memo to team owners.

The White House supported the idea of asking players to stand, said spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.

“We are glad to see the NFL taking positive steps in that direction,” she said at a news briefing.

Asked to explain Trump’s comment on the NFL and taxes, Sanders said, “The federal tax law doesn’t apply here, but certainly we know that they receive tax subsidies on a variety of different levels.”

The NFL Players Association, when asked for a reaction to possible changes to anthem rules, said in an email “we do not have a response at this time.”

Trump last month called on NFL team owners to fire players who kneel during the anthem to protest police violence against black Americans.

Critics contend Trump is fanning the controversy to distract from issues including devastation in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, tensions with North Korea and difficulties in pushing healthcare and tax overhauls through the U.S. Congress.

Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, speaking on KRLD-FM in Dallas on Tuesday, reiterated his stance that if any of his players chose to demonstrate during the anthem, they would not play.

“If you do not honor and stand for the flag in the way that a lot of our fans feel that you should ... if that’s not the case, then you won’t play,” said Jones.

“That’s nothing new as far as that being my wish or the way I want the Cowboys. As far as whether or not I will basically institute or do what I said I would just say. ... I would ask anybody to look at my record relative to what I say I’m going to do.”

Vice President Mike Pence walked out of a NFL game on Sunday after some players knelt, an action some critics called a publicity stunt.

Trump won the presidency with less support from black voters than any other president in at least four decades.

Trump has squared off against the NFL before, having owned a team in the upstart United States Football League in the 1980s. That league folded in 1985 after an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL failed.

Trump has refused to disclose his own tax history, departing from a practice of U.S. presidents going back more than 40 years.

(Reuters) - The United States will be absent from the World Cup finals for the first time since 1986 next year after a humiliating 2-1 defeat at the hands of Trinidad & Tobago in Couva on Tuesday.

Despite an inconsistent qualifying campaign, the Americans entered the Ato Boldon Stadium needing only a win of any sort over the bottom team in the CONCACAF final qualifying group to punch their ticket to Russia.

But two first-half goals - an Omar Gonzalez own goal in the 17th minute and an Alvin Jones effort 20 minutes later - proved too much for the Americans to overcome despite Christian Pulisic’s strike after the break.

Instead, Panama qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time with their 2-1 victory over Costa Rica, while Honduras beat Mexico 3-2 to pip the United States to a playoff place against Australia.

“Clearly very disappointing,” U.S. coach Bruce Arena told reporters.

”We had everything there for us today. There are no excuses for us not getting the second goal and at least a point out of the game.

“It’s a blemish for us. We should not be staying home for this World Cup and I take the responsibility for that.”

It was a stunning turn of events for the U.S., who were supposed to be rebuilding their program after hiring Arena last year.

Weathering some bumps in the road, the Americans pulled off an emphatic 4-0 win over Panama last week to take a two-point edge over both Panama and Honduras and regain control of their destiny.

But the U.S. got off to an ominous start against the Soca Warriors when defender Gonzalez tried to clear the ball only for it to loop up and over goalkeeper Tim Howard and into the net.

“The guy hit an early cross, and when I went to clear it, he touched it first and it hit off my shin and it happened to go right over Tim Howard,” Gonzalez said. “It’s one of the most unlucky goals ever. It’s one that will haunt me forever. I never thought I would see this day, it’s the worst day of my career.”

Jones doubled the lead when he unleashed a piledriver of a shot from well outside the penalty area that flew past Howard and into the net just inside the far post.

The U.S. responded in the second half when Pulisic also scored from outside the box in the 47th minute to give the visitors hope that they might at least rescue a draw that would have secured them the playoff spot.

The desperate effort to level up the match fell short, though, despite the best efforts of 34-year-old Clint Dempsey who nearly scored twice in the final 20 minutes.

Benny Feilhaber also had a header ricochet off the post in the 88th minute but the hosts held firm to condemn the Americans to a fourth defeat in 10 matches in the final round of qualifying.",United States miss out on World Cup after Trinidad loss,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFKBN1CG0NY-OZASP

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - When OPEC leader Saudi Arabia pledged in May to do “whatever it takes” to defend world oil prices, it didn’t expect the market to be testing its resolve just one month later.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

LONDON (Reuters) - Workers at Bombardier’s Northern Irish plant called on British Prime Minister Theresa May to be more visible in her attempts to save their jobs after the United States imposed tariffs on planes made by the Canadian aerospace firm.

The United States has backed a complaint brought by Boeing (BA.N) that Bombardier (BBDb.TO) received illegal subsidies and dumped planes at “absurdly low” prices, imposing duties of nearly 300 percent on its C-series aircraft.

Britain is confident that it can successfully fight the ruling, which jeopardizes some 4,200 jobs in Northern Ireland, where it is the biggest manufacturing employer.

“We do feel that the levies that are put on are unfair and will be detrimental to jobs in Northern Ireland,” Ron McDowell, 42, who has been an aerospace fitter for 25 years, told Reuters outside parliament in London, where workers had gathered for a protest.

“What we want is for Theresa May to come out publicly rather than speaking behind closed doors.”

McDowell was one of around 20 protesters who stood behind a sign saying “Back Bombardier: Defend our jobs, skills and communities.”

However, Jimmy Kelly of the Unite union said the dispute emphasized how Trump’s protectionist policies might undermine May’s hopes for a good trading relationship.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling bloc could come close to keeping its two-thirds “super” majority in an Oct. 22 lower house election, defying some predictions of substantial losses and solidifying his grip on power, a survey published by the Nikkei business daily on Wednesday showed.

Abe’s conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its more dovish junior partner, the Komeito, are likely to secure more than 290 seats in the 465-seat chamber, the Nikkei said.

The ruling bloc had a two-thirds “super majority” in the lower house before the chamber was dissolved. The number of seats has been cut from 475 as part of electoral reforms.

A strong showing by Abe’s coalition would boost his chances of winning a third term as LDP leader from next September, putting him on track to become Japan’s longest-serving premier.

Abe called the snap election amid confusion in the opposition camp and after an uptick in his ratings, which had been hurt earlier this year by suspected cronyism scandals, in hopes of gaining a fresh mandate after nearly five years in power.

But the outlook has been clouded by the emergence of popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike’s Party of Hope, a fledgling party that the former LDP lawmaker and defense minister calls a reformist, conservative alternative to Abe’s LDP.

The Nikkei said Koike’s party was on track to get around 69 seats, with a forecast range of 46-110.

Another new party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, formed from the liberal wing of the failed opposition Democratic Party, was set to win more than 40 seats, it said.

The Democrats, faced with rock bottom ratings and internal dissension, have said they would run no candidates of their own, freeing many to run on the Party of Hope ticket.

PRO-CONSTITUTION REVISION FORCES

The Asahi newspaper also forecast a strong showing by the ruling bloc, with the LDP set to win well over the 233 seats needed to have a simple majority on its own. It said Koike’s Party of Hope was struggling but was likely to get more than 57 seats. About 40 percent of voters were undecided, the Asahi said.

The Nikkei also forecast that parties in favor of revising the post-war, pacifist constitution - Abe’s long-held goal - were on track to win more than two-thirds.

That includes the LDP and Koike’s Party of Hope as well as another smaller right-leaning party, the Japan Innovation Party.

Amending the constitution, a politically controversial move never yet taken, requires a two-thirds majority in both chambers and a majority in a public referendum.

Koike’s party had raised expectations that it would cut into the LDP’s conservative base. But her decision not to run for a lower house seat herself and refusal to say whom her party would support for premier after the election appears to have eroded the party’s momentum.

Competition among a fragmented opposition, which also includes the Japanese Communist Party, in many districts means the anti-LDP vote could be split, a plus for Abe’s party.

Abe has led the LDP to four landslide wins since he took the helm of the party in 2012, but turnout has been low and the LDP has typically won with about 25 percent of eligible votes. The others either stayed home or backed opposition parties.

The premier has been touting the success of his “Abenomics” recipe of hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and promised structural reforms, while Koike argues that reforms have been too slow in a fast-changing global economy.

The world’s third-largest economy is on track for its longest expansion since World War Two, and the jobless rate was at a 23-year low of 2.8 percent in August while wages are starting to rise a bit.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan’s electoral commission on Wednesday barred from contesting elections a new political party that is backed by an Islamist with a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head, a government official said.

Haroon Khan, a spokesman for the commission, said a four-man panel rejected the registration of Milli Muslim League (MML) as an official political party.

Khan said Muhammad Raza Khan, chief of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), told MML’s lawyer at the final hearing of the registration that the new party has links with militant groups and as such “We can’t enlist you.”

The ECP spokesman said the commission cited an interior ministry recommendation that the MML was “affiliated” with Lashkar-e-Tayyeba (LeT), a militant group blamed for the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people, and that such groups could breed violence and extremism in politics.

The United States has designated LeT founder Hafiz Saeed a terrorist and offers a $10 million reward for information leading to his conviction.

Saeed, currently under house arrest, heads the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) Islamict charity, which Washington says is a front for LeT.

Pakistan’s reluctance to press charges against him has been a sore point in relations with Washington and India over the past decade.

“PATRIOTIC FORCES”

Saifullah Khalid, the head of MML, said his party would challenge the decision. “An attempt is being made to keep patriotic forces away from politics,” he said.

The party is likely to continue operating unofficially, as it did last month when one of its leaders contested a by-election in the eastern city of Lahore as an independent candidate.

The candidate, Yaqoob Sheikh, won several thousand votes, though officials from MML and JuD ran his campaign. Saeed’s portraits adorned posters promoting Sheikh.

The move to bar the party appears at odds with what political and former military sources told Reuters was a plan by the military’s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency to integrate militant-linked organisations by bringing them into politics as part of a de-radicalization drive.

Pakistani army spokesman Major-General Asif Ghafoor also said last week the integration of militants into the country’s politics would be based on seeking a constructive role for the militant-linked groups, although he did not comment on the military’s role in any such strategy.

“It is in my knowledge that the government has started some discussion over it, that is, how do we mainstream them,” Ghafoor said.

Neighbours India and Afghanistan accuse Pakistan’s military of backing and using militant groups such as LeT as proxies, a charge the army denies.

(Reuters) - Trading revenue was likely to be a black spot in U.S. banks’ third quarter earnings, as volatility remained low, and investors have little hope the fourth quarter will be much better.

U.S. banks’ equity trading volume has been hit by record lows in volatility as investors have less reason to trade if stocks are not moving much. At the end of the third quarter, the quarterly average for the CBOE market volatility index .VIX, was at its lowest ever.

On top of this, traders said that equity trading had also been dampened by an ongoing rise in popularity of passive investment instruments such as exchange traded funds over active investing.

Trading volume for fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) was also hurt by weak volatility in the quarter. Making matters worse, banks face a difficult comparison with the year-ago quarter when investors were busy reacting to the Brexit vote and preparing for the U.S. election.

“August was very slow. We saw some fits and starts from different headlines in September,” said Thomas Roth, head of U.S. Treasury trading at MUFG Securities America in New York.

While S&P banks were still expected to report EPS growth of 6.4 percent and revenue growth of 1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, analysts pared their estimates during the quarter as expectations for trading revenue declined.

Revenue estimates were 2.2 percent lower than where they were July 1 while EPS estimates were 1.8 percent lower.

Banks in aggregate will report a 16 percent decline in trading revenue from the year-ago quarter and a 7 percent decline from the second quarter, according to KBW estimates, following a 10 percent year-over year drop in trading revenue for the second-quarter.

The third-quarter decline includes a 25 percent drop in fixed income, currency and commodities trading revenue and flat equity trading revenue, according to KBW.

Executives from JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) all warned in September about weak trading revenue in what they described as a challenging quarter.

Goldman Sachs (GS.N) was expected to see the biggest drop in trading revenue with a 20 percent overall decline from the year-ago quarter driven by a 40 percent drop in its FICC trading revenue, according to KBW.

JPMorgan (JPM.N) is expected to show an overall drop of 19 percent driven by a 25 percent drop in FICC trading revenue and a 2 percent drop in equity revenue. Citigroup (C.N) will see overall trading revenue tumble 16 percent while Bank of America’s (BAC.N) was seen declining 15 percent. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) was expected to fare the best with a 10 percent drop in trading revenue, KBW estimated.

Some of the factors that drove trading declines in the third quarter will still be around in the fourth quarter, according to traders and other market watchers.

“Who knows when volatility will pick up?” said Russell Price, senior economist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, MI. “Comparisons will be better after the first of the year and we could know more on tax reform so that could help on trading activity,” he said.",Light trading volume seen as black spot in banks' results,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-results/light-trading-volume-seen-as-black-spot-in-banks-results-idUSKBN1CG1C6

Yet he stands to lose more face than he does money.

Peltz, CEO of Trian Fund Management, was also rebuffed in a battle for board seats, or proxy contest, at DuPont two years ago. But he went on to attract more money from investors and have a key ally installed as the chemical maker’s new chief executive.

Trian said on Tuesday that the shareholder vote at P&G, the biggest company to ever face a proxy contest, was too close to call, and that it would wait for the result to be certified by an independent inspector. P&G says Peltz has lost.

But if Peltz’s defeat is confirmed, there is little evidence it would cost him with his investors, industry analysts and academics said.

“Overall, Nelson Peltz has a good record and he does work hard to improve companies,” said University of Michigan professor Erik Gordon. “He will have no trouble finding companies where improvements need to be made and where he’ll be let in the door.”

Trian’s assets under management are at an all-time high of $14 billion, the result of long-standing confidence by pension funds and endowments in Trian’s 12-year investment history. There was no sign on Tuesday of significant redemptions by Trian investors.

Indeed, Trian got a boost this week from another big U.S. conglomerate, when General Electric Co offered a board seat to Trian chief investment officer Ed Garden, without any proxy contest.

To be sure, Trian was eager for a win at P&G. Trian’s 2.1 percent return through the end of September trails the average activist hedge fund’s 4.8 percent gain this year. And it lags last year’s 11 percent return.

Trian prefers to work behind the scenes and has only waged three proxy contests since its founding in 2005. It now looks to have lost two of them, and joins a small club of activist hedge funds that have experienced such defeat. They include Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, Barry Rosenstein’s Jana Partners and Jeff Smith’s Starboard Value.

In the investment community, 75-year old Peltz, who speaks in calm tones and steers clear of the name-calling often heard in other contests, was thought to be the only activist who could take on P&G and its entrenched management.

However, the 180-year-old company, which makes Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste and Gillette razors, always presented a challenging target for Peltz because an unusually high 40 percent of P&G’s stock is held by individual investors. They include P&G employees and retirees, who are traditionally loyal to the company’s management.

“Even if they win, which I‘m not sure they did, think of what a pyrrhic victory it is,” Peltz told CNBC on Tuesday. “I mean everybody but the current employees voted for us up and down the line.”

P&G cannot afford to ignore Peltz even if victory has eluded him on this vote, said Charles Elson, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware.

“In many ways, this could echo what happened at DuPont, where within the year, the CEO was out and the things Trian called for were happening,” he said.

On Tuesday P&G’s share price fell, closing down 0.5 percent, as investors worried whether the company would let up on its promises to pursue operational reforms.

P&G has said that management is already working on several operational changes, and that Peltz does not have the relevant experience to be helpful in the process.

Investor pressure could still deliver change, industry insiders said.

“Winning the ‘war’ will be measured in the share price creation over time,” said Bruce Goldfarb, founder of Okapi Partners, which advises on proxy contests.",Peltz's Procter & Gamble defeat could be more humbling than harmful,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-procter-gamble-trian-peltz/peltzs-procter-gamble-defeat-could-be-more-humbling-than-harmful-idUSKBN1CF37M

BERLIN (Reuters) - A co-leader of Germany’s Greens, a possible partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s next government, said on Wednesday the next head of the Eurogroup should support a shift away from austerity and toward investment and more fiscal solidarity.

The Greens are set to start exploratory talks next week with Merkel’s conservatives on forming a coalition government that also includes the pro-business, fiscally hawkish Free Democrats (FDP) after an election in September.

Unlike the FDP, who have cautioned against proposals by French President Emmanuel Macron for deeper fiscal integration in the single currency bloc, the Greens support common tax collection and an investment pact within the 19-country euro zone.

In January, Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem will step down as president of the Eurogroup, an informal body that plays a key role in shaping the economic policy of the bloc. The group will vote for a new chairman at a meeting in December.

“The upcoming leadership switch at the Eurogroup should be used as an opportunity for a new start in European fiscal and economic policy,” Greens co-chief Simone Peter said in a statement.

“Europe will gain from more solidarity. Europe’s fiscal policy needs a shift away from austerity toward a common pact for tax collection and investments, which would trigger social and ecological innovations.”

Like his German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble, Dijsselbloem opposes so-called transfers from richer euro zone states to poorer ones like Greece.

“It would be good for Europe if the chairman of the Eurogroup holds the position of European Finance Minister who reports to the European Parliament,” Peter said.

“French President Macron has put good proposals on the table, which should be taken on by the next government and should not be torpedoed as former Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble did” to previous proposals.

Schaeuble has agreed to step down after the Sept. 24 election that weakened Merkel’s conservatives. He will become president of the German parliament.

MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberians voted on Tuesday in an election expected to mark the first democratic transfer of power in over seven decades in a country haunted by a civil war that ended nearly 15 years ago.

Outgoing President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who won the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize, is praised for maintaining peace since taking over after the end of the West African country’s 14-year conflict in which child fighters were used.

Liberia’s policy of prioritizing reconciliation over justice, however, has meant that prominent figures responsible for the violence that killed a quarter of a million people are still present on the political landscape.

There is no clear frontrunner but Prince Johnson, a former rebel leader who finished third in the last election in 2011, is among 20 candidates on the ballot.

The ex-wife of warlord-turned-president Charles Taylor, now imprisoned in the UK for war crimes committed in Sierra Leone, is the running mate of another favorite: former soccer star George Weah.

“I am just voting for peace. We want peace right now,” said James Marthics, a voter in Paynesville, a suburb of the capital Monrovia.

Residents queued before dawn at polling stations in Monrovia, some bringing small wooden chairs with them, and formed queues as vendors sold them soft drinks and palm wine.

Materials including ballot boxes arrived late in some locations and some people struggled to find their names on voter rolls. State broadcaster ELBC reported a party chair in Lofa County was detained for distributing money to voters.

Elections commission head Jerome Korkoya said some individuals were arrested for trying to vote more than once, but he said voting went smoothly overall.

Liberia is Africa’s oldest modern republic. It was founded by freed U.S. slaves in 1847 but its last democratic power transfer dates back to 1943.

Johnson Sirleaf, Africa’s first elected female president, won a surprise victory in 2005 following a post-war transition. She was re-elected in 2011 but is barred from seeking another term.

Among the favorites to replace her is Vice President Joseph Nyuma Boakai.

Weah, who has won FIFA’s world player of the year, was greeted at his polling station by supporters in football shirts. He came second to Johnson Sirleaf in 2005.

Ex-rebel leader Johnson won around 12 percent of the vote in 2011. A widely-circulated video showed him sipping a beer as he directed the torture of President Samuel Doe shortly before his murder in 1990.

Ballot counting started soon after polls officially closed at 6 p.m. (1800 GMT), though voting continued in some areas where there had been delays.

Results are expected to begin arriving later this week. But most analysts think it will be difficult for any single candidate to win an outright majority on Tuesday, raising the likelihood of a run-off election next month.

Few believe there is a real risk of a return to war but in a national address on Monday Johnson Sirleaf called for peace.

Though held in high esteem internationally, many Liberians, who call her simply “Ellen”, say they are disappointed she has not achieved more in her 12 years in office.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling bloc could come close to keeping its two-thirds “super” majority in an Oct. 22 lower house election, defying some predictions of substantial losses and solidifying his grip on power, a survey published by the Nikkei business daily on Wednesday showed.

Abe’s conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its more dovish junior partner, the Komeito, are likely to secure more than 290 seats in the 465-seat chamber, the Nikkei said.

The ruling bloc had a two-thirds “super majority” in the lower house before the chamber was dissolved. The number of seats has been cut from 475 as part of electoral reforms.

A strong showing by Abe’s coalition would boost his chances of winning a third term as LDP leader from next September, putting him on track to become Japan’s longest-serving premier.

Abe called the snap election amid confusion in the opposition camp and after an uptick in his ratings, which had been hurt earlier this year by suspected cronyism scandals, in hopes of gaining a fresh mandate after nearly five years in power.

But the outlook has been clouded by the emergence of popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike’s Party of Hope, a fledgling party that the former LDP lawmaker and defense minister calls a reformist, conservative alternative to Abe’s LDP.

The Nikkei said Koike’s party was on track to get around 69 seats, with a forecast range of 46-110.

Another new party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, formed from the liberal wing of the failed opposition Democratic Party, was set to win more than 40 seats, it said.

The Democrats, faced with rock bottom ratings and internal dissension, have said they would run no candidates of their own, freeing many to run on the Party of Hope ticket.

PRO-CONSTITUTION REVISION FORCES

The Asahi newspaper also forecast a strong showing by the ruling bloc, with the LDP set to win well over the 233 seats needed to have a simple majority on its own. It said Koike’s Party of Hope was struggling but was likely to get more than 57 seats. About 40 percent of voters were undecided, the Asahi said.

The Nikkei also forecast that parties in favor of revising the post-war, pacifist constitution - Abe’s long-held goal - were on track to win more than two-thirds.

That includes the LDP and Koike’s Party of Hope as well as another smaller right-leaning party, the Japan Innovation Party.

Amending the constitution, a politically controversial move never yet taken, requires a two-thirds majority in both chambers and a majority in a public referendum.

Koike’s party had raised expectations that it would cut into the LDP’s conservative base. But her decision not to run for a lower house seat herself and refusal to say whom her party would support for premier after the election appears to have eroded the party’s momentum.

Competition among a fragmented opposition, which also includes the Japanese Communist Party, in many districts means the anti-LDP vote could be split, a plus for Abe’s party.

Abe has led the LDP to four landslide wins since he took the helm of the party in 2012, but turnout has been low and the LDP has typically won with about 25 percent of eligible votes. The others either stayed home or backed opposition parties.

The premier has been touting the success of his “Abenomics” recipe of hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and promised structural reforms, while Koike argues that reforms have been too slow in a fast-changing global economy.

The world’s third-largest economy is on track for its longest expansion since World War Two, and the jobless rate was at a 23-year low of 2.8 percent in August while wages are starting to rise a bit. But Abe’s reflationary policies have not yet sparked a sustainable recovery led by the private sector.",Japan PM's ruling bloc seen nearing 2/3 majority in Oct 22 lower house poll: Nikkei,https://www.reuters.com/article/japan-politics-election-poll/japan-pms-ruling-bloc-seen-nearing-2-3-majority-in-oct-22-lower-house-poll-nikkei-idINKBN1CG20B?il=0

O Brasil terminou as eliminatórias sul-americanas em primeiro lugar, com 41 pontos, 10 a mais que o segundo colocado Uruguai. Desde que Tite assumiu a seleção, no ano passado, foram 12 jogos oficiais, com 10 vitórias, incluindo a da noite de terça-feira por 3 x 0 sobre o Chile, e apenas dois empates.

Até o Mundial de 2018, o treinador terá alguns amistosos para acertar a seleção.

“Eu gostaria de experimentar mais, mas tenho um dilema: ou fortalece para os grandes jogos ou fica testando em demasia, e com o pouco número de jogos que eu tenho, (a escolha) é pelo fortalecimento da equipe”, disse Tite em entrevista coletiva após a partida contra os chilenos em São Paulo.

“Eu queria dar oportunidades para mais atletas, mas não dá, não tem mais tempo”, acrescentou.

O treinador, no entanto, descartou que o grupo esteja fechado e apontou a lateral-esquerda como um exemplo de dúvida, afirmando que Marcelo, Filipe Luís e Alex Sandro disputam duas vagas.

Tite disse também que os três goleiros ainda não estão definidos, após testar Ederson na vaga do titular Alisson contra o Chile. O terceiro goleiro convocado para a última rodada das eliminatórias foi Cássio.

Para Tite, o Brasil é um dos favoritos para a Copa do Mundo, pelo desempenho e resultados obtidos nos últimos jogos.

“O futebol que a equipe está apresentando me deixa feliz... tem troca de passes para depois verticalizar, marcação posicional. Resgata aquilo que penso de futebol, e associa efetividade, com beleza e ganhar jogos, mostrando que essas coisas não são conflitantes”, afirmou, destacando não saber o limite de sua equipe.

“Eu não tenho a capacidade de projetar o que vai ser lá na frente. Não sei qual o limite, mas a cada dificuldade e adversário, ela (equipe) vai se mostrando.”

No entanto, Tite destacou que os jogadores do Brasil precisam aprender a lidar melhor com as provocações, citando algumas discussões no jogo com os chilenos. “Tem que saber administrar esses momentos, tem que ter maturidade e melhorar”, disse.

Tite citou França e Alemanha como outras favoritas para a Copa do Mundo do ano que vem, e aprovado a classificação da Argentina na última rodada das eliminatórias.

“Eles fizeram por merecer, não era um jogo só, mas uma regularidade... talvez tenham se valido da qualidade do Messi”, afirmou Tite, ao saber que Lionel Messi marcou os três gols da vitória sobre o Equador por 3 x 1 fora de casa.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New Yorker reported on Tuesday that 13 women have claimed that movie producer Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them, including three who told the magazine they had been raped.

Weinstein’s spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister was quoted in the article saying, “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.”

Weinstein and the women for whom contact information was available did not reply to Reuters requests for comment. Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the claims.

“Mr. Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual,” Hofmeister was quoted as saying.

Weinstein’s wife of 10 years, Marchesa label fashion designer Georgina Chapman, said late on Tuesday that she was leaving him, according to a report in People magazine.

“My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions. I have chosen to leave my husband,” Chapman was quoted as saying.

Her representatives did not respond to a request for comment.

The New York City Police Department and Manhattan District Attorney’s office said in separate statements on Tuesday that Weinstein was investigated in 2015 over an allegation that he sexually abused one of the women, who was named in the article. The district attorney’s office said there was insufficient evidence to charge him.

Separately, the New York Times reported on Tuesday that actress Gwyneth Paltrow said she was sexually harassed by Weinstein more than 20 years ago and that Angelina Jolie said she “had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth and as a result chose never to work with him again.”

The New Yorker reported that Italian actress Ambra Battilana Gutierrez went to police in 2015 claiming that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her.

She was asked by police to arrange another meeting with Weinstein during which she would wear a recording device, the New Yorker reported.

Manhattan Chief Assistant District Attorney Karen Friedman- Agnifilo said on Tuesday, referring to the wire, “While the recording is horrifying to listen to, what emerged from the audio was insufficient to prove a crime under New York law.”

Actress Gutierrez could not be reached for comment.

The New York Times published an article last week in which it was alleged that Weinstein had sexually harassed several women over 30 years. After a statement in which Weinstein apologized for his behavior, his attorney Charles J. Harder said the newspaper’s story was defamatory because it relied on “mostly hearsay accounts and a faulty report.”

Weinstein, one of the most powerful men in Hollywood who produced and distributed movies like “Shakespeare in Love” and “Chicago,” was fired over the weekend from his job as co-chairman of The Weinstein Company.

The Democratic National Committee and several Democratic politicians who received political contributions from Weinstein said they would reroute the money to women’s rights groups.

On Tuesday, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said she was “shocked and appalled” at the reports about Weinstein. She did not mention any contribution but said “the behavior described ... cannot be tolerated.”",Women claim Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted them: report,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CF2P2-OCAEN

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG) plans to automate 30 percent of operations at its core banking unit by 2024, using software robots and artificial intelligence for paperwork that would otherwise take 9,500 employees to process.

Automation would free bankers to better serve Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd’s [MTFGTU.UL] wealthier clients, where there are opportunities such as estate management, said Kanetsugu Mike, the unit’s chief executive since June.

“Branch officials spend 50 to 60 percent of their time processing customer documents,” Mike said in an interview. “We can free up that time with robotics technology so more time can be spent with customers.”

The comments come as Japanese banks turn to automation under an efficiency drive aimed at blunting the impact of the central bank’s negative interest rates on profit margins, stricter capital requirements and a shrinking population.

Japanese banks have been slow to eliminate paper-based documentation compared with major global peers, partly because many forms require customers’ personal ink stamps - Japan’s official method of identification - rather than signatures.

Having fallen behind, they are now scrambling to reform processes - such as introducing stamp-free accounts - and employ new technology to fend off potential threats from their more tech-savvy competitors.

Mizuho Financial Group Inc, Japan’s second-biggest financial group after MUFG, last year set up joint venture J.Score Co with SoftBank Group Corp, using artificial intelligence to calculate individuals’ creditworthiness.

At MUFG, Mike said “robotics process automation” will handle half of branch operations by the end of the business year to March 2024, or 30 percent of the bank’s total. By the time of full installation, the automation would have handled the equivalent of 9,500 employee’s workload, he said.

Freeing up staff will allow for increased focus particularly on 1.2 million clients with assets over 100 million yen ($890,000), currently served by only 2,600 bankers, Mike said.

“We need more bankers, so we don’t have much of an excess workforce to begin with,” he said, dismissing any connection between automation and headcount.

Mike, who has spent nearly half of his 38-year MUFG career outside Japan, also said overseas business will continue to be a growth-driver, and that further acquisitions are likely in Asia and the United States.

He said the rate of expansion will not be as fast as in recent years given constraints such as higher capital requirements. MUFG’s assets grew nearly $1 trillion over the past decade to $2.7 trillion at the end of June.

“Our growth so far has been led by balance sheet expansion, especially after the global financial crisis,” he said. “We need to use our balance sheet more prudently now.”",Japan's MUFG to automate operations to free bankers for wealthy clients,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mufg-strategy/japans-mufg-to-automate-operations-to-free-bankers-for-wealthy-clients-idUSKBN1CG21U?il=0

The move follows a similar one-year suspension in Finland in July to allow a new taxi law to come into effect, however there is no set date for when UberPOP will be reintroduced in Norway.

The U.S. ride-hailing company has come under fierce pressure from traditional taxi drivers and regulators across Europe who accuse it of unfair competition and skirting traditional licensing rules.

UberPOP has already been suspended in several European capitals, including Paris and Brussels, and Uber was recently humbled when it lost its license to operate in London.

“We’ve learned the hard way that we must change as a company in order to serve the millions of riders and drivers who rely on us. With our new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi onboard, it’s a new era for Uber,” the company said in a statement.

“That’s why it’s now time to pause UberPOP in Norway, in order to relaunch under new regulations.”

UberPOP will be suspended on Oct. 30, while Uber’s licensed services UberBLACK and UberXXL will continue to operate as normal.

The Uber logo is seen on mobile telephone in London, Britain, September 25, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay

The Norwegian transport minister said Uber was being treated as any other market participant would be. “All actors offering taxi services must conform to rules and regulation at any time,” Ketil Solvik-Olsen told Reuters.

The suspension of UberPOP in Norway comes as the non-EU country must answer by Oct. 27 a query on its transport regulations by the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA), the body that ensures EU regulations are enforced in countries that have access to the European common market.

Uber will suspend UberPOP three days after that deadline.

In February, ESA said Norway was setting “disproportionately high barriers to enter the taxi market” that led to inefficient use of resources and higher prices for consumers.

Khosrowshahi took the helm of Uber in August, replacing co-founder and former boss Travis Kalanick and has promised change at the $70 billion dollar firm.

The company said it was encouraged by developments in Norway such as the government’s sharing economy committee which recommended repealing certain provisions related to taxis and an opinion from the EFTA surveillance authority which said Norway’s restrictions on taxi licenses were illegal.

“Norway deserves modernized laws that encourage innovation and competition without sacrificing what makes the Norwegian model special,” Uber said. “We hope the government will implement these recommendations soon, so that we can relaunch a new and improved version of the product loved by so many.”

Any legal misstep in the trial of Diane Shima Rwigara could further mar the reputation of the long-ruling Kagame, who is credited for stabilising and developing Rwanda after its 1994 genocide but accused by rights groups of suppressing dissent.

Rwigara is accused of falsifying registration papers she filed to stand against Kagame in an August election and is the latest in a series of dissidents to face criminal charges. She was barred from running in the election, which Kagame subsequently won with an official 98.8 percent of the vote.

“I plead not guilty to all charges,” she told the court, adding that she had so far had scant access to her lawyer since police arrested her at her home on Aug. 30 on tax evasion allegations related to her family’s tobacco company.

Prosecutors said on Monday they could not disclose details of the charges because an investigation was still going on.

Rwigara accuses Kagame of stifling dissent and has criticised the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front’s (RPF) tight grip on the country since it fought its way to power to end the east African nation’s genocide.

Her mother Adeline and younger sister Anne are co-defendants in the trial and say the accusations are politically motivated.

Their attorney, Pierre Celestin Buhuru, said he had not been given access to WhatsApp messages and recordings that prosecutors have presented as evidence.

The family has also asked for a return of money they said was confiscated by police during their raid in August so that they can appoint an additional lawyer.

The trial will resume on Friday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s pound steadied on Wednesday, holding just above a one-month low hit as investors grew concerned on whether entrenched expectations of higher UK interest rates were reasonable given a backdrop of uncertain Brexit negotiations.

Noises around Brexit negotiations grew louder after finance minister Philip Hammond declared the government was planning for all possibilities, including Britain’s leaving with no agreement on the terms of its departure.

However, that had little impact on sterling with the currency hemmed in tight trading ranges as investors worried that a sharp turnaround in sterling in the currency markets to net long positions may come under pressure.

David Cheetham, the chief market analyst for XTB trading, warned that the high levels of speculative positioning risked weakening the pound.

“Recent events are unlikely to cause major downside for sterling on their own but they are weighing on the pound, and the alarming frequency with which they are occurring only increases the chances of another major political blow for the market,” he said.

Sterling GBP=D3 was broadly flat at $1.3195 after two sessions of gains. It briefly hit a day's low of $1.3176 after Hammond's comments.

Strategists said the speech had only minimal impact with markets more focused on the strong data this week and broad expectations of interest rate hikes baked into the currency markets.

“I don’t think Hammond’s speech about a ‘no deal’ is a major factor. Actions speak louder than words to the market. There has been virtually no practical preparation of a ‘no deal’ scenario,” said Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at Societe Generale.

Despite falling projections for British economic growth, futures markets are pricing in 50 basis points of Bank of England rate increases over the next year IRPR, the most in the developed world apart from Canada.

But the outlook appeared fragile, with some market watchers including such as Morgan Stanley preferring to sell sterling on rallies on Brexit worries.

Given an unproven business model and the flame-out of U.S. rival Blue Apron after its own initial public offering, the loss-making German group’s plan to float belongs in the deep-freeze.

HelloFresh said on Tuesday it plans to raise between 250 million euros and 300 million euros in a Frankfurt initial public offering. Largest shareholder Rocket Internet abandoned a previous IPO attempt in 2015 due to concerns over investor demand and market conditions. It’s not clear why now will be any better.

Shares in Blue Apron, which also ships pre-prepared recipe ingredients to time-poor urbanites, have roughly halved in value since a June listing, and the group trades at around a one-times multiple of forecast sales. At a similar rating, HelloFresh might be worth just under 1 billion euros, based on Barclays estimates of its revenue – about half the upper-end valuation that Bloomberg reported on Oct. 6.

Granted, some of Blue Apron’s problems are unique, such as “operational challenges” in its fulfilment centres and a dependence on the promotion-heavy U.S. market. But both companies are reliant on costly marketing to buy growth. The German group has even cooked up a new accounting measure: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and marketing, which was 122 million euros higher than EBITDA in the first half of 2017. If getting ahead is a question of piling on marketing spend, HelloFresh could face problems should a giant like Amazon, fresh from its acquisition of Whole Foods, or a major grocer muscle in.

Fortunately there’s no need to serve up this particular dish just yet. Loss-making HelloFresh needs fresh capital to keep growing, but shareholder Rocket Internet is flush with cash after selling shares in Germany’s Delivery Hero and it stake in e-commerce group Lazada. That might be a better source of funds for a company that has all the ingredients for a post-IPO flop.",Breakingviews - HelloFresh IPO belongs in the deep-freeze,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hellofresh-ipo-breakingviews/breakingviews-hellofresh-ipo-belongs-in-the-deep-freeze-idUSKBN1CF1JV

(Reuters) - Wall Street’s main indexes were little changed at open on Wednesday, as a jump in shares of consumer staples were offset by a drop in financials on the eve of their financial reports.

Kroger (KR.N) rose nearly 7 percent after the grocery chain said it would explore a potential sale of its convenience stores business.

That led the consumer staples index .SPLRCS up 0.36 percent. But those gains were offset by a 0.5 percent drop in financials.

Wall Street banks JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) both report on Thursday. But, analysts warn bank results will be held back by a lack of volatility compared to a year ago.

“Third quarter results of large banks are expected to be tepid,” said Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research. “Trading revenue (will be) down due to low volatility and loan growth remaining flat to slightly negative.”

With the S&P 500 up 14 percent in 2017, investors are betting on strong earnings growth across the S&P 500.

“It’s only a question of valuations, if they’ve gotten a little bit ahead of themselves, even though the earnings story remains positive,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

“Time will tell.”

At 9:36 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 4.04 points, or 0.02 percent, at 22,834.72, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 0.73 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,549.91 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 4.12 points, or 0.06 percent, at 6,583.13.

The dollar .DXY dipped to a 12-day low on worries that a feud with influential Tennessee Senator Bob Corker would undermine President Donald Trump’s efforts to pass tax changes.

FED AHEAD

Of interest will be minutes, due at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), of the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting, when it left interest rates unchanged but signaled one more hike was still on the cards by the end of 2017.

Worried by signs the U.S. economy had peaked, the Fed has slowed since raising rates twice within three months at the start of this year.

“There may not be any new information, but the market will be susceptible to any sort of negative headline that might come out,” Brown said.

Seven of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher.

General Electric (GE.N) slipped about 1 percent after JPMorgan said a dividend cut was “increasingly likely” and cut its price target on the stock.

J&J (JNJ.N) rose 1.5 percent after Jefferies upgraded the stock to “buy”.

Micron Technology (MU.O) dipped 1.17 percent after launching a $1 billion stock offering to cut debt.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia plans to reduce up to 310 jobs from its Nokia Technologies unit and halt development of its virtual reality camera “OZO” and hardware, the Finnish company said on Tuesday.

The unit has about 1,090 employees and the potential cuts are expected to affect staff in Finland, the United States and Britain. Nokia employed about 102,000 employees as of end-June.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian banking stocks rose sharply on Wednesday with traders citing relief that new proposals by the EU Commission to strengthen the banking sector made no reference to stricter provisioning rules on the existing backlog of bad loans.

Italian banks have been hit by a sell-off over the past week after the European Central Bank unveiled plans to require lenders to set aside more money on new soured debts. This has angered Italy, which fears this treatment could be extended to the current stock of non performing loans (NPLs).

BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - European countries are scrambling to cobble together a package of measures they hope will keep the Iran nuclear deal on track if U.S. President Donald Trump ignores their pleas and decertifies the landmark 2015 agreement this week.

The package would include a strong statement backing the deal by European powers, together with efforts to lobby the U.S. Congress and put wider pressure on Iran, officials said.

But without strong U.S. support for the deal, senior officials in Berlin, Paris and London say it may be only a matter of time before the pact between Tehran and six world powers unravels, with grave consequences for Middle East security, nonproliferation efforts and transatlantic ties.

The two-year-old agreement, under which Iran agreed to freeze its nuclear program for 15 years in exchange for sanctions relief, is viewed in Europe as a rare triumph of international diplomacy in the Middle East.

As tensions over North Korea’s nuclear activities risk boiling over into all-out war, any move by the United States to undermine the Iran deal is seen in Europe as utter folly.

European capitals have been delivering this message to the White House and Congress in one of the most intense lobbying campaigns in recent memory. In the past weeks, European ambassadors have met dozens of U.S. lawmakers. And on Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May lobbied Trump by phone.

Despite this, Trump is expected declare this week that Iran is not complying with the pact. He is also due to unveil a tough new strategy toward Iran - including designating its Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization - that could sink the deal.

“If the feeling is the United States no longer supports the agreement then the political reality is that the deal will be in serious jeopardy and its implementation will be very difficult,” a senior French diplomat told Reuters.

A decision by Trump to decertify would not automatically kill the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The expectation is that Trump would kick the ball to Congress, which would then have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions lifted as part of the JCPOA.

THREE-PRONGED RESPONSE

European officials said they were preparing a three-pronged strategy if this does occur.

First, Berlin, London and Paris would issue statements reaffirming their commitment to the deal.

Second, they would redouble efforts to lobby Congress, which appears keen to keep the deal, against any rash moves.

And third, they would present measures to pressure Iran over its ballistic missile program and destabilizing policies in the Middle East -- areas that fall outside the narrowly-focused nuclear deal.

French President Emmanuel Macron alluded to this at the United Nations last month. Diplomats said the package was still in the works and they had not yet briefed Brussels on it.

With the third step, the Europeans hope to build a bridge to Washington while keeping the JCPOA intact. But a German diplomat said ratcheting up pressure on Tehran was like walking a tightrope: push too hard and the whole deal could fall apart.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo

“We all knew the JCPOA wasn’t perfect, but by calling its benefits into question I see us only losing,” said a senior European diplomat who has been involved in negotiations with Iran since 2003, well before Washington joined the talks under President Barack Obama.

If Trump follows through on his threats it will be the second time in four months that he has distanced the United States from a major multilateral agreement despite intense lobbying by partners and members of his own cabinet.

But in Europe, the Iran move would be seen as far more damaging than Trump’s decision in June to pull out of the Paris climate accord.

“The threat from Iran in terms of nuclear proliferation is more immediate. This is far more dangerous,” said Elmar Brok, a veteran foreign policy expert in the European Parliament and party ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

European officials and analysts fear a breakdown of the JCPOA could lead to an arms race in the Middle East, a military conflict between Iran and Israel and an escalation of regional proxy wars between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

They fear it would also doom any chances, no matter how slim, for a negotiated deal with North Korea.

ALL ABOUT WAR

“At the end of the day it’s all about the risk of war,” said Francois Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

There is also the danger of a further deterioration in transatlantic ties, especially if Washington targets European firms that do business in Iran.

Were that to happen, the EU ambassador to Washington, David O‘Sullivan, has said Brussels would revert to a 1990s-era law that shields European companies from extraterritorial sanctions.

Even if the EU were to take such a step, the senior French diplomat said European companies could think twice about their Iran commitments.

Among firms that have announced big deals in Iran since the JCPOA went into force are planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA), French energy group Total (TOTF.PA) and Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE).

“One of the big difficulties of the agreement is ensuring the economic operators have confidence in the system and key to that is confidence in the United States,” the diplomat said.

Any signs that European companies are pulling back could prompt the Iranians to reassess the merits of the nuclear deal.

“The agreement with Iran is like a delicate plant,” said Omid Nouripour, an Iranian-born lawmaker with the German Greens party, which is expected to be part of Merkel’s next coalition government.

“It is a sign of what diplomacy can achieve but it is fragile. The American president doesn’t appear to believe in diplomacy. He seems intent on crushing this plant.”","Fearing Trump torpedo, Europe scrambles to save Iran deal",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-europe/fearing-trump-torpedo-europe-scrambles-to-save-iran-deal-idUSKBN1CG1XY

TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp’s autonomous driving system is expected to be launched in commercial vehicles as early as in 2022, in a move that will likely help the Japanese company narrow its gap with rival suppliers in a highly competitive market.

Panasonic, the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla Inc’s mass-market Model 3, has been reinventing itself as a provider of advanced auto parts to escape the price competition of smartphones and other lower-margin consumer products.

The new autonomous driving system will enable autonomous driving at low- and medium-speed ranges including self-valet parking, Panasonic said on Tuesday.

“We know we are behind our rivals right now,” said Shoichi Goto, director in charge of vision and sensing technologies at the firm’s automotive R&D division.

“But we have developed key LSI (large-scale integration) chips for advanced image processing and sonar sensing that would give us major advantages, using expertise from television sets and cameras.”

The new chips need more testing and polishing before the commercial launch of the autonomous driving system, added Goto, previously a TV engineer.

Panasonic has been pushing to expand its range of advanced driving-related products to better compete with top suppliers such as Bosch [ROBG.UL] and Continental AG.

The firm has said it plans to nearly double its automotive business revenue to 2.5 trillion yen ($22 billion) by the year to March 2022, from 1.3 trillion yen in the year to March 2017.

Panasonic established the automotive R&D division in April, transferring about 350 engineers from TV, the company’s mainstay at the time, and other consumer electronics businesses.

To bolster its push into the automotive field, Panasonic took control of Spanish auto parts maker Ficosa International SA earlier this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Illegal immigrants who survived a fire that killed about 80 people in a social housing block in London will be given a clear path to obtaining permanent residency rights in Britain, the government said on Wednesday.

The 24-storey Grenfell Tower, home to a low-income, multi-cultural community, was gutted on June 14 in an inferno that started in a fourth floor apartment in the middle of the night and quickly engulfed the building.

The building is in a deprived estate within one of London’s richest boroughs, and the disaster prompted a wave of soul-searching about social inequalities and neglect of poor communities.

Some of the approximately 250 people who made it out of the building alive on the night of the fire did not have the legal right to live in Britain and as a result have been reluctant to make themselves known to the authorities.

The government had previously said that if they came forward, those people would be given leave to remain legally in Britain for 12 months -- a stance that drew widespread criticism for being ungenerous to people affected by the tragedy.

Martin Moore-Bick, chairman of a public inquiry into the fire, had asked the government to reconsider the policy, saying some survivors were unwilling to give evidence because of fears over their long-term immigration status.

“I therefore urge the government to take all necessary steps to dispel those fears,” he said in a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May in August.

The Home Office, or interior ministry, said the new policy was that after the initial period of 12 months of limited leave to remain in Britain, Grenfell survivors would be able to apply for further periods of leave, building up to five years.

At the end of the five years, if they had not committed any offences, they would be given permanent residency, the Home Office said.

A spokesman said the government had not previously indicated what would happen at the end of the first 12 months. He said the new stance provided greater certainty.

BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - European countries are scrambling to cobble together a package of measures they hope will keep the Iran nuclear deal on track if U.S. President Donald Trump ignores their pleas and decertifies the landmark 2015 agreement this week.

The package would include a strong statement backing the deal by European powers, together with efforts to lobby the U.S. Congress and put wider pressure on Iran, officials said.

But without strong U.S. support for the deal, senior officials in Berlin, Paris and London say it may be only a matter of time before the pact between Tehran and six world powers unravels, with grave consequences for Middle East security, nonproliferation efforts and transatlantic ties.

The two-year-old agreement, under which Iran agreed to freeze its nuclear program for 15 years in exchange for sanctions relief, is viewed in Europe as a rare triumph of international diplomacy in the Middle East.

As tensions over North Korea’s nuclear activities risk boiling over into all-out war, any move by the United States to undermine the Iran deal is seen in Europe as utter folly.

European capitals have been delivering this message to the White House and Congress in one of the most intense lobbying campaigns in recent memory. In the past weeks, European ambassadors have met dozens of U.S. lawmakers. And on Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May lobbied Trump by phone.

Despite this, Trump is expected declare this week that Iran is not complying with the pact. He is also due to unveil a tough new strategy toward Iran - including designating its Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization - that could sink the deal.

“If the feeling is the United States no longer supports the agreement then the political reality is that the deal will be in serious jeopardy and its implementation will be very difficult,” a senior French diplomat told Reuters.

A decision by Trump to decertify would not automatically kill the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The expectation is that Trump would kick the ball to Congress, which would then have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions lifted as part of the JCPOA.

THREE-PRONGED RESPONSE

European officials said they were preparing a three-pronged strategy if this does occur.

First, Berlin, London and Paris would issue statements reaffirming their commitment to the deal.

Second, they would redouble efforts to lobby Congress, which appears keen to keep the deal, against any rash moves.

And third, they would present measures to pressure Iran over its ballistic missile program and destabilizing policies in the Middle East -- areas that fall outside the narrowly-focused nuclear deal.

French President Emmanuel Macron alluded to this at the United Nations last month. Diplomats said the package was still in the works and they had not yet briefed Brussels on it.

With the third step, the Europeans hope to build a bridge to Washington while keeping the JCPOA intact. But a German diplomat said ratcheting up pressure on Tehran was like walking a tightrope: push too hard and the whole deal could fall apart.

“We all knew the JCPOA wasn’t perfect, but by calling its benefits into question I see us only losing,” said a senior European diplomat who has been involved in negotiations with Iran since 2003, well before Washington joined the talks under President Barack Obama.

If Trump follows through on his threats it will be the second time in four months that he has distanced the United States from a major multilateral agreement despite intense lobbying by partners and members of his own cabinet.

But in Europe, the Iran move would be seen as far more damaging than Trump’s decision in June to pull out of the Paris climate accord.

“The threat from Iran in terms of nuclear proliferation is more immediate. This is far more dangerous,” said Elmar Brok, a veteran foreign policy expert in the European Parliament and party ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

European officials and analysts fear a breakdown of the JCPOA could lead to an arms race in the Middle East, a military conflict between Iran and Israel and an escalation of regional proxy wars between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

They fear it would also doom any chances, no matter how slim, for a negotiated deal with North Korea.

ALL ABOUT WAR

“At the end of the day it’s all about the risk of war,” said Francois Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

There is also the danger of a further deterioration in transatlantic ties, especially if Washington targets European firms that do business in Iran.

Were that to happen, the EU ambassador to Washington, David O‘Sullivan, has said Brussels would revert to a 1990s-era law that shields European companies from extraterritorial sanctions.

Even if the EU were to take such a step, the senior French diplomat said European companies could think twice about their Iran commitments.

Among firms that have announced big deals in Iran since the JCPOA went into force are planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA), French energy group Total (TOTF.PA) and Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE).

“One of the big difficulties of the agreement is ensuring the economic operators have confidence in the system and key to that is confidence in the United States,” the diplomat said.

Any signs that European companies are pulling back could prompt the Iranians to reassess the merits of the nuclear deal.

“The agreement with Iran is like a delicate plant,” said Omid Nouripour, an Iranian-born lawmaker with the German Greens party, which is expected to be part of Merkel’s next coalition government.

“It is a sign of what diplomacy can achieve but it is fragile. The American president doesn’t appear to believe in diplomacy. He seems intent on crushing this plant.”","Fearing Trump torpedo, Europe scrambles to save Iran deal",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iran-nuclear-europe/fearing-trump-torpedo-europe-scrambles-to-save-iran-deal-idUKKBN1CG1Y0?il=0

The government proposes spending an additional 15 billion euros on training over five years, with employers saying they cannot fill vacancies despite a jobless rate of close to 10 percent, higher than in many European countries.

President Emmanuel Macron also wants to bring the national unemployment insurance fund, currently jointly run by unions and employers, under the state’s control.

Macron, a former banker whose other labor market reform plans have been condemned by some trade union leaders as a deathknell for high French standards of labor protection, wants to make a professional training program less bureaucratic.

He also wants the state to have more say over how much the unemployed get in benefits and for how long, which is currently largely set by unions and employers,

On Thursday the government is due to open talks with union leaders before deciding how to overhaul training and unemployment insurance.

Training is already funded to the tune of some 30 billion euros annually, financed in part by a levy on wage-earners, but is widely criticized for not benefiting workers that need it most.

Meanwhile, unions and employers are protective of their decades-old grip over the unemployment insurance benefits system worth billions of euros.

Macron angered unionists last week with comments he made during a visit to a car parts factory, where scuffles erupted between police and workers protesting over job losses.

“Instead of kicking up a bloody mess, some of them would be better off going to see if they can get a job over there,” he said, alluding to vacancies that a nearby aluminum factory was battling to fill.

Opponents accused Macron of showing contempt toward the workforce.

Nonetheless, business owners say the skills gap is a problem.

“We just can’t get people into factories,” Pierre Tisseau, whose company makes house terraces in Cholet in western France, told Reuters.

Tisseau said he hoped reforms to professional training would help him fill vacancies he has struggled to plug since 2008.

The local branch of the Medef business federation in Cholet said 9,000 people were looking for work but that firms were finding it hard to fill 1,500 vacancies in sectors such as construction, transport and the agri-foods.

Macron defied street protests led by the Communist Party-rooted CGT union to drive through employment law reforms that critics say will weaken collective bargaining and give more power to companies to set out work conditions.","After 'bloody mess' jab, Macron eyes training, job insurance reform",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-france-reform-training/after-bloody-mess-jab-macron-eyes-training-job-insurance-reform-idUKKBN1CG1Z0?il=0

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian ride-hailing firm Ola has raised $1.1 billion from investors led by China’s Tencent Holdings and Japan’s SoftBank Group and is in advanced talks with other investors for another $1 billion.

The funds will give a leg up to Ola that has been locked in a fierce battle with rival Uber for a bigger piece of India’s $12 billion taxi market. Both firms have already burnt millions of dollars to lure users in a bid to outdo each other.

Ola will use the funds to increase its numbers of drivers and expand its presence to more cities, it said in a statement on Wednesday.

The company, which currently has a majority share of India’s ride-hailing market, operates in 110 cities and has a wide range of transport options including bikes, auto-rickshaws and electric cars. Uber is present in about 30 cities.

It also said it would invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, which includes technologies like its in-car entertainment platform called Play that allows riders to choose music and stream videos.

The company is in advanced talks with U.S.-based financial investors for the second tranche, which would also include funds from existing investors, a source close to the company said, declining to be identified as the talks were not yet finalised.

Once the second tranche is complete Ola would have raised over $2 billion. Prior to this, the company had raised about $1.9 billion since it began operations in 2011.

Uber, valued at about $69 billion, has pumped millions of dollars into India but has not been able to grow its presence at the same speed as Ola.

And with Uber’s new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi focused on portraying the firm as a reformed company that is turning a page on concerns including sexual harassment claims and a U.S. bribery probe, Ola has an opportunity to further extend its lead in India.","India's Ola raises $1.1 billion in Tencent, SoftBank-led round, seeks another $1 billion",https://www.reuters.com/article/ola-fundraising/ola-raises-1-1-billion-in-tencent-softbank-led-round-seeks-another-1-billion-idINKBN1CG0GV

SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military flew two strategic bombers over the Korean peninsula in a show of force late on Tuesday, as President Donald Trump met top defense officials to discuss how to respond to any threat from North Korea.

Tensions have soared between the United States and North Korea following a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test in recent weeks as it fast advances toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

The two U.S. Air Force B-1B bombers were joined by two F-15K fighters from the South Korean military after leaving their base in Guam, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement on Wednesday.

After entering South Korean airspace, the two bombers carried out air-to-ground missile drills in waters off the east coast of South Korea, then flew over the South to waters between it and China to repeat the drill, the release said.

The U.S. military said in a separate statement it conducted drills with Japanese fighters after the exercise with South Korea, making it the first time U.S. bombers have conducted training with fighters from both Japan and South Korea at night.

The U.S. bombers had taken off from the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. In August, Pyongyang threatened to fire intermediate-range missiles toward the vicinity of Guam, a U.S. Pacific territory that is frequently subjected to sabre-rattling from the North.

GUARD RAISED

South Korean and U.S. government officials have been raising their guard against more North Korean provocations with the approach of the 72nd anniversary of the founding of North Korea’s ruling party, which fell on Tuesday.

Trump hosted a discussion on Tuesday on options to respond to any North Korean aggression or, if necessary, to prevent Pyongyang from threatening the United States and its allies with nuclear weapons, the White House said in a statement.

SHIPS BANNED

The United Nations Security Council, which has imposed a series of ever tighter sanctions on North Korea, has banned four ships from ports globally for carrying coal from North Korea, including one vessel that also had ammunition.

The vessels are the first to be designated under stepped-up sanctions imposed on North Korea by the 15-member council in August and September over two long-range ballistic missile launches and Pyongyang’s sixth and largest nuclear test.

China, North Korea’s main ally and trading partner, has consistently argued sanctions alone will not work, urging Washington and Pyongyang to lower their rhetoric and return to the negotiating table.

China’s influential Global Times tabloid expressed alarm at how far the rhetoric on both sides had gone and how it had increased the risk of a “fatal misjudgment”.

“The international community won’t accept North Korea as a nuclear power. North Korea needs time and proof to believe that abandoning its nuclear program will contribute to its own political and economic advantage. This positive process is worth a try,” the paper said in an editorial late on Tuesday.

VW’s German rival Daimler (DAIGn.DE) last month delivered the first of a smaller range of electric delivery trucks to customers in New York.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New Yorker reported on Tuesday that 13 women have claimed that movie producer Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them, including three who told the magazine they had been raped.

Weinstein’s spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister was quoted in the article saying, “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.”

Weinstein and the women for whom contact information was available did not reply to Reuters requests for comment. Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the claims.

“Mr. Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual,” Hofmeister was quoted as saying.

Weinstein’s wife of 10 years, Marchesa label fashion designer Georgina Chapman, said late on Tuesday that she was leaving him, according to a report in People magazine.

“My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions. I have chosen to leave my husband,” Chapman was quoted as saying.

Her representatives did not respond to a request for comment.

The New York City Police Department and Manhattan District Attorney’s office said in separate statements on Tuesday that Weinstein was investigated in 2015 over an allegation that he sexually abused one of the women, who was named in the article. The district attorney’s office said there was insufficient evidence to charge him.

Separately, the New York Times reported on Tuesday that actress Gwyneth Paltrow said she was sexually harassed by Weinstein more than 20 years ago and that Angelina Jolie said she “had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth and as a result chose never to work with him again.”

Jolie and Paltrow did not reply to requests for comment.

The New Yorker reported that Italian actress Ambra Battilana Gutierrez went to police in 2015 claiming that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her.

She was asked by police to arrange another meeting with Weinstein during which she would wear a recording device, the New Yorker reported.

Manhattan Chief Assistant District Attorney Karen Friedman- Agnifilo said on Tuesday, referring to the wire, “While the recording is horrifying to listen to, what emerged from the audio was insufficient to prove a crime under New York law.”

Actress Gutierrez could not be reached for comment.

The New York Times published an article last week in which it was alleged that Weinstein had sexually harassed several women over 30 years. After a statement in which Weinstein apologised for his behaviour, his attorney Charles J. Harder said the newspaper’s story was defamatory because it relied on “mostly hearsay accounts and a faulty report.”

Weinstein, one of the most powerful men in Hollywood who produced and distributed movies like “Shakespeare in Love” and “Chicago,” was fired over the weekend from his job as co-chairman of The Weinstein Company.

The Democratic National Committee and several Democratic politicians who received political contributions from Weinstein said they would reroute the money to women’s rights groups.

On Tuesday, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said she was “shocked and appalled” at the reports about Weinstein. She did not mention any contribution but said “the behaviour described ... cannot be tolerated.”",Women claim Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted them - report,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-people-harvey-weinstein/women-claim-harvey-weinstein-sexually-assaulted-them-report-idUKKBN1CF2PH

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contentious new U.S. demands are set to hit NAFTA negotiating tables on Wednesday, threatening to push modernization talks toward collapse as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau again tries to remind U.S. President Donald Trump of the trade pact’s merits.

Trudeau will meet with Trump and trade-focused U.S. lawmakers on the North American Free Trade Agreement while hundreds of negotiators, government officials and lobbyists from Canada, Mexico and the United States descend on a hotel in Arlington, Virginia for a fourth round of talks.

“We’re going to be talking about NAFTA and the fact it has led to great opportunities for our citizens,” Trudeau said on Tuesday night in conciliatory remarks at a Fortune magazine dinner honoring women, where he sat next to Ivanka Trump.

He added that he would “look for areas of agreement” with President Trump to improve outcomes for both countries.

The Canadian leader’s visit comes amid increasing acrimony over NAFTA renegotiations, with Trump making fresh threats to terminate the 23-year-old agreement and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday accusing Trump’s administration of trying to sabotage the talks with “poison pill proposals.”

Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray warned that an end to NAFTA would mark a breaking point in U.S.-Mexican relations and affect bilateral cooperation in non-trade areas.

The NAFTA talks are likely to stall in the face of aggressive U.S. demands to sharply increase content requirements for autos and auto parts, trade experts say.

The Washington round promises to be difficult, with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announcing early on Wednesday that talks would be extended by two days to Oct 17.

Lighthizer also said the three nations have completed their negotiations regarding company competition policy, reaching agreement on a chapter that provides goes beyond previous U.S. trade deals to ensure “certain rights and transparency under each nation’s competition laws.”

People briefed on the new U.S. proposals to be presented this week said that USTR is seeking to sharply lift North American content threshold for autos and auto parts to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent, with a 50 percent U.S.-specific content requirement.

“These will be met with widespread opposition from Canada and Mexico. I think it’s just a bridge too far,” said Wendy Cutler, the Asia Society’s Washington policy director and former chief U.S. negotiator for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal canceled by Trump.

Other contentious U.S. proposals opposed by Canada, Mexico and U.S. business interests include a five-year sunset provision, radical changes to NAFTA’s dispute arbitration systems, changes to intellectual property provisions and new protections for U.S. seasonal produce growers.

In his meeting with Trump, Trudeau is expected to remind the president that Canada is the United States’ biggest export customer, with largely balanced two-way goods and services trade, and is not the cause of U.S. manufacturing jobs lost under NAFTA, Canadian officials said.

Mexico has that distinction, with far lower wages that have lured U.S. auto plants and other manufacturers across its northern border, resulting in a $64 billion trade surplus with the United States last year that Trump administration officials have vowed to slash.

Ces publicités ne semblent pas émaner de l‘organe affilié au Kremlin qui a acheté des annonces auprès de Facebook, ce qui pourrait être le signe d‘une campagne russe plus vaste de désinformation en ligne, ajoute la source, confirmant une information rapportée un peu plus tôt par le Washington Post.

Ces nouvelles révélations sont susceptibles d‘entraîner un examen plus approfondi sur le rôle que les géants de la technologie dans la Silicon Valley auraient pu jouer, involontairement, lors de cette élection. Les services de renseignement américains sont parvenus à la conclusion que la Russie avait l‘intention de semer la discorde aux Etats-Unis, via une campagne de propagande, destinée à influencer l‘élection afin de faire élire Donald Trump.

Selon la source, Google a évalué pour le moment à moins de 100.000 dollars (environ 85.200 euros) les dépenses publicitaires à financement russe potentiel.

Twitter et Facebook ont récemment repéré que des opérateurs russes présumés, travaillant pour le Centre de recherche d‘internet (Internet Research Agency, en anglais), avaient utilisé leurs plates-formes pour acheter des publicités et publier des contenus destinés à créer politiquement des divisions dans le but d‘influencer les Américains avant et après l‘élection présidentielle de novembre 2016.

Facebook a annoncé le mois dernier avoir découvert une dépense de 100.000 dollars provenant du Centre de recherche d‘internet. Sous pression, le premier réseau social mondial a aussi promis de faire davantage preuve de transparence sur la manière dont ses annonces sont achetées et ciblées.

PARIS(Reuters) - La réforme de l‘apprentissage et de la formation professionnelle, censée offrir un emploi à 150.000 chômeurs et à 150.000 jeunes avant la fin du quinquennat d‘Emmanuel Macron, est très attendue par les petites et moyennes entreprises qui n‘arrivent pas à recruter malgré le chômage de masse.

Les nombreux emplois non pourvus faute, notamment, des qualifications nécessaires ont de quoi surprendre dans un pays où le taux de chômage était, selon le Bureau international du travail, de 9,5% au deuxième trimestre de 2017 (23,1% pour les 15-24 ans), malgré plus de 30 milliards d‘euros dépensés chaque année pour former les travailleurs et financer des apprentis.

La région de Cholet, dans les Pays de la Loire, vit par exemple un rebond industriel qui donne des vertiges à ses entrepreneurs. Les listes des offres d‘emploi s‘allongent et tous les secteurs en profitent, de l‘agroalimentaire aux transports, en passant par le bâtiment et la métallurgie.

Rien que dans le Pays Choletais, une agglomération du département de Maine-et-Loire, le Medef local a recensé 1.500 offres pour 152 entreprises.

Le hic, c‘est que la plupart de ces offres restent vacantes.

“C‘est un problème d‘image. On n‘arrive pas à attirer les gens dans les usines”, a expliqué à Reuters Pierre Tisseau, le dirigeant de Rénoval, une entreprise de fabrication de vérandas de 160 salariés à Yzernay.

Pourtant, le nombre de demandeurs d‘emploi dans la région dépasse les 8.950 personnes, selon le Medef.

Pour Pierre Tisseau, qui dit vivre une pénurie de main d‘oeuvre depuis 2008, la réforme de l‘apprentissage et de la formation professionnelle promise par la ministre du Travail, Muriel Pénicaud, pourrait faire la différence.

TOUT MISER SUR L‘ALTERNANCE

Le gouvernement, qui entamera jeudi les consultations sur ce dossier avec les partenaires sociaux, a dévoilé fin septembre les grandes lignes de son programme d‘investissement pour le secteur de la formation, qui a coûté 31,6 milliards d‘euros en 2014 aux entreprises, aux régions et à l‘Etat.

L‘investissement annuel de l‘Etat représente, à lui seul, 3,8 milliards d‘euros.

Au total, ce sont 15 milliards d‘euros supplémentaires que le gouvernement entend débloquer pendant le quinquennat, dont la majorité - 13,8 milliards d‘euros - serviront à former les demandeurs d‘emplois et les jeunes décrocheurs.

Avec cet investissement, le gouvernement prévoit une baisse de 0,5 point du taux de chômage structurel et une amélioration du taux d‘emploi des jeunes de deux points.

Le modèle allemand de formation et d‘apprentissage est cité, qui permet à ce pays d‘avoir un taux de chômage de 3,8% au deuxième trimestre 2017 au sens du BIT (6,6% pour les 15-24 ans), avec un pourcentage des 15-29 ans non scolarisés ni en formation ou sans emploi, de 8,56% en 2015 (le double en France), selon l‘OCDE.

“VOIE ROYALE”

Le Premier ministre Edouard Philippe l‘avait implicitement reconnu le 14 septembre dernier dans un discours en estimant que l‘apprentissage était “voie royale pour l’insertion”.

“Une voie royale dont nous avons perdu le chemin alors que d’autres pays l’empruntent massivement, depuis de nombreuses années et avec succès”, avait-il déclaré.

Parmi les mesures proposées par le gouvernement français: mettre en place des indicateurs de performance pour mieux évaluer la valeur ajoutée des organismes de formation, développer les formations à distance, favoriser l‘apprentissage dans le cas des jeunes décrocheurs et renforcer leur accompagnement dans la recherche d‘emploi.

Pierre Tisseau dit miser beaucoup sur l‘alternance, qui permet d‘alterner études et séjours en entreprise.

“Pour nous, c‘est le meilleur moyen de recrutement et d‘intégration”, a expliqué ce patron qui engage en moyenne cinq “alternants” par année et qui en recherche cinq de plus.

Même discours pour Laurent Morillon, un autre entrepreneur de la région. “Ce sont loin d‘être des voies de garage”, dit le dirigeant de Morillon SAS, société de machinerie, à propos des contrats d‘apprentissage et de professionnalisation.

Le patron de cette entreprise de 50 salariés fonctionne également avec une moyenne de cinq alternants. Il engage des jeunes en CAP ou bac professionnel et, après quelques mois de formation, les envoie travailler chez ses clients à travers le monde. Plus de 80% de son chiffre d‘affaires est réalisé au Moyen-Orient, en Asie et en Amérique Latine.

“Ils sont ravis. Ils apprennent l‘anglais, ils ont des postes à responsabilité”, a-t-il dit. “Il y a vraiment des perspectives d‘évolution.”

UN SYSTÈME CHRONOPHAGE

L‘autre volet de la réforme, c‘est la simplification des canaux de financement de la formation professionnelle, pour lesquels les discussions devraient débuter début novembre.

Pour l‘instant, les entreprises doivent verser un pourcentage de leur masse salariale dans un fonds destiné à la formation des salariés. Ce fonds, estimé à 6,71 milliards d‘euros, est géré par les partenaires sociaux.

Pour que leurs salariés en bénéficient, les entreprises déposent des dossiers à travers le compte personnel de formation (CPF) de ces derniers. Mais ce système, considéré comme chronophage, est largement décrié par les PME.

“En ce moment, il faut faire des tas de démarches auprès des organismes. S‘il manque un papier, on repart de zéro”, a dit Hervé Raineteau, vice-président d‘ASP, une société de nettoyage de bureaux, chantiers et locaux dans la région de Cholet.

“Souvent, lorsque la formation n‘est pas trop chère, on laisse tomber. On la finance nous-même.”

Pour cette entreprise de 40 salariés, ce dispositif creuse encore l‘écart entre les diplômés et les moins qualifiés.

“La plupart de nos salariés ne sont pas capables d‘ouvrir un CPF si on ne les assiste pas”, a-t-il poursuivi. “On a l‘impression que la majorité des formations va à l‘élite.”

La Confédération des PME (CPME), qui n‘était pas signataire de la dernière réforme de 2015, mise beaucoup sur cette refonte.

“Aujourd‘hui, il faut une réforme qui simplifie. Il faut négocier quelque chose qui soit lisible et stable”, a dit Jean-Michel Pottier, le vice-président de la Confédération.",La réforme de l'apprentissage très attendue par les PME,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRKBN1CG16G-OFRTP

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When reporters descended on upstate New York to ask about a stunning prison break in 2015, state police spokesman Major Charles Guess took their questions.

A dog named Trigger stepped on his owner’s 12-gauge shotgun during an Indiana waterfowl hunt just months later and shot her in the foot.

Sometimes the name fits the news story. Correspondent Julie Weed writes about legal marijuana for Forbes. This month, a front-page New York Times story on obesity was edited by Hilary Stout.

And former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner on Monday was sentenced to prison for sending explicitly sexual pictures of a certain body part to an underage girl.

This phenomenon has secured its own line of scientific research, called nominative determinism. It even has a name of its own: aptronym.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo

In some cases, it may be rooted in the tradition of a profession determining a family name, such as Baker, Smith or Taylor.

Other times, it is a coincidence. But it nearly always raises an eyebrow or even a smile from those realizing the unusual pairing.

Recent news stories have mentioned Jack Dagger, the U.S. director of the International Knifethrowers Hall of Fame. Then there is Detective Martin Speechley, the ever-quotable spokesman for the New York Police Department.

Sometimes the odd connections can be horrifying. When a gunman at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon, killed nine people, including a woman in a wheelchair, her service dog named Bullet survived.

But strange synergies also can signal hope. Josh Outman now pitches for Mexico’s Triple-A Minor League Pericos de Puebla but was once with the New York Yankees, Oakland Athletics and other U.S. Major League Baseball teams. Perhaps a streak of no-hitters by Outman could get him back to the big leagues.","Having the right name at the right, or sometimes wrong, time",https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKCN1C425Q

LONDON (Reuters) - Illegal immigrants who survived a fire that killed about 80 people in a social housing block in London will be given a clear path to obtaining permanent residency rights in Britain, the government said on Wednesday.

The 24-storey Grenfell Tower, home to a low-income, multi-cultural community, was gutted on June 14 in an inferno that started in a fourth floor apartment in the middle of the night and quickly engulfed the building.

The building is in a deprived estate within one of London’s richest boroughs, and the disaster prompted a wave of soul-searching about social inequalities and neglect of poor communities.

Some of the approximately 250 people who made it out of the building alive on the night of the fire did not have the legal right to live in Britain and as a result have been reluctant to make themselves known to the authorities.

The government had previously said that if they came forward, those people would be given leave to remain legally in Britain for 12 months -- a stance that drew widespread criticism for being ungenerous to people affected by the tragedy.

Martin Moore-Bick, chairman of a public inquiry into the fire, had asked the government to reconsider the policy, saying some survivors were unwilling to give evidence because of fears over their long-term immigration status.

“I therefore urge the government to take all necessary steps to dispel those fears,” he said in a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May in August.

The Home Office, or interior ministry, said the new policy was that after the initial period of 12 months of limited leave to remain in Britain, Grenfell survivors would be able to apply for further periods of leave, building up to five years.

At the end of the five years, if they had not committed any offences, they would be given permanent residency, the Home Office said.

A spokesman said the government had not previously indicated what would happen at the end of the first 12 months. He said the new stance provided greater certainty.

These labels are more than just words. For one thing, a terrorist designation for the Guard would likely bring with it sanctions across the whole organisation; Iran's most powerful force with its own ground, naval, and air divisions. The U.S. government has sanctioned individuals and entities with ties to the Guard in the past, including a special forces unit in 2007. But historically Washington has shied away from labelling as terrorists any military belonging to a recognized government, partly because it would open up American troops to the same label. Analysts say the move can be risky as it means soldiers on both sides lose protections granted by the Geneva Convention. For example, American civilians detained in Iran have often received long and harsh treatment in the past, but when a U.S. Navy crew was captured in Iranian waters last year it was an embarassment, but the sailors were released the next day. NATO allies France and Germany have urged the White House to show restraint, warning that any escalation could further destabilize the region.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain published proposals on Wednesday for a levy on social media firms and internet providers to help fund its online safety strategy, designed to tackle bullying, abuse and other risks for children and vulnerable users.

Prime Minister Theresa May and her ministers have been critical of firms like Twitter, Facebook, and Google, repeatedly calling on them to do more to stop the spread of extremist content online and help victims of abuse.

May first promised a levy on “social media companies and communication service providers” in her 2017 election manifesto.

On Wednesday, digital minister Karen Bradley published proposals for an Internet Safety Strategy including the levy, a code of practice on removing intimidating or humiliating content from social media, and online safety classes in schools.

“The internet has been an amazing force for good, but it has caused undeniable suffering and can be an especially harmful place for children and vulnerable people,” Bradley said in a statement.

“We need an approach to the internet that protects everyone without restricting growth and innovation in the digital economy.”

The government proposal, which invites views from the industry before being formulated into legislation, said the levy would initially be sought on a voluntary basis.

“We may then seek to underpin this levy in legislation, to ensure the continued and reliable operation of the levy,” the document said. “The levy will not be a new tax on social media.”

It likened the proposed levy to an existing one paid on a voluntary basis by the gambling sector to fund charitable work.

Social media firms have typically been exempt from regulatory fees that can apply to communication services.

BELGRADE (Reuters) - Catalonia’s president has no choice but to suspend secession since it is unlikely anyone will recognise the Spanish region on the basis of a disputed referendum, a former British diplomat who has advised the Catalans and other secessionist movements said.

Carne Ross, who as founder of the diplomatic consultancy Independent Diplomat has worked with Kosovo, South Sudan, Western Sahara and Catalonia on their respective bids for sovereignty, said there would be no solution to the crisis without a legal plebiscite agreed to by Madrid.

To get there would require pressure from Spain’s European Union partners, Ross told Reuters in a telephone interview.

“A full declaration of independence would have been very problematic, would have led to obvious confrontation with Madrid and he (Catalan President Carles Puigdemont) was under enormous pressure not to declare independence, including I assume from the countries that Catalonia would look to for recognition,” said Ross.

“At the end of the day, if you’re to be independent, you need to be recognised as such.”

“I think they are only likely to get international recognition if there is a legal referendum that Madrid accepts.”

Puigdemont declared on Tuesday that Catalonia had the mandate for independence but proposed suspending sovereignty to allow for talks with Madrid on an agreed solution. On Wednesday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called for clarity as to whether or not Catalonia had declared independence and raised the spectre of Madrid suspending the region’s autonomy.

FUEL ON THE FIRE

People stand outside the Sagrada Familia cathedral in Barcelona, Spain, October 11, 2017. REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado

Catalonia’s Oct. 1 referendum was declared illegal by a Spanish high court and mustered only 43 percent turnout as many independence opponents stayed at home. Hundreds of people were injured by baton-wielding police as they intervened to close polling stations.

Ross said many Catalans had been “radicalised” by Madrid’s resistance and police behaviour.“Fuel has been added to the fire,” he said.

“In my view, legitimate independence can only be legitimately declared when it has a clear majority of the population. I don’t think it is right to declare independence when you don’t have that clear majority. And as things currently stand, Catalonia does not have that clear majority.”

Ross formerly headed the Middle East section of the British mission to the United Nations but resigned from the civil service in 2004 over the invasion of Iraq. His work with Independent Diplomat was the subject of the documentary Accidental Anarchist that was broadcast in July on the BBC.

Ross, who advised the Catalan government between July 2013 and September 2015 and is a committed advocate of self-determination, said it was “unrealistic” to expect a mediated solution resulting in, for instance, greater autonomy for Catalonia.

He cited the examples of Montenegro and Scotland, in which referendums were held on the basis of negotiated terms in 2006 and 2014 respectively. Montenegro narrowly voted to leave a state union with Serbia, while a majority of Scots opted to remain with Britain.

“I think that the international community should be calling for Madrid to do what Britain did with Scotland, which is to allow a legal referendum to resolve this once and for all.”

French President Emmanuel Macron has rejected a call by Puigdemont for EU mediation, but Ross said the bloc should state clearly to Madrid “that it needs to find a more consensual solution”.

Asked if the Catalans had erred in holding a referendum that Madrid did not agree to, Ross replied: “They had no other option to build up the pressure for that dialogue.”","Interview: Catalans have no choice but to delay, says former adviser",https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia-resolution/interview-catalans-have-no-choice-but-to-delay-says-former-adviser-idINKBN1CG1U1?il=0

The turnout shows only smaller companies are risking bets on the oil sector of the world’s youngest country. South Sudan has 3.5 billion barrels of oil and 3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in proven reserves, and is seen by companies as one of the last frontiers in energy exploration in sub-Saharan Africa.

But a civil war that broke out in late 2013 dashed the hopes of oil major Exxon Mobil, which has ditched exploration plans. Its rival Total has put such plans on hold. Four million people have fled the conflict.

Oil production has fallen to about a third of the peak it reached before the war.

The government says Total is still interested in developing two of its biggest oil blocks. The company did not immediately comment when asked by Reuters why it did not send a representative to South Sudan for the conference.

“The elephant in the room is still the crisis,” said NJ Ayuk, chief executive of Centurion Law Group, an African energy-focused firm. He spoke wistfully of 2011, when the country gained independence from Sudan.

“Everybody was in love with South Sudan, everybody was hopeful and wanted to help,” he said of prospective investors. “The challenge is bringing the country back to where it was in 2011, where most people could really see a dream.”

Britain’s Tullow Oil, a leading exploration firm on the continent that the government says has expressed interest in an untapped block, was represented by its Africa vice-president.

But at coffee breaks conference attendees said they worried that political obstacles, more than technical ones, would plague any possible investment.

A fragile peace deal broke down last year amid gun battles between soldiers and rebels in Juba. International efforts to bring warring sides to new talks have not succeeded.

There was brief applause when second vice-president James Wani Igga, standing in for President Salva Kiir, said South Sudan “is emerging as a powerful nation with a world-class oil industry”.

A British drilling company executive called arrival at Juba’s airport “enlightening”. The airport is housed in tents amid renovations of the original terminal. Passports are stamped by officials without computers in a trailer provided by the United Nations.

Petroleum minister Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth said the government would assert itself in talks with potential investors.

“I‘m not threatening anybody, but if you don’t meet our terms, we will say ‘bye bye’ and then somebody else will come in immediately,” Gatkuoth said.

He said state-owned Nilepet would take a greater role in partnerships. “You will team up with Nilepet,” he told the conference, with a caveat: “I‘m not encouraging you to leave - immediately.”

This is not a reassuring message, said Andrew Firth of Secure, a regional private security and risk management firm.

“The quickest way to drive the petroleum sector forward is by allowing the market to drive development, not for the government to drive (it).”

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Fostering monetary conditions conducive to economic growth were a constant consideration for Indian policymakers, but would not take priority over achieving the central bank’s inflation target, Governor Urjit Patel told a newspaper on Monday.

Patel told the Mint newspaper that the economy was recovering, after growth slowed to a three-year low of 5.7 percent in the April-June quarter.

The slowdown had sparked some calls for lower interest rates, but with inflation rising the RBI left rates unchanged at a review by the monetary policy committee (MPC) last week.

“Growth is always there in the MPC’s scheme of things; we don’t lose sight of that, but not at the cost of inflation,” Patel was quoted as saying in the interview.

“However, we have to be careful — we should aim at achieving the inflation target without losing sight of supporting economic growth.”

Consumer inflation accelerated to 3.36 percent in August. India’s central bank has a medium-term target for annual inflation of 4 percent with the flexibility of plus/minus 2 percent on either side to make room for food price volatility.

The (MPC) will strive to achieve its 4 percent inflation target on a “durable basis”, Patel said.

Last week, the RBI kept its repo rate unchanged at 6.00 percent as expected last week, and raised inflation projections, cooling hopes for future rate cuts.

However, Patel said growth was already starting to recover. The RBI last week cut its projection for gross value added - an indicator of growth it prefers to 6.7 percent from 7.3 percent for the year ending in March - higher than some analyst forecasts.

“Our projections based on high frequency real economy indicators suggest that growth will pick up in the third and fourth quarters (of the current fiscal year) to above 7 percent,” he told Mint.

“We have started seeing the upturn.”

Patel has given only a handful of interviews since taking over as RBI Governor late last year.

MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy took the first step on Wednesday toward suspending Catalonia’s political autonomy and ruling the region directly to thwart a push for independence.

He demanded that the regional government clarify whether it now considered itself independent following a speech by Catalan president Carles Puigdemont on Tuesday night.

This requirement is a necessary step before triggering Article 155 of the constitution, which would allow Madrid to suspend the region’s political autonomy.

Rajoy’s move could deepen the confrontation between Madrid and Catalonia but it also signals a way out of Spain’s biggest political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981.

The prime minister would be likely to call a snap regional election after activating the constitutional mechanism allowing him to do so.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence from Spain on Tuesday night but then immediately suspended it and called for talks with the Madrid government.

“The cabinet has agreed this morning to formally request the Catalan government to confirm whether it has declared the independence of Catalonia, regardless of the deliberate confusion created over its implementation,” Rajoy said in a televised address after a cabinet meeting to consider the government’s response.

Without giving a specific deadline for the Catalan government to reply, Rajoy said: “The answer from the Catalan president will determine future events, in the next few days.”

It is not yet clear if and when the Catalan government would answer the requirement but it now faces a conundrum, political analysts say.

If Puigdemont says he did declare independence, the government would likely trigger Article 155. If he says he did not declare it, then far-left party CUP would likely withdraw its support to his minority government.

“Rajoy has two objectives: if Puigdemont remains ambiguous, the pro-independence movement will get more fragmented; if Puigdemont insists on defending independence then Rajoy will be able to apply Article 155,” said Antonio Barroso, deputy director of London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence.

“Either way Rajoy’s aim would be to first restore the rule of law in Catalonia and this could at some point lead to early elections in the region”.

DIALOGUE CALL DISMISSED

Puigdemont had been widely expected to unilaterally declare Catalonia’s independence on Tuesday after the Catalan government said 90 percent of Catalans had voted for a breakaway in an Oct. 1 referendum that Spain had declared illegal and which most opponents of independence boycotted.

Madrid responded angrily to Puigdemont’s speech, saying the Catalan government could not act on the results of the referendum.

“Neither Mr. Puigdemont nor anyone else can claim, without returning to legality and democracy, to impose mediation... Dialogue between democrats takes place within the law,” Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said.

Invoking Article 155 to ease Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades would make prospects of a negotiated solution to the Catalonia crisis even more remote.

A spokesman for the Catalan government said earlier on Wednesday that if Madrid went down this road, it would press ahead with independence.

“We have given up absolutely nothing...We have taken a time out...which doesn’t mean a step backwards, or a renunciation or anything like that,” Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull told Catalunya Radio.

Socialist opposition leader Pedro Sanchez said he would back Rajoy if he had to activate Article 155 and said he had agreed with the prime minister to open a constitutional reform within six months to discuss how Catalonia could fit better in Spain.

It was not clear how the Catalan government would respond to the offer.

MARKET RELIEF

Puigdemont’s speech also disappointed supporters of independence, thousands of whom watched proceedings on giant screens outside parliament before sadly leaving for home.

Financial markets, however, were encouraged that an immediate declaration of independence had been avoided.

Following Puigdemont’s speech, Spain’s benchmark IBEX share index rose as much as 1.6 percent, outperforming the pan-European STOXX 600 index. The rally pushed the main world stocks index, the MSCI’s 47-country ‘All-World’ index, to a record high.

Spain’s 10-year government bond yield -- which moves inversely to the price -- dropped 5 basis points to 1.65 percent in early trade, according to Tradeweb data.

In Brussels, there was relief that the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy now had at least bought some time to deal with a crisis that was still far from over.

One EU official said Puigdemont “seems to have listened to advice not to do something irreversible”.

The Catalan crisis has deeply divided the northeastern region itself as well as the Spanish nation. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of about 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.

The stakes are high -- losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.

(Reuters) - Fast-moving wildfires raging across Northern California’s wine country have killed 17 people, left about 150 missing and destroyed 1,500 homes, wineries and other structures, state fire officials said on Tuesday.

The flames from 17 major blazes have blackened more than 115,000 acres (46,500 hectares) since fires broke out on Sunday amid hot, dry conditions and high winds.

The Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office said 11 of the fatalities were in its jurisdiction, where 155 people were still missing, although 45 others had been found and some of those unaccounted for may be due to confusion surrounding evacuations.

In Napa County, the dead included 100-year-old Charles Rippey and his wife, Sarah,, 98, according to the county sheriff’s office. No other details on that incident or the other fatalities were immediately available.

Crews took advantage of cooler temperatures, lower winds and coastal fog on Tuesday to make headway against the fires but cautioned that homes, wineries and other structures remained at risk.

“We need to jump on it and take advantage of this lull before any other wind jumps up,” said Steve Crawford, a CAL FIRE operations chief, at an afternoon briefing. “There’s a lot of devastation out there, people running around who just lost everything.”

North of San Francisco, the fires reduced houses to ashes in several communities. The city of Santa Rosa was particularly hard hit by the so-called Tubbs Fire, which damaged a Hilton hotel and destroyed a mobile home park.

Tens of thousands of residents were forced to flee, as schools closed and at least two hospitals in Sonoma County were temporarily shuttered.

Napa Valley Vintners, a trade group with 550 members, said it was too early to estimate the economic impact of the fires. At least four wineries had suffered “total or very significant losses,” and at least nine reported damage to their winery, outbuildings or surrounding vineyards, the group said.

Ninety percent of grapes had been picked before the fires started, with almost all of those still on the vine Cabernet Sauvignon, a thick-skinned variety that is not expected to be impacted by smoke from the fires.

In addition to potential damage to vineyards from fire itself, sustained exposure to heavy smoke can taint unpicked grapes, according to wine-making experts.

More than 91,000 homes and businesses served by Pacific Gas & Electric were without power, with most of those customers in Northern California’s Sonoma and Napa counties, and gas was shut off to 28,000 customers, representatives for the utility company said.

California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in Napa, Sonoma and five other counties.

In Southern California, the so-called Canyon Fire 2 has spread to 7,500 acres (3,035 hectares) in Orange County, destroying 14 structures and damaging 22, fire spokesman Thanh Nguyen said.

(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is betting it can get its money-making mojo back by pitching creative deals to big, complex clients, marking a return to its investment banking roots as trading revenue slows.

The Wall Street bank is forming a group, known internally as the Innovation Lab, focused on generating compelling deal ideas for companies like Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) or Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp’s (9984.T) $93 billion investment fund, people familiar with the matter said.

The new “brain trust,” as one insider called it, is aimed at supercharging investment banking revenue as trading, for many years Goldman’s profit engine, has faltered amid regulations and market trends that hurt the bank more than rivals.

From 2009-2016, Goldman’s annual trading revenue fell by more than $18 billion, or 32 percent, while investment banking revenue rose by $1.3 billion, or 26 percent. That trend has accelerated this year.

Analysts expect Goldman to reveal more trading pain when it reports third-quarter results on Tuesday, building on two consecutive quarters of declines.

After facing angry questions from shareholders, Goldman last month unveiled a plan to boost annual revenue by $5 billion.

Management has emphasized Goldman’s roots as a strategic adviser to corporations, wealthy families and investment funds, and has also expanded into areas like consumer lending.

But while fees from those services can be more reliable than trading, analysts say Goldman will not replace the income from its stock and bond market heyday any time soon.

“Many investors still view it as a ‘show me’ story because the initiatives are in businesses that are highly competitive,” said Steven Chubak, a banking analyst with Instinet.

A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment on the new group.

Led by Goldman dealmakers Brian DeCenzo and James Morris, the group will perform a different role than traditional bankers focused broadly on pitching mergers and acquisitions to big companies, the people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media.

The group is expected to come up with out-of-the box ideas and focus on clients who want to acquire or make big investments in businesses across industries, and do not fit neatly into individual categories, like technology or industrials, that sector bankers already cover.

Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses across aerospace, energy industrials, financials, transportation, consumer products and food. Meanwhile, SoftBank’s Vision Fund has invested in companies ranging from satellite startup OneWeb to asset manager Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG.N).

On top of spotting deal opportunities, the new team will analyze broad trends like the impact of oil prices across various sectors.

DeCenzo and Morris were previously part of Goldman’s financial sponsors group, which scouts deals for private equity firms.

The group is the latest change under new management of the investment bank, which earlier this year elevated Gregg Lemkau and Marc Nachmann as co-heads alongside John Waldron.

Under their leadership, the business has added bankers to cities like Atlanta and Dallas to serve local clients more closely, and hired dealmakers at the partner level from Wall Street rivals. They have also installed programmers alongside dealmakers to increase productivity and give clients better advice.

LONDON (Reuters) - A special production of the 1960s rock musical “Hair”, tweaked for the age of Trump, premieres in London this week to mark the ground-breaking show’s 50th anniversary.

The show, staged in London’s Vaults theater, features updates to the dialogue and song lyrics written by James Rado, who wrote the show with Germoe Ragni in the 1960s, to comment on contemporary politics.

Among the updates, characters sing about making “America stronger,” - a reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan. The new production also features new scenes and other dialogue.

“I think what Jim (Rado) wanted to do was just make it a little bit more apparent and clear that America and other Western countries, including Britain, haven’t necessarily moved forward as quickly as we’d hoped,” director Jonathan O‘Boyle, told Reuters.

It was highly controversial upon its first release for its full-frontal nudity, liberal depiction of drug taking and irreverent treatment of the American flag, which was displayed up-side down and laid on the floor.

The show had lengthy runs on Broadway and on London’s West End, and songs like “Aquarius” and “Good Morning Starshine” helped the original Broadway cast recording sell almost three million copies.

Despite the social and political changes since the show’s creation, its themes of racism, fears of nuclear war - and it’s irreverent treatment of the American flag - mean that is still relevant to the current political discussion.

“Everything that hippies were fighting for then, is still needing to be fought for today,” said Andy Coxon, who plays hippy George Berger. “You’d be surprised how much things haven’t changed. A lot has, we still have a way to go.”

And would the U.S. president himself, currently embroiled in a row over American football players kneeling during the playing of the national anthem in protest, approve of the show?

“He’d probably hate it,” said O‘Boyle.",'Hair' gets a little new styling for the age of Trump,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CG1BL-OCAEN

The Chinese foreign ministry insists it takes a “cautious and responsible attitude” to military drone exports.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is nearing completion of new “Buy American” rules to make it easier to sell U.S.-made military drones overseas and compete against fast-growing Chinese and Israeli rivals, senior U.S. officials said.

While President Donald Trump’s aides work on relaxing domestic regulations on drone sales to select allies, Washington will also seek to renegotiate a 1987 missile-control pact with the aim of loosening international restrictions on U.S. exports of unmanned aircraft, according to government and industry sources.

At home, the U.S. administration is pressing ahead with its revamp of drone export policy under heavy pressure from American manufacturers and in defiance of human rights advocates who warn of the risk of fueling instability in hot spots including the Middle East and South Asia.

The changes, part of a broader effort to overhaul U.S. arms export protocols, could be rolled out by the end of the year under a presidential policy decree, the administration officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

The aim is to help U.S. drone makers, pioneers in remote-controlled aircraft that have become a centerpiece of counterterrorism strategy, reassert themselves in the overseas market where China, Israel and others often sell under less-cumbersome restrictions.

Simplified export rules could easily generate thousands of jobs, but it’s too early to be more specific, said Remy Nathan, a lobbyist with the Aerospace Industry Association. The main beneficiaries would be top U.S. drone makers General Atomics, Boeing (BA.N), Northrop Grumman (NOC.N), Textron (TXT.N) and Lockheed Martin (LMT.N).

“This will allow us to get in the game in a way that we’ve never been before,” said one senior U.S. official.

‘BUY AMERICAN’ AGENDA

Regulations are expected to be loosened especially on the sale of unarmed intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance drones, the most sophisticated of which carry high-resolution cameras and laser-guided targeting systems to aid missiles fired from warplanes, naval vessels or ground launchers.

Deliberations have been more complicated, however, on how to alter export rules for missile-equipped drones like the Predator and Reaper. Hunter-killer drones, which have essentially changed the face of modern warfare, are increasingly in demand and U.S. models considered the most advanced.

The push is not only part of Trump‘s “Buy American” agenda to boost U.S. business abroad but also reflects a more export-friendly approach to weapons sales that the administration sees as a way to wield influence with foreign partners, the senior official said.

Under a draft of the new rules, a classified list of countries numbering in double digits would be given more of a fast-track treatment for military drone purchases, a second senior official said. The favored group would include some of Washington’s closest NATO allies and partners in the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence alliance: Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, according to the industry source.

Rachel Stohl, director of the conventional defense program at the Stimson Center in Washington, said if U.S. drone export rules become too lenient, they could give more governments with poor human rights records the means to “target their own civilians.”

Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, revised the policy for military drone exports in 2015. But U.S. manufacturers complained it was still too restrictive compared with main competitors China and Israel.

U.S. drone makers are vying for a larger share of the global military drone market. Even before the coming changes, the Teal Group, a market research firm, has forecast sales will rise from $2.8 billion in 2016 to $9.4 billion in 2025.

Linden Blue, CEO of privately held General Atomics, the U.S. leader in military drones, visited the White House recently to lobby for his industry, a person familiar with the discussions said.

Among the U.S. changes will be a formal reinterpretation of the “presumption of denial”, a longstanding obstacle to most military drones sales, that would make it easier and faster to secure approval, the officials said.

Britain, and only recently Italy, are the only countries that had been allowed to buy armed U.S. drones.

A long-delayed $2 billion sale to India of General Atomics’ Guardian surveillance drones finally secured U.S. approval in June. But New Delhi’s request for armed drones has stalled.

A major hurdle to expanded sales of the most powerful U.S. drones is the Missile Technology Control Regime, or MTCR, a 1987 accord signed by the United States and 34 other countries, which set rules for the sale and purchase of missiles.

It categorizes drones with a range greater than of 185 miles (300 km) and a payload above 1,100 pounds (500 kg) as cruise missiles, requiring extremely tight import/export controls. To gain an international stamp of approval for the relaxed U.S. export rules, U.S. officials want the MTCR renegotiated.

State Department officials attending an annual meeting of the missile-control group in Dublin next week will present a “discussion paper” proposing that sales of drones – which did not exist when the agreement was created – be treated more leniently than the missile technology that the MTCR was designed to regulate, according to a U.S. official and industry sources.

There is no guarantee of a consensus. Russia, which has NATO members along its borders, could resist such changes, the U.S. official said.

CHINA AND ISRAEL

China, which is not an MTCR signatory, has pushed ahead with drone sales to some countries with close ties to Washington, such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria, but which have failed to pass U.S. regulatory muster.

Chinese models such as the CH-3 and CH-4 have been compared to the Reaper but are much cheaper. U.S. officials said Beijing sells them with few strings attached.

The Chinese foreign ministry insists it takes a “cautious and responsible attitude” to military drone exports.

Israel, which is outside the MTCR but has pledged to abide by it, competes with U.S. manufacturers on the basis of high-tech standards. But it will not sell to neighbors in the volatile Middle East. Israel sold $525 million worth of drones overseas in 2016, according defense ministry data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chinese officials probably don’t read literary critic Harold Bloom. If they do, they are ignoring his advice to “make what is implicit ... finely explicit.” A dispute over whether the government will stand behind the potential liabilities of Syngenta (SYNN.S), a Swiss seed maker acquired by a Chinese state firm earlier this year for about $43 billion, shows the problems that result from habitual murkiness.

Syngenta is potentially on the hook for a big legal bill after U.S. farmers and agricultural firms claimed it sold them seeds for a strain of corn unapproved for export to the People’s Republic. China’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, which oversees central state-owned companies such as Syngenta’s parent, ChemChina, says the government won’t foot those costs. Rating agency Standard & Poor’s is now hinting it could strip away Syngenta’s prized investment-grade status. The seed maker’s immediate parent may be too indebted to help, with adjusted total debt of about 11 times EBITDA, according to Moody’s Investors Service.

At issue is a dynamic that plays out across China’s financial sector: implicit guarantees. It’s particularly rampant in local government financing, where investors assume – but without any actual confirmation – that the central government stands behind local governments, which in turn stand behind the companies they set up to fund projects. Even though Beijing’s actual support is uncertain, bond spreads between local governments and their financing vehicles, of which Fitch reckons around 4 trillion yuan ($610 billion) issued domestically since 2015 remain outstanding, are narrow.

That equilibrium works to Beijing’s interest. The official line keeps the door open for regulators to allow selective defaults, but avoid widespread blowups. Financially speaking, the unspoken promise that officials will step in if a crisis erupts keeps borrowing costs low.

In practice, Syngenta is now part and parcel of a state company. It would be better for the government to accept that, and show investors where the line really lies. Implicit guarantees distort capital flows and encourage investors to underprice risk. Then again, at a time when politicians and capital providers alike worry about the real levels of debt in China’s financial system, keeping things murky may seem like the safest strategy.",Breakingviews - Syngenta puts Beijing’s unspoken promises to test,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syngenta-credit-rating-breakingviews/breakingviews-syngenta-puts-beijings-unspoken-promises-to-test-idUSKBN1CG0I6

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives’ Appropriations Committee has approved $36.5 billion in emergency funding for relief and recovery from the recent devastating hurricanes and wildfires, a spokeswoman for the committee’s chairman said late on Tuesday.

The bill includes $7 billion more funding than the White House had sought last week, and included nearly $6 billion more for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) than the administration’s request.

The committee’s bill also includes $576.6 million for wildfire efforts, $16 billion for the National Flood Insurance program, and a provision enabling low-income Puerto Ricans to receive emergency nutrition assistance, said Jennifer Hing, spokeswoman for Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, the committee chairman.

It was not immediately clear when the bill would move to the floor to be voted on by the entire House.

The United States has been battered by a series of hurricanes in the Caribbean, Texas and Florida and wildfires in California.

President Donald Trump has also asked Congress to approve a $4.9 billion government loan to help Puerto Rico pay some of its bills in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria.

Berlin (Reuters) - Die scheidende Bundeswirtschaftsministerin Brigitte Zypries sieht trotz des Daueraufschwungs eine Menge Baustellen für die künftige Regierung.

Nach den neuen Herbstprognosen haben sich die Konjunkturaussichten für Deutschland zwar deutlich verbessert. Aber nun dürfe man die Hände nicht in den Schoß legen, sagte die SPD-Politikerin am Mittwoch in Berlin. So gebe es nach wie vor abgehängte Regionen mit hoher Arbeitslosigkeit. “Es bleibt weiter ein Problem, dass wir noch immer relativ viele geringfügig beschäftigte Personen habe.” Zudem gebe es zu viele Frauen und Männer mit befristeten Jobs. “Das alles sind Aufgaben, die weiter angegangen werden müssen”, mahnte Zypries.

Die künftige Bundesregierung - womöglich aus Union, FDP und Grünen - kann mit kräftigem Rückenwind von der Konjunktur starten. Das Bruttoinlandsprodukt wird den Herbstprognosen der alten Regierung zufolge in diesem Jahr um 2,0 und 2018 um 1,9 Prozent wachsen. Im April waren nur 1,5 beziehungsweise 1,6 Prozent veranschlagt worden. “Der deutschen Wirtschaft geht es gut”, betonte Zypries. “Die Konjunktur hat an Schwung und Breite gewonnen und bleibt auch in den kommenden Jahren auf Wachstumskurs.”

“UNSERE POLITIK TRÄGT FRÜCHTE”

Die Ministerin betonte die Erfolge der scheidenden schwarz-roten Koalition. “In Deutschland wird wieder mehr investiert”, sagte sie. “Damit trägt unsere Wirtschaftspolitik Früchte.” So seien die öffentlichen Ausgaben für Investitionen in den vergangenen vier Jahren um 45 Prozent auf insgesamt 36 Milliarden Euro erhöht worden. Auch seien Kommunen entlastet, Bürokratie abgebaut und neu gegründete Firmen (Start-ups) mit mehr Risikokapital gefördert worden. Die Einführung des Mindestlohns habe zu größeren Lohsteigerungen geführt, was wiederum den Konsum beflügele.

Ein Grund für den gestiegenen Konjunkturoptimismus ist auch die anziehende Weltwirtschaft. Der globale Handel wachse stärker als bislang angenommen, nicht zuletzt durch die Erholung der Euro-Zone, führte Zypries aus.

Die Regierung erwartet in diesem Jahr einen Anstieg der Erwerbstätigkeit um 660.000 und 2018 ein weiteres Plus um 495.000 Personen auf das Rekordniveau von 44,8 Millionen. Zugleich werde die Arbeitslosigkeit in diesem Jahr um 155.000 und im nächsten Jahr um 70.000 auf dann knapp unter 2,5 Millionen sinken.

Die Wachstumsprognose des Bundes bildet die Grundlage für die amtliche Steuerschätzung im November.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to dramatically increase the country’s nuclear arsenal, he said in a meeting with his national security advisers in July, NBC News reported on Wednesday, citing three officials who were present in the room.

Trump’s reported comments come as tensions remained high with North Korea and as Trump is expected to make an announcement on whether to decertify the international deal surrounding Iran’s nuclear program.

The president spoke on July after he was shown a chart indicating the stockpile of U.S. nuclear weapons had slid from a high of 32,000 in the 1960s. Trump said he wanted to have that same number now, NBC reported.

The United States currently has about 4,000 nuclear warheads earmarked for use in its military stockpile, according to the Federation of American Scientists.

In a post on Twitter on Wednesday, the president said, “Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a ‘tenfold’ increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction, made up to demean. NBC = CNN!”

Trump said in an interview with Reuters in February that he wanted to ensure that the U.S. nuclear arsenal was at the “top of the pack.”

Although U.S. presidents have modernized weapons stockpiles over the years, adding to the nuclear arsenal or building a prohibited type of weapon would be a violation of treaty agreements, according to NBC.

After the meeting, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson referred to Trump as a “moron,” according to NBC. U.S. news reports have painted the relationship between Trump and Tillerson as tense.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The global economic recovery has strengthened financial stability but easy monetary and financial conditions against a backdrop of sluggish inflation is elevating medium-term risks, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday.

The IMF, whose autumn meetings with the World Bank get under way in Washington later this week, also noted risks are rotating from banks, which have fortified their balance sheets, to financial markets as credit spreads compress, volatility declines and asset prices rise.

“While increased risk appetite and search for yield are a welcome and intended consequence of unconventional monetary policy measures...there are risks if these trends extend too far,” the IMF said in its biannual global financial stability update.

A prolonged search for yield has raised the sensitivity of the financial system to market and liquidity risks, the Fund said, keeping those risks elevated.

The IMF urged national regulators to consider carefully any proposals that would substantially ease capital, liquidity or prudential standards in “light of their potential to damage the agenda of global regulatory harmonization.”

The improvement in near-term financial stability has been underpinned by a broad-based global economic upswing.

On Tuesday, the IMF upgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2017 by 0.1 percentage point to 3.6 percent, and to 3.7 percent for 2018, from its April and July outlook, driven by a pickup in trade, investment, and consumer confidence.

But global central banks have found themselves at different stages in removing monetary policy accommodation, which has been complicated by overall sluggish inflation.

The U.S. Federal Reserve has picked up the pace of interest rate rises since it began a tightening cycle in late 2015, but the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have yet to move away from negative rates and bond buying.

“Too quick an adjustment in monetary policies could cause unwanted turbulence in financial markets and set back progress toward inflation targets,” the IMF said in its report, while keeping rates low for too long may cause a harmful buildup in market and credit risks.

Elsewhere, the Fund warned that leverage in the non-financial sector was now higher than before the financial crisis across the so-called G20 advanced economies as a whole.

Such leverage made households and companies more vulnerable to changes in interest rates and weaker economic activity.

“The key challenge confronting policymakers is to ensure that the buildup of financial vulnerabilities is contained while monetary policy remains supportive of the global recovery,” the IMF warned. “Otherwise, rising debt loads and overstretched asset valuations could undermine market confidence in the future, with repercussions that could put global growth at risk.”","Global financial stability has improved, but risks ahead: IMF",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-g20-stability/global-financial-stability-has-improved-but-risks-ahead-imf-idINKBN1CG1IC?il=0

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid.
The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play.
The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.
From 2009-2011, he led the Department of Justice’s disability rights enforcement as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.","On September 7, on a straight party-line vote, the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee moved forward a bill that would gut key protections for people with disabilities. Although versions of this legislation had been introduced in prior years, the bill did not go anywhere while President Barack Obama stood ready to veto it. But now that President Donald Trump, whose actions have demonstrated hostility to civil rights, occupies the White House, the proposal presents a real risk of passage. If Republicans in Congress do eviscerate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it will be the culmination of their recent abandonment of the bipartisan consensus in favor of inclusion and equality for disabled persons.

Although the partisan divide in Washington has often seemed unbridgeable, disability rights long united lawmakers. Republican President George H.W. Bush referred to the ADA, which he signed in 1990, as one of his “proudest achievements.” The law guaranteed that people with disabilities would have access to, and be free from discrimination by, employers, businesses, and government agencies. In 2008, after a series of court decisions that gave a narrow reading to the ADA, a Democratic Congress passed amendments to the ADA reasserting the statute’s broad coverage - and President George W. Bush signed it.

The Trump administration is hacking away at disability rights online and in the workplace, while Trump and congressional Republicans work to gut funding for programs people with disabilities rely on such as Medicaid. The partial ADA-repeal bill is only the most overt assault on disability rights - the culmination of a shift that began when, in December 2012, 38 Republican senators denied the two-thirds vote needed for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was modeled on the ADA and ardently supported by disabled GOP luminaries such as former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But while that action was merely symbolic red meat for their base – conservatives worried it would inhibit homeschooling and infringe U.S. sovereignty - this new proposal could cause tangible and long-lasting harm.

The current bill, misleadingly titled the “ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017,” would render largely unenforceable key ADA requirements that businesses be accessible to disabled consumers – requirements that they provide ramps instead of stairs where possible, that doorways be wide enough for wheelchairs and so forth.

For wheelchair users, a single step – or a door that is a bit too narrow – can be the barrier that prevents them from patronizing a store. A few inches can make the difference between being full participants in civic and economic life and being dependent on others and shut off from the community.

Businesses have had 27 years to learn about and conform to the ADA’s requirements. But too many still fail to comply with the law, because enforcement relies principally on suits by disabled individuals. Wheelchair users, blind persons, and other people with disabilities encounter inaccessible businesses on a daily basis. According to 2016 Department of Labor statistics, only 31.2 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities had jobs, compared to 76.4 percent of working-age nondisabled Americans. The failure of employers, including stores and restaurants, to provide required accommodations is one of the key reasons for this persistent gap. Surveys show inaccessibility also causes people with disabilities to eat out less often.

The ADA does not give a disabled customer the right to receive damages for a denial of service, just an injunction that requires the owner to remove the barrier. This limitation already creates an incentive for inaccessible businesses to wait until they are sued before complying. Under the bill that recently passed the judiciary committee, the incentive to wait and see will be even greater. The proposal would prevent a disabled person from suing a business that violates the ADA as long as the business makes “substantial progress in removing the barrier,” within six months of being notified. A business might be able to avoid ever complying with the ADA or facing a lawsuit. It’s a system designed to allow businesses to delay until the victim runs out of energy or money to keep pursuing them.

Sponsors of the “ADA Education and Reform Act,” such as Texas Republican Ted Poe, say that the bill is necessary to stop unscrupulous lawyers from bringing frivolous or abusive ADA cases against small businesses. But state bars, and individual judges, already have ample authority to sanction attorneys who engage in such unprofessional conduct. And the ADA itself protects the interests of business owners by providing that an existing facility need not remove accessibility barriers unless doing so is easy to accomplish without significant expense.

Rather than protecting legitimate business interests, the bill pending in Congress would give a reprieve to enterprises that have had 27 years to comply with the law but have not yet done so. That is a betrayal of the basic promise of the ADA – that people with disabilities would be treated as equal citizens, with full access to America’s civic and economic life.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department has already reversed course in a key lawsuit, prosecuted by the Obama administration, involving the rights of disabled workers to retain their jobs. The White House has also signaled a halt to the Obama-era efforts to adopt regulations ensuring that the Internet is accessible to blind people and others with disabilities.

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid. If they succeed Republicans would remove benefits that allow people with disabilities to access health insurance and home health services. Instead of staying in their communities and possibly working, many would be institutionalized. Trump has also proposed in his budget to cut drastically into Social Security Disability Insurance, the only source of income for millions of Americans unable to work.

The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play. The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mylan N.V. is best known for producing EpiPen emergency allergy treatments and generic drugs.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian authorities have agreed to regulate the crypto-currency market and hope to set out how this regulation will work by the end of the year, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday.

Crypto-currencies such as bitcoin enable individuals to transfer value to each other and pay for goods and services bypassing banks and the mainstream financial system.

They count technology enthusiasts, speculators attracted by big price swings and libertarians skeptical of government monetary policy among their fans worldwide. But banks have mostly steered clear of crypto-currencies, and some governments and central banks have been strongly critical of them.

On Tuesday President Vladimir Putin chaired a meeting of senior Russian officials on the issue, and said the crypto-currencies were risky and used for crime. Russia’s central bank has said it would block websites selling bitcoin and its rivals to households.

“The president has spoken of the problems related to crypto-currencies. These are difficulties regarding ... money laundering and cases that are related to identification issues,” TASS news agency quoted Siluanov as saying on Wednesday.

“That’s why we have agreed that the state should regulate the issuing of crypto-currencies, their mining and turnover. The state should take all this under control,” said Siluanov, who attended Tuesday’s meeting with Putin.

Siluanov’s comments echoed his earlier calls to control and supervise the market for virtual currencies. Siluanov said his ministry would work with the central bank on regulating crypto-currencies in Russia.

Siluanov’s deputy Alexei Moiseev said on Wednesday that Russia’s Federal Tax Service could also be involved as Moscow wants to collect taxes from those who mine crypto-currencies.

Investors, worried about the financial impact and potential legal fallout, again dumped Kobe Steel stock, wiping about $1.6 billion off its market value in two days.

Kobe Steel said late on Wednesday it found 70 cases of tampered data on materials used in optical disks and liquid crystal displays at its Kobelco Research Institute Inc, which makes and tests products for the company. It also found one case of falsified data on iron powder products shipped to a customer.

An internal probe carried out since it found issues in its aluminum and copper business has not found other cases of data tampering, Yoshihiko Katsukawa, a managing executive officer at Kobe Steel, told a news conference.

He said the company - which has said it was examining possible data falsifications going back 10 years - has begun an external investigation of all its units, including those overseas.

“We can’t rule out the possibility that the external investigation will find other cases,” Katsukawa said, adding no customers had raised any safety issues or stopped buying its products.

One customer, Central Japan Railway (9022.T), said some parts it received from Kobe Steel for its bullet trains did not meet Japanese Industrial Standards, but there were no safety issues.

Kobe Steel President Hiroya Kawasaki will meet a senior official at the industry ministry on Thursday, the ministry said in a statement.

The new revelations come after Kobe Steel admitted at the weekend it had falsified data about the quality of aluminum and copper products used in cars, aircraft, space rockets and defense equipment - a fresh blow to Japanese manufacturers’ reputation for quality production.

There have been previous cases in Japan involving falsified data, including at Nissan Motor (7201.T), Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) and Takata, which filed for bankruptcy this year over faulty airbags that were blamed for 17 deaths and scores of injuries.

In 2015, it was revealed that Toyo Tire & Rubber (5105.T) fabricated data to secure government approval for materials to absorb shocks from earthquakes. Conglomerate Toshiba Corp (6502.T) is still battling the fallout of a scandal over reporting inflated profits.

The corrosive business practices have raised broader questions over corporate governance in Japan, and cast doubt on the integrity of a manufacturing industry once the envy of the world.

“The scandal looks similar to that of Toyo Tire, and not as massive (or) devastating as Takata‘s. Kobe Steel’s technology is not something easily substitutable by others, and existing customers have nowhere else to go,” said Yasuo Sakuma, Chief Investment Officer at Libra Investments in Tokyo.

Kobe Steel faces potential costs from any product recalls, replacements and possible litigation, including class-action suits in the United States, Yuji Matsumoto, an analyst at Nomura Securities, said in a report.

The data tampering at its aluminum unit could also hit plans to expand the business as carmakers increasingly turn to the material, which is lighter than steel, to meet tighter environmental rules.

“Aluminum is one of Kobe Steel’s key focus areas in the medium term as part of its strategy to help lighten vehicles, (and) this will certainly have a negative impact on the expansion,” Matsumoto noted.

Multinationals including Toyota Motor (7203.T), Ford Motor (F.N) and planemakers Boeing (BA.N) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) have said they are investigating the safety of products from Kobe Steel.

REPEAT OFFENDER?

It’s not the first time Kobe Steel has been caught up in falsifying data.

In June of last year, it said an affiliate, Shinko Wire Stainless Co, falsified data on tests for tensile strength of some stainless steel wire for springs over a period of more than nine years. And in 2006, Kobe Steel said its Kakogawa steelworks in western Japan falsified soot emissions data over five years.

In a statement on Wednesday, Kobe Steel denied a Nikkei business daily report that it intended to put its real estate business up for sale to help shore up its finances. The company said it was assessing its options.

The steelmaker reported losses in the last two financial years, but has said it expects to return to profit this year.

(Reuters) - Cash-strapped U.S. shale firms scaled back their hedging programs in the first quarter, leaving them more vulnerable to tumbling spot market prices just after OPEC reached a landmark deal to curb global supply.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

MUMBAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Profits from India’s top firms are expected to have swung back to growth in July-September from a decline in the previous quarter, though economic headwinds are likely to have kept the pace of growth sluggish.

The latest results are critical for investors, marking the first quarter since the rollout of a national goods and services tax (GST) on July 1 and coming amid a wider retreat in share markets on investor concern about stocks being overvalued.

Forecasts compiled by Reuters show net profits are expected to rise 12.8 percent in the latest quarter for members of the main NSE index, known as Nifty, marking a recovery from the 1 percent fall in net profits in April-June.

That would be less than half the 33 percent increase posted in the January-March quarter and lag the 17.7 percent rise in October-December last year.

Profits are expected to be driven by energy and metals firms benefiting from stronger commodity prices, while telecoms are expected to post weak results due to aggressive competition. Drug makers profits are also likely to have suffered, mostly from regulatory challenges in the key U.S. market.

However, the impact of India’s new GST on earnings remains the biggest unknown for investors positioning themselves for the earnings season.

Uncertainty caused by companies rushing to prepare for the new tax and cutting production dented profits in the April-June quarter more than analysts had initially expected.

Fund managers now warn another disappointing set of results could hurt India’s recent bull run.

Nilesh Shah, managing director at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management, said markets were pricing in a recovery in earnings in the next 3-5 quarters.

He said markets would correct if earnings don’t show a solid recovery.

Meanwhile, operating profits are expected to rise 11.5 percent from a year earlier, while revenues are expected to advance 6.5 percent.

The results come at a time of deep uncertainty for markets. The Nifty has fallen about 1.9 percent since hitting a record high on Sept. 19, amid heavy foreign selling and rising worries as economic growth slows to its weakest pace in three years.

The Nifty is trading at a price to current fiscal year’s earnings (PE) ratio of 21.3, a healthy premium over the historic five-year average of 16.8.

Investors say the GST’s impact is hard to measure given it can affect virtually every aspect of the economy from consumer purchases to industrial production. Some manufacturers are expected to have restored inventory levels in the latest quarter.

“We had seen an uptick in terms of re-stock in July, which was positively received by the markets,” said Sunil Sharma, chief investment officer at Sanctum Wealth Management.

(Reuters) - CSX Corp’s chief executive apologized to customers for months of service disruptions at the No. 3 U.S. railroad but passionately defended his operating strategy, at a hearing on Wednesday called by the top U.S. rail regulator.

Seated before two regulators at the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) in Washington, CSX Chief Executive Hunter Harrison defended his vision for streamlining efficiency, which he calls “precision scheduled railroading.”

The STB announced the public hearing in August after customers complained of service issues, including longer transit times, unreliable switching operations, inefficient car routings and poor communications with CSX customer service.

Harrison, appointed to the job amid investor fanfare in March, said his strategy was critical to his turnarounds of two Canadian railroads - Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd and Canadian National Railway Co.

Since he took over, Harrison has rapidly closed CSX rail yards, lengthened trains, mothballed locomotives, and slashed overtime pay and hundreds of jobs. He changed the way rail cars are sorted in yards and replaced “unit” trains carrying a single commodity like coal or grain to carry diverse freight.

“If I don’t accomplish anything else today, I want to apologize to our valued shippers,” Harrison said on Wednesday. “Whatever problems we’ve had, we’ve had internally, we’ve made some mistakes, this is not a failure of precision scheduled railroading.”

Harrison spoke before Cargill Inc, Dow Chemical Co and seven other major rail customers were due to testify about their experiences with CSX’s network.

CSX’s service disruptions have created logistical headaches for companies ranging from chemical and agricultural to automotive and steel producers whose supply chains, plants and distribution channels rely on CSX’s rail network across the eastern United States.

The STB’s “listening session” was the first public forum for customers to air grievances and give Harrison the chance to defend his strategy. The agency has been reviewing CSX’s performance weekly and talking to senior management for months.

At least three companies have withdrawn requests to testify as service has improved. Other companies due to testify on Wednesday included The Chemours Company, Kellogg Company and Murray Energy Corp, the largest private U.S. coal mining company.

An assortment of trade groups including automotive, grain, and paper lobbyists expected to speak on Wednesday have called on Congress to make it easier for shippers to file complaints and to allow other operators to use CSX track during service disruptions.

Other stakeholders have filed comments with the STB.","CSX CEO Harrison apologizes to rail customers, defends strategy",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-csx-disruptions/csx-ceo-harrison-apologizes-to-rail-customers-defends-strategy-idUSKBN1CG1BW?il=0

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Three men blew themselves up near the police headquarters in central Damascus on Wednesday, the second such attack to hit the Syrian capital this month, state media said.

The blasts killed two people and injured six others, it said, citing the Interior Ministry.

Two suicide bombers tried to storm the police command center and clashed with guards before detonating explosive devices outside on Khalid bin al-Walid street, the Damascus police chief said on state TV.

Police forces then chased down the third attacker, who blew himself up nearby at the entrance of a clothes market.

“Our investigations are ongoing to find out where they came from and how,” Mohammad Kheir Ismail said from outside the headquarters. “The issue has been controlled.”

Islamic State’s media unit Amaq reported the attack without outright claiming responsibility for it.

Earlier this month, militants struck a police station in another part of Damascus, with 17 reported dead in that suicide bombing which Islamic State claimed.

The capital has enjoyed relative security as Syria’s six-year war has raged on nearby and across the country. But several such attacks have hit Damascus in recent years, including a car bomb that killed 20 people in July.

Islamic State and Tahrir al-Sham - led by militants formerly linked to al Qaeda - have each claimed separate suicide blasts that killed scores of people in Damascus before.

“The desperate suicide attempts come as a response to the victories of the Syrian Arab Army and the Interior Ministry is fully ready to thwart any terrorist act,” state television quoted the minister as saying.

With the help of Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, the Damascus government has pushed back rebels in western Syria, shoring up its rule over the main urban centers. In recent months, it has also marched eastwards against Islamic State.

Syrian troops and allied forces have captured several suburbs of Damascus from rebel factions over the past year.

LORDSTOWN, Ohio (Reuters) - Wall Street is fretting that the U.S. auto industry is heading for a downturn, but for thousands of workers at General Motors Co factories in the United States, the hard times are already here.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

BERLIN (Reuters) - A co-leader of Germany’s Greens, a possible partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s next government, said on Wednesday the next head of the Eurogroup should support a shift away from austerity and toward investment and more fiscal solidarity.

The Greens are set to start exploratory talks next week with Merkel’s conservatives on forming a coalition government that also includes the pro-business, fiscally hawkish Free Democrats (FDP) after an election in September.

Unlike the FDP, who have cautioned against proposals by French President Emmanuel Macron for deeper fiscal integration in the single currency bloc, the Greens support common tax collection and an investment pact within the 19-country euro zone.

In January, Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem will step down as president of the Eurogroup, an informal body that plays a key role in shaping the economic policy of the bloc. The group will vote for a new chairman at a meeting in December.

“The upcoming leadership switch at the Eurogroup should be used as an opportunity for a new start in European fiscal and economic policy,” Greens co-chief Simone Peter said in a statement.

“Europe will gain from more solidarity. Europe’s fiscal policy needs a shift away from austerity toward a common pact for tax collection and investments, which would trigger social and ecological innovations.”

Like his German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble, Dijsselbloem opposes so-called transfers from richer euro zone states to poorer ones like Greece.

“It would be good for Europe if the chairman of the Eurogroup holds the position of European Finance Minister who reports to the European Parliament,” Peter said.

“French President Macron has put good proposals on the table, which should be taken on by the next government and should not be torpedoed as former Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble did” to previous proposals.

Schaeuble has agreed to step down after the Sept. 24 election that weakened Merkel’s conservatives. He will become president of the German parliament.

“I don’t feel it was racist,” she said in an interview with the BBC on Wednesday.
Many Facebook and Twitter users said the clip signaled that white people were cleaner or more beautiful than black people and likened it to 19th century soap adverts that showed black people scrubbing themselves to become white.

Another point of contention was a label on a Dove product that said it was for “normal to dark skin”.","LONDON (Reuters) - A black model who appeared in a Dove advert denounced as racist by many social media users has defended the clip, saying that far from belittling black women it celebrated ethnic diversity.

Lola Ogunyemi unwittingly found herself at the center of an international furor over a 3-second video posted on Dove’s U.S. Facebook page which showed her removing her t-shirt to reveal a white woman, who then took hers off to reveal an Asian woman.

“I don’t feel it was racist,” she said in an interview with the BBC on Wednesday.

Many Facebook and Twitter users said the clip signaled that white people were cleaner or more beautiful than black people and likened it to 19th century soap adverts that showed black people scrubbing themselves to become white.

But Ogunyemi said the stills from the clip that shot around the internet over the weekend - which mostly showed only her and the white woman, leaving out the Asian woman - gave the wrong impression.

She said there was a 30-second, made-for-TV version that had other images and a slogan that made it much clearer that the intention was to say that all women deserved quality products.

“The screenshots that have taken the media by storm paint a slightly different picture,” she said.

Dove apologized for the Facebook clip, saying it had “missed the mark in representing women of colour thoughtfully”.

Ogunyemi, who is Nigerian, born in Britain and raised in the United States, said in an article in the Guardian that she had “grown up very aware of society’s opinion that dark-skinned people, especially women, would look better if our skin were lighter”.

Far from fitting into this narrative, she wrote, her participation in the Dove advert was a chance to “represent my dark-skinned sisters in a global beauty brand”.

She said Dove could have defended itself by better explaining the concept behind the clip.

However, she also said that Dove should have spotted the risk that the sequence of images could be interpreted as racist given that it had run into trouble over similar content in the past.

“They should have strong teams there that can point this kind of thing out before it goes to air,” she told the BBC.

Dove, a Unilever brand, was criticized in 2011 over an ad which showed three women side by side in front of a before-and-after image of cracked and smooth skin, with a black woman on the “before” side and a white woman on the “after” side.

On Oct. 15, he will have to certify whether Tehran is observing the 2015 multinational agreement to forego nuclear weapons. Trump has reluctantly certified Iran’s compliance, which is due quarterly, twice since taking office. This time, his belligerent address to the United Nations suggests he may not.If the United States follows through on threats to stop fulfilling its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as the Iran deal is formally known, its allies in Europe will be forced to choose between committing a crime and making a mistake. Whichever they decide, the strength of the transatlantic coalition – America’s most important and most reliable partnership – will be cast into doubt.

Iran is complying with the JCPOA. The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly confirmed it, as have partner intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). European leaders oppose refusing to certify Iranian compliance because it would make it likely that Congress will re-impose U.S. sanctions.

That would be only the first of two body blows to the agreement and to the alliance. The second would be an abuse of U.S. authority to re-impose United Nations sanctions.

The president has the power to force the United Nations to “snap back” the multilateral sanctions lifted under the deal – biting restrictions on Iranian banks and other businesses. If the United States re-imposes its own sanctions on Iran, it will inevitably avail itself of these UN sanctions, as well.

The Bush and Obama administrations persuaded Russia, China, and the UN Security Council to sanction Iran’s economy in order to limit its nuclear program. The JCPOA traded these sanctions for tight nuclear restrictions and inspections, but the United States and its partners worried that the Security Council might fail to re-impose the sanctions if Iran cheated, reducing Iran’s incentive for long-term compliance. A clever procedural solution was built into the JCPOA. Any participant in the deal can demand that the Security Council vote on a resolution to continue sanctions relief. The U.S. can veto that resolution, so even if the Security Council votes 14-1 all of the previous restrictions on Iran still snap back into place.

The JCPOA was built to respond to Iranian violations, even if Russia and China were no longer aligned with the United States and the EU. It was not designed to withstand a hawkish or isolationist America using its veto power outside of the terms of the deal or against the objections of its European partners.

Ironically, though, if the U.S. does choose to act alone, in the absence of Iranian violations and against the wishes of its allies, it might undermine the substantive goal of UN snapback, leaving empty sanctions on paper.

Once the UN applies – or in this case, re-applies – sanctions, the European Commission and European Union member countries are supposed to take a number of steps to make the UN sanctions part of EU law and regulation. This is serious business for Europe, which is strongly committed to the idea that, as a matter of international law, the UN can impose binding requirements on all members in the interest of international peace and security. The EU has occasionally faced legal challenges in applying UN sanctions, but it never has simply chosen to ignore a binding Security Council resolution as a matter of policy.

Europe would be sorely tempted to do exactly that on Iran. The snap back mechanism is designed for cases of Iranian non-compliance. Under the JCPOA, Washington does not need to prove that Iran has violated the deal, but Europe may decide that American bad faith justifies breaking from its own UN obligations. Certainly, Europe will categorically disagree with the U.S. policy. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, echoing the senior leadership of the UK, France, and Germany, said after Trump’s UN speech that the deal is working and must be preserved. If the U.S. withdraws, the EU has made clear it will do everything within its power to keep the agreement alive by sustaining newly established business ties with Iran.

Europe would thus be faced with a choice between a crime under international law and what it considers to be a policy mistake. In either case, Europe would be justifiably furious about being forced to choose between two important, deeply held policies – adherence to Security Council resolutions and implementation of the JCPOA.

Other countries, including Russia and China, may also prove lax in applying the restored sanctions, but this is both less uncommon and less important to Iran’s economic aspirations. U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA will hurt Iran’s economy badly, but will not achieve the kind of strangulating effect the broad international coalition had before the deal. A deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.

At the UN last week, President Trump called the Iran deal “an embarrassment to the United States.” He teased that he has made a decision about whether to certify Iranian compliance to Congress but refused to tell anyone, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, what he had decided. The weeks leading to the October 15 certification deadline may be Europe’s last, best chance to explain to President Trump and his advisors that undermining, let alone abrogating, the JCPOA would be a catastrophe not only for the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but also for the bond between the United States and Europe. The only winners would be Europe’s and America’s adversaries.",Commentary: Trump’s Iran threats risk a U.S. break with Europe,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blanc-iran-commentary/commentary-trumps-iran-threats-risk-a-u-s-break-with-europe-idUSKCN1C32E3

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Three men blew themselves up near the police headquarters in central Damascus on Wednesday, the second such attack to hit the Syrian capital this month, state media said.

The blasts killed two people and injured six others, it said, citing the Interior Ministry.

Two suicide bombers tried to storm the police command center and clashed with guards before detonating explosive devices outside on Khalid bin al-Walid street, the Damascus police chief said on state TV.

Police forces then chased down the third attacker, who blew himself up nearby at the entrance of a clothes market.

“Our investigations are ongoing to find out where they came from and how,” Mohammad Kheir Ismail said from outside the headquarters. “The issue has been controlled.”

Islamic State’s media unit Amaq reported the attack without outright claiming responsibility for it.

Earlier this month, militants struck a police station in another part of Damascus, with 17 reported dead in that suicide bombing which Islamic State claimed.

The capital has enjoyed relative security as Syria’s six-year war has raged on nearby and across the country. But several such attacks have hit Damascus in recent years, including a car bomb that killed 20 people in July.

Islamic State and Tahrir al-Sham - led by militants formerly linked to al Qaeda - have each claimed separate suicide blasts that killed scores of people in Damascus before.

“The desperate suicide attempts come as a response to the victories of the Syrian Arab Army and the Interior Ministry is fully ready to thwart any terrorist act,” state television quoted the minister as saying.

With the help of Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, the Damascus government has pushed back rebels in western Syria, shoring up its rule over the main urban centers. In recent months, it has also marched eastwards against Islamic State.

Syrian troops and allied forces have captured several suburbs of Damascus from rebel factions over the past year.

(Reuters) - Wall Street’s main indexes were little changed at open on Wednesday, as a jump in shares of consumer staples were offset by a drop in financials on the eve of their financial reports.

Kroger (KR.N) rose nearly 7 percent after the grocery chain said it would explore a potential sale of its convenience stores business.

That led the consumer staples index .SPLRCS up 0.36 percent. But those gains were offset by a 0.5 percent drop in financials.

Wall Street banks JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) both report on Thursday. But, analysts warn bank results will be held back by a lack of volatility compared to a year ago.

“Third quarter results of large banks are expected to be tepid,” said Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research. “Trading revenue (will be) down due to low volatility and loan growth remaining flat to slightly negative.”

With the S&P 500 up 14 percent in 2017, investors are betting on strong earnings growth across the S&P 500.

“It’s only a question of valuations, if they’ve gotten a little bit ahead of themselves, even though the earnings story remains positive,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

“Time will tell.”

At 9:36 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 4.04 points, or 0.02 percent, at 22,834.72, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 0.73 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,549.91 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 4.12 points, or 0.06 percent, at 6,583.13.

The dollar .DXY dipped to a 12-day low on worries that a feud with influential Tennessee Senator Bob Corker would undermine President Donald Trump’s efforts to pass tax changes.

FED AHEAD

Of interest will be minutes, due at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), of the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting, when it left interest rates unchanged but signaled one more hike was still on the cards by the end of 2017.

Worried by signs the U.S. economy had peaked, the Fed has slowed since raising rates twice within three months at the start of this year.

“There may not be any new information, but the market will be susceptible to any sort of negative headline that might come out,” Brown said.

Seven of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher.

General Electric (GE.N) slipped about 1 percent after JPMorgan said a dividend cut was “increasingly likely” and cut its price target on the stock.

J&J (JNJ.N) rose 1.5 percent after Jefferies upgraded the stock to “buy”.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to be 2.4 percent in 2017, the World Bank said on Wednesday, down from the 2.6 percent projected in April.

It said the downgrade was due to a number of reasons, including Nigeria’s failing to meet expectations but also broader conditions.

“Regional per capita output growth is forecast to be negative for the second consecutive year, while investment growth remains low, and productivity growth is falling,” it said.

Growth across the region, however, was seen rising 3.2 percent in 2018 and 3.5 percent in 2019, forecasts unchanged from earlier this year.

In its latest Africa Pulse report, the Bank said the region would be helped by better commodity prices. Sub-Saharan African economies have been hit by lower commodity prices which slowed growth in the last few years, cutting government revenues.

Albert Zeufack, World Bank chief economist for Africa, said the region’s growth recovery would partly be driven by the continent’s two largest economies - Nigeria and South Africa - exiting recession.

He said the two countries need “deeper reforms” to get back to pre-2014 levels of growth and their political uncertainty needs to be reined in. He said they make up about half of Sub-Saharan Africa’s GDP growth.

The World Bank said Nigeria’s economy, the largest in the continent, was expected to expand by 1 percent in 2017.

South Africa’s economy, hit by political worries, was expected to grow just 0.6 percent this year.","Sub-Saharan Africa to grow at a slower rate this year, World Bank says",https://www.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFKBN1CG1P8-OZABS

Republicans in Congress and the White House haven’t been able to get any major legislation passed yet. But they're betting they can pull it off with a bare-bones proposal for tax reform outlined last week, which they claim will help the middle class despite the evidence that it will overwhelmingly benefit the rich.

Their plan to overhaul what they call a broken tax code leaves out many key details. But one point gets hammered home: Republicans say they want to make filing taxes easier. The first principle for President Trump’s tax plan, their outline states, is to “make the tax code simple, fair and easy to understand.” There are a dozen more references to simplification throughout the rest of the document.

The Republican promise is that they want to make filing taxes as easy as mailing a postcard. But their plan doesn’t get anywhere close to that, while overlooking a straightforward reform that would. Instead of reducing complexity, the GOP plan mostly lowers and flattens rates. For example, it reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three.

However, the effort of filing taxes has nothing to do with how many brackets there are -- figuring out which bracket you fall in is the easy part. What makes doing taxes complicated is figuring out which deductions, credits, and loopholes to claim. Republicans would close some loopholes, but they would open others -- including a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses that will entice rich people with the right accounting team to get creative in order to reap the rewards. (Tycoons with family-owned businesses, such as Donald Trump, especially stand to benefit from this change, which would allow law firms, hedge funds, and real estate brokerages to file under a much lower rate.) Such loopholes make the code more complex to navigate, not less.

Simple tax filing isn’t a hopeless goal, however. There’s something Congress could do that would radically simplify the process of filing taxes for the vast majority of U.S. taxpayers.

It’s called return-free filing. In countries such as Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Spain, the government basically prepares tax returns for its citizens. It already has most of the information it needs: Employers have to tell tax authorities how much they pay their employees, while forms like W-2s and 1099s provide other necessary details. In Japan, for example, the country’s tax agency sends everyone a document with how much they earned, how much was withheld, and how much they owe or are owed in taxes.

If Washington adopted this policy, the government would fill out a return for every resident with the information it already keeps on file. Taxpayers who wanted to itemize their returns or dispute the numbers would be free to do so, but otherwise they could simply sign off on the government’s math. In some countries, merely taking no action constitutes an approval and therefore counts as doing your taxes.

Instead, in the United States it’s up to every taxpayer to gather their forms, enter all the numbers into a long document, ensure that everything has been calculated accurately, and send it all in. It takes a collective 2.6 billion hours to get this done. Americans pay an average $200 each for the pleasure of doing their taxes, or around 10 percent of the average federal tax refund.

Return-free filing, on the other hand, could save an estimated collective 225 million hours of tax filing work and $2 billion in costs. Up to 60 million households would no longer have to file any returns.

The concept is not entirely foreign to the United States. President Ronald Reagan called for something just like it in his 1985 Tax Reform Act, arguing that Americans should “not even have to fill out a return.” Since then, Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken up the crusade, introducing legislation two years in a row that would instruct the IRS to develop a free, online return-free filing option, allowing taxpayers to download their information straight from the government and into a form. The idea is even supported by conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.

But it hasn’t moved forward; last year, Warren’s bill didn’t even make it out of committee.

That’s because some deep-pocketed companies have worked tirelessly to bury it. If most Americans no longer needed help doing their taxes, business would dry up for tax preparers such as H&R Block and TurboTax. More than half of all individual tax returns filed in 2014 were prepared by a tax professional, while about 80 percent of Americans use either software or a preparer.

These companies have said as much publicly. Intuit, the software company that makes TurboTax, has said in filings that it “opposes IRS government tax preparation” and that such legislation “may present a continued competitive threat to our business in the foreseeable future.” Liberty Tax Service stated in 2015 that “demand for our products is related to the complexity of tax return preparation.”

So they’ve spent heavily to campaign against return-free filing. H&R Block, which ProPublica says spent $3 million on lobbying last year, fought hard against Warren’s bill. Intuit spent $2 million in the same year, much of it in favor of legislation that would block the government from offering return-free filing. The firm has lobbied in favor of a number of similar past bills.

Republicans have long claimed that they want to make taxes simpler, yet their proposals never live up to such promises. It’s not impossible, though; the answer is staring us right in the face. It would just require the government to put the interests of everyday taxpayers over big-spending corporate lobbyists.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israeli intelligence officials spying on Russian government hackers found they were using Kaspersky Lab antivirus software that is also used by 400 million people globally, including U.S. government agencies, according to media reports on Tuesday.

The Israeli officials who had hacked into Kaspersky’s network over two years ago then warned their U.S. counterparts of the Russian intrusion, said The New York Times, which first reported the story. nyti.ms/2yev8Vj

That led to a decision in Washington only last month to order Kaspersky software removed from government computers.

The Washington Post also reported on Tuesday that the Israeli spies had also found in Kaspersky's network hacking tools that could only have come from the U.S. National Security Agency. wapo.st/2i2clXa

After an investigation, the NSA found that those tools were in possession of the Russian government, the Post said.

And late last month, the U.S. National Intelligence Council completed a classified report that it shared with NATO allies concluding that Russia’s FSB intelligence service had “probable access” to Kaspersky customer databases and source code, the Post reported.

That access, it concluded, could help enable cyber attacks against U.S. government, commercial and industrial control networks, the Post reported.

The New York Times said the Russian operation, according to multiple people briefed on the matter, is known to have stolen classified documents from a National Security Agency employee who had improperly stored them on his home computer, which had Kaspersky antivirus software installed on it.

It is not yet publicly known what other U.S. secrets the Russian hackers may have discovered by turning the Kaspersky software into a sort of Google search for sensitive information, the Times said.

The current and former government officials who described the episode spoke about it on condition of anonymity because of classification rules, the Times said.

The newspaper said the National Security Agency and the White House declined to comment, as did the Israeli Embassy, while the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment.

The Russian embassy in Washington last month called the ban on Kaspersky Lab software “regrettable” and said it delayed the prospects of restoring bilateral ties.

Kaspersky Lab denied to the Times any knowledge of, or involvement in, the Russian hacking. “Kaspersky Lab has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday.

Eugene Kaspersky, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, has repeatedly denied charges his company conducts espionage on behalf of the Russian government.

Kaspersky spokeswoman Sarah Kitsos told the Washington Post on Tuesday that “as a private company, Kaspersky Lab does not have inappropriate ties to any government, including Russia, and the only conclusion seems to be that Kaspersky Lab is caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight.” She said the company “does not possess any knowledge” of Israel’s hack, the Post said.

Test matches have witnessed a decline in attendances in recent years, throwing the door open to a number of means to engage fans, including the introduction of day-night tests.

South Africa announced plans to play Zimbabwe in the first four-day test starting on Boxing Day in Port Elizabeth, as part of their home summer calendar for the 2017-18 season.

Cricket South Africa (CSA) are awaiting approval for the four-day, day/night fixture, which would also be their first home ‘pink ball’ test.

However, Irish was concerned that countries trialing four-day tests on a random basis may lead to confusion and uncertainty around the format.

“If the ICC for example is coming up with a new league structure for test cricket then how does playing four-day tests fit into that and what are the advantages and disadvantages of four days, as opposed to five days, in that structure,” he added.

”If there are not significant advantages in making the structure and schedule better then why change?

“If there are significant advantages then these need to be understood before decisions are simply made to change the format.”","Cricket: Changes to tests must be in line with new structure, says FICA chief",https://www.reuters.com/article/cricket-test/cricket-changes-to-tests-must-be-in-line-with-new-structure-says-fica-chief-idINKBN1CG1YO?il=0

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission’s attempts to intervene in Russia’s plans for a new gas pipeline to Germany have been dealt a blow by legal advice, according to EU diplomats and a document seen by Reuters.

Brussels, backed by some EU member states, is concerned the Nord Stream 2 pipeline will increase the bloc’s reliance on Russian gas and cut gas transit revenues for Ukraine, damaging its fragile economy. So the Commission is seeking a mandate from EU members to hold talks with Russia.

But Germany, the EU’s biggest economy and the end-point for the pipeline planned to deliver 55 billion cubic meters of gas a year, believes Brussels should not get involved.

According to an opinion by the legal service of the European Council, a body where EU nations meet, the Commission’s proposed mandate for talks with Russia failed to establish “any legal need to negotiate” and contained “mere political arguments.”

The opinion also took aim at the Commission’s concern that the pipeline would increase dependence on Russia’s state-owned gas firm Gazprom (GAZP.MM). This “is at the very least counter intuitive,” the document, dated Sept. 27, said.

“It pretty much kills the mandate,” one EU official said.

With the opinion suggesting the Commission may need unanimous backing from EU members for its plan, another EU official said: “I see very little room for moving forward, and in the meantime, the pipeline will be built.”

Eastern European and Baltic Sea states fear the project strengthens Russia’s hand, while Germany and other beneficiaries in northern Europe see a commercial payoff.

Both sides, however, fear the potential loss for Ukraine of some $2 billion per year of Russian gas transit fees will undermine its war-torn economy, complicating the bloc’s investment in reforms there.

Many see the project at odds with sanctions Western countries have imposed on Moscow over its role in the conflict in Ukraine.

“Our main concern is how to stabilize Ukraine,” said an EU diplomat. But he added: “Apart from Russia, there aren’t many gas-rich countries left close to Germany ... Nord Stream 2 is unsavory, but the right thing to do.”

The opinion, the latest legal tussle over the pipeline, will make it harder for the EU’s 28 members to find common ground when they debate the issue on Thursday, EU sources said.

Germany has seized on it as proof EU regulators should not meddle, while others accuse Berlin of strong-arming EU institutions.

“Our German colleagues are crowing right now,” said an EU diplomat, whose country backs the Commission bid.

Another was defiant: “We are not rolling over yet,” the diplomat said. “This is not a legal issue but about taking care of geopolitics.”

Poland, one of the pipeline’s fiercest opponents, plans to put forward its own legal opinion this week, one of its diplomats said, dismissing the Council document as “just an opinion.”

Within a bloc still reeling from Brexit, EU officials say there is little appetite for divisive initiatives and the Commission will not move ahead without a strong mandate. It is also wary of any future court challenge, they added.

‘UP TO MERKEL’

German energy groups Uniper (UN01.DE) and Wintershall (BASFn.DE) are not alone in having a stake in the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline, which will pump Russian gas via the Baltic Sea.

Austria’s OMV (OMVV.VI), Anglo-Dutch group Shell (RDSa.L), and France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA) are also invested.

Several EU diplomats said German counterparts were under pressure to sweep away an issue that could interfere with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s efforts to build a new coalition, including with the Green party, after Sept. 24 elections.

Merkel says she sees no need for the EU to get involved, and her government has sought assurances from Moscow that it will keep pumping gas through Ukraine after its gas transit contract expires in 2019.

Those in Brussels who do not want to see the EU bid fail worry the bloc will loose leverage to seek such assurances.

“Then it will be up to Merkel to negotiate Ukraine transits with Russia,” one EU official said.","Up against Germany, EU bid for gas talks with Moscow falters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-gazprom-nordstream/up-against-germany-eu-bid-for-gas-talks-with-moscow-falters-idINKBN1CG1ZO?il=0

MUMBAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Profits from India’s top firms are expected to have swung back to growth in July-September from a decline in the previous quarter, though economic headwinds are likely to have kept the pace of growth sluggish.

The latest results are critical for investors, marking the first quarter since the rollout of a national goods and services tax (GST) on July 1 and coming amid a wider retreat in share markets on investor concern about stocks being overvalued.

Forecasts compiled by Reuters show net profits are expected to rise 12.8 percent in the latest quarter for members of the main NSE index, known as Nifty, marking a recovery from the 1 percent fall in net profits in April-June.

That would be less than half the 33 percent increase posted in the January-March quarter and lag the 17.7 percent rise in October-December last year.

Profits are expected to be driven by energy and metals firms benefiting from stronger commodity prices, while telecoms are expected to post weak results due to aggressive competition. Drug makers profits are also likely to have suffered, mostly from regulatory challenges in the key U.S. market.

However, the impact of India’s new GST on earnings remains the biggest unknown for investors positioning themselves for the earnings season.

Uncertainty caused by companies rushing to prepare for the new tax and cutting production dented profits in the April-June quarter more than analysts had initially expected.

Fund managers now warn another disappointing set of results could hurt India’s recent bull run.

Nilesh Shah, managing director at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management, said markets were pricing in a recovery in earnings in the next 3-5 quarters.

He said markets would correct if earnings don’t show a solid recovery.

Meanwhile, operating profits are expected to rise 11.5 percent from a year earlier, while revenues are expected to advance 6.5 percent.

The results come at a time of deep uncertainty for markets. The Nifty has fallen about 1.9 percent since hitting a record high on Sept. 19, amid heavy foreign selling and rising worries as economic growth slows to its weakest pace in three years.

The Nifty is trading at a price to current fiscal year’s earnings (PE) ratio of 21.3, a healthy premium over the historic five-year average of 16.8.

Investors say the GST’s impact is hard to measure given it can affect virtually every aspect of the economy from consumer purchases to industrial production. Some manufacturers are expected to have restored inventory levels in the latest quarter.

“We had seen an uptick in terms of re-stock in July, which was positively received by the markets,” said Sunil Sharma, chief investment officer at Sanctum Wealth Management.

LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC forecast higher demand for its oil in 2018 on Wednesday and said its production-cutting deal with rival producers was getting rid of a glut, pointing to a tighter market that could move into a deficit next year.

In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said the market could find support in winter from low distillate fuel stocks and forecasts of colder weather, which would boost distillates demand for heating.

OPEC said the world would need 33.06 million barrels per day (bpd) of its crude next year, up 230,000 bpd from its previous forecast. That is its third consecutive monthly increase in the projection from its first estimate made in July.

The report illustrates growing confidence among OPEC officials that its supply cut is working. Still, OPEC is not banking on a surge in prices, saying in the report crude is expected to remain at $50 to $55 a barrel in the next year. Brent oil LCOc1 traded higher near $57 on Wednesday.

“With the market moving into the winter season, distillate fuel supplies are notably tight, representing a change from the excess supplies seen in the last two years,” OPEC said.

“OPEC and key non-OPEC oil producers continue to successfully drain the oil market of excess barrels.”

In a deal aimed at clearing the glut, OPEC is curbing output by about 1.2 million bpd, while Russia and other non-OPEC producers are cutting half as much, until March 2018.

The 14-country producer group said its oil output in September, as assessed by secondary sources, came in below the 2018 demand forecast, even though production climbed by about 89,000 bpd to 32.75 million bpd.

In a further sign that the supply excess is easing, OPEC said inventories in developed economies declined by 24.7 million barrels in August to 2.996 billion barrels, 171 million barrels above the five-year average.

OPEC and its allies want to bring stocks down to the five-year average and are discussing extending their supply restraint.

HEADWINDS FOR SHALE

OPEC lowered its estimate of supply growth from non-OPEC countries next year, seeing a rise of 940,000 bpd, down 60,000 bpd from the previous forecast, due to downward revisions to Russia.

The report also cited headwinds in 2018 for an expansion of supplies in U.S. shale, such as lower drilling efficiency and cost inflation. Growth in U.S. shale three years ago contributed to the global excess OPEC’s cut is now targeting.

“The supply forecast for next year will be revised downward if higher oil prices and lower costs do not materialize,” the report said.

“Oil prices are expected to remain at $50-55 in the next year. A rise above that level would encourage U.S. oil producers to expand their drilling activities, otherwise the lower prices could lead to a reduction in their capex.”

The price expectation, given on page 45 of the 96-page report, is an assumption, not a forecast, OPEC sources said. OPEC does not issue price forecasts.

OPEC raised its forecasts for global oil demand growth in 2017 and 2018, saying consumption would rise by 1.38 million bpd next year, 30,000 bpd more than previously thought.

The report’s OPEC production figures mean compliance with the supply cut by the 11 members with output targets remains high at 98 percent, according to a Reuters calculation.

This is up from 83 percent initially reported in August, as September’s rise in overall OPEC output was led by Nigeria and Libya, which are exempt from the cut.

Should OPEC keep pumping at September’s level, the market could move into a deficit next year, the report indicates.

Those fears were allayed as Messi’s hat-trick led Argentina to a 3-1 win at high altitude in Ecuador to ensure their place and Portugal made it with a 2-0 win over Switzerland.

The U.S., one of FIFA’s most important members in commercial terms, were not so lucky as a shock 2-1 defeat in Trinidad and Tobago, combined with wins for Panama and Honduras, ended their run of seven successive finals appearances.

The Netherlands, semi-finalists in 2014 and runners-up in 2010, will also miss out while four-times champions Italy, who last failed to qualify in 1958, face a two-leg playoff in November.

The impact of the U.S’s absence will be felt at broadcasters Fox, who take over coverage of the World Cup from ESPN starting with the 2018 tournament and a host of sponsors, such as Nike, who had been hoping for plenty of World Cup exposure.

SMALLER NATIONS

Panama’s first-ever qualification for the finals prompted President Juan Carlos Varela to declare a national holiday, describing it on Twitter as an “historic day for the country”.

But their 2-1 win over Costa Rica also highlighted global soccer body FIFA’s surprising decision not to use goal-line technology in the qualifiers, as the ball did not appear to fully cross the line for their first goal.

Panama’s success also strengthened the hand of those who argue that the expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams is not necessary to allow more smaller countries to take part.

On Monday, Iceland, with a population of less than 350,000, became the smallest nation ever to qualify for the finals while Cape Verde, with a population of 550,000, are still in contention for one of the African places.

A bigger World Cup may also devalue the qualifying competition, particularly in South America where two points separated five teams battling for two direct places and a playoff spot before Tuesday’s enthralling finale.

An evening of unremitting tension ended with Uruguay, Argentina and Colombia joining Brazil in Russia, while Peru’s 1-1 draw was enough to land them in fifth place - the playoff spot - and continue dreaming of a first appearance since 1982.

Peru sneaked ahead of Chile on goal difference after their southern neighbours lost 3-0 to Brazil and dropped to sixth. They were also indebted to Venezuela who stopped Paraguay from taking the playoff spot with a shock 1-0 win in Asuncion.

Earlier in the competition, Chile got an extra two points after protesting that Bolivia fielded an ineligible player -- Paraguay-born Nelson Cabrera -- during a 0-0 draw in Santiago.

FIFA agreed and awarded them a 3-0 walkover win -- but then did the same for Peru who lost 2-0 to Bolivia and therefore gained three extra points, compared to Chile’s two.

That extra point proved decisive on Tuesday.",Ronaldo and Messi make it safely to World Cup but no U.S,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-worldcup-roundup/ronaldo-and-messi-make-it-safely-to-world-cup-but-no-u-s-idUKKBN1CG1K8

GENEVA (Reuters) - Myanmar security forces have brutally driven out half a million Muslim Rohingya from northern Rakhine state, torching their homes, crops and villages to prevent them from returning, the U.N. human rights office said on Wednesday.

Jyoti Sanghera, head of the Asia and Pacific region of the U.N. human rights office, called on Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi to “stop the violence” and voiced fear that if the stateless Rohingya refugees return from Bangladesh they may be interned.

“If villages have been completely destroyed and livelihood possibilities have been destroyed, what we fear is that they may be incarcerated or detained in camps,” she told a news briefing.

In a report based on 65 interviews with Rohingya who have arrived in Bangladesh in the past month, it said that “clearance operations” had begun before insurgent attacks on police posts on Aug. 25 and included killings, torture and rape of children.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein - who has described the government operations as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing” - said in a statement that the actions appeared to be “a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return”.

“Credible information indicates that the Myanmar security forces purposely destroyed the property of the Rohingyas, scorched their dwellings and entire villages in northern Rakhine State, not only to drive the population out in droves but also to prevent the fleeing Rohingya victims from returning to their homes,” the report said.

It said the destruction by security forces, often joined by mobs of armed Rakhine Buddhists, of houses, fields, food stocks, crops, and livestock made the possibility of Rohingya returning to normal lives in northern Rakhine “almost impossible”.

The campaign was “well-organised, coordinated and systematic” and began with Rohingya men under 40 being arrested a month earlier, creating a “climate of fear and intimidation”.

“We are not in a position to make a finding of genocide or not, but this should in no way detract from the seriousness of the situation which the Rohingya population is currently facing,” said Thomas Hunecke, who led the team that went to Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, from Sept. 14-24.

It was “highly likely” that Myanmar security forces planted landmines along the border in recent weeks to prevent Rohingya from returning, he said, citing doctors treating injuries.

VIOLENCE CONTINUES

Despite growing international condemnation of the crisis, the military campaign is popular in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya, and for Muslims in general, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged.

Myanmar on Tuesday launched its first bid to improve relations between Buddhists and Muslims since the eruption of deadly violence inflamed the communal tension and triggered an exodus of some 520,000 Muslims to Bangladesh.

But Sanghera, noting that 11,000 Rohingya crossed into Bangladesh on Monday alone, said: “Clearly it seems that some level of eviction, displacement, forced movement and violence may be continuing.”

The U.N. experts documented Myanmar security forces “firing indiscriminately at Rohingya villagers, injuring and killing other innocent victims, setting houses on fire”.

“Almost all testimonies indicated that people were shot at close range and in the back while they tried to flee in panic,” the report said.

The U.N. report quoted a 12-year-old girl from Rathedaung township as saying the security forces had surrounded her house and started shooting.

“It was a situation of panic – they shot my sister in front of me, she was only seven years old. She cried and told me to run. I tried to protect her and care for her, but we had no medical assistance on the hillside and she was bleeding so much that after one day she died. I buried her myself.”

Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council.
What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did.","President Donald Trump’s opening speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday is drawing widespread criticism for his aggressive statements about North Korea and Iran, but it is just as significant for what he didn’t mention at all.

In a 42-minute address that stunned many listeners, Trump called the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man on a suicide mission” and vowed to “totally destroy” the country if it attacks the United States. He promised to crush “loser terrorists.” He called the Iran nuclear deal an “embarrassment” and said portions of the world are “going to hell.”

The overarching theme of Trump’s speech was sovereignty – a word he used 21 times. It was a strange emphasis in an increasingly interconnected, globalized world. Though in line with his ""America first"" platform, it was highly unusual for a U.S. leader speaking in a global forum that stands for peace through cooperation. What Trump left out was just as important: he did not offset his emphasis on sovereignty — with its implication that what a nation does within its borders is of no concern to the international community — with an assertion of the primacy of universal human rights or Washington’s commitment to promoting democracy.

Indeed, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, their vast ideological differences notwithstanding, sounded far more similar to each other when addressing the UN than Trump did to either of them or his other predecessors.

The three most glaring omissions were climate change, human rights and Russia’s efforts to destabilize Western democracies. Trump’s ignoring climate change was no surprise, given his rejection of climate science and planned withdrawal from the UN-sponsored Paris climate agreement. President Obama, by comparison, frequently argued for international climate cooperation in his UN speeches.

But the other subjects Trump avoided were less expected. American commitment to helping the UN advance human rights has long been a staple in UN addresses by presidents, no matter their political party. Although Trump said that he intends to work hard on an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal at a Wednesday meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the fact that a settlement wasn’t mentioned during the UN address suggests the issue is no longer a White House priority.

In his UN speech Trump also offered no direct condemnation of China or Russia, despite their recent actions that have undermined — and antagonized — the United States on the world stage.

These omissions were a stark departure from past U.S. presidents. Though Trump’s condemnation of North Korea, Iran and Venezuela echoed Bush’s “axis of evil,” Bush’s annual UN addresses promoted the spread of democracy and nation-building abroad. Obama, meanwhile, emphasized diplomacy and international institutions to resolve conflict, achieve peace and protect human rights.

Any call for the respect of rights in Trump’s speech was reserved for nations, not people. “Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity, and peace, for themselves and for the world,” he said, adding that he expects nations to “uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.”

For all the president’s focus on sovereignty, he ignored threats to from Russia, such as its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and what U.S. intelligence agencies say was Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and hacking of French election infrastructure.

As for China, Trump made only a vague reference to its threat in the South China Sea, where Beijing has built up islands and military outposts in an area the United States regards as international waters. Trump did, however, thank both Russia and China by name for their recent UN Security Council votes for more sanctions on North Korea. His choice of words could perhaps be interpreted as recognition of how much he will need their support facing down the Kim regime.

Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council. China and American allies such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the obvious suspects. (Trump did say, “We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela,” but his overwhelming focus regarding Venezuela was on attacking its socialist economy.)

He did not raise the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, where more than 420,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh in what the United Nations called “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” Calling out Myanmar would have carried little political risk for Trump and would have gone a long way toward pressuring the country to drop its brutal campaign.

The focus on sovereignty conjured a picture of a world where every nation only looks out for itself. It is also a world where the United States abandons its role as a leader.

What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did. He repeatedly extolled the virtues of strong nations over strong international institutions and held up the nation-state as “the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.” What’s unclear just how this is supposed to work. His rhetoric of sovereignty gives oppressive regimes permission to violate their citizens’ rights, and tells the rest of the world it’s okay to turn a blind eye.","Commentary: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-karas-trump-commentary/commentary-at-the-un-trumps-silences-spoke-volumes-idUSKCN1BW2AC

Mailand/Luxemburg (Reuters) - Neue Leitlinien der EZB-Bankenaufseher zum Umgang mit faulen Krediten haben eine Kontroverse ausgelöst.

EU-Parlamentspräsident Antonio Tajani forderte in einem Brief an Zentralbank-Chef Mario Draghi eindringlich dazu auf, das europäische Abgeordnetenhaus in den Entscheidungsprozess zu den neuen Vorgaben einzubeziehen. Die EZB-Bankenaufsicht hatte neue Richtlinien vorgestellt, nach denen Geldhäuser künftig mehr Vorsorge für faule Kredite betreiben müssen. In Italien lösten die neuen Leitlinien große Kritik aus. Unterstützung erhielt die EZB hingegen von Bundesfinanzminister Wolfgang Schäuble. Die EU-Kommission will am Mittwoch eigene Vorschläge vorstellen, wie aus einem Entwurf hervorgeht, der Reuters vorliegt.

Zu den neuen EZB-Vorgaben soll es Ende November eine öffentliche Anhörung bei der Europäischen Zentralbank geben, die Konsultationen laufen bis zum 8. Dezember. “Ich möchte sie dringend dazu auffordern, alle Schritte zu unternehmen, um sicherzustellen, dass Vorrechte des Parlaments als Mitgesetzgeber ordnungsgemäß respektiert werden”, schrieb Tajani in dem Brief an Draghi, den Reuters am Dienstag einsehen konnte. Ein Disput zwischen den Institutionen über dieses Thema solle vermieden werden. Er sei “tief besorgt” über die Vorgehensweise.

Schäuble stellte sich hingegen auf die Seite der EZB-Aufseher. “Ich kann die EZB in der Position nur unterstützen”, sagte Schäuble am Rande des EU-Finanzminister-Treffens in Luxemburg. Auch eine “große Mehrheit” seiner europäischen Kollegen habe in dem Punkt Draghi dem Rücken gestärkt. Nach den neuen EZB-Vorgaben müssen Banken ab 2018 alle Darlehen, die neu als ausfallgefährdet eingestuft werden, schrittweise vollständig über Rückstellungen abdecken. Bei neuen unbesicherten Problemkrediten soll nach zwei Jahren eine 100-prozentige Abdeckung erreicht werden, bei neuen besicherten Problemdarlehen spätestens nach sieben Jahren.

ITALIEN BEFÜRCHTET DÄMPFER FÜR WIRTSCHAFTSWACHSTUM

In Italien wird befürchtet, dass Banken wegen der neuen Regelungen noch mehr Kredite abschreiben müssen. Dies könnte letztendlich das Wirtschaftswachstum dämpfen. In der Euro-Zone entfallen etwa 30 Prozent des mehr als 900 Milliarden Euro großen Bestands an Problemdarlehen auf Banken in Italien. Italiens Finanzminister Pier Carlo Padoan äußerte bereits Zweifel an der Vorgehensweise der EZB-Bankenaufsicht. Italiens Notenbank hofft einem Insider zufolge, dass die neuen Regeln noch aufgeweicht werden.

Die EU-Kommission will laut einem Entwurf bis zum Frühjahr Bankenregeln vorstellen, die auch zu erfüllende Mindestniveaus an Rückstellungen für faule Kredite enthalten könnten. Dem Entwurf zufolge sollen die Maßnahmen verhindern, dass Banken in den Mitgliedsstaaten in der Zukunft faule Krediten anhäufen und nicht genügend über Rückstellungen abdecken. Die Pläne zielen in dieselbe Richtung wie der Vorstoß der EZB. Der parallele Vorstoß der Kommission könnte aber den Prozess verlangsamen, da alle EU-Mitgliedstaaten den Plänen zustimmen müssten.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan stocks and bonds fell on Wednesday after opposition leader Raila Odinga pulled out of a repeat presidential election set for Oct. 26.

The all-share index dropped 0.67 percent and the blue-chip index 1.41 percent, while Kenya’s dollar-denominated 2024 sovereign bond fell as much as 1.2 cents, according to Reuters data, as political uncertainty deepened.

Odinga, who successfully challenged the Aug. 8 re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta last month, said the repeat poll should be canceled and a fresh election held after the election board has carried out reforms.

“There was cautious optimism, but now political risk has risen considerably overnight driven by the opposition candidate’s withdrawal,” said Ken Minjire, the head of securities at Genghis Capital in Nairobi.

The all-share index has lost 5.5 percent and the blue chip index is down 10 percent since the August election was annulled.

The Kenyan shilling, which fell 0.5 percent after the election was annulled on Sept. 1, was stable against the dollar on Wednesday. Traders attributed that to the central bank’s credibility, which is bolstered by healthy foreign-exchange reserves.

It was unclear after Odinga’s withdrawal whether repeat elections would be held on Oct. 26. A court ruling on Wednesday said other candidates, none of whom polled more than one percent, could also be on the ballot, possibly giving Kenyatta someone to run against other than Odinga.

The opposition leader has been leading regular protests against the electoral board, and hundreds of his supporters marched through the streets of the capital, Nairobi, on Wednesday.

Concern over the prolonged political uncertainty have hit economic growth, with businesses and households feeling the pinch. The government has already cut this year’s economic growth forecast to 5.5 percent from the initial 5.9 percent.

But Aly Khan Satchu, an independent trader and analyst, said he expected the election to go ahead after the court ruled in favour of the minority candidate, ushering in a relief rally afterwards.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to block a Chinese-backed firm from buying a U.S.-based chipmaker this week is detrimental to America’s growth and the global economy, China’s state news agency Xinhua said in a commentary on Saturday.

Canyon Bridge Capital Partners’ planned $1.3 billion acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corp was one of the largest attempted by a Chinese-backed firm in the U.S. microchip sector and was the first announced deal for the buyout fund, which launched last year with a focus on technology investment.

U.S. regulatory scrutiny grew after Reuters reported in November that Canyon Bridge was funded partly by capital from China’s central government and had indirect links to its space program.

Trump said in an executive order on Wednesday that Lattice and Canyon Bridge “shall take all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed transaction” within 30 days.

“The move, which is detrimental to both America’s growth and global economic recovery, also runs counter to the mutually-beneficial and win-win nature of China-U.S. relations,” the Xinhua commentary said.

Security reviews of investments in sensitive sectors “should not be used as a tool to implement protectionism”, it added, echoing comments by a Commerce Ministry spokesman last week.

Citing analysts who said Trump’s decision was made with an eye to the 2018 midterm election, Xinhua called it “penny wise and pound foolish ... It is a short-sighted move to take protectionist measures amid sluggish global growth.”

“Chinese investment is not ‘Trojan Horse’ with hidden purposes,” it said.

Trump is set to visit China in November.

“The two countries need to strengthen dialogue and communication, promote cooperation and exchanges in various fields and properly handle issues of common concerns. Only then can China and the United States push forward the world’s most important bilateral relationship,” Xinhua said.",Trump move to block chipmaker deal bad for America - Xinhua,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-trade-commentary/trump-move-to-block-chipmaker-deal-bad-for-america-xinhua-idUSKCN1BR062

BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - European countries are scrambling to cobble together a package of measures they hope will keep the Iran nuclear deal on track if U.S. President Donald Trump ignores their pleas and decertifies the landmark 2015 agreement this week.

The package would include a strong statement backing the deal by European powers, together with efforts to lobby the U.S. Congress and put wider pressure on Iran, officials said.

But without strong U.S. support for the deal, senior officials in Berlin, Paris and London say it may be only a matter of time before the pact between Tehran and six world powers unravels, with grave consequences for Middle East security, nonproliferation efforts and transatlantic ties.

The two-year-old agreement, under which Iran agreed to freeze its nuclear program for 15 years in exchange for sanctions relief, is viewed in Europe as a rare triumph of international diplomacy in the Middle East.

As tensions over North Korea’s nuclear activities risk boiling over into all-out war, any move by the United States to undermine the Iran deal is seen in Europe as utter folly.

European capitals have been delivering this message to the White House and Congress in one of the most intense lobbying campaigns in recent memory. In the past weeks, European ambassadors have met dozens of U.S. lawmakers. And on Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May lobbied Trump by phone.

Despite this, Trump is expected declare this week that Iran is not complying with the pact. He is also due to unveil a tough new strategy toward Iran - including designating its Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization - that could sink the deal.

“If the feeling is the United States no longer supports the agreement then the political reality is that the deal will be in serious jeopardy and its implementation will be very difficult,” a senior French diplomat told Reuters.

A decision by Trump to decertify would not automatically kill the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The expectation is that Trump would kick the ball to Congress, which would then have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions lifted as part of the JCPOA.

THREE-PRONGED RESPONSE

European officials said they were preparing a three-pronged strategy if this does occur.

First, Berlin, London and Paris would issue statements reaffirming their commitment to the deal.

Second, they would redouble efforts to lobby Congress, which appears keen to keep the deal, against any rash moves.

And third, they would present measures to pressure Iran over its ballistic missile program and destabilizing policies in the Middle East -- areas that fall outside the narrowly-focused nuclear deal.

French President Emmanuel Macron alluded to this at the United Nations last month. Diplomats said the package was still in the works and they had not yet briefed Brussels on it.

With the third step, the Europeans hope to build a bridge to Washington while keeping the JCPOA intact. But a German diplomat said ratcheting up pressure on Tehran was like walking a tightrope: push too hard and the whole deal could fall apart.

“We all knew the JCPOA wasn’t perfect, but by calling its benefits into question I see us only losing,” said a senior European diplomat who has been involved in negotiations with Iran since 2003, well before Washington joined the talks under President Barack Obama.

If Trump follows through on his threats it will be the second time in four months that he has distanced the United States from a major multilateral agreement despite intense lobbying by partners and members of his own cabinet.

But in Europe, the Iran move would be seen as far more damaging than Trump’s decision in June to pull out of the Paris climate accord.

“The threat from Iran in terms of nuclear proliferation is more immediate. This is far more dangerous,” said Elmar Brok, a veteran foreign policy expert in the European Parliament and party ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

European officials and analysts fear a breakdown of the JCPOA could lead to an arms race in the Middle East, a military conflict between Iran and Israel and an escalation of regional proxy wars between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

They fear it would also doom any chances, no matter how slim, for a negotiated deal with North Korea.

ALL ABOUT WAR

“At the end of the day it’s all about the risk of war,” said Francois Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

There is also the danger of a further deterioration in transatlantic ties, especially if Washington targets European firms that do business in Iran.

Were that to happen, the EU ambassador to Washington, David O‘Sullivan, has said Brussels would revert to a 1990s-era law that shields European companies from extraterritorial sanctions.

Even if the EU were to take such a step, the senior French diplomat said European companies could think twice about their Iran commitments.

Among firms that have announced big deals in Iran since the JCPOA went into force are planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA), French energy group Total (TOTF.PA) and Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE).

“One of the big difficulties of the agreement is ensuring the economic operators have confidence in the system and key to that is confidence in the United States,” the diplomat said.

Any signs that European companies are pulling back could prompt the Iranians to reassess the merits of the nuclear deal.

“The agreement with Iran is like a delicate plant,” said Omid Nouripour, an Iranian-born lawmaker with the German Greens party, which is expected to be part of Merkel’s next coalition government.

“It is a sign of what diplomacy can achieve but it is fragile. The American president doesn’t appear to believe in diplomacy. He seems intent on crushing this plant.”","Fearing Trump torpedo, Europe scrambles to save Iran deal",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iran-nuclear-europe/fearing-trump-torpedo-europe-scrambles-to-save-iran-deal-idUKKBN1CG1Y0

The smallcap mining sector is taking longer to recover from the commodity price crash of 2015-16 than the majors.

But the juniors have been increasingly active in Mali, regarded as a relatively stable jurisdiction, where Legend has a portfolio of gold projects and licences covering nearly 400 square kilometres.

Altus Strategies, which has signed a letter of intent to buy Toronto-listed Legend Gold, valuing it at 3.4 million pounds, said it was offering a 130 percent premium to Legend’s market close on Tuesday, but given low levels of liquidity for small miners that could still be cheap.

“Hopefully our timing is good. Some companies can go up 25 percent in a day in a highly illiquid market where price is not necessarily the same as value,” Steven Poulton, CEO of Altus Strategies, said in an interview.

The letter of intent should be followed by a firm all-equity deal by the end of the month.

Nervousness about Africa risk revived by an upsurge in resource nationalism, especially in Tanzania, has rattled the sector, but Mali’s gold is viewed as a relatively safe haven.

On Monday, another small miner Cora Gold (CORAC.L) listed on London’s AIM to raise cash to fund its mining project in Mali.

Altus Strategies listed in August to raise funds for its vocation as an African-focused project generator, which aspires to sell on its assets once they are established or find venture partners to develop them.

It has projects in Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Morocco and Liberia, covering a range of commodities, in addition to its anticipated purchases in Mali.

Poulton said until now Altus had been “underweight gold” and was still in acquisition mode.

“We’re restless in the sense we want to create value. Once this transaction is done, we will have grown the business, but we are constantly on the look out for accretive opportunities,” he said.

Investors, worried about the financial impact and potential legal fallout, again dumped Kobe Steel stock, wiping about $1.6 billion off its market value in two days.

Kobe Steel said late on Wednesday it found 70 cases of tampered data on materials used in optical disks and liquid crystal displays at its Kobelco Research Institute Inc, which makes and tests products for the company. It also found one case of falsified data on iron powder products shipped to a customer.

An internal probe carried out since it found issues in its aluminum and copper business has not found other cases of data tampering, Yoshihiko Katsukawa, a managing executive officer at Kobe Steel, told a news conference.

He said the company - which has said it was examining possible data falsifications going back 10 years - has begun an external investigation of all its units, including those overseas.

“We can’t rule out the possibility that the external investigation will find other cases,” Katsukawa said, adding no customers had raised any safety issues or stopped buying its products.

One customer, Central Japan Railway (9022.T), said some parts it received from Kobe Steel for its bullet trains did not meet Japanese Industrial Standards, but there were no safety issues.

Kobe Steel President Hiroya Kawasaki will meet a senior official at the industry ministry on Thursday, the ministry said in a statement.

The new revelations come after Kobe Steel admitted at the weekend it had falsified data about the quality of aluminum and copper products used in cars, aircraft, space rockets and defense equipment - a fresh blow to Japanese manufacturers’ reputation for quality production.

There have been previous cases in Japan involving falsified data, including at Nissan Motor (7201.T), Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) and Takata, which filed for bankruptcy this year over faulty airbags that were blamed for 17 deaths and scores of injuries.

In 2015, it was revealed that Toyo Tire & Rubber (5105.T) fabricated data to secure government approval for materials to absorb shocks from earthquakes. Conglomerate Toshiba Corp (6502.T) is still battling the fallout of a scandal over reporting inflated profits.

The corrosive business practices have raised broader questions over corporate governance in Japan, and cast doubt on the integrity of a manufacturing industry once the envy of the world.

“The scandal looks similar to that of Toyo Tire, and not as massive (or) devastating as Takata‘s. Kobe Steel’s technology is not something easily substitutable by others, and existing customers have nowhere else to go,” said Yasuo Sakuma, Chief Investment Officer at Libra Investments in Tokyo.

Kobe Steel faces potential costs from any product recalls, replacements and possible litigation, including class-action suits in the United States, Yuji Matsumoto, an analyst at Nomura Securities, said in a report.

The data tampering at its aluminum unit could also hit plans to expand the business as carmakers increasingly turn to the material, which is lighter than steel, to meet tighter environmental rules.

“Aluminum is one of Kobe Steel’s key focus areas in the medium term as part of its strategy to help lighten vehicles, (and) this will certainly have a negative impact on the expansion,” Matsumoto noted.

Multinationals including Toyota Motor (7203.T), Ford Motor (F.N) and planemakers Boeing (BA.N) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) have said they are investigating the safety of products from Kobe Steel.

REPEAT OFFENDER?

It’s not the first time Kobe Steel has been caught up in falsifying data.

In June of last year, it said an affiliate, Shinko Wire Stainless Co, falsified data on tests for tensile strength of some stainless steel wire for springs over a period of more than nine years. And in 2006, Kobe Steel said its Kakogawa steelworks in western Japan falsified soot emissions data over five years.

In a statement on Wednesday, Kobe Steel denied a Nikkei business daily report that it intended to put its real estate business up for sale to help shore up its finances. The company said it was assessing its options.

The steelmaker reported losses in the last two financial years, but has said it expects to return to profit this year.

Sales at Kobe Steel’s aluminum and copper division fell 6.4 percent to 323.3 billion yen ($2.9 billion) in the year to March, and recurring profit dropped by more than a fifth to 12 billion yen.",Kobe Steel crisis deepens as more data tampering revealed; shares tumble,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-kobe-steel/kobe-steel-crisis-deepens-as-more-data-tampering-revealed-shares-tumble-idUSKBN1CG064?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

One week after suffering a staggering collision with Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is in the throes of an agonizing humanitarian disaster.

The storm left at least 16 dead and the entire island without power; most people won’t get their lights back on anytime soon. The cascading effects have been devastating. More than half of residents remain without drinking water. Hospitals cannot function. Supermarket shelves are empty and few gas stations are open. Communication networks are crippled, and first responders are struggling to make contact with residents in remote or heavily affected areas. Credit cards are useless, and ATMs are out of service.

We know how to do better and we can do better. Nobody should die because the power went out.

We need a dedicated national effort to fortify our electrical grids so that they can get back online much more quickly after inevitable, and increasingly severe, extreme weather events. Natural disasters happen, but often the catastrophes that follow are man-made. And when it comes to the electricity system—the lynchpin upon which so much of our society relies—widespread, long-lasting power outages can quickly devolve into nightmares all their own. Just a few weeks ago, 11 senior citizens died in Florida following prolonged heat exposure due to power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Similar catastrophes were suffered in the wakes of many other earlier storms, including Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.

The centralized electricity grid is widely vulnerable to threats, both natural and manmade. Flooding can submerge and damage equipment, as it did throughout the Northeast during Sandy; heavy winds can rip down trees and power lines, as was seen throughout Florida from Irma; and extreme heat and forest fires can wreak havoc on transmission lines. Climate change stands to escalate these threats, by contributing to higher seas, more intense storms, worsening wildfires and extended heat waves.

That’s why the focus must be on electricity grid resilience. It’s impractical and impossible to stop all outages from occurring. But it is possible to design the system such that when the power does inevitably fail, fewer people are affected from the outset and power is restored more quickly for the rest.

In Florida, policymakers directed the state’s utilities to “storm harden” their systems following the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. One decade and several billion ratepayer dollars later, Irma gave people a chance to see their increased utility bills at work.

Workers repair electrical installations after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in San Juan, Puerto Rico, September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez

The result: an astounding 6.7 million customers—or nearly two out of every three in the state—were plunged into darkness. Surely evidence of a failed approach, right?

Not quite. When it comes to the cascading failures arising from widespread outages, length of the blackout is a key factor in the severity of the impact. Even though all those Floridians lost power after, the utilities were able to get over one million back online overnight, and millions more restored within a few days with help from crews from across America.

In Florida, that pivot toward improving recovery times has meant, for one, simple upgrades, like replacing thousands of wooden utility poles with concrete that can better withstand hurricane-force winds. In the aftermath of Irma, even though crashing trees and flying debris ripped down power lines, restoration times were vastly improved by a reduced need to replace fallen poles.

Other initiatives can be more technologically complex. For example, by installing sensors and grid automation throughout the system, utilities can pinpoint when and where an outage has occurred, and re-route systems to reduce the number of people without power. Similarly, flood monitoring equipment can alert a utility when critical infrastructure is at risk of inundation, allowing the equipment to be pre-emptively turned off to improve post-storm repair times.

Debris and destruction left by Hurricane Maria in Canovanas, Puerto Rico September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins

Tackling a problem this big, however, is impossible for each utility to do alone. Complicating the push for a more resilient electricity system is the fact that proposed interventions can be expensive, and investment dollars are limited. Additionally, the federal government has offered insufficient assistance, leaving states, cities and territories to largely fend for themselves, even though investing in a more resilient system now can reduce the costs of future relief and recovery efforts.

Utilities’ limited funds mean there are trade-offs, so opportunities must be carefully weighed against one another. But the costs of prolonged outages are far-reaching and challenging to quantify, and resiliency metrics are hard to define and even harder to compare. Efforts must also align with other priorities, especially as the power sector undergoes an unparalleled transition to clean and distributed renewable resources.

The fact also remains that some services are far too critical—drinking water, first responders, communications—and some populations, such as the elderly, disabled, or low-income, to tolerate even a day without power. For these people and services, a resilient grid is not enough.

Diesel generators, which have long-served a backup role when disasters hit, are expensive, heavily polluting, and prone to failure due to infrequent use. And as the long and frustrating lines following recent storms have made clear, maintaining steady access to fuel in the aftermath of a severe storm can be challenging, if not impossible. Microgrids powered by solar and storage, on the other hand, are more reliable during times of crisis, better for health and the environment, and increasingly affordable. This is thanks to lower costs of solar and storage technologies, as well as the fact that these systems can provide onsite power, generating benefits all year, not just during extreme weather events.

So what does this mean for Puerto Rico? Reports suggest parts of the island could remain without power for months, potentially impacting millions of people. This is unacceptable.

Now, as a country, we must pool together resources for a swift response to curtail the devastating crisis at hand. But we must also ensure that as the decimated power grid is pieced back together, this catastrophe—and the far too many that preceded it—were not suffered in vain. The electricity system must be rebuilt for a climate-resilient, clean-energy supporting future, not as a replica of its brittle and underinvested past.",Commentary: How we could have prevented some of Puerto Rico’s misery,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcnamara-electricity-commentary/commentary-how-we-could-have-prevented-some-of-puerto-ricos-misery-idUSKCN1C42ER

GENEVA (Reuters) - Myanmar security forces have brutally driven out half a million Muslim Rohingya from northern Rakhine state, torching their homes, crops and villages to prevent them from returning, the U.N. human rights office said on Wednesday.

Jyoti Sanghera, head of the Asia and Pacific region of the U.N. human rights office, called on Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi to “stop the violence” and voiced fear that if the stateless Rohingya refugees return from Bangladesh they may be interned.

“If villages have been completely destroyed and livelihood possibilities have been destroyed, what we fear is that they may be incarcerated or detained in camps,” she told a news briefing.

In a report based on 65 interviews with Rohingya who have arrived in Bangladesh in the past month, it said that “clearance operations” had begun before insurgent attacks on police posts on Aug. 25 and included killings, torture and rape of children.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein - who has described the government operations as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing” - said in a statement that the actions appeared to be “a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return”.

“Credible information indicates that the Myanmar security forces purposely destroyed the property of the Rohingyas, scorched their dwellings and entire villages in northern Rakhine State, not only to drive the population out in droves but also to prevent the fleeing Rohingya victims from returning to their homes,” the report said.

It said the destruction by security forces, often joined by mobs of armed Rakhine Buddhists, of houses, fields, food stocks, crops, and livestock made the possibility of Rohingya returning to normal lives in northern Rakhine “almost impossible”.

The campaign was “well-organized, coordinated and systematic” and began with Rohingya men under 40 being arrested a month earlier, creating a “climate of fear and intimidation”.

“We are not in a position to make a finding of genocide or not, but this should in no way detract from the seriousness of the situation which the Rohingya population is currently facing,” said Thomas Hunecke, who led the team that went to Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, from Sept. 14-24.

It was “highly likely” that Myanmar security forces planted landmines along the border in recent weeks to prevent Rohingya from returning, he said, citing doctors treating injuries.

VIOLENCE CONTINUES

Despite growing international condemnation of the crisis, the military campaign is popular in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya, and for Muslims in general, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged.

Myanmar on Tuesday launched its first bid to improve relations between Buddhists and Muslims since the eruption of deadly violence inflamed the communal tension and triggered an exodus of some 520,000 Muslims to Bangladesh.

But Sanghera, noting that 11,000 Rohingya crossed into Bangladesh on Monday alone, said: “Clearly it seems that some level of eviction, displacement, forced movement and violence may be continuing.”

The U.N. experts documented Myanmar security forces “firing indiscriminately at Rohingya villagers, injuring and killing other innocent victims, setting houses on fire”.

“Almost all testimonies indicated that people were shot at close range and in the back while they tried to flee in panic,” the report said.

The U.N. report quoted a 12-year-old girl from Rathedaung township as saying the security forces had surrounded her house and started shooting.

“It was a situation of panic – they shot my sister in front of me, she was only seven years old. She cried and told me to run. I tried to protect her and care for her, but we had no medical assistance on the hillside and she was bleeding so much that after one day she died. I buried her myself.”

The girl did not know what happened to her mother and four brothers, nor her father jailed a month earlier.","'Cynical' Myanmar army operation aimed at preventing Rohingya return, U.N. says",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CG0Z1

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission’s attempts to intervene in Russia’s plans for a new gas pipeline to Germany have been dealt a blow by legal advice, according to EU diplomats and a document seen by Reuters.

Brussels, backed by some EU member states, is concerned the Nord Stream 2 pipeline will increase the bloc’s reliance on Russian gas and cut gas transit revenues for Ukraine, damaging its fragile economy. So the Commission is seeking a mandate from EU members to hold talks with Russia.

But Germany, the EU’s biggest economy and the end-point for the pipeline planned to deliver 55 billion cubic meters of gas a year, believes Brussels should not get involved.

According to an opinion by the legal service of the European Council, a body where EU nations meet, the Commission’s proposed mandate for talks with Russia failed to establish “any legal need to negotiate” and contained “mere political arguments.”

The opinion also took aim at the Commission’s concern that the pipeline would increase dependence on Russia’s state-owned gas firm Gazprom (GAZP.MM). This “is at the very least counter intuitive,” the document, dated Sept. 27, said.

“It pretty much kills the mandate,” one EU official said.

With the opinion suggesting the Commission may need unanimous backing from EU members for its plan, another EU official said: “I see very little room for moving forward, and in the meantime, the pipeline will be built.”

Eastern European and Baltic Sea states fear the project strengthens Russia’s hand, while Germany and other beneficiaries in northern Europe see a commercial payoff.

Both sides, however, fear the potential loss for Ukraine of some $2 billion per year of Russian gas transit fees will undermine its war-torn economy, complicating the bloc’s investment in reforms there.

Many see the project at odds with sanctions Western countries have imposed on Moscow over its role in the conflict in Ukraine.

“Our main concern is how to stabilize Ukraine,” said an EU diplomat. But he added: “Apart from Russia, there aren’t many gas-rich countries left close to Germany ... Nord Stream 2 is unsavory, but the right thing to do.”

The opinion, the latest legal tussle over the pipeline, will make it harder for the EU’s 28 members to find common ground when they debate the issue on Thursday, EU sources said.

Germany has seized on it as proof EU regulators should not meddle, while others accuse Berlin of strong-arming EU institutions.

“Our German colleagues are crowing right now,” said an EU diplomat, whose country backs the Commission bid.

Another was defiant: “We are not rolling over yet,” the diplomat said. “This is not a legal issue but about taking care of geopolitics.”

Poland, one of the pipeline’s fiercest opponents, plans to put forward its own legal opinion this week, one of its diplomats said, dismissing the Council document as “just an opinion.”

Within a bloc still reeling from Brexit, EU officials say there is little appetite for divisive initiatives and the Commission will not move ahead without a strong mandate. It is also wary of any future court challenge, they added.

‘UP TO MERKEL’

German energy groups Uniper (UN01.DE) and Wintershall (BASFn.DE) are not alone in having a stake in the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline, which will pump Russian gas via the Baltic Sea.

Austria’s OMV (OMVV.VI), Anglo-Dutch group Shell (RDSa.L), and France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA) are also invested.

Several EU diplomats said German counterparts were under pressure to sweep away an issue that could interfere with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s efforts to build a new coalition, including with the Green party, after Sept. 24 elections.

Merkel says she sees no need for the EU to get involved, and her government has sought assurances from Moscow that it will keep pumping gas through Ukraine after its gas transit contract expires in 2019.

Those in Brussels who do not want to see the EU bid fail worry the bloc will loose leverage to seek such assurances.

“Then it will be up to Merkel to negotiate Ukraine transits with Russia,” one EU official said.","Up against Germany, EU bid for gas talks with Moscow falters",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-gazprom-nordstream/up-against-germany-eu-bid-for-gas-talks-with-moscow-falters-idUKKBN1CG1ZK?il=0

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG) plans to automate 30 percent of operations at its core banking unit by 2024, using software robots and artificial intelligence for paperwork that would otherwise take 9,500 employees to process.

Automation would free bankers to better serve Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd’s [MTFGTU.UL] wealthier clients, where there are opportunities such as estate management, said Kanetsugu Mike, the unit’s chief executive since June.

“Branch officials spend 50 to 60 percent of their time processing customer documents,” Mike said in an interview. “We can free up that time with robotics technology so more time can be spent with customers.”

The comments come as Japanese banks turn to automation under an efficiency drive aimed at blunting the impact of the central bank’s negative interest rates on profit margins, stricter capital requirements and a shrinking population.

Japanese banks have been slow to eliminate paper-based documentation compared with major global peers, partly because many forms require customers’ personal ink stamps - Japan’s official method of identification - rather than signatures.

Having fallen behind, they are now scrambling to reform processes - such as introducing stamp-free accounts - and employ new technology to fend off potential threats from their more tech-savvy competitors.

Mizuho Financial Group Inc, Japan’s second-biggest financial group after MUFG, last year set up joint venture J.Score Co with SoftBank Group Corp, using artificial intelligence to calculate individuals’ creditworthiness.

At MUFG, Mike said “robotics process automation” will handle half of branch operations by the end of the business year to March 2024, or 30 percent of the bank’s total. By the time of full installation, the automation would have handled the equivalent of 9,500 employee’s workload, he said.

Freeing up staff will allow for increased focus particularly on 1.2 million clients with assets over 100 million yen ($890,000), currently served by only 2,600 bankers, Mike said.

“We need more bankers, so we don’t have much of an excess workforce to begin with,” he said, dismissing any connection between automation and headcount.

Mike, who has spent nearly half of his 38-year MUFG career outside Japan, also said overseas business will continue to be a growth-driver, and that further acquisitions are likely in Asia and the United States.

He said the rate of expansion will not be as fast as in recent years given constraints such as higher capital requirements. MUFG’s assets grew nearly $1 trillion over the past decade to $2.7 trillion at the end of June.

“Our growth so far has been led by balance sheet expansion, especially after the global financial crisis,” he said. “We need to use our balance sheet more prudently now.”",Japan's MUFG to automate operations to free bankers for wealthy clients,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mufg-strategy/japans-mufg-to-automate-operations-to-free-bankers-for-wealthy-clients-idUKKBN1CG21U?il=0

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to dramatically increase the country’s nuclear arsenal, he said in a meeting with his national security advisers in July, NBC News reported on Wednesday, citing three officials who were present in the room.

Trump’s reported comments come as tensions remained high with North Korea and as Trump is expected to make an announcement on whether to decertify the international deal surrounding Iran’s nuclear program.

The president spoke on July after he was shown a chart indicating the stockpile of U.S. nuclear weapons had slid from a high of 32,000 in the 1960s. Trump said he wanted to have that same number now, NBC reported.

The United States currently has about 4,000 nuclear warheads earmarked for use in its military stockpile, according to the Federation of American Scientists.

In a post on Twitter on Wednesday, the president said, “Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a ‘tenfold’ increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction, made up to demean. NBC = CNN!”

Trump said in an interview with Reuters in February that he wanted to ensure that the U.S. nuclear arsenal was at the “top of the pack.”

Although U.S. presidents have modernized weapons stockpiles over the years, adding to the nuclear arsenal or building a prohibited type of weapon would be a violation of treaty agreements, according to NBC.

After the meeting, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson referred to Trump as a “moron,” according to NBC. U.S. news reports have painted the relationship between Trump and Tillerson as tense.

BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - European countries are scrambling to cobble together a package of measures they hope will keep the Iran nuclear deal on track if U.S. President Donald Trump ignores their pleas and decertifies the landmark 2015 agreement this week.

The package would include a strong statement backing the deal by European powers, together with efforts to lobby the U.S. Congress and put wider pressure on Iran, officials said.

But without strong U.S. support for the deal, senior officials in Berlin, Paris and London say it may be only a matter of time before the pact between Tehran and six world powers unravels, with grave consequences for Middle East security, nonproliferation efforts and transatlantic ties.

The two-year-old agreement, under which Iran agreed to freeze its nuclear program for 15 years in exchange for sanctions relief, is viewed in Europe as a rare triumph of international diplomacy in the Middle East.

As tensions over North Korea’s nuclear activities risk boiling over into all-out war, any move by the United States to undermine the Iran deal is seen in Europe as utter folly.

European capitals have been delivering this message to the White House and Congress in one of the most intense lobbying campaigns in recent memory. In the past weeks, European ambassadors have met dozens of U.S. lawmakers. And on Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May lobbied Trump by phone.

Despite this, Trump is expected declare this week that Iran is not complying with the pact. He is also due to unveil a tough new strategy toward Iran - including designating its Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization - that could sink the deal.

“If the feeling is the United States no longer supports the agreement then the political reality is that the deal will be in serious jeopardy and its implementation will be very difficult,” a senior French diplomat told Reuters.

A decision by Trump to decertify would not automatically kill the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The expectation is that Trump would kick the ball to Congress, which would then have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions lifted as part of the JCPOA.

THREE-PRONGED RESPONSE

European officials said they were preparing a three-pronged strategy if this does occur.

First, Berlin, London and Paris would issue statements reaffirming their commitment to the deal.

Second, they would redouble efforts to lobby Congress, which appears keen to keep the deal, against any rash moves.

And third, they would present measures to pressure Iran over its ballistic missile program and destabilizing policies in the Middle East -- areas that fall outside the narrowly-focused nuclear deal.

French President Emmanuel Macron alluded to this at the United Nations last month. Diplomats said the package was still in the works and they had not yet briefed Brussels on it.

With the third step, the Europeans hope to build a bridge to Washington while keeping the JCPOA intact. But a German diplomat said ratcheting up pressure on Tehran was like walking a tightrope: push too hard and the whole deal could fall apart.

“We all knew the JCPOA wasn’t perfect, but by calling its benefits into question I see us only losing,” said a senior European diplomat who has been involved in negotiations with Iran since 2003, well before Washington joined the talks under President Barack Obama.

If Trump follows through on his threats it will be the second time in four months that he has distanced the United States from a major multilateral agreement despite intense lobbying by partners and members of his own cabinet.

But in Europe, the Iran move would be seen as far more damaging than Trump’s decision in June to pull out of the Paris climate accord.

“The threat from Iran in terms of nuclear proliferation is more immediate. This is far more dangerous,” said Elmar Brok, a veteran foreign policy expert in the European Parliament and party ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

European officials and analysts fear a breakdown of the JCPOA could lead to an arms race in the Middle East, a military conflict between Iran and Israel and an escalation of regional proxy wars between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

They fear it would also doom any chances, no matter how slim, for a negotiated deal with North Korea.

ALL ABOUT WAR

“At the end of the day it’s all about the risk of war,” said Francois Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

There is also the danger of a further deterioration in transatlantic ties, especially if Washington targets European firms that do business in Iran.

Were that to happen, the EU ambassador to Washington, David O‘Sullivan, has said Brussels would revert to a 1990s-era law that shields European companies from extraterritorial sanctions.

Even if the EU were to take such a step, the senior French diplomat said European companies could think twice about their Iran commitments.

Among firms that have announced big deals in Iran since the JCPOA went into force are planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA), French energy group Total (TOTF.PA) and Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE).

“One of the big difficulties of the agreement is ensuring the economic operators have confidence in the system and key to that is confidence in the United States,” the diplomat said.

Any signs that European companies are pulling back could prompt the Iranians to reassess the merits of the nuclear deal.

“The agreement with Iran is like a delicate plant,” said Omid Nouripour, an Iranian-born lawmaker with the German Greens party, which is expected to be part of Merkel’s next coalition government.

“It is a sign of what diplomacy can achieve but it is fragile. The American president doesn’t appear to believe in diplomacy. He seems intent on crushing this plant.”","Fearing Trump torpedo, Europe scrambles to save Iran deal",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-europe/fearing-trump-torpedo-europe-scrambles-to-save-iran-deal-idUSKBN1CG1XY?il=0

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Along with the ongoing decimation of Iraq's Sunni population, the referendum means that in practice ""Iraq"" no longer exists. In its place is a Shiite state dominated by Iran, the de facto new nation of Kurdistan, and a shrinking population of Sunnis tottering between annihilation or reservation-like existence, depending on whether the United States uses the last of its influence to sketch out red lines or abandons the people to fate.

The waste comes in that a better version of a de facto tri-state Iraq was available in 2006. Every life lost (out of a million some, including 4,424 Americans), every dollar spent (in the trillions), and every unanticipated outcome suffered (rise of Islamic State, conflict in Syria, de-democratization of Turkey) since then has been unnecessary.

The post-World War One failure to create a Kurdish state resulted in 30 million Kurds scattered across modern Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq destroyed civil order in much of the area populated by those Kurds, and opened the door to Iranian influence. Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies directed political violence against Iraqi Sunnis, paving the way for a Sunni protector, Islamic State, to move in.

When the American-trained (cost: $25 billion) Iraqi national army dropped its weapons and ran in 2014, and Shiite militias proved too weak to fill the breach, Obama reinserted the American military into Iraq, saving the Kurds, by then also under threat from Islamic State. The United States subsequently turned those Kurdish fighters loose in Iraq and later Syria against Islamic State. It was expediency over strategy; there was no force otherwise available in bulk.

And it kind of worked. In the short run.

The Kurds, with American help, blunted Islamic State’s progress. The problem was that while American diplomacy, the carrot-and-stick of aid, and the difficulty of maintaining long-distance logistics saw the Kurdish forces replaced by Shiite militias in some locations, the Kurds held on to their gains in the north, having in most instances displaced Iraqi Sunnis. Victorious and bloodied, the Kurds were not about to renounce their hard-earned gains.

The need for American arms did force Kurdish leaders to postpone an independence referendum, opposed by Washington, in 2014. Three years later, with Islamic State mortally weakened, Washington no longer holds sway over Kurdish ambitions. And although the Sept. 25 referendum has no legal force, Kurdish leaders will use the vote to push Baghdad for full autonomy. Donald Trump, the fifth consecutive American president to make war on Iraq, may be the last simply for lack of an Iraq to fight over.

The ground truth of autumn 2017 -- a Kurdistan in the north, a Shiite state in the south, a marginalized Sunni population out west -- is pretty much the deal that could have been had in 2006 when then-Senator Joe Biden proposed dividing Iraq into statelets. Biden wanted the United States to leave a ""residual force to combat terrorists and keep the [three] neighbors honest.” The Senate actually passed a resolution supporting Biden's idea.

It probably would have stabilized the region. The Middle East in 2006 was a very different place.

In 2006 Iran faced an American military as yet undamaged by an additional decade of grinding war. That military sat on both Iran's western border with Iraq and its eastern border with Afghanistan. The Iranian nuclear program was years behind where it is today. Syria was a relatively stable place under not-then-yet-enemy of the free world Bashar al-Assad; indeed, the British-educated Assad was initially seen as a minor reformer. Turkey was stable. Russia was not a major player in the Middle East.

With many of 2017's regional Pandoras still in the box, by Middle Eastern standards security in a divided Iraq would have been manageable via a modest American military presence.

Instead, events of the last decade mean the chance of Kurdish independence adding to regional stability is near zero. Iran, fearing that an independent Kurdish state could threaten its own sectarian balance, is already conducting maneuvers on the border, has canceled flights to and from Kurdistan, and will push its proxies in Baghdad to take action. Will Turkey, now politically distant from NATO, move to open war over disputed borderlands with Kurdistan? The Turkish parliament just extended its authorization for cross-border incursions for another year. Will Kurdish minorities in Turkey and Iran see this all as their moment to rise? Will Israel, which backs Kurdish independence in its search for regional allies, supply weapons?

In a best-case scenario, where everyone tacitly acknowledges Kurdistan while maintaining the status quo (as with Taiwan, which officially exists as a part of China even as it acts like an independent nation) there may be a measure of stability in the near term. Baghdad will talk tough even as it allows the Kurds a surprising amount of free reign -- for example, Baghdad has withdrawn its police from contested Kirkuk, leaving Kurdish forces fully in charge of the oil-rich city. Kurdistan already has full control over its own education, security, military, taxes, and diplomatic representation. Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government, has experimented with diplomatically vague language, saying “self-determination wouldn't mean a direct separation from Iraq.”

Darker predictions involve Syrian-Russian forces contesting Kurdish occupiers inside Syria. Iranian-backed Shiite militias have signaled plans to re-enter Kirkuk, and Turkey already has a running war with Kurdish fighters; tank maneuvers are ongoing with new threats gushing out of Ankara.

American policy has been a blurry gray for some time, calling for the referendum to be postponed without actually supporting or opposing independence. Traditionally the State Department favored a united Iraq somehow, while the Pentagon, with its history of in-the-dirt cooperation with Kurdish fighters stretching back to the 1991 no-fly zone and Operation Provide Comfort that essentially established the preliminary borders of Kurdistan, has been more sympathetic towards independence. The wording of America’s reaction (there has been no post-election statement issued as this is written) to the referendum could signal which part of government is making foreign policy in Iraq these days.

What seems clear is the American role going forward will be mostly limited to diplomacy, and that, regardless of who is carrying out the task, is not the country’s strong suit these days. There seems no appetite in Washington for large-scale troop redeployments, the kind of boots-on-the-ground necessary to decisively shape events.

The American military, which once could have played a role similar to its help in bringing peace to former Yugoslavia, instead will exist as a crumple zone among its own warring semi-allies.

Such a scenario exposes what might have been in 2006 when the United States could have managed events, and 2017, when America can do little more than witness them.",Commentary: Why the Kurdish referendum means the end of Iraq,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-kurds-commentary/commentary-why-the-kurdish-referendum-means-the-end-of-iraq-idUSKCN1C125Q

Although May has talked up the “promise of Brexit” since gaining power last year, she had, in the run-up to the June 2016 referendum, quietly backed staying in the European Union.

She won the top job after David Cameron, who had also campaigned to remain, resigned in the chaos following the shock result of the vote. She has ruled out holding a second referendum on the final deal of the terms of Brexit, despite calls for one from some pro-EU MPs.

Asked three times in an interview if she had changed her mind since then, she did not answer directly, saying she wouldn’t engage with hypothetical questions and said her job was now to deliver what the people had voted for.

“I voted remain for good reasons at the time, but circumstances move on and I think the important thing now is that I think we should all be focused on delivering Brexit and delivering the best deal,” she said on British radio station LBC on Tuesday.

The United Kingdom remains deeply divided over Brexit which most senior politicians view as the most important decision Britain has taken since World War Two.

In the June 23, 2016 referendum, 17.4 million voters, or 51.9 percent of votes cast, backed leaving the EU while 16.1 million voters, or 48.1 percent of votes cast, backed staying.

Britain has just over one year to negotiate the terms of the divorce and the outlines of the future relationship before it is due to leave in late March 2019. Both sides need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world’s biggest trading bloc and the fifth largest global economy.

But the other 27 members of the EU combined have about five times the economic might of Britain. They also have a strong incentive to deny the UK a deal so attractive it might encourage others to follow the British example.

May, who said she voted to remain, called a general election earlier this year in a bid to unite the country around her vision for Brexit. However, she lost her parliamentary majority, jeopardising her premiership.

Pressed on whether she would now vote leave, she said she would look at everything and come to a judgement, but stressed that there would not be another referendum.

Minister Damian Green, who is effectively May’s deputy, was asked on BBC Newsnight the same question. He said that it would have been better had the public voted to remain, but there would not be another referendum and it was his job as a democrat to work towards making Brexit a success.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s top e-commerce firm, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd [BABA.N], is launching a $15 billion drive to build overseas research hubs as the deep-pocketed firm looks to compete with global leaders in e-commerce, logistics and cloud technology.

The Alibaba ‘Damo’ academy would launch eight research bases in China, Israel, the United States, Russia and Singapore and was hiring 100 researchers to work on artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing and fintech, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.

“The Alibaba DAMO Academy will be at the forefront of developing next-generation technology that will spur the growth of Alibaba and our partners”, Chief Technology Officer Jeff Zhang said.

The Chinese giant and its affiliates have undergone a rapid expansion in the past year, bringing it into direct competition with U.S. e-retailer Amazon.com Inc [AMZN.O], as well as global payments, cloud and logitics firms.

Since last year Alibaba has invested roughly $2 billion to acquire a majority stake in Singapore-based retailer Lazada.com, creating a network of e-commerce hubs across Southeast Asia in partnership with payment affiliate Ant Financial.

It has also pursued a 1.2 billion bid for U.S. money transfer service MoneyGram, in a pending deal that has come under scrutiny from critics who say it poses a national security threat.

Along with an existing data science research lab in California, Alibaba has opened new data centers in Europe, the United States, the Middle East, Australia, Japan, India and Indonesia since 2016, in a bid to boost its cloud business.

The investment also comes as Beijing prioritises state funding in quantum computing, AI and big data, urging provincial governments, universities, the military and private firms to play a bigger role in developing advanced technology in areas where China trails developed countries.

FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) is poised to agree a deal to buy assets from insolvent Air Berlin (AB1.DE), a person familiar with the matter told Reuters, ahead of a deadline on Thursday.

Germany’s largest airline is set to buy Air Berlin’s Niki leisure unit, its LG Walter regional airline and some additional short-haul aircraft, the source said on Wednesday.

“The deal with Lufthansa is done, there is agreement,” the person said, adding that no contract had been signed yet.

Lufthansa declined to say whether it was set to sign a deal, saying only it was confident it would meet the deadline for negotiations.

Air Berlin, which has struggled to turn a profit over the last decade, filed for insolvency on Aug. 15, and a government loan has kept its planes in the air while it negotiates with potential buyers over parts of its business.

It said late last month that negotiations with Lufthansa and Britain’s easyJet (EZJ.L) would continue until Oct. 12.

The operations up for grabs also include access to take-off and landing slots at Air Berlin’s hubs in Tegel in the German capital and Duesseldorf.

EasyJet, which has a base at Berlin’s Schoenefeld airport, has been discussing acquiring 27 to 30 planes, though a media report earlier this week said talks could fail.

EasyJet said it would not comment on ongoing discussions and would provide a further update in due course if necessary.

Meanwhile German family-owned logistics firm Zeitfracht said it had made a new offer for Air Berlin’s cargo marketing platform and its maintenance business with a partner.

It declined to provide further details. A person familiar with the matter said that Zeitfracht’s new bid was made jointly with maintenance group Nayak and its owners.

The government proposes spending an additional 15 billion euros on training over five years, with employers saying they cannot fill vacancies despite a jobless rate of close to 10 percent, higher than in many European countries.

President Emmanuel Macron also wants to bring the national unemployment insurance fund, currently jointly run by unions and employers, under the state’s control.

Macron, a former banker whose other labor market reform plans have been condemned by some trade union leaders as a deathknell for high French standards of labor protection, wants to make a professional training program less bureaucratic.

He also wants the state to have more say over how much the unemployed get in benefits and for how long, which is currently largely set by unions and employers,

On Thursday the government is due to open talks with union leaders before deciding how to overhaul training and unemployment insurance.

Training is already funded to the tune of some 30 billion euros annually, financed in part by a levy on wage-earners, but is widely criticized for not benefiting workers that need it most.

Meanwhile, unions and employers are protective of their decades-old grip over the unemployment insurance benefits system worth billions of euros.

Macron angered unionists last week with comments he made during a visit to a car parts factory, where scuffles erupted between police and workers protesting over job losses.

“Instead of kicking up a bloody mess, some of them would be better off going to see if they can get a job over there,” he said, alluding to vacancies that a nearby aluminum factory was battling to fill.

Opponents accused Macron of showing contempt toward the workforce.

Nonetheless, business owners say the skills gap is a problem.

“We just can’t get people into factories,” Pierre Tisseau, whose company makes house terraces in Cholet in western France, told Reuters.

Tisseau said he hoped reforms to professional training would help him fill vacancies he has struggled to plug since 2008.

The local branch of the Medef business federation in Cholet said 9,000 people were looking for work but that firms were finding it hard to fill 1,500 vacancies in sectors such as construction, transport and the agri-foods.

Macron defied street protests led by the Communist Party-rooted CGT union to drive through employment law reforms that critics say will weaken collective bargaining and give more power to companies to set out work conditions.","After 'bloody mess' jab, Macron eyes training, job insurance reform",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CG1Z0

The operation was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters. But it was not as provocative as previous ones carried out since Trump took office in January.

The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Chafee, a guided-missile destroyer, carried out normal maneuvering operations that challenged “excessive maritime claims” near the Paracel Islands, among a string of islets, reefs and shoals over which China has territorial disputes with its neighbors.

China’s Defense Ministry said on Wednesday that a warship, two fighter jets and a helicopter had scrambled to warn the U.S. ship away, adding it had infringed upon China’s sovereignty and security with its “provocation”.

China would further strengthen its naval and air defenses, the ministry said.

“We demand the U.S. side earnestly take steps to correct its mistakes,” it added.

Related Coverage China says U.S. violated its sovereignty in South China Sea

Speaking earlier at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China had lodged “stern representations” with the United States, and reiterated that the Paracels were Chinese territory.

“China will continue to take resolute measures to protect Chinese sovereign territory and maritime interests. China urges the U.S. to conscientiously respect China’s sovereign territory and security interests, conscientiously respect the efforts regional countries have made to protect peace and stability in the South China Sea, and stop these wrong actions.”

Next month, Trump makes his first visit to Asia as president, including a stop in China, which he has been pressuring to do more to rein in North Korea. China is North Korea’s neighbor and biggest trading partner.

Unlike in August, when a U.S. Navy destroyer came within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built up by China in the South China Sea, officials said the destroyer on Tuesday sailed close to but not within that range of the islands.

Twelve nautical miles mark internationally recognized territorial limits. Sailing within that range is meant to show the United States does not recognize territorial claims.

The Pentagon did not comment directly on the operation, but said the United States carried out regular freedom-of-navigation operations and would continue to do so.

China’s claims in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in shipborne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.

Experts and some U.S. officials have criticized former president Barack Obama for potentially reinforcing China’s claims by sticking to innocent passage, in which a warship effectively recognized a territorial sea by crossing it speedily without stopping.

The U.S. military has a long-standing position that its operations are carried out throughout the world, including in areas claimed by allies, and that they are separate from political considerations.

The United States has said it would like to see more international participation in freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea.

NORTH KOREA ISSUE

Trump’s trip to Asia will likely be dominated by the North Korean nuclear threat. He will also visit South Korea, Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines.

In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, all in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Trump’s visit to China will reciprocate a trip to the United States made in April by Chinese President Xi Jinping. The U.S. president’s attempts to get Chinese help with North Korea have met with limited success so far, but he has gone out of his way to thank Xi for his efforts.",Exclusive: U.S. warship sails near islands Beijing claims in South China Sea - U.S. officials,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-military-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-warship-sails-near-islands-beijing-claims-in-south-china-sea-u-s-officials-idUSKBN1CF2QG

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contentious new U.S. demands are set to hit NAFTA negotiating tables on Wednesday, threatening to push modernization talks toward collapse as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau again tries to remind U.S. President Donald Trump of the trade pact’s merits.

Trudeau will meet with Trump and trade-focused U.S. lawmakers on the North American Free Trade Agreement while hundreds of negotiators, government officials and lobbyists from Canada, Mexico and the United States descend on a hotel in Arlington, Virginia for a fourth round of talks.

“We’re going to be talking about NAFTA and the fact it has led to great opportunities for our citizens,” Trudeau said on Tuesday night in conciliatory remarks at a Fortune magazine dinner honoring women, where he sat next to Ivanka Trump.

He added that he would “look for areas of agreement” with President Trump to improve outcomes for both countries.

The Canadian leader’s visit comes amid increasing acrimony over NAFTA renegotiations, with Trump making fresh threats to terminate the 23-year-old agreement and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday accusing Trump’s administration of trying to sabotage the talks with “poison pill proposals.”

Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray warned that an end to NAFTA would mark a breaking point in U.S.-Mexican relations and affect bilateral cooperation in non-trade areas.

The NAFTA talks are likely to stall in the face of aggressive U.S. demands to sharply increase content requirements for autos and auto parts, trade experts say.

The Washington round promises to be difficult, with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announcing early on Wednesday that talks would be extended by two days to Oct 17.

Lighthizer also said the three nations have completed their negotiations regarding company competition policy, reaching agreement on a chapter that provides goes beyond previous U.S. trade deals to ensure “certain rights and transparency under each nation’s competition laws.”

People briefed on the new U.S. proposals to be presented this week said that USTR is seeking to sharply lift North American content threshold for autos and auto parts to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent, with a 50 percent U.S.-specific content requirement.

“These will be met with widespread opposition from Canada and Mexico. I think it’s just a bridge too far,” said Wendy Cutler, the Asia Society’s Washington policy director and former chief U.S. negotiator for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal canceled by Trump.

Other contentious U.S. proposals opposed by Canada, Mexico and U.S. business interests include a five-year sunset provision, radical changes to NAFTA’s dispute arbitration systems, changes to intellectual property provisions and new protections for U.S. seasonal produce growers.

In his meeting with Trump, Trudeau is expected to remind the president that Canada is the United States’ biggest export customer, with largely balanced two-way goods and services trade, and is not the cause of U.S. manufacturing jobs lost under NAFTA, Canadian officials said.

Mexico has that distinction, with far lower wages that have lured U.S. auto plants and other manufacturers across its northern border, resulting in a $64 billion trade surplus with the United States last year that Trump administration officials have vowed to slash.

Or, as some conservatives fear, the far-left leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon be prime minister.","British politics are a terrible mess. But don’t blame populism, however that’s defined. If anything, blame democracy – however that’s organized.

Last June’s referendum result on Brexit was close – 52 percent voted for Britain to leave the European Union; 48 percent to stay – but indisputable. Unlike in the U.S., no one believes that Russia altered the outcome. And this was a vote not to “drain the swamp” of Westminster, but to strengthen it. As Gisela Stuart, one of the few Labour MPs who campaigned enthusiastically for Brexit as the head of the “Vote Leave” campaign put it, the electors “wanted to restore genuine democratic government and take back control of the laws that govern them.”

Brexit is what happened when people were given a voice. No doubt that many who voted for it were uninformed; some were voting for a better yesterday; many were fearful of the effects of mass immigration – especially of Muslims. A few Britons didn’t want any foreigners at all. But above all, they wanted to “take back control,” and believed that political power should reside in the British parliament – which is comprehensible in its workings and dignified by centuries of existence – rather than in a series of institutions in Brussels, confusing in their overlapping and largely mysterious operations.

No matter that those with more sophisticated views of governance saw the desire as foolish: “an attempt to create a romantic idea of what Britain could be like out of the EU,” said the Liverpool University political scientist Andrew Crines. The majority wanted politics to be at least within their understanding, their representatives – liked or loathed – familiar.

It is this view that has rumbled along beneath the surface for most of the 44 years in which Britain has been a member of the European Union; it is what Prime Minster Theresa May meant in her Brexit speech to politicians in Florence on Friday, when she said that the EU “never felt to us like an integral part of our national story.”

That feeling was quiescent at times, especially during the 13 years of a Labour government, from 1997 to 2010, fevered at others. It was most turbulent during Conservative administrations: the last three Conservative Prime Ministers – Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) John Major (1990-1997) and David Cameron (2010-2016) all lost power because they were fatally weakened by the internal argument on Europe within their party. No one gives Theresa May much hope of avoiding the Brussels curse which has wreaked so much damage on her predecessors.

The British prime minister is seen as someone clinging on to power, at the mercy of fellow ministers who could, at any time, bring her down. The most ambitious of these, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, has revealed his desire to lead his country most clearly. In an article in the Telegraph, he lauded the UK in the most elevated rhetoric employed in the Brexit cause, largely devoid of his trademark jests, expressing a bounding belief that “we can become the greatest country on earth.”

Giving only the briefest mention to his prime minister, he took over 4000 words to make the vision of a liberated Britain his own, striking a Churchillian pose with “I do not underestimate the scale of the task ahead as we take back control of our destiny” – the kind of rhetoric wholly absent from May’s cautious, if more precise, speeches.

Her Florence speech, clearly something of a compromise between her cabinet factions, vague on many details, nevertheless laid down a process, if not a destination: honoring commitments (that is, probably a 20 billion GBP – about $27 billion – payment to the EU), adopting new laws to protect the existing rights of European citizens living in the UK and passing through a two-year transition to give both sides, especially the UK, time to adjust to a customized relationship not based on the trade pacts which other, non-EU countries, have with the EU.

May’s all-but-impossible job is – as she interprets it – to keep a party and a cabinet with many Remainers in it relatively united, and to retain at least the acquiescence of the senior diplomats and civil servants, of the Bank of England and the main institutions of state, many – probably most – of whom believe Brexit to be most grievously self-wounding, consigning Britain not to greatness but to marginality.

Speaking in Washington earlier this week, Mark Carney, the Canadian who leads the Bank of England, warned of higher inflation, interest rate rises and slower growth, and forecast that Britain – unlike the other advanced countries – would be “an example of deglobalization, not globalization.”

The former close aide to the prime minister, Nick Timothy – whom May was told to fire after nearly losing the election in June – wrote ahead of May’s Florence speech that Chancellor Philip Hammond, was “maneuvering” towards a partial Brexit, failing to promote its advantages and, in his behind-the-scenes arguments with Boris Johnson, playing “games” with the future of the country.

These “maneuvers,” and many more at every level of government, are deployed around the office of an embattled prime minister who, with a relatively modest personality (for a senior politician), has no powerful public presence with which to offset the impression of barely-controlled chaos. Meanwhile, every institution at home and abroad affected by Brexit – there are many – call loudly and daily for a certainty at which the government has not yet arrived, and an easy transition which it cannot guarantee.

In a much-discussed book, “The Road to Somewhere”, the journalist David Goodhart (disclosure: a former Financial Times colleague, and a friend, of this columnist) sees in British society a widening split. On one side there are those who are anywhere people: at home in a globalizing world, with liberal views, enthusiastically pro-European, scornful of rootedness - “progressive individualists.” On the other, somewhere people, much more rooted in family and local work and friendships, not (in the main) bigoted but slow to adapt, worried by too-rapid change - “decent populists.”

Admitting that each side usually shares aspects of the other, he argues that the somewhere people have lost out in status, income and visibility in the last few decades, to the point where they often tell pollsters that they barely recognize the country they live in. Much more strongly represented in the working and lower middle class, less often university-educated, generally older than the anywheres, they still are the largest bloc in the country – and in the referendum, their pent-up vexations were allowed a release.

Their decision was probably not a wise act, but it was a thoroughly democratic one. They have given their country’s leadership one monster of a job: to reconcile what is a still globalizing world with their need for esteem and a restored sense that their country is recognizable, and that it is theirs.

O leilão de venda da fatia do governo paulista na Cesp estava previsto para setembro, mas foi suspenso em meio a um temor de falta de interessados, com potenciais compradores queixando-se porque os contratos das hidrelétricas da empresa vencem entre 2020 e 2028, prazo considerado curto para investimentos em energia, vistos como de longo prazo.

“É uma possibilidade. Lá atrás não houve uma convergência entre a posição de São Paulo e do Ministério da Fazenda sobre como dividir os benefícios...mas isso sempre é possível buscar uma convergência, e agora São Paulo vai tentar isso”, disse Pedrosa.

A Reuters publicou em setembro que o governo paulista negociava com a União uma solução para as concessões da Cesp a fim de renovar o interesse na privatização da companhia.

A Cesp opera 1,65 gigawatt em hidrelétricas no Estado de São Paulo, e a possibilidade de o comprador da empresa renovar no futuro os contratos dessas usinas em troca do pagamento de uma outorga à União poderia favorecer a arrecadação do Tesouro e ao mesmo tempo elevar o valor da Cesp para investidores.

“Estamos discutindo com eles um cronograma de trabalho...já existe cobertura legal para esse movimento....a União pode arrecadar, é uma oportunidade”, acrescentou Pedrosa.

Ele lembrou ainda que uma eventual renovação dos contratos das usinas não seria realizada em um modelo em que a energia é vendida a preço regulado, o chamado “regime de cotas”.

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

LONDON (Reuters) - For years the options market that companies and investors use to hedge against big swings in currencies viewed the euro as a bigger political and structural risk than Britain’s pound.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission proposed on Wednesday softer measures to strengthen the EU banking sector against future crises, after two years of fruitless talks among the 28 EU states on more ambitious plans.

The watered-down proposals are designed to win over Germany, the largest economy of the bloc and the staunchest opponent of sharing banking risks among EU states, but they were quickly dismissed by the German banking lobby.

The proposals could also create frictions with the European Central Bank over the pace of reduction of banks’ exposure to bad loans.

Germany’s outgoing finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, has repeatedly raised concerns that sharing risks would mean richer German banks propping up weaker rivals in other EU countries, such as Italy, Portugal or Greece.

To convince Germany, whose new finance minister may be equally resistant, the Commission has put forward a plan that reduces the sharing of banking risks and eyes stricter conditions that states must meet before their banking sectors can access safety nets funded at EU level.

The plan, revealed by Reuters last week, discards earlier proposals for full EU-sharing of savers’ protection in cases of bank failure and leaves the financial burden largely with individual member states.

EU rules guarantee all deposits up to 100,000 euros ($118,000), a provision meant to strengthen confidence in the banking sector after a decade-long crisis that has seen the bailout of several top banks in the bloc.

But existing national schemes to insure depositors are considered insufficient in the event of a major banking crisis. An EU backstop, funded by all banks in the bloc, is seen as the best guarantee to protect savers and increase market confidence.

UMBRELLA WITH HOLES?

Under the new proposals that the commission wants agreed by next year, a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) would intervene only after national insurance schemes have fully used their resources to rescue depositors.

In the initial phase, EDIS would only provide loans to national insurers amounting to a fraction of the losses, which would grow from 30 percent up to 90 percent in 2021.

In a second phase, EDIS would directly cover depositors’ losses, but only partially, while national insurance schemes would continue to bear the brunt of a banking crisis.

The beginning of the second phase would not be automatic but would depend on banks’ ability to clean their balance sheets and dispose of bad loans.

But the German banking lobby DK said the plan was “only a marginal advance” and urged measures to clean weak banks’ balance sheets before the launch of the scheme’s first phase.

So-called non-performing loans (NPLs) are slowly decreasing, but still account for nearly 1 trillion euros ($1.18 trillion), saddling mostly lenders in southern European countries.

The Commission said it would make new legislative proposals by spring to address the NPLs problem, including measures to revamp a secondary market for bad loans and to favor banks’ recovery of soured credit, such as mortgages.

It will also consider possible legislative measures on “minimum levels of provisioning which banks must make for future NPLs arising from newly originated loans.”

AFME, a European banking lobby, said it was concerned that “non-proportionate” prudential backstops could increase costs for banks and reduce the supply of loans.

CLASH WITH ECB?

This possible proposal on higher capital buffers could clash with ECB plans to impose similar requirements already from next year.

While the aims coincide with the ECB plan, the Commission’s parallel process could slow things down. EU legislative proposals require the backing of EU states and parliamentarians, a process that usually takes months or years before rules enter into force.

Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference he expected the ECB to take into account opinions of other institutions and market participants before adopting any measure.

He also said that legislators and supervisors have different powers and the ECB could intervene to address risks on specific banks.

The president of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, urged the ECB to involve the parliament in decisions on bad loans.

Italy has criticized the ECB move, urging a more gradual reduction of bad loans to avoid creating large holes in banks’ balance sheets. Germany has supported the ECB move.

But an EU legislator close to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Markus Ferber, attacked the ECB on Wednesday, saying it lacked “modesty” with its NPLs plans.

“I do not want to see the ECB creating a parallel regime of capital requirements that bypasses the legislator,” he said.","EU weakens plan on bank deposits safety net, risks clash with ECB",https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-banks-regulation/eu-weakens-plan-on-bank-deposits-safety-net-risks-clash-with-ecb-idINKBN1CG1NI?il=0

BERLIN (Reuters) - A co-leader of Germany’s Greens, a possible partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s next government, said on Wednesday the next head of the Eurogroup should support a shift away from austerity and toward investment and more fiscal solidarity.

The Greens are set to start exploratory talks next week with Merkel’s conservatives on forming a coalition government that also includes the pro-business, fiscally hawkish Free Democrats (FDP) after an election in September.

Unlike the FDP, who have cautioned against proposals by French President Emmanuel Macron for deeper fiscal integration in the single currency bloc, the Greens support common tax collection and an investment pact within the 19-country euro zone.

In January, Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem will step down as president of the Eurogroup, an informal body that plays a key role in shaping the economic policy of the bloc. The group will vote for a new chairman at a meeting in December.

“The upcoming leadership switch at the Eurogroup should be used as an opportunity for a new start in European fiscal and economic policy,” Greens co-chief Simone Peter said in a statement.

“Europe will gain from more solidarity. Europe’s fiscal policy needs a shift away from austerity toward a common pact for tax collection and investments, which would trigger social and ecological innovations.”

Like his German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble, Dijsselbloem opposes so-called transfers from richer euro zone states to poorer ones like Greece.

“It would be good for Europe if the chairman of the Eurogroup holds the position of European Finance Minister who reports to the European Parliament,” Peter said.

“French President Macron has put good proposals on the table, which should be taken on by the next government and should not be torpedoed as former Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble did” to previous proposals.

Schaeuble has agreed to step down after the Sept. 24 election that weakened Merkel’s conservatives. He will become president of the German parliament.

The smallcap mining sector is taking longer to recover from the commodity price crash of 2015-16 than the majors.

But the juniors have been increasingly active in Mali, regarded as a relatively stable jurisdiction, where Legend has a portfolio of gold projects and licences covering nearly 400 square kilometres.

Altus Strategies, which has signed a letter of intent to buy Toronto-listed Legend Gold, valuing it at 3.4 million pounds, said it was offering a 130 percent premium to Legend’s market close on Tuesday, but given low levels of liquidity for small miners that could still be cheap.

“Hopefully our timing is good. Some companies can go up 25 percent in a day in a highly illiquid market where price is not necessarily the same as value,” Steven Poulton, CEO of Altus Strategies, said in an interview.

The letter of intent should be followed by a firm all-equity deal by the end of the month.

Nervousness about Africa risk revived by an upsurge in resource nationalism, especially in Tanzania, has rattled the sector, but Mali’s gold is viewed as a relatively safe haven.

On Monday, another small miner Cora Gold (CORAC.L) listed on London’s AIM to raise cash to fund its mining project in Mali.

Altus Strategies listed in August to raise funds for its vocation as an African-focused project generator, which aspires to sell on its assets once they are established or find venture partners to develop them.

It has projects in Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Morocco and Liberia, covering a range of commodities, in addition to its anticipated purchases in Mali.

Poulton said until now Altus had been “underweight gold” and was still in acquisition mode.

“We’re restless in the sense we want to create value. Once this transaction is done, we will have grown the business, but we are constantly on the look out for accretive opportunities,” he said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is finalizing a deal to make 10 new episodes of Steven Spielberg’s 1980s science fiction anthology series “Amazing Stories,” landing a premiere Hollywood talent for its plunge into original TV programming, a source with knowledge of the discussions said.

The series would be produced for Apple by Spielberg’s Amblin Television and Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) NBCUniversal television production unit. “Amazing Stories” originally ran on the NBC broadcast network.

“We love being at the forefront of Apple’s investment in scripted programming,” NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke said in a statement about the show’s planned revival.

An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Amblin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The deal is the first to be made public since Apple hired veteran Sony executives Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg in June to expand the iPhone maker’s push into original programming, a field crowded with streaming services and traditional networks.

It is unclear how people will be able to watch “Amazing Stories” or when it will debut. Apple has not divulged if it will put its own TV series in the iTunes Store, where it sells shows made by other companies, or on another platform.

The deal with Spielberg fits with a strategy Apple executives have outlined in meetings with Hollywood executives. Apple has emphasized in the discussions that it wants prestigious programming and to work with A-list actors, producers and writers, according to sources with knowledge of Apple’s plans.

The company already has placed bids on other projects, including for a comedy series about morning television starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, sources said.

“They are looking for really high-end premium stuff they feel is creatively in line with the Apple brand,” one source said of Apple’s strategy.

The technology company is competing with several established players that have hooked big name stars, such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) HBO, plus newer entrants like Facebook Inc FB.N.

Apple has committed $1 billion to start its programming push, the sources said. Netflix, by comparison, says it will spend up to $7 billion on content next year.

ABUJA (Reuters) - The economy of sub-Saharan Africa is seen growing more slowly this year than previously forecast, largely due to weak investment and productivity, the World Bank said on Wednesday.

In a report, it forecast growth in the region to be 2.4 percent in 2017, down from the 2.6 percent that it projected in April. But growth was seen rising to 3.2 percent in 2018 and 3.5 percent in 2019, forecasts unchanged from earlier this year.

In its latest Africa Pulse report, the Bank said the region would be helped by better commodity prices. Lower prices have slowed overall growth in the resource-rich region in the last few years, cutting government revenues.

Sub-Saharan Africa’s growth was an estimated 1.3 percent in 2016, the lowest for two decades.

The Bank said the downgrade to 2017 projections was due to various conditions, including the failure of Nigeria - which has Africa’s biggest economy - to meet expectations.

“Regional per capita output growth is forecast to be negative for the second consecutive year, while investment growth remains low, and productivity growth is falling,” it said.

Nigeria escaped from its first recession in 25 years in the second quarter as oil revenues rose following the cessation of militant attacks on energy facilities in the Niger Delta that last year cut crude production by around a third.

However, the pace of growth was slow.

The Bank said Nigeria’s expected 1 percent growth in 2017 was 0.2 percentage points below the April forecast because the increase in oil production was below projections due to maintenance work. It said growth in the non-oil sector has remained subdued.

World Bank chief economist for Africa Albert Zeufack said sub-Saharan Africa’s recovery would partly be driven by Nigeria and South Africa, the continent’s second biggest economy which also exited recession in the second quarter.

Growth in South Africa is projected to rise from 0.6 percent in 2017 to 1.1 percent in 2018 and 1.7 percent in 2019. The forecast for 2019 was revised down by 0.3 percentage points.

Zeufack said the two countries need “deeper reforms” to get back to pre-2014 levels of growth and their political uncertainty needs to be reined in, adding that they make up about half of Sub-Saharan Africa’s GDP growth.

Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari spent much of this year in Britain receiving treatment for an unspecified illness. And South Africa’s President Jacob Zuma in August survived a no-confidence vote in parliament that could have forced him out of office.","Sub-Saharan Africa to grow at a slower rate this year, World Bank says",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-africa-economy/sub-saharan-africa-to-grow-at-a-slower-rate-this-year-world-bank-says-idUKKBN1CG1ON?il=0

OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Burkina Faso’s former foreign minister will be released from jail pending trial for treason over his alleged involvement in a coup attempt in 2015, his lawyer said on Wednesday.

Djibril Bassole was the last foreign minister under president Blaise Compaore who ruled for three decades before being driven out of power by mass protests in 2014.

He is among two dozen people accused of participating in the coup attempt the following year mounted by the presidential guard led by Compaore’s military advisor General Gilbert Diendere.

Bassole’s defence lawyer, Dieudonne Bonkoungou, said the military tribunal trying the case had agreed to his provisional release. It was not immediately clear when that would happen.

The defence team says Bassole had nothing to do with the coup attempt, and that he was detained for political reasons to prevent him running in the 2015 presidential election.

At least 11 people were killed and 271 injured as the presidential guard crushed protests against the plotters who had taken members of a transitional government hostage ahead of scheduled elections.

REUTERS - Rapper Eminem derided U.S. President Donald Trump as a racist and a reckless leader in a rap video that aired on Tuesday night during the Black Entertainment Television Hip Hop Awards.

Eminem told his fans in the four-minute unaccompanied vocal they must choose whether to support him or the president.

“Racism is the only thing that he’s fantastic for,” Eminem rapped in the video that was taped on Friday in a Detroit parking garage.

Trump has previously dismissed accusations of racism. For example, he said in February he is “the least racist person.”

Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Eminem’s rap, which was one of the most watched videos on YouTube early on Wednesday.

The rap also mentioned Barack Obama, Trump’s predecessor in the White House, and Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic rival in last year’s presidential election.

“But we better give Obama props / ‘cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze / that’ll probably cause a nuclear holocaust,” Eminem rapped.

Eminem rebuked Trump for his strong criticism of National Football League players who kneel during the national anthem before games. The gesture is a form of demonstration that began last year in silent protest against police violence against black people.

“He gets an enormous reaction / when he attacks the NFL so we focus on that in- / ‘stead of talkin’ Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada,” Eminem rapped, referring to a devastating hurricane that hit Puerto Rico last month and a mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people on Oct. 1.",Eminem rebukes 'racist' Donald Trump in awards show rap,https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-eminem/eminem-rebukes-racist-donald-trump-in-awards-show-rap-idINKBN1CG1NN

May has previously indicated a cap could cut average energy bills by around 100 pounds a year.
Once the law is passed, Ofgem would need to launch a statutory consultation process of around 50-60 days and then allow energy suppliers further time to implement the measure, meaning it could not be in place this winter.
“I cannot comment on next winter as it depends how quickly the bill will go through,” Nolan told journalists during a telephone briefing.

Prime Minister Theresa May stunned the industry last week when she announced a plan to impose price caps on standard variable tariffs (SVT), the basic rate that energy suppliers charge if a customer does not opt for a specific fixed-term deal.

Further details of the government’s proposals are expected on Thursday.

Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said he did not know how long it would take for the government bill to become law, but it would then take around another five months before the regulator could start capping people’s bills.

Around 70 percent of households are on SVTs. May has previously indicated a cap could cut average energy bills by around 100 pounds a year.

Once the law is passed, Ofgem would need to launch a statutory consultation process of around 50-60 days and then allow energy suppliers further time to implement the measure, meaning it could not be in place this winter.

“I cannot comment on next winter as it depends how quickly the bill will go through,” Nolan told journalists during a telephone briefing.

Ofgem had already proposed intervening in the part of the market that supplies more vulnerable customers. A new scheme for this sector would protect around 1 million households next February, it said.

The regulator is also working on plans to extend its price protection plan to a further 2 million vulnerable households by next winter, but Nolan said this would be dependent on the timing of the government’s legislation.

Ofgem said it would now consult the industry on its safeguard tariff for SVTs while the government’s draft bill passes through parliament, and said suppliers in the meantime must step up efforts to provide better value deals.

U.S. banks’ equity trading volume has been hit by record lows in volatility as investors have less reason to trade if stocks are not moving much. At the end of the third quarter, the quarterly average for the CBOE market volatility index .VIX, was at its lowest ever.

On top of this, traders said that equity trading had also been dampened by an ongoing rise in popularity of passive investment instruments such as exchange traded funds over active investing.

Trading volume for fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) was also hurt by weak volatility in the quarter. Making matters worse, banks face a difficult comparison with the year-ago quarter when investors were busy reacting to the Brexit vote and preparing for the U.S. election.

“August was very slow. We saw some fits and starts from different headlines in September,” said Thomas Roth, head of U.S. Treasury trading at MUFG Securities America in New York.

While S&P banks were still expected to report EPS growth of 6.4 percent and revenue growth of 1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, analysts pared their estimates during the quarter as expectations for trading revenue declined.

Revenue estimates were 2.2 percent lower than where they were July 1 while EPS estimates were 1.8 percent lower.

Banks in aggregate will report a 16 percent decline in trading revenue from the year-ago quarter and a 7 percent decline from the second quarter, according to KBW estimates, following a 10 percent year-over year drop in trading revenue for the second-quarter.

The third-quarter decline includes a 25 percent drop in fixed income, currency and commodities trading revenue and flat equity trading revenue, according to KBW.

Executives from JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) all warned in September about weak trading revenue in what they described as a challenging quarter.

Goldman Sachs (GS.N) was expected to see the biggest drop in trading revenue with a 20 percent overall decline from the year-ago quarter driven by a 40 percent drop in its FICC trading revenue, according to KBW.

JPMorgan (JPM.N) is expected to show an overall drop of 19 percent driven by a 25 percent drop in FICC trading revenue and a 2 percent drop in equity revenue. Citigroup (C.N) will see overall trading revenue tumble 16 percent while Bank of America’s (BAC.N) was seen declining 15 percent. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) was expected to fare the best with a 10 percent drop in trading revenue, KBW estimated.

Some of the factors that drove trading declines in the third quarter will still be around in the fourth quarter, according to traders and other market watchers.

“Who knows when volatility will pick up?” said Russell Price, senior economist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, MI. “Comparisons will be better after the first of the year and we could know more on tax reform so that could help on trading activity,” he said.",Light trading volume seen as black spot in banks' results,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-results/light-trading-volume-seen-as-black-spot-in-banks-results-idUSKBN1CG1C6?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

The proposed voting system is backed by three of the country’s four largest parties, with the center-left government looking to rush it onto the statute books ahead of elections, which are due by May 2018.

Unlike the current rules, the new system would allow the formation of multi-party coalitions before the ballot, a factor likely to hurt 5-Star, which refuses to join alliances.

“They want to take away our right to choose,” said Nicola Zuppa, 45, who said he had paid 175 euros ($200) to travel from Padua in northern Italy to take part in the protest, which drew up to 2,000 people in the heart of Rome.

Five-Star supporters distributed leaflets declaring a “full democratic emergency” on commuter trains early on Wednesday to try to muster a large crowd ahead of two confidence votes on Wednesday, both of which the government is expected to win.

A third such motion is set for Thursday, as the ruling coalition looks to truncate discussion on the bill and sidestep dozens of planned secret votes on various amendments.

Five-Star said it would not participate in the first confidence vote in a sign of protest, virtually guaranteeing that the motion will pass.

“If you allow the electoral rules to be changed again so that the scum of the country rises to the top yet again, it will be your children who pay the price,” 5-Star’s founder Beppe Grillo wrote on his blog on Wednesday.

Small left-wing parties that oppose the law will stage a protest in front of the ancient Roman Pantheon temple in the afternoon.

Pier Luigi Bersani, a former leader of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) and now a member of the small leftist MDP party, said the decision to use confidence votes to try to force through the electoral law “opens up a huge question of democracy”.

If a government loses a confidence vote, it must resign.

A final secret vote on the bill, in which lawmakers could break with the party line, is scheduled before the end of the week. If it passes, the law moves to the upper house Senate.

Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s PD drafted the new rules, which are supported by right-wing parliamentary rivals Forza Italia (Go Italy!) and the Northern League. Five other small parties are also backing the proposed law.

“This electoral law is supported by eight different parties, and it’s a very delicate equilibrium,” said Ettore Rosato, the PD group leader who presented the bill (dubbed the Rosatellum after him).

Five-Star estimates that the new rules could cost it up to 50 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and potentially scupper its chances of being the largest group in parliament after the vote.

President Sergio Mattarella is expected to give the formation that gets the most seats in parliament the first crack at forming a government.

The ruling Democratic Party denies the new rules are designed to penalize 5-Star.

“No one is preventing (5-Star) from making alliances if they want to,” Rosato told reporters. “If they don’t want to do them, they can continue to be an isolated party.”",Italy's 5-Star protests as parliament votes on electoral law,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-vote/italys-5-star-protests-as-parliament-votes-on-electoral-law-idUSKBN1CG1MC?il=0

SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military flew two strategic bombers over the Korean peninsula in a show of force late on Tuesday, as President Donald Trump met top defense officials to discuss how to respond to any threat from North Korea.

Tensions have soared between the United States and North Korea following a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test in recent weeks as it fast advances toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

The two U.S. Air Force B-1B bombers were joined by two F-15K fighters from the South Korean military after leaving their base in Guam, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement on Wednesday.

After entering South Korean airspace, the two bombers carried out air-to-ground missile drills in waters off the east coast of South Korea, then flew over the South to waters between it and China to repeat the drill, the release said.

The U.S. military said in a separate statement it conducted drills with Japanese fighters after the exercise with South Korea, making it the first time U.S. bombers have conducted training with fighters from both Japan and South Korea at night.

The U.S. bombers had taken off from the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. In August, Pyongyang threatened to fire intermediate-range missiles toward the vicinity of Guam, a U.S. Pacific territory that is frequently subjected to sabre-rattling from the North.

GUARD RAISED

South Korean and U.S. government officials have been raising their guard against more North Korean provocations with the approach of the 72nd anniversary of the founding of North Korea’s ruling party, which fell on Tuesday.

Trump hosted a discussion on Tuesday on options to respond to any North Korean aggression or, if necessary, to prevent Pyongyang from threatening the United States and its allies with nuclear weapons, the White House said in a statement.

Trump was briefed by Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford at a national security team meeting, the statement said.

U.S. and South Korean wartime operational plans, including a plan to wipe out the North Korean leadership, were stolen by North Korean hackers last year, a South Korean ruling party lawmaker said on Wednesday.

Some 235 gigabytes of military documents were taken from South Korea’s Defense Integrated Data Center in September last year, Democratic Party representative Rhee Cheol-hee said in radio appearances on Wednesday, citing information from unidentified South Korean defense officials.

In May, an investigative team inside the defense ministry announced the hack had been carried out by North Korea, but did not disclose what kind of information had been taken.

SHIPS BANNED

The United Nations Security Council, which has imposed a series of ever tighter sanctions on North Korea, has banned four ships from ports globally for carrying coal from North Korea, including one vessel that also had ammunition.

The vessels are the first to be designated under stepped-up sanctions imposed on North Korea by the 15-member council in August and September over two long-range ballistic missile launches and Pyongyang’s sixth and largest nuclear test.

China, North Korea’s main ally and trading partner, has consistently argued sanctions alone will not work, urging Washington and Pyongyang to lower their rhetoric and return to the negotiating table.

China’s influential Global Times tabloid expressed alarm at how far the rhetoric on both sides had gone and how it had increased the risk of a “fatal misjudgment”.

“The international community won’t accept North Korea as a nuclear power. North Korea needs time and proof to believe that abandoning its nuclear program will contribute to its own political and economic advantage. This positive process is worth a try,” the paper said in an editorial late on Tuesday.

“War would be a nightmare for the Korean Peninsula and surrounding regions.

P&G shareholders are not being offered a choice between one chief executive or another.
Since P&G’s board before Peltz jolted it into action had no such representative, they consider his pitch favorably.

To put it another way, Peltz just has to win one of the three.","NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Procter & Gamble is counting on a variation of America’s electoral arithmetic as its best hope for keeping Nelson Peltz off the board of directors. There’s no particularly good reason for shareholders to deny the pushy investor, whose hedge fund Trian Partners owns 1.5 percent of the $235 billion diapers-to-shampoo conglomerate, a seat at the table. Yet as at the ballot box, a combination of voter apathy and arcane rules is likely to leave three investors holding all the cards at next Tuesday’s annual meeting.

It is an irony of the way American public equity markets have developed that the most important deciders on the P&G saga – as in many other proxy battles involving the world’s most valuable companies – are so-called passive index-fund managers led by Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. To further the imperfect political analogy, they play roles similar to the ones Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania did in helping put Donald Trump into the Oval Office, even though his rival Hillary Clinton achieved more of the popular vote last November.

There are differences, of course. P&G shareholders are not being offered a choice between one chief executive or another. The question of whether to give Peltz, who comes armed with ideas about how P&G can improve its performance and more experience in the sector than most if not all of the company’s sitting directors, is far from existential. He would be one of about a dozen people helping set strategy, compensation and the like. Handing him a board seat is pretty much a no-lose option on bettering the maker of Tide and Pampers.

The insular, Cincinnati-based company thinks differently. P&G’s notorious allegiance to internal candidates for nearly every high-level position makes it vulnerable to criticism that it does not like outsiders telling it what to do. That’s a central theme to Peltz’s charges of P&G’s underperformance. For its part, the giant led by David Taylor says it’s already on track to create a “profoundly different, much stronger, and more profitable company” than just a few years ago.

As in previous engagements, Peltz is apt to have won over most of those P&G investors who spend their days thinking about whether to keep the investment in their portfolio. These so-called active managers, a group that in P&G’s case includes hedge funds, mutual funds and some pension funds, tend to agree that corporate boards benefit from having a voice from the investor community in their midst. Since P&G’s board before Peltz jolted it into action had no such representative, they consider his pitch favorably.

”Peltz’s experience in the consumer product space will add value to P&G’s board and his significant stake in the company will bring an owner’s perspective inside the boardroom,“ said Anne Sheehan, the director of corporate governance at CalSTRS, on Thursday. ”The addition of Mr. Peltz to the board is best for P&G, the CalSTRS fund and ultimately, the teachers of California.”

It’s here where the electoral math starts to matter. P&G has about 2.6 billion shares outstanding. Proxy advisers working either side of the tussle roughly estimate that investors like CalSTRS, Fidelity and Capital Group own about 41 percent of those shares. Assume 90 percent of the active managers live up to their billing and vote. If 80 percent of them tilt in favor of Peltz, that would give Trian about 770 million votes.

Retail investors own about the same amount of P&G, however. They tend to go along with what management has told them to do in the proxy cards that arrive in the post, as Trian learned the hard way when it failed to garner enough support to win seats on the board of DuPont two years ago. Like the American electorate, this group doesn’t tend to vote the way Fidelity and other institutions do. P&G may have an extra edge, though, in that many of its former workers still hold the stock, or received it as part of their retirement.

Yet there may also be folks who own the stock because, say, they love Dawn dishwashing liquid or live in the Cincinnati area and worry that Peltz would move its headquarters to the Bronx. So for arithmetic purposes, assume a slightly higher 60 percent of retail shareholders vote, and 80 percent of them cast their ballot against Peltz. That would give P&G 515 million votes.

That’s obviously not enough, and explains the significance of Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. They have been the biggest beneficiaries of a trend toward investing in funds that simply track benchmark indexes like the S&P 500 – and charge lower fees for doing so – at the expense of higher-cost managers. Together, the trio control more than 17 percent of P&G, according to Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory firm that favors Peltz’s proposal.

To beat back Peltz, P&G needs to make up the difference between the active and retail investors, of some 255 million shares. In this scenario, P&G can only make that happen by bringing all three to its side. Vanguard, with 181 million shares, is the largest. State Street and BlackRock own 115 million and 156 million, respectively, according to ISS. To put it another way, Peltz just has to win one of the three.

Though that sounds like a tall order for P&G, past voting records give it a chance. In votes for directors proposed by shareholders, BlackRock only cast its ballot against management’s wishes 17 percent of the time at U.S. companies in the year to June 30. Nearly half the time, Vanguard sided with board-related proposals put forward by shareholders at U.S. companies. State Street says it cast its ballot in favor of any shareholder proposal, in defiance of management, only about 7 percent of the time in the first half of this year on a global basis.

These are not perfectly comparable statistics. They nevertheless suggest that P&G has a chance, just as Trump clearly did, if it can woo the investment world’s version of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin. That also means a weekend trip for Peltz to suburban Malvern in the Keystone State – where Vanguard calls home – is advisable.",Breakingviews - Cox: P&G counting on an investor electoral college,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-procter-gamble-trian-breakingviews/breakingviews-cox-pg-counting-on-an-investor-electoral-college-idUSKBN1CB25W

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM.O) has offered to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) without some of its patents in a bid to win EU antitrust regulatory approval for the $38 billion deal, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

The NXP deal, the biggest-ever in the semiconductor industry, would make Qualcomm the leading supplier to the fast-growing automotive chips market.

Qualcomm, which supplies chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple (AAPL.O), submitted its proposal to the European Commission on Oct. 5, but did not provide details.

The EU competition authority is worried that the merged company may provide incentives to customers to buy bundled products, thereby squeezing out rivals, or change NXP’s intellectual property licensing practices.

Qualcomm has told regulators it will not acquire NXP’s standard essential patents, which the Dutch company can sell to another buyer, the sources said.

The company also agreed not to take legal action against third parties related to NXP’s near field communication (NFC) patents except for defensive purposes. NXP co-invented NFC chips which enable mobile phones to be used to pay for goods and store and exchange data.

Qualcomm also offered an interoperability pledge, allowing rival products to function with NXP’s products.

The Commission has told rivals and customers to provide feedback to the offer by the end of the week. It can demand more if the feedback is negative.",Qualcomm offers to buy NXP minus some patents to allay EU concerns: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nxp-semicondtrs-m-a-qualcomm-eu/qualcomm-offers-to-buy-nxp-minus-some-patents-to-allay-eu-concerns-sources-idUSKBN1CF20D

SOCHI, Russia (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin, a dog lover, received a top breed puppy as a belated birthday gift on Wednesday from Turkmenistan’s president who is keen to recover lost Russian markets for Turkmen gas.

“We have a common friend - this is the world’s unique alabai dog. And today I brought this little alabai with me,” President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov said before talks with Putin, pulling the pup out from a portable cage and holding it up by the scruff of its neck.

Putin, who marked his 65th birthday on Oct. 7, took the puppy, called Verny which means “faithful” in Russian, and kissed it in its forehead.

The alabai is a home-bred Turkmen variety of the Central Asian shepherd dog. Along with the handmade carpets and the ancient Akhal Teke breed of race horses, it is officially listed as part of Turkmenistan’s national heritage.

Plush and cuddly when they are young, alabai dogs grow into fierce shepherd dogs, fearless in warding off wolves but also in dealing with human strangers.

Berdymukhamedov, a flamboyant former dentist whose interests range from sport cars to noble horses, enjoys a personality cult and autocratic powers in his desert nation which sits on the world’s fourth-largest natural gas reserves.

The two men held talks at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, on the sidelines of a summit of ex-Soviet states, with the Turkmen side keen to see a possible resumption of natural gas exports to Russia.

Russia, once the main buyer of Turkmen gas, stopped buying the fuel last year due to a price dispute. China, with its growing appetite for energy, is now the main market for Turkmen gas.

Frankfurt (Reuters) - An den europäischen Aktienmärkten haben sich die Anleger am Dienstag kaum aus der Deckung gewagt.

Der Dax notierte am frühen Nachmittag mit 12.957 Punkten 0,2 Prozent im Minus. Der EuroStoxx50 verlor 0,3 Prozent auf 3601 Zähler.

In Madrid ging die Börse wieder in die Knie. Der Leitindex verlor rund ein Prozent. Banken-Titel gaben im Schnitt knapp zwei Prozent nach. Spanische Anleihen flogen erneut aus den Depots, was die Rendite der zehnjährigen Papiere auf ein Tageshoch von 1,70 Prozent von 1,68 Prozent am Montag trieb. Sollte es tatsächlich zur Ausrufung der Unabhängigkeit kommen, werde das die spanischen Anleihen weiter unter Druck setzen, sagte Analyst Dirk Gojny von der National-Bank in Essen voraus.

Relativ kalt ließ die Entwicklung in Spanien erneut den Euro. Die Gemeinschaftswährung kletterte um rund einen halben US-Cent auf ein Tageshoch von 1,1807 Dollar.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain hopes a provisional U.S. ruling imposing tariffs on Canadian aerospace manufacturer Bombardier (BBDb.TO) will not be politically influenced when new evidence is considered, UK Business Secretary Greg Clark said on Tuesday.

Clark said he was confident the British government could successfully fight the complaint, which was brought by Boeing (BA.N) and could cost jobs in the British province of Northern Ireland.

“Following the initial determination, there is then a further call for evidence ... we look to the U.S. to make sure that this is a rigorous process and is not politically influenced,” Clark told lawmakers.

The U.S. Commerce Department has raised proposed trade duties on Bombardier CSeries jets to nearly 300 percent, backing Boeing’s complaint that the Canadian company received illegal subsidies and dumped the planes at “absurdly low” prices.

The decision could effectively halt sales of Bombardier’s new plane to U.S. airlines by quadrupling the cost of the jets imported to the United States, although Clark said the jet did not directly compete with Boeing’s aircraft.

Clark said British Prime Minister Theresa May had twice discussed the dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump, and that several members of the British government had reinforced their “serious concerns” with the U.S. administration over the ruling.

He added Britain would discuss the ruling with the United States, Canada and the two companies in the coming days.

Bombardier is the largest manufacturing employer in Northern Ireland, and the decision to impose duties on the planes has put 4,200 jobs at risk.

But Britain is also a major base for Boeing. The company has recently begun constructing its first European parts manufacturing site in Sheffield, northern England, and Britain has warned that Boeing might miss out on future business over the row.

“Boeing has a reputation in this country that was beginning to grow in a positive way, through the investment in Sheffield and elsewhere,” Clark said.

“To jeopardize that reputation and relationship by doing something that is completely unjustified is something that I don’t regard as being in the strategic interests of Boeing.”",Britain hopes U.S. will keep politics out of Bombardier decision,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CF122-OCADN

SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military flew two strategic bombers over the Korean peninsula in a show of force late on Tuesday, as President Donald Trump met top defense officials to discuss how to respond to any threat from North Korea.

Tensions have soared between the United States and North Korea following a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test in recent weeks as it fast advances toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

The two U.S. Air Force B-1B bombers were joined by two F-15K fighters from the South Korean military after leaving their base in Guam, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement on Wednesday.

After entering South Korean airspace, the two bombers carried out air-to-ground missile drills in waters off the east coast of South Korea, then flew over the South to waters between it and China to repeat the drill, the release said.

The U.S. military said in a separate statement it conducted drills with Japanese fighters after the exercise with South Korea, making it the first time U.S. bombers have conducted training with fighters from both Japan and South Korea at night.

The U.S. bombers had taken off from the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. In August, Pyongyang threatened to fire intermediate-range missiles toward the vicinity of Guam, a U.S. Pacific territory that is frequently subjected to sabre-rattling from the North.

GUARD RAISED

South Korean and U.S. government officials have been raising their guard against more North Korean provocations with the approach of the 72nd anniversary of the founding of North Korea’s ruling party, which fell on Tuesday.

Trump hosted a discussion on Tuesday on options to respond to any North Korean aggression or, if necessary, to prevent Pyongyang from threatening the United States and its allies with nuclear weapons, the White House said in a statement.

In May, an investigative team inside the defense ministry announced the hack had been carried out by North Korea, but did not disclose what kind of information had been taken.

SHIPS BANNED

The United Nations Security Council, which has imposed a series of ever tighter sanctions on North Korea, has banned four ships from ports globally for carrying coal from North Korea, including one vessel that also had ammunition.

The vessels are the first to be designated under stepped-up sanctions imposed on North Korea by the 15-member council in August and September over two long-range ballistic missile launches and Pyongyang’s sixth and largest nuclear test.

China, North Korea’s main ally and trading partner, has consistently argued sanctions alone will not work, urging Washington and Pyongyang to lower their rhetoric and return to the negotiating table.

China’s influential Global Times tabloid expressed alarm at how far the rhetoric on both sides had gone and how it had increased the risk of a “fatal misjudgment”.

“The international community won’t accept North Korea as a nuclear power. North Korea needs time and proof to believe that abandoning its nuclear program will contribute to its own political and economic advantage. This positive process is worth a try,” the paper said in an editorial late on Tuesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British government confirmed on Wednesday up to 557 million pounds of funding for the next clean electricity auctions for less-established renewables.

The next so-called contracts-for-difference (CfD) auction will take place in spring 2019, the government said in a statement but has not yet confirmed how much will be available for that auction.

Less-established renewables include offshore wind, biomass, energy-from-waste technologies and some combined heat and power projects, a government spokesman said.

Under the CfD scheme, qualifying projects are guaranteed a minimum price at which they can sell electricity and renewable power generators bid for CfD contracts in a round of auctions.

The results of the last CfD auction were released last month. In that auction, the cost of new offshore wind power fell below new nuclear generation for the first time.

The eleven renewable energy projects which won contracts were expected to deliver up to 3 gigawatts (GW) of new electricity generation capacity from 2021-2023, with the contracts worth up to 176 million pounds a year.

Offshore wind is one of the more expensive forms of renewable energy, but the government said it will continue to support the technology as long as costs come down.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committee said on Wednesday the international nuclear deal with Iran should be strictly enforced, but did not call for an end to the agreement, saying Washington should work with allies.

“As flawed as the deal is, I believe we must now enforce the hell out of it,” Representative Ed Royce said at a hearing. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce as soon as on Thursday a new strategy for Iran that could include a first step toward Washington exiting the agreement.

Royce, like every other Republican in the U.S. Congress, opposed the nuclear agreement reached under President Barack Obama, a Democrat, in 2015 and signed by the United States, Iran, China, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and the European Union.

But several of Obama’s fellow Democrats also opposed the deal, including Representative Eliot Engel, the ranking Democrat on the foreign affairs panel.

Engel said at the hearing that killing the deal would be a “grave mistake,” since it is in place and backed by U.S. allies and other powers.

“We need to work with allies and partners on a shared agenda that holds the regime in Iran accountable, not dividing America from our closest friends across the globe,” he said.

Trump is expected to announce an “overall Iran strategy,” including whether to decertify the international deal curbing Tehran’s nuclear program ahead of an Oct. 15 deadline.

If Trump declines to certify the Iran deal, it would open a 60-day window in which U.S. congressional leaders could move quickly to reimpose sanctions on Tehran suspended under the agreement. That could be a first step toward Washington existing the agreement, something strongly opposed by European allies.

If Congress does not act, however, it would leave the agreement in place. Many congressional sources and others familiar with the process say the Trump administration is considering using decertification to increase pressure on Tehran, not to end the deal.

Iranian officials have said they will not renegotiate.","Key U.S. lawmakers back enforcing, not ditching, Iran pact",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa-congress/key-u-s-house-republican-backs-enforcing-not-ditching-iran-pact-idUSKBN1CG1XE

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Tim Cahill scored an extra-time winner to keep Australia’s World Cup hopes alive with a 2-1 win in the Asian qualifying playoff on Tuesday which dashed war-torn Syria’s fairytale bid to reach the finals for the first time.

Syria fought right until the end of the 120-minute match and Omar Al Somah could have secured their passage on the away goals rule at the death, only for his brilliantly struck free kick to hit Mat Ryan’s right post and bounce away.

The 3-2 aggregate victory sends the Socceroos into an intercontinental playoff in November against the fourth-placed team in North and Central America and Caribbean (CONCACAF) qualifying with a World Cup spot on the line.

The United States, Panama and Honduras, the three teamns who could provide the opposition, play their final qualifiers later on Tuesday.

The Syrians had battled the odds to even get into the playoff, having been forced to play all their “home” matches in Malaysia because of the civil war in their own nation.

Without five first-choice players through injury or suspension, they also had to play most of extra time with 10 men after midfielder Mahmoud Al Mawas was dismissed for two yellow cards.

“I think (it might have been different) if we had stayed with 11 players and hadn’t had that red card and not hit the post at the end,” Syria coach Ayman Hakeem told reporters.

“I am very proud of my boys with what they have achieved so far and that’s going to be continuing moving forward as well.”

Cahill scored Australia’s opener in the 13th minute but it was not until 96 minutes later that he notched up his 50th international goal to keep alive his country’s hopes of a fourth successive appearance at the World Cup finals.

It made for another nervous night for Australian fans as the Socceroos once again failed to find a way to get the scoreboard to reflect their dominance.

“We always find a difficult way to do things ... but we got through, I think we deserved to get through,” Australia coach Ange Postecoglou said.

“Timmy was Timmy, that’s why he’s the greatest ever.”

The Syrians made the perfect start in the sixth minute to cancel out Australia’s away goal advantage from the 1-1 first-leg draw.

Tamer Haj Mohamad dispossessed Mark Milligan in midfield and he fed Al Somah, who outpaced the Australian defence and planted the ball high into the net with his left foot.

DROPPED MIDFIELDER

The Asian champions were back on terms in 13th minute when Mathew Leckie broke down the right and delivered a pinpoint cross that 37-year-old Cahill headed home.

Australia dominated the remainder of the first half, with Syrian skipper Zaher Medani blocking a Cahill shot and goalkeeper Ibrahim Alma denying James Troisi and Leckie.

Alma again had to be at his best to stop a fierce Rogic strike from the edge of the box after 70 minutes and the Celtic midfielder curled a shot just wide of the far post from the ensuing corner.

Once Al Mawas was sent off for a second foul on Aaron Mooy four minutes into the first period of extra time, it appeared only a matter of time before the Australians would break down the already weary visitors.

Robbie Kruse finally carved out the decisive chance in the 109th minute when his perfectly weighted cross to the far post found Cahill, who headed the ball into the top left-hand corner of the net to the delight of the majority of the 42,000 crowd.",Cahill's extra-time winner dashes Syria dreams,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFKBN1CF24Q-OZASP

“The date is July 7 but no-one really believes it will happen on that day,” said one Western official in Kabul who follows the election process closely.
But there are still major worries over the rollout of a sufficiently robust voter registration system.
“The key decision that needs to be made now is how you are settling the polling centre-based voter registration lists because it takes time,” Dahler Kardel said.
“If the parliamentary elections fall apart, it’s likely that the presidential elections will fall apart too.”","KABUL (Reuters) - Less than a year before Afghanistan is due to hold much-delayed parliamentary elections, technical problems and political wrangling are hampering a project seen as vital to ensuring the country’s long-term stability.

Ever since the fraud-tainted presidential election of 2014, the Kabul government and its Western backers have been wrestling with the problem of how to hold fair and transparent elections. Parliamentary and district council polls scheduled for July 7 are seen as a major political test and dry run for the next presidential vote in 2019.

But delays in creating reliable voter registration systems and opposition to an election commission many critics judge is too close to President Ashraf Ghani have raised doubts about whether organisers of the vote - previously slated for October 2016 - will meet the latest deadline.

“The date is July 7 but no-one really believes it will happen on that day,” said one Western official in Kabul who follows the election process closely.

For Western countries, desperate for progress after 16 years in Afghanistan, some measure of fudge or delay may be acceptable.

But after repeated postponements since parliament’s mandate expired in 2015, there are fears the shaky political stability achieved since the Taliban government was ousted in 2001 will be undermined if the process is derailed completely.

“If elections do not take place, you go back to square one and you’re asking, how do you actually do the division of political power?” said Pernille Dahler Kardel, deputy representative of the United Nations Secretary General in Afghanistan.

“It’s to drive that longer term agenda that the international community is so absolutely focused on the electoral agenda.”

Electoral reform was one of the centrepieces of the U.S.-brokered deal between Ghani and his former rival Abdullah Abdullah, who joined him in a national unity government after months of wearying negotiations in 2014.

Last week, Ghani pledged to meet the July date and the UN signed an agreement with Afghan authorities creating the legal footing for the UN and donor countries to support the process.

Imam Mohammad Warymoch, chief electoral officer of the Independent Election Commission, said the IEC was “committed to doing the election on time” but admitted: “At the moment, we are a little bit behind.”

VOTER REGISTRATION

Warymoch said much of the assessment work on thousands of polling stations across Afghanistan, many in areas outside government control, had been completed. But there are still major worries over the rollout of a sufficiently robust voter registration system.

The commission has still not awarded the contract to manage a sophisticated biometric system that Ghani wants to identify voters and match them to allotted polling centres.

Mindful of the technical hurdles in rolling out an untested system in under nine months, some Western officials have urged using a simpler paper-based system. But whatever happens, a decision is needed urgently if it is to be ready next year.

“The key decision that needs to be made now is how you are settling the polling centre-based voter registration lists because it takes time,” Dahler Kardel said.

Technical issues are not the only problem, however. Suspicions left over from 2014 have fed accusations of bias, disputes in parliament and angry battles over the make-up and independence of the commissioners supervising the vote.

Bashir Ahmad Tayanj, a member of parliament close to General Rashid Dostum, the vice president currently in exile in Turkey after accusations of severe human rights abuses, said public trust had been undermined by political “interference”.

He said political movements critical of the government wanted a free and fair election but added: “We have our concerns and we are not sure the election will take place next year.”

Ghani’s spokesman, Shah Hussain Murtazawi, said election commissioners were independent and had been selected through a fair and transparent process. “There is no interference from the president or the government,” he said.

For its part, the IEC says it has faced intense pressure from political interests opposed to holding elections on time because they feared losing power.

“There are groups trying to blackmail us. There is huge propaganda on Facebook, in parliament,” Warymoch said.

He said much of the discussion over the biometric voter registration contract, for which only one company submitted a bid, was aimed at deliberately delaying the process.

“There are people looking to kill time,” he said.

Unless the issues are resolved, a repeat of the 2014 debacle would become a real possibility, dealing a severe blow to hopes of political stability, the Western official said.

Donald Trump mentioned Afghanistan just once in his speech to the United Nations Tuesday. His “new strategy for victory” there, he said, would help “crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.”

Trump outlined that new strategy on August 21, in an address that was a curious mixture of the vague and the specific. Speaking at Fort Myer, the U.S. president announced plans to deploy additional American troops, but did not give details about numbers, policy specifics or an exit strategy. He mentioned Pakistan 12 times – criticizing it for “housing the very terrorists that we are fighting” – but did not make a single mention of the two other countries ramping up resistance to the U.S. presence in the region: Russia and Iran.

That was a serious omission on Trump’s part. No U.S. plan for Afghanistan can accomplish even its most minimal objective of destroying militant groups like al Qaeda or the Taliban unless it factors in the mounting evidence that Tehran and Moscow are playing a more aggressive role in resisting the American presence in the region.

Sharif Yaftali, chief of general staff of the Afghan national army, told the BBC in an exclusive interview on September 6 that Kabul has evidence showing that Iran had provided the Taliban with weapons and equipment in western Afghanistan. While Yaftali acknowledged that Afghan security forces have not yet found any evidence of Russian support for the Taliban, others believe Tehran is consolidating its South Asian partnership with Russia by serving as a mediator between Moscow and Afghan insurgents.

“The regional politics have changed,” Mohammed Arif Shah Jehan, an Afghan senior intelligence official recently appointed the governor of Farah province adjacent to Iran told The New York Times in August. “The strongest Taliban here are Iranian Taliban.”

Iran also helps Russia provide various types of weaponry to the Taliban, Hayatullah Hayat, the provincial governor of Helmand province, told the Washington Post. The arms deliveries include rocket-propelled grenades, landmines, sniper rifles and 82mm mortar rounds.

In a similar vein, construction of the largely India-funded Chabahar port in Iran’s southeastern Sistan and Baluchistan province is arguably pursued with a view to the Afghan war and the strategic rivalries unfolding there. A counterweight to Pakistan’s Chinese-backed Gwadar port only 62 miles away, Chabahar will enhance Delhi's foothold in landlocked Afghanistan by offering it convenient access through the Gulf of Oman, thereby enabling India to bypass rival Pakistan. This can in turn boost Iran’s military mobility and political influence over events in the conflict-ridden nation.

Perhaps the most telling sign of Tehran-Taliban collaboration dates back to May 2016, when a U.S. drone targeted a lone vehicle on a desert route in the southwest Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killing the driver and his only passenger. The passenger’s passport listed his name as Wali Mohammad; U.S. and Afghan officials said he was really Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour.

Intriguingly, the mystery passenger was returning from Iran; the passport indicated that it was at least his second trip to the neighboring Islamic Republic that year.

The catalyst for Shiite Iran’s unlikely yet growing relationship with the Sunni Taliban has been the rise of the more militant, rabidly anti-Shiite Islamic State in parts of Afghanistan. For Iran, the Taliban is the lesser evil with the potential to serve as a local bulwark against the spread of the most aggressive anti-Iranian forces to its east.

Trump needs to recognize the profound regional shift in interests and alliances since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. Back in 2001, Tehran helped the U.S.-led coalition topple the Taliban, which it blamed for the killing of Iranian diplomats during the storming of Iran’s consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif three years earlier. The intelligence and military assistance offered by Iran and its Afghan allies in the Northern Alliance – a military front that also enjoyed the backing of Russia and India at the time – was indispensable to the U.S. mission.

Sixteen years on, Trump’s anti-Iran sentiments make a similar collaboration unlikely. However, Washington does have to recognize that it cannot ignore Iran’s national security concerns in its immediate neighborhood or Russia’s strategic interests in Central and South Asia. Trump doesn’t have to become Moscow or Tehran’s best friend, but he should be considering measures like offering to de-list Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism” and easing sanctions against Tehran and Moscow in return for their withdrawing support from anti-American forces in Afghanistan. Those measures aren’t going to end Afghanistan’s internal conflict, but they might de-escalate it enough for Trump to work on a new exit strategy for U.S. troops.",Commentary: The real deal Trump has to make on Afghanistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-behravesh-afghanistan-commentary/commentary-the-real-deal-trump-has-to-make-on-afghanistan-idUSKCN1BV28K

A statement by the bank confirmed the receipt of international transfers in U.S. dollars to two Sudanese banks, in what was the first signal of recovery for Sudan’s battered economy.

The decision to suspend sanctions and lift a trade embargo, unfreeze assets and remove financial restrictions came after a U.S. assessment that Sudan had made progress on counter terrorism cooperation and resolving its long internal conflicts such as in Darfur.

Khartoum is hopeful that the sanctions decision will help it regain access to global financial markets which could help draw in badly needed investment and raise prospects for a recovery.

The Sudanese economy has struggled more since the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of the country’s oil output, its main source of foreign currency and income for President Omar al-Bashir’s government.

Price rises have been compounded by the government’s decision late last year to cut fuel and electricity subsidies in a bid to tighten its finances.

Petrol prices rose by about 30 percent, leading to a jump in broader inflation to 35.13 percent in September from 34.61 in August, according to the state-run Central Statistics Office.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Software produced by Microsoft Corp has been acquired by state organizations and firms in Russia and Crimea despite sanctions barring U.S-based companies from doing business with them, official documents show.

The acquisitions, registered on the Russian state procurement database, show the limitations in the way foreign governments and firms enforce the U.S. sanctions, imposed on Russia over its annexation of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.

Some of the users gave Microsoft fictitious data about their identity, people involved in the transactions told Reuters, exploiting a gap in the U.S. company’s ability to keep its products out of their hands.

The products in each case were sold via third parties and Reuters has no evidence that Microsoft sold products directly to entities hit by the sanctions.

“Microsoft has a strong commitment to complying with legal requirements and we have been looking into this matter in recent weeks,” a Microsoft representative said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters.

“We have robust trade compliance processes around the world to help ensure that our partners comply with all conditions including immediate halting of suspected improper sales by partners, and strong measures to try to prevent banned customers from accessing and using our products and services.”

All state organizations and state firms are obliged to disclose purchases they make on the procurement database. People involved in five of the transactions confirmed to Reuters the software had been acquired.

The Reuters review of the database found state entities in Russia and Crimea that are subject to sanctions have acquired more than 5,000 Microsoft products worth about 60 million rubles ($1.03 million).

The sum is relatively small but such software is vital for many firms and organizations in Russia and Crimea to operate. The database also does not include private companies, so the scale of the problem could be much bigger.

Related Coverage Factbox: Entities subject to sanctions that bought Microsoft products

Among entities hit by sanctions that acquired Microsoft products was Almaz-Antey, manufacturer of the BUK surface-to-air missile. Dutch prosecutors say a BUK missile brought down a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet over east Ukraine in July 2014, though Russia denies its forces shot down the plane.

Other Microsoft buyers, the database shows, include Glavgosexpertiza, a state design agency involved in work on a new bridge from Russia to Crimea and the “Krym” health spa in Crimea owned by Russia’s defense ministry.

The arms manufacturer, Almaz-Antey, did not respond to a request for comment. The defense ministry’s health spa in Crimea declined to comment. Glavgosexpertiza said “the company operates within the Russian legal framework”.

COMPLIANCE CRACKDOWN

One set of U.S. sanctions prohibits the export by a U.S. entity of any goods, services or technology to Crimea.

Other sanctions bar U.S firms from carrying out transactions with companies or individuals on a list of “specially designated nationals” deemed by Washington to be linked to the Russian government and its activities in Ukraine.

Microsoft did not directly respond to detailed questions about specific users of its products and the compliance procedures it has in place.

The products acquired by organizations hit by sanctions include “Open License Program” services, where the user must provide Microsoft with the company’s full name and address.

Almaz-Antey, Glavgosexpertiza and the defense ministry spa acquired “Open License Program” products, the database showed.

After the sanctions were introduced, Microsoft took steps to prevent entities hit by sanctions acquiring its products, according to five sources involved in the software re-selling trade and a former Microsoft employee in Russia.

But people involved in transactions say ways can be found to circumvent obstacles.

The “Morye” shipyard, based in Crimea, bought 150 Windows Server, SQL Server and Office licenses in June 2016 from OOO Web-Potok, a firm registered in Moscow, the procurement database shows. All the products were “Open License Program” services.

The shipyard fell under the general prohibition on transactions by U.S. firms with entities in Crimea and is now on the “special designated nationals” list.

“If we bought directly from Microsoft, there would be sanctions,” a shipyard employee, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said by telephone. “But there were no problems with (buying third-party from) Russian firms.”

The shipyard declined to comment. Reuters called telephone numbers listed for the supplier, OOO Web-Potok, but the people who answered said they worked for a different company.

Another way to circumvent the restrictions on Crimea-based entities is for the user, when registering the product with Microsoft, not to provide a Crimean address, three people involved in the trade said.

They said addresses in Russia’s Krasnodar region, across the Kerch Strait from Crimea, were commonly used instead.

A supplier who worked with a company on the U.S. “specially designated nationals” list said a supplier and a client could circumvent restrictions by registering Microsoft products to a subsidiary or parent company of the end user.","Exclusive: Despite sanctions, Russian organizations acquire Microsoft software",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CG0NS-OCATC

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will pay up to C$750 million ($598 million) in compensation to thousands of aboriginals who were removed as children from their families decades ago, a top official said on Friday, promising to end “a terrible legacy.”

The move is the latest bid by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to repair ties with Canada’s often-marginalized indigenous population, which says it has been the victim of systemic racism for centuries.

In the so-called “Sixties Scoop,” welfare authorities took around 20,000 aboriginal children from their homes between the 1960s and 1980s and placed them in foster care or allowed them to be adopted by non-indigenous families.

The compensation package is designed to settle many of the lawsuits launched by survivors, who say the forced removal deprived them of their heritage and led to mental disorders, substance abuse and suicide.

“Language and culture, apology, healing -- these are essential elements to begin to right the wrong of this dark and painful chapter,” said Carolyn Bennett, the federal minister in charge of relations with the indigenous population.

Canada’s 1.4 million aboriginals, who make up about 4 percent of the population, experience higher levels of poverty and incarceration and have a lower life expectancy than other Canadians. They are often victims of violent crime and addiction.

Indigenous activists complain Trudeau has broken repeated promises to improve their lives since taking office in late 2015. He reshuffled his cabinet in August to put more emphasis on helping aboriginal people.

Bennett, at times fighting back tears, told a news conference she had heard “truly heartbreaking stories” about loss of identity and alienation.

Marcia Brown Martel, an aboriginal chief who led the campaign for compensation, lamented the “stealing of children” and noted some of those involved lived as far away as New Zealand.

“Think of it as a puzzle, a great big puzzle. Pieces, people are missing,” she told reporters.

Ottawa agreed the settlement after a Canadian court ruled earlier this year that the government breached its duty of care to the children.

Trudeau and other Canadian leaders have already apologized for the many abuses committed over a 150-year period when 150,000 aboriginal children were forcibly separated from their parents and sent to church-run residential schools.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union Youth Orchestra is moving to Italy from London, its home for more than 40 years, in an early example of the cultural fallout from Brexit.

The prestigious organization, which has worked with some of the world’s most famous conductors, relies on EU funding which would almost certainly no longer be available to UK-based organizations after Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019.

“The EUYO is a vital cultural and political resource for Europe and for the EU, and I am delighted that the orchestra’s long-term stability has now been effected,” said Vasily Petrenko, the orchestra’s chief conductor, in a statement.

The orchestra will move next year to new headquarters in Rome and in the northern Italian city of Ferrara, it said.

Its founding music director was the late Italian conductor Claudio Abbado and it was invited to move to Italy by Culture Minister Dario Franceschini.

Founded in London in 1976, it has been headquartered in the British capital ever since. Britain joined the precursor of what is now the EU in 1973.

The orchestra auditions every year for new members, who must be aged between 16 and 26 and come from an EU member country.

Its website says that British musicians are still eligible to apply this autumn to join the orchestra in 2018, when Britain will still be a member.

“The arrangement for future years will depend on the details of the agreement negotiated between the EU and the UK,” it says.

Britain’s decision in a June 2016 referendum to leave the bloc was a severe blow to many in the arts world, where cross-border collaboration and the ability to tour freely around Europe are valued particularly highly.",Brexit drives EU youth orchestra from London to Italy,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-orchestra/brexit-drives-eu-youth-orchestra-from-london-to-italy-idUKKBN1CG1MS

O voto foi proferido durante julgamento pelo plenário do Supremo de uma ação movida por três partidos políticos, que terá repercussão direta no caso do senador Aécio Neves (PSDB-MG), afastado do Senado há duas semanas pela Primeira Turma do STF.

Em seu voto, o relator da ação votou no sentido de que a ação dos partidos PP, PSC e Solidariedade em busca de considerar ilegal a adoção de medidas cautelares exclusivamente pelo Judiciário é totalmente improcedente.

Fachin afirmou que é “evidentemente inaplicável” que a adoção de medidas cautelares seja submetida ao crivo da Câmara dos Deputados ou do Senado. “Entendo que é evidentemente inaplicável para medidas cautelares penais”, disse o relator da ação.

Para o ministro do Supremo, há uma “marcante e significativa diferença” entre a possibilidade de que os parlamentares sustem uma decisão do Supremo, nos casos da prisão em flagrante por crime inafiançável ou em situações de perda de mandato, de uma eventual adoção de medida cautelar determinada pela Corte.

Os partidos autores da ação pretendem que decisões do STF com aplicação de medidas cautelares contra parlamentares sejam enviadas para a Câmara ou Senado a fim de que os parlamentares decidam em até 24 horas sobre a sua aplicação, conforme previsto expressamente na Constituição para o caso de prisão em flagrante de parlamentar por crime inafiançável.

Fachin observou que não se pode ter uma “interpretação extensiva” nos casos de imposição de medidas cautelares porque não há previsão na Constituição. O relator argumentou ainda que isso não significa qualquer tipo de fragilização das prerrogativas do mandato de um parlamentar.

No voto, o ministro do STF também destacou que uma eventual submissão de decisões em medidas cautelares determinadas pelo Poder Judiciário significaria uma ampliação da imunidade do parlamentar sem respaldo legal. “É uma ofensa ao postulado republicano e uma ofensa à Constituição”, avaliou.

Logo após o voto de Fachin, a presidente do Supremo, Cármen Lúcia, decidiu suspender o julgamento para ser retomado no início da tarde a partir do voto dos demais ministros da Corte.

A expectativa é que a maioria do STF concorde com a adoção de medidas cautelares, desde que a Câmara ou o Senado avalize a decisão posteriormente. Seria uma solução intermediária entre a proibição total de o Judiciário afastar parlamentares ou a permissão para esse Poder tomar esse tipo de decisão mesmo sem o aval do Legislativo.

Após a posição da Primeira Turma de afastar Aécio, o Senado ensaiou entrar em confronto com o Supremo ao votar, em plenário, um requerimento para reverter a medida. Mas os presidente da Casa, Eunício Oliveira (PMDB-CE), e do STF, Cármen Lúcia, entraram em campo na busca de uma solução para o impasse.",Fachin vota a favor de STF decretar medidas cautelares contra parlamentares sem aval do Congresso,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1CG1ZA-OBRTP

SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military flew two strategic bombers over the Korean peninsula in a show of force late on Tuesday, as President Donald Trump met top defense officials to discuss how to respond to any threat from North Korea.

Tensions have soared between the United States and North Korea following a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test in recent weeks as it fast advances toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

The two U.S. Air Force B-1B bombers were joined by two F-15K fighters from the South Korean military after leaving their base in Guam, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement on Wednesday.

After entering South Korean airspace, the two bombers carried out air-to-ground missile drills in waters off the east coast of South Korea, then flew over the South to waters between it and China to repeat the drill, the release said.

The U.S. military said in a separate statement it conducted drills with Japanese fighters after the exercise with South Korea, making it the first time U.S. bombers have conducted training with fighters from both Japan and South Korea at night.

The U.S. bombers had taken off from the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. In August, Pyongyang threatened to fire intermediate-range missiles toward the vicinity of Guam, a U.S. Pacific territory that is frequently subjected to sabre-rattling from the North.

GUARD RAISED

South Korean and U.S. government officials have been raising their guard against more North Korean provocations with the approach of the 72nd anniversary of the founding of North Korea’s ruling party, which fell on Tuesday.

Trump hosted a discussion on Tuesday on options to respond to any North Korean aggression or, if necessary, to prevent Pyongyang from threatening the United States and its allies with nuclear weapons, the White House said in a statement.

U.S. and South Korean wartime operational plans, including a plan to wipe out the North Korean leadership, were stolen by North Korean hackers last year, a South Korean ruling party lawmaker said on Wednesday.

Some 235 gigabytes of military documents were taken from South Korea’s Defense Integrated Data Center in September last year, Democratic Party representative Rhee Cheol-hee said in radio appearances on Wednesday, citing information from unidentified South Korean defense officials.

In May, an investigative team inside the defense ministry announced the hack had been carried out by North Korea, but did not disclose what kind of information had been taken.

SHIPS BANNED

The United Nations Security Council, which has imposed a series of ever tighter sanctions on North Korea, has banned four ships from ports globally for carrying coal from North Korea, including one vessel that also had ammunition.

The vessels are the first to be designated under stepped-up sanctions imposed on North Korea by the 15-member council in August and September over two long-range ballistic missile launches and Pyongyang’s sixth and largest nuclear test.

China, North Korea’s main ally and trading partner, has consistently argued sanctions alone will not work, urging Washington and Pyongyang to lower their rhetoric and return to the negotiating table.

China’s influential Global Times tabloid expressed alarm at how far the rhetoric on both sides had gone and how it had increased the risk of a “fatal misjudgment”.

“The international community won’t accept North Korea as a nuclear power. North Korea needs time and proof to believe that abandoning its nuclear program will contribute to its own political and economic advantage. This positive process is worth a try,” the paper said in an editorial late on Tuesday.

The proposed voting system is backed by three of the country’s four largest parties, with the center-left government looking to rush it onto the statute books ahead of elections, which are due by May 2018.

Unlike the current rules, the new system would allow the formation of multi-party coalitions before the ballot, a factor likely to hurt 5-Star, which refuses to join alliances.

“They want to take away our right to choose,” said Nicola Zuppa, 45, who said he had paid 175 euros ($200) to travel from Padua in northern Italy to take part in the protest, which drew up to 2,000 people in the heart of Rome.

Five-Star supporters distributed leaflets declaring a “full democratic emergency” on commuter trains early on Wednesday to try to muster a large crowd ahead of two confidence votes on Wednesday, both of which the government is expected to win.

A third such motion is set for Thursday, as the ruling coalition looks to truncate discussion on the bill and sidestep dozens of planned secret votes on various amendments.

Five-Star said it would not participate in the first confidence vote in a sign of protest, virtually guaranteeing that the motion will pass.

“If you allow the electoral rules to be changed again so that the scum of the country rises to the top yet again, it will be your children who pay the price,” 5-Star’s founder Beppe Grillo wrote on his blog on Wednesday.

Small left-wing parties that oppose the law will stage a protest in front of the ancient Roman Pantheon temple in the afternoon.

Pier Luigi Bersani, a former leader of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) and now a member of the small leftist MDP party, said the decision to use confidence votes to try to force through the electoral law “opens up a huge question of democracy”.

If a government loses a confidence vote, it must resign.

A final secret vote on the bill, in which lawmakers could break with the party line, is scheduled before the end of the week. If it passes, the law moves to the upper house Senate.

Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s PD drafted the new rules, which are supported by right-wing parliamentary rivals Forza Italia (Go Italy!) and the Northern League. Five other small parties are also backing the proposed law.

“This electoral law is supported by eight different parties, and it’s a very delicate equilibrium,” said Ettore Rosato, the PD group leader who presented the bill (dubbed the Rosatellum after him).

Five-Star estimates that the new rules could cost it up to 50 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and potentially scupper its chances of being the largest group in parliament after the vote.

President Sergio Mattarella is expected to give the formation that gets the most seats in parliament the first crack at forming a government.

The ruling Democratic Party denies the new rules are designed to penalize 5-Star.

“No one is preventing (5-Star) from making alliances if they want to,” Rosato told reporters. “If they don’t want to do them, they can continue to be an isolated party.”",Italy's 5-Star protests as parliament votes on electoral law,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-italy-politics-vote/italys-5-star-protests-as-parliament-votes-on-electoral-law-idUKKBN1CG1NL?il=0

Trump has squared off against the NFL before, having owned a team in the upstart United States Football League in the 1980s.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - NFL team owners will consider requiring football players to stand for the U.S. national anthem after President Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested using tax laws to penalize the league for players who kneel in protest of racial injustice.

Trump, a Republican, escalated his feud with the National Football League in a Twitter post asking if the league should get tax breaks while some athletes kneel in protest when the “Star-Spangled Banner” is played at the start of each game.

“Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!” Trump wrote on Twitter.

The world’s top-grossing sports league gave up its tax-free status two years ago. Its owners are preparing to address the anthem issue at their fall meeting in New York Oct. 17-18, NFL chief spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday.

“Everyone at this point is frustrated by the situation,” Lockhart said. “The commissioner and the owners do want the players to stand. We think it is an important part of the game.”

The protests, in a league where African-Americans make up the majority of players, have continued through the season, with some players taking a knee when the anthem is played and others standing arm-in-arm in solidarity.

Current policy calls for players to stand for the anthem and face the flag, but no player has been disciplined for a protest, Lockhart said.

“We need to move past this controversy, and we want to do that together with our players,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell wrote in a memo to team owners.

The White House supported the idea of asking players to stand, said spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.

“We are glad to see the NFL taking positive steps in that direction,” she said at a news briefing.

Asked to explain Trump’s comment on the NFL and taxes, Sanders said, “The federal tax law doesn’t apply here, but certainly we know that they receive tax subsidies on a variety of different levels.”

The NFL Players Association, when asked for a reaction to possible changes to anthem rules, said in an email “we do not have a response at this time.”

Trump last month called on NFL team owners to fire players who kneel during the anthem to protest police violence against black Americans.

Critics contend Trump is fanning the controversy to distract from issues including devastation in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, tensions with North Korea and difficulties in pushing healthcare and tax overhauls through the U.S. Congress.

Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, speaking on KRLD-FM in Dallas on Tuesday, reiterated his stance that if any of his players chose to demonstrate during the anthem, they would not play.

“If you do not honor and stand for the flag in the way that a lot of our fans feel that you should ... if that’s not the case, then you won’t play,” said Jones.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The global economic recovery has strengthened financial stability but easy monetary and financial conditions against a backdrop of sluggish inflation is elevating medium-term risks, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday.

The IMF, whose autumn meetings with the World Bank get under way in Washington later this week, also noted risks are rotating from banks, which have fortified their balance sheets, to financial markets as credit spreads compress, volatility declines and asset prices rise.

“While increased risk appetite and search for yield are a welcome and intended consequence of unconventional monetary policy measures...there are risks if these trends extend too far,” the IMF said in its biannual global financial stability update.

A prolonged search for yield has raised the sensitivity of the financial system to market and liquidity risks, the Fund said, keeping those risks elevated.

The IMF urged national regulators to consider carefully any proposals that would substantially ease capital, liquidity or prudential standards in “light of their potential to damage the agenda of global regulatory harmonization.”

The improvement in near-term financial stability has been underpinned by a broad-based global economic upswing.

On Tuesday, the IMF upgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2017 by 0.1 percentage point to 3.6 percent, and to 3.7 percent for 2018, from its April and July outlook, driven by a pickup in trade, investment, and consumer confidence.

But global central banks have found themselves at different stages in removing monetary policy accommodation, which has been complicated by overall sluggish inflation.

The U.S. Federal Reserve has picked up the pace of interest rate rises since it began a tightening cycle in late 2015, but the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have yet to move away from negative rates and bond buying.

“Too quick an adjustment in monetary policies could cause unwanted turbulence in financial markets and set back progress toward inflation targets,” the IMF said in its report, while keeping rates low for too long may cause a harmful buildup in market and credit risks.

Elsewhere, the Fund warned that leverage in the non-financial sector was now higher than before the financial crisis across the so-called G20 advanced economies as a whole.

Such leverage made households and companies more vulnerable to changes in interest rates and weaker economic activity.

“The key challenge confronting policymakers is to ensure that the buildup of financial vulnerabilities is contained while monetary policy remains supportive of the global recovery,” the IMF warned. “Otherwise, rising debt loads and overstretched asset valuations could undermine market confidence in the future, with repercussions that could put global growth at risk.”","Global financial stability has improved, but risks ahead: IMF",https://www.reuters.com/article/imf-g20-stability/global-financial-stability-has-improved-but-risks-ahead-imf-idINKBN1CG1IG

But it was not clear if Afghan Taliban representatives would join the talks. Taliban sources said they had not yet received an invitation and plan to skip Monday’s discussions in Muscat, casting doubt on efforts to revive long-stalled negotiations.

The four-nation Quadrilateral Coordination Group (QGC), comprising Afghanistan, China, Pakistan and the United States, has been trying to ease the path to direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban, with little success.

The Taliban, ousted in a U.S.-led military intervention in 2001, has been gaining territory in recent years through a violent insurgency to try to topple Afghanistan’s Western-backed government and re-establish a fundamentalist Islamic regime.

Amin Waqad, a close aide to Agfhan President Ashraf Ghani and a senior member of the High Peace Council (HPC), said, “HPC and government representatives will participate, and it is an important one because the Taliban representatives will be there. We will go with a clear plan.”

A senior Pakistani foreign ministry official confirmed the talks would take place on Oct 16. Last week, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif told Voice of America the “quadrilateral arrangement will again be in operation” in Muscat in October.

The U.S. embassy in Islamabad did not comment for the report.

Talks and efforts to kick start negotiations have failed following the 2015 announcement of the death of the Taliban’s founder and long-time leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, in 2013.

The animals are fitted with infrared bio-sensors which monitor their heartbeat and movement. Data is analyzed by a computer, and any changes in the animals’ body or behavior flags a change in the purity levels of the water in its tank.

“When three or more crayfish are moving or change their pulse activity, we know that the water parameters have changed. We can react quickly because we have the result within three minutes,” head brewer Michal Voldrich told Reuters.

“We are using crayfish like a living chemical laboratory – like a bio indicator and bio sensor together,” said Pavel Kozak, Director of the university’s Research Institute of Fish Culture and Hydrobiology.

Researchers aim to upgrade the technology used in the scheme, and plan to use special cameras to monitor the animals’ hearts.

Carne Ross, que como fundador de la consultora diplomática Independent Diplomat ha trabajado con Kosovo, Sudán del Sur, Sáhara Occidental y Cataluña en sus respectivos movimientos soberanistas, dijo que no habría una solución a la crisis sin un plebiscito legal acordado por Madrid.

Para llegar a ese punto sería necesaria la presión de los socios de España en la Unión Europea, dijo Ross a Reuters en una entrevista telefónica.

“Una declaración de independencia total habría sido muy problemática y llevado a una clara confrontación con Madrid, y (el presidente catalán Carles Puigdemont) estuvo bajo una enorme presión para no declarar la independencia, incluso supongo de los países de los que Cataluña buscaría reconocimiento”, dijo Ross.

“Al final, para ser independiente tienes que ser reconocido como tal”.

“Creo que probablemente lograrían reconocimiento internacional sólo si hay un referéndum legal aceptado por Madrid”.

Puigdemont anunció el martes que asumía el mandato para declarar la independencia, pero segundos después pidió una suspensión de la declaración para intentar abrir un cauce de negociación y “desescalar” las tensiones con Madrid. [nL8N1ML690]

El miércoles, el presidente español Mariano Rajoy pidió al líder catalán que explicase si se ha declarado o no una independencia unilateral que llevaría a la aplicación en cuestión de “días” de medidas de intervención extraordinarias contempladas en el artículo 155 de la Constitución y que, en última instancia, podrían propiciar elecciones anticipadas en Cataluña. [nL8N1MM2Q1]

GASOLINA AL FUEGO

El referéndum de Cataluña el 1 de octubre fue suspendido por el Tribunal Constitucional español y la participación fue de sólo el 43 por ciento del electorado catalán porque muchos contrarios a la independencia se quedaron en sus casas. Cientos de personas resultaron heridas según el Gobierno catalán en las intervenciones de la policía para cerrar centros de votación.

Ross dijo que muchos catalanes se habían “radicalizado” por la resistencia y las cargas policiales de Madrid. “Eso es echar gasolina al fuego”, dijo.

“En mi opinión, una legítima independencia sólo puede declararse legítimamente cuando tiene una clara mayoría de la población. No creo que sea correcto declarar la independencia cuando no se cuenta con esa mayoría clara. Y tal y como están las cosas, Cataluña no tiene esa mayoría clara”.

Ross dirigió la sección de Oriente Próximo de la misión británica en las Naciones Unidas, pero dejó el funcionariado en 2004 por la invasión de Irak. Su trabajo con Independent Diplomat ha sido objeto del documental Accidental Anarchist (Anarquista accidental) emitido por la BBC el pasado julio.

Ross, que asesoró al gobierno catalán entre julio de 2013 y septiembre de 2015 y es un defensor comprometido de la autodeterminación, dijo que no era realista esperar que una solución con intermediarios resultase en una mayor autonomía para Cataluña.

El experto citó los ejemplos de Montenegro y Escocia, cuyos referendos se celebraron en base a condiciones negociadas en 2006 y 2014, respectivamente. Montenegro votó por poco abandonar el estado que formaba con Serbia, mientras una mayoría de escoceses optaron por quedarse dentro de Reino Unido.

“Creo que la comunidad internacional debería pedir que Madrid haga lo que Reino Unido hizo con Escocia, que es permitir que un referéndum legal resuelva esto de una vez por todas”.

El presidente francés Emmanuel Macron rechazó una petición de Puigdemont para que la UE hiciera de mediador, aunque Ross dijo que el bloque de países debe indicar claramente a Madrid “que necesita encontrar una solución más consensuada”.

To put major emphasis on labor reforms may, in any case, not be the main point.
If France’s CGT and the left/far-right cannot mobilize enough opposition, the labor reforms will be implemented, and they could be part of a general renaissance of the French economy.","Protestors against President Emmanuel Macron’s proposed liberalization of French labor laws were on the streets of the country’s cities on Tuesday. The marchers, chanting slogans and brandishing placards, halted traffic as they moved slowly through the streets. A fringe of anarchists broke windows; police responded by firing tear gas. But this was no rerun of the mass marches of past years, let alone the semi-revolutionary eruptions of 1968.

France’s second-largest union, the Conféderation Générale du Travail (CGT) was the only one of the three main workers’ organizations that took part. Another protest, this one organized by the far-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party is scheduled for Sept. 23. This week’s marching columns numbered, nationwide, in the few hundred thousand rather than the many millions hoped for – the police claimed 223,000, the organizers 400,000. There was little effect on production, services or transport.

It was neither victory nor defeat for either side. Instead, Macron’s changes to the vast labor code – hiring and firing will be easier, some workplace issues will be negotiated at company level – hang in the balance. The CGT, the left and the far-right National Front all oppose them, but Macron and his government have a solid, if inexperienced, majority in the Assembly.

More than his predecessors who tried and failed to liberalize France’s labor market – the center-right Nicolas Sarkozy and the center-left Francois Hollande – Macron has pinned the credibility of his presidency on systemic, cultural change, a deliberate jolting of French society and economy out of the rut into which he believes it has fallen. He is contemptuous of both former presidents (he knew Hollande well, having been both his advisor and Finance Minister), believing them to have given up too soon and too easily. When Macron spoke, as he did earlier this month, of “slackers,” he said when challenged that he meant those who retreated from the necessary surgery on France’s body politic The marchers, however, seized on the word and put it on their placards: “Macron, the slackers will kick you out,” read one.

The slackers have a point. Indeed, they have several. Labor productivity in France is relatively good, only a little behind that of the United States and the highest of Europe’s major economies. When French workers work, they work well.

Though both Macron’s labor and economic reforms have won support from the center-right and from many economists, France remains doubtful, even hostile. Perhaps the best-known Frenchman in political and intellectual circles before Macron was the economist Thomas Piketty, whose “Capital in the 21st Century” (2013) is a best seller and who has excoriated his country both for its steeply rising inequality and its hypocrisy in pretending it is egalitarian. Hypocritical it may be, but it clings to the myth, and perfectly bourgeois Frenchmen and -women may recoil from an obvious widening of the income and wealth gaps.

To put major emphasis on labor reforms may, in any case, not be the main point. Germany liberalized its labor market through the so-called Hartz reforms between 2003 and 2005, but unlike France the German unions were relatively moderate, wage bargaining was already localized and investment was rising. In addition, the costs of German unification had already been paid.

If France’s CGT and the left/far-right cannot mobilize enough opposition, the labor reforms will be implemented, and they could be part of a general renaissance of the French economy. That is also dependent on other ifs – if the present improvement in the European Union economy continues (the European Commission, while underscoring that all members are growing, warns of “higher-than-usual uncertainty) and if investment increases, then France could become more like Germany. The German (and EU) leader Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to see that, and Macron wishes to show her he can deliver.

Yet delivery of this kind of economy now comes with an apparently unavoidable cost. Faster growth and even a fall in unemployment produces an ever-larger underclass, composed both of those with few qualifications and the still-increasing numbers of immigrants, often from poor countries. Macron’s opponents like to quote the Cambridge University economist Christopher Bickerton, who argued in a New York Times column that “not since the economic boom of the 1950s and ’60s has capitalism in Europe been dynamic enough to combine high levels of employment with long-term material gains for the masses.” It will not do so, he believes, under Macron.

The deeper movement, about which Macron can do little, is that the greater integration into the global economy that he champions produces huge gains for the top one percent, more modest rises for the well educated and skilled, but a much larger tail of the precarious, insecure and low paid. The leftist German think tank, the Rosa Luxemburg Institute, called this trend “the end of social capitalism.” A sign of this is the general decline of social democratic parties such as the once-mighty German Social Democrats and the shrunken French Socialists. Only in the UK has the main left party, Labour, made substantial political gains with a far-left leadership.

Social democracy depended on, and greatly furthered, “social capitalism.” It did so in France, under socialist governments, did so again in Germany and still does, though with difficulty, in the Scandinavian states. Organized labor had a place, even an honored and at times powerful one. Now, its gains are a hindrance, its ideology no longer attractive. The leaders of the further left – such as Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn in the UK and Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of France Insoumise in France - gain by being fundamentalists, opposed to capitalism itself, social or not.

In moving France towards the globalist model, Macron echoes the claim made nearly four decades ago by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, that there is no alternative. In this, he may be more right than she: there is presently no popular base, no public assent, no powerful parties able to show that cooperation with capitalism is best for the workers. And that, sooner or later, will be a large problem – for leftists, or course, for the state which must provide some support for the poor and ultimately, for the capitalist system itself.",Commentary: Labor reform in France’s Macron economy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-macron-commentary/commentary-labor-reform-in-frances-macron-economy-idUSKCN1BQ2DJ

It now looks to have lost two of them, and joins a small club of activist hedge funds that have experienced such defeat.","(Reuters) - Nelson Peltz put his activist hedge fund credentials on the line to win a board seat at Procter & Gamble Co, only to be narrowly defeated, according to a preliminary shareholder vote count. Yet he stands to lose more face than he does money.

Peltz, CEO of Trian Fund Management, was also rebuffed in a battle for board seats, or proxy contest, at DuPont two years ago. But he went on to attract more money from investors and have a key ally installed as the chemical maker’s new chief executive.

Trian said on Tuesday that the shareholder vote at P&G, the biggest company to ever face a proxy contest, was too close to call, and that it would wait for the result to be certified by an independent inspector. P&G says Peltz has lost.

But if Peltz’s defeat is confirmed, there is little evidence it would cost him with his investors, industry analysts and academics said.

“Overall, Nelson Peltz has a good record and he does work hard to improve companies,” said University of Michigan professor Erik Gordon. “He will have no trouble finding companies where improvements need to be made and where he’ll be let in the door.”

Trian’s assets under management are at an all-time high of $14 billion, the result of long-standing confidence by pension funds and endowments in Trian’s 12-year investment history. There was no sign on Tuesday of significant redemptions by Trian investors.

Indeed, Trian got a boost this week from another big U.S. conglomerate, when General Electric Co offered a board seat to Trian chief investment officer Ed Garden, without any proxy contest.

To be sure, Trian was eager for a win at P&G. Trian’s 2.1 percent return through the end of September trails the average activist hedge fund’s 4.8 percent gain this year. And it lags last year’s 11 percent return.

Trian prefers to work behind the scenes and has only waged three proxy contests since its founding in 2005. It now looks to have lost two of them, and joins a small club of activist hedge funds that have experienced such defeat. They include Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, Barry Rosenstein’s Jana Partners and Jeff Smith’s Starboard Value.

In the investment community, 75-year old Peltz, who speaks in calm tones and steers clear of the name-calling often heard in other contests, was thought to be the only activist who could take on P&G and its entrenched management.

However, the 180-year-old company, which makes Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste and Gillette razors, always presented a challenging target for Peltz because an unusually high 40 percent of P&G’s stock is held by individual investors. They include P&G employees and retirees, who are traditionally loyal to the company’s management.

“Even if they win, which I‘m not sure they did, think of what a pyrrhic victory it is,” Peltz told CNBC on Tuesday. “I mean everybody but the current employees voted for us up and down the line.”

P&G cannot afford to ignore Peltz even if victory has eluded him on this vote, said Charles Elson, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware.

“In many ways, this could echo what happened at DuPont, where within the year, the CEO was out and the things Trian called for were happening,” he said.

On Tuesday P&G’s share price fell, closing down 0.5 percent, as investors worried whether the company would let up on its promises to pursue operational reforms.

P&G has said that management is already working on several operational changes, and that Peltz does not have the relevant experience to be helpful in the process.

Investor pressure could still deliver change, industry insiders said.

“Winning the ‘war’ will be measured in the share price creation over time,” said Bruce Goldfarb, founder of Okapi Partners, which advises on proxy contests.",Peltz's Procter & Gamble defeat could be more humbling than harmful,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-procter-gamble-trian-peltz/peltzs-procter-gamble-defeat-could-be-more-humbling-than-harmful-idUSKBN1CF37M?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Talks on a transition period have not even begun.
If progress does not pick up, Hammond said, a transition agreement will rapidly diminish in value.

Business leaders have repeatedly called for clarity on the trading conditions they will face during the transition period and beyond.","LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Wednesday the value of a transitional Brexit deal would decline rapidly if talks to agree it drag into next year, but said it was too soon to spend money on contingency plans.

Negotiations on the terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union have made slow progress before a March 2019 deadline. Talks on a transition period have not even begun.

And while Hammond thinks it’s too early to begin enacting contingency plans for a failure to reach an agreement, EU diplomats and officials are putting renewed focus on preparing for a legal limbo after March 2019.

Their efforts have intensified as Brexit negotiations stall on issues like the bill Britain must pay to leave and the future of Northern Ireland’s land border with the EU. If progress does not pick up, Hammond said, a transition agreement will rapidly diminish in value.

“It is self-evident to me ... that a transitional arrangement is a wasting asset. It has a value today. It will still have a very high value at Christmas, early in the new year,” Hammond said.

“But as we move through 2018 its value to everybody will diminish significantly. And I think our European partners need to think very carefully about the need for speed in order to protect the potential value to all of us of having an interim period.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May has set out plans to seek a transition period after March 2019 with a set time limit. During that period, Britain wants to operate under the same rules as it currently does to provide certainty for businesses while allowing new arrangements to be put in place.

Business leaders have repeatedly called for clarity on the trading conditions they will face during the transition period and beyond. Some - including banks in London’s financial sector - are making arrangements to move overseas to ensure continued access to the EU market.

Hammond said lack of direction to talks was hurting business investment and consumer confidence, and one of his top advisors said international banks would make decisions to move in the first three months of 2018.

Britain had hoped EU leaders would agree to start talking about the future at a summit next week. But European Council President Donald Tusk poured cold water on that idea on Tuesday, saying he hoped it could happen in December.

Hammond called on the EU to change their approach, warning of the possibility of a bad-tempered breakdown in talks which would see EU countries acting against their own interest.

“We have made the running in this and we really need our European Union partners to engage ... We are not asking them to sign up. We are not asking them to write blank cheques. We are simply asking them to start talking to us,” he said.

NO DEAL

The limited progress in Brussels has drawn calls from some British lawmakers to walk away from the talks and start preparing for a clean break with the bloc.

Hammond is considered one of the most pro-EU members of Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet, and pro-Brexit lawmakers and campaigners have accused him of trying to water down or even halt Britain’s exit.

He said the government was planning for all possibilities, including Britain’s leaving with no agreement on the terms of its departure or how the two would build a new relationship. He said 250 million pounds was being spent on planning for all scenarios.

But he rejected the idea that Britain should begin putting “no deal” contingency arrangements in place, including a suggestion from a member of his own party that the government should start spending money to beef up border and customs capabilities.

“Some are urging me to spend money simply to send a message to the EU that we mean business. I think the EU knows that we mean business,” Hammond said. “I don’t believe we should be in the business of making potentially nugatory expenditure until the very last moment when we need to do so.”

However, he warned that he would have to start spending in 2018 if there was no clear prospect of a transitional deal.

“There will be some areas where we need to start spending money in the new year if we can’t tell ourselves that we are moving steadily and pretty assuredly towards a transition agreement,” he said.","Speed up Brexit transition talks or deal will be worthless, says UK's Hammond",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-hammond-spending/uk-preparing-for-no-deal-but-no-spend-on-contingency-arrangements-yet-hammond-idUKKBN1CG10K

As Reuters recently reported, the White House is preparing to shift oversight of the sale of American-manufactured small arms from the diligent State Department review process to the business-friendly Commerce Department. By loosening the inter-agency guidelines in an attempt to boost America’s share in the global marketplace, the Trump administration runs the risk of fueling the civil wars currently bringing misery to millions worldwide.

The aim of this policy is to enable U.S. weapons manufactures to sell their products overseas quickly by trimming the bureaucratic red tape now governing the export of non-military grade weapons and ammunition. According to the Reuters report, the new plan would mean that commercial gun exports would no longer be given the same scrutiny as missile and fighter jet sales, which often require congressional approval. The shift would also move weapons like assault rifles and handguns from the State Department’s tightly-restricted Munitions list to the Commerce Control Lists, which allows for more streamlined licensing for international sales. While the administration has explained these new procedures as a logical extension of a U.S. president who is solidly pro-business, the transfer of authority from Foggy Bottom will have unintended and damaging foreign policy repercussions.

In contrast to the significant decline in major conventional conflicts over the last 50 years, unconventional conflicts within a sovereign state’s territory, such as the current war in Syria, have become the new normal. Small weapons like AK-47’s assault rifles, Kalashnikovs, sniper rifles, and low-grade explosives are used in most of these confrontations. Indeed, the ease with which a combatant with little military training can use semi-automatic weapons on the battlefield is part of the weapons’ appeal.

Light arms have many advantages for guerilla armies: an AK-47 is a lot cheaper than a tank, a missile defense system, or a fighter aircraft and it can be smuggled across porous borders. As Senators Ben Cardin, Patrick Leahy, and Dianne Feinstein wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in opposing the new rules, the civil wars and rebellions currently taking place are being fueled by the illegal sales of what many Americans would categorize as sports rifles or hunting equipment.

Relaxing the rules on small arms exports is counterproductive to the U.S. objective of de-escalating these conflicts. The new administration policy has the potential to squander the inclusive diplomatic processes Washington has encouraged in order to promote peaceful approaches to conflict resolution in states as varied as South Sudan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Multiple agencies and departments within the U.S. government would in effect be working against one another, with the State Department hoping to end the very hostilities that are sustained by American-manufactured weapons.

Washington would not be deliberately arming combatants in a civil war, but the handguns and assault rifles American firearms manufacturers sell on the open market could find their way to a conflict zone through smuggling and diversion. In one highly-publicized case last year, corrupt Jordanian intelligence officers sold a cache of rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles that were destined for the moderate Syrian opposition to arms merchants on the underground market. The FBI later determined that one of those weapons was likely to have been responsible for the shooting deaths of two American contractors in Jordan that same year.

The civil war in Libya illustrates the insecurity that can result when governments send weapons into a conflict zone without crafting the necessary oversight and security measures that help prevent them from being sold off elsewhere. During the 2011 armed rebellion against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Washington's Arab partners – with the secret blessing of the Obama administration – delivered military assistance to the rebels trying to oust the regime. While the military aid helped to drive Gaddafi from power after eight months of combat, that same equipment eventually helped fuel the civil war still ravaging Libya. Libyan militias previously concerned with overthrowing Qaddafi began stockpiling arms to increase their political leverage for later internal battles. The availability of weapons in Libya remains so overwhelming that U.N. experts have categorized the North African country as a regional weapons bazaar. Weapons that were sent into the country to aid the Libyan rebellion have been diverted to other regional conflicts, either through arms smuggling across lightly defended borders or through illicit arms deals. African officials claim that some of these arms likely assisted the jihadist Boko Haram group to recover after serious territorial losses against the Nigerian army.

According to the Small Arms Survey, the United States is already the world’s top exporter of small arms, having reached a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. While this figure is small compared to the far larger conventional weapons contracts U.S. defense manufacturers sign every year, the possibility that even a fraction of these commercial weapons could leak into a conflict zone would have a deeply negative impact.

The question is whether the monetary benefits that are likely to result from the administration’s new rules are enough to compensate for the instability and violence that are likely to increase with more small arms available for sale around the world. The ease with which U.S. arms companies will now be able to export their products may be terrific from a business perspective. But from the standpoint of international peace and security, this policy is a dangerous gamble for the White House to take.

REUTERS/Sergio Perez - RC1C10FDFB20

Madrid/Barcelona (Reuters) - Im Katalonien-Konflikt hat die spanische Regierung konkrete Schritte zur Entmachtung der Regionalregierung in Barcelona eingeleitet.

“Das Kabinett ist diesen Morgen übereingekommen, förmlich die Regierung um Aufklärung zu bitten, ob sie die Erklärung der Unabhängigkeit Kataloniens bestätigt”, erklärte Ministerpräsident Mariano Rajoy in Madrid. Damit bereitete der Regierungschef eine mögliche Absetzung der separatistischen Regionalregierung in Barcelona nach Verfassungsartikel 155 vor, auf den er ausdrücklich verwies. Bereits zuvor erklärten allerdings die Separatisten, auch wenn Rajoy den Artikel 155 aktiviere, würden sie sich davon nicht von ihren Plänen für eine Loslösung von Spanien abbringen lassen.

Rajoy warf dem katalanischen Regierungschef Carles Puigdemont vor, eine gefährliche Verwirrung ausgelöst zu haben, indem er zwar einseitig die katalanische Unabhängigkeit erklärt, deren Umsetzung aber gleichzeitig ausgesetzt habe. Am Dienstag unterzeichneten Puigdemont und andere katalanische Politiker die Unabhängigkeitserklärung, in der die internationale Gemeinschaft dazu aufgerufen wird, Katalonien als souveräne Republik anzuerkennen. Gleichzeitig betonte er, dass diese Erklärung zunächst keine formellen Auswirkungen haben werde. [nL8N1ML6BV] Puigdemont beruft sich auf den Ausgang des Referendums vom 1. Oktober, das das spanische Verfassungsgericht für illegal erklärt hat. Etwa 90 Prozent hatten für die Unabhängigkeit gestimmt. Allerdings lag die Wahlbeteiligung nur bei 43 Prozent.

SOZIALISTEN STÜTZEN VON RAJOYS KURS

In Madrid betonte Rajoy, nötig sei nun Klarheit darüber, was Puigdemont wirklich wolle. Auch der Chef der größten Oppositionspartei im Madrider Parlament, Sozialistenführer Pedro Sanchez, forderte, der Katalane müsse “schwarz auf weiß” erklären, ob er die Unabhängigkeit ausgerufen habe.

Rajoy sagte, Klarheit über die in Barcelona am Dienstag getroffenen Beschlüsse sei auch für die Rechtssicherheit bei möglichen Maßnahmen von großer Tragweite von Bedeutung. Dieser Verweis gilt als Fingerzeig auf den Verfassungsartikel 155, denn demnach muss zunächst die Regionalregierung offiziell aufgefordert werden, sich an die Verfassung zu halten. Erst wenn die Regionalregierung dies verweigert, kann die sogenannte nukleare Option in der Verfassung aktiviert werden. [nL8N1MJ0BC] Unklar ist jedoch, wie genau die kommissarische Übernahme der katalanischen Regionalregierung ablaufen könnte. In Spanien gibt es dafür keinen Präzedenzfall.

SEPARATISTEN: WIR SIND DEM WILLEN DER KATALANEN VERPFLICHTET

Am Morgen hatte die Regierung im Barcelona Rajoy vor der Aktivierung der “nuklearen Option” gewarnt. “Wenn die Regierung den Artikel 155 aktiviert, heißt das, dass es keinen Willen zum Dialog gibt”, sagte der Sprecher der separatistischen Regierung, Jordi Turull, dem “Catalunya Radio”. “Dann müssen wir selbstverständlich konsequent mit dem sein, zu dem wir uns vor dem Volk von Katalonien verpflichtet haben.” Die Aussetzung der Unabhängigkeit durch Puigdemont stelle keinen Schritt zurück und keinesfalls einen Verzicht auf die Abspaltung von Spanien dar.

Puigdemont hatte am Dienstag sein Vorgehen damit rechtfertigt, dass er Spielraum für eine internationale Vermittlung in dem Konflikt schaffen wolle. Allerdings betonen seit Wochen sowohl EU wie auch die Mitgliedsstaaten - darunter auch Deutschland -, die Krise sei ein innerspanischer Konflikt, der auch dort gelöst werden müsse. Die spanische Zentralregierung hat eine Mediation wiederholt entschieden abgelehnt.","Rajoy stellt in Katalonien-Krise ""nukleare Option"" scharf",https://www.reuters.com/article/spanien-katalonien-idDEKBN1CG182

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

A map of Qatar is seen in this picture illustration June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

There’s Google for accessing information; Twitter for sharing opinion and news; Facebook for interacting with friends; Amazon for shopping, AirBnB for places to stay and Uber for getting around.

Until relatively recently, most consumers and governments took this as a positive trend. While there were disputes over individual and limited issues – not least the companies’ unwillingness to pay tax or comply with requests from local regulators – they usually were seen as good for the economy and job opportunities. With their slick lobbying and PR operations, the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were courted by politicians and civil society alike.

That is changing. The decision by London authorities to strip Uber of its license to operate in the British capital is part of a wider backlash in a rapidly escalating war between governments and the tech firms they believe have become too powerful and contemptuous of rules and democratic authority. Uber and its biggest rival Lyft were ejected from the Texas capital of Austin last year for refusing to fingerprint their drivers. In 2013 in San Francisco and Oakland, tech giants such as Google and Apple’s private employee buses, which were illegally using public bus stops, were blocked by protesters.

Other cities are clearly watching carefully. New York’s city regulators said Monday they were looking at their own probe into Uber, looking specifically at its impact on the city’s own yellow cab sector.

Political perceptions of these tech firms are changing too. After the so-called “Arab Spring,” many Western governments – and the Obama administration in particular – openly praised the tech firms as being a positive global influence, helping democratize the world.

That assumption unraveled as the same platforms later fueled the rise of far right parties in Europe and the Trump presidential campaign. Under Congressional pressure, Facebook voluntarily turned over details of 3,000 election-related ads that appeared to have been paid for by Russia-linked buyers.

Such scrutiny may only be the beginning. Increasingly, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are being blamed for seismic changes in Western political systems, accused of allowing themselves to be hijacked by automatic bots and hardliners to radicalize politics and often spread extremism.

Getting too close to tech firms now brings its own political dangers. U.S. think tanks that happily embraced funding from Google now find themselves criticized for it, accused of reining in any debate critical of the company and its counterparts.

Instead of spreading opportunity, such firms are increasingly blamed for killing jobs. Amazon’s success is at the heart of what trade analysts referred to as the “retail apocalypse,” the shutting of growing numbers of stores across the United States and beyond. Uber has proved toxic to more tightly controlled taxi industries. The drivers of London’s famous black cabs have been particularly hard hit, and their aggressive lobbying of politicians is seen as one of the key factors behind London mayor Sadiq Khan’s decision to suspend Uber’s operating license.

The decision proved immediately contentious. For all the criticisms of Uber – that it ignores regulators and the employment rights of those who drive for it, and that there have been reports of abuse and sexual assaults by drivers – it has slashed transport costs for its users. It has also provided opportunities – although without much in the way of job security – for hundreds of thousands around the world. An Uber-launched petition to reverse the London ban quickly notched up 600,000 signatures.

For the firms themselves, this is a familiar dynamic. Facebook, Google and Twitter in particular have been tangling with national governments since they began operating in relatively autocratic countries such as Russia, China and those in the Middle East, where those in authority have long felt threatened by the quick and easy access they offer to information. Sometimes, the tech companies have found themselves blocked outright.

Increasingly, the perception has become that many of these firms are simply willing to push their luck to see what they can get away with.

Technology firms do have a difficult balance to strike. Google, Apple and others have long made a virtue of protecting user data against what they see as overly intrusive requests for access by authorities. In some areas, the rights and wrongs are arguable. In others, however – such as the payment of tax – governments and campaigners believe the issues are much more clear-cut.

In many respects, Uber and AirBnB are seen amongst the most egregious examples of companies that have seriously and deliberately pushing the limits of what is strictly legal. While London’s already more stringent taxi regulation means Uber needs a license, in many other cities both it and its drivers operate outside the conventional taxi licensing system. AirBnB lets out rooms in cities that explicitly ban short-term rentals. Both have based their entire business model on working around, if not entirely flouting, pre-existing local regulations. Authorities often seemed to lack the ability, or the political will, to enforce the rules.

The London Uber decision is perhaps the most significant escalation in that war so far. It’s not that the firm will necessarily be ultimately banned from the streets, as it will continue to operate pending an appeal. The most likely scenario is that the firm and regulators reach a deal – although that could be a difficult process.

Early signs are that the firm is indeed willing to compromise. On Monday, its chief executive sent London authorities a contrite letter saying that the firm realized it had to change. Mayor Khan welcomed the statement, saying he favored talks to resolve the issue.

What Khan – a fast-rising star within the opposition Labour Party – has demonstrated, however, is that the firm can only operate if authorities allow it to do so. It is fundamentally replaceable – indeed, that have already been suggestions that a quickly-formed rival with better employment and safety practices might take its place. Something similar happened in Austin: although the Texas state government overruled the ban on Uber and Lyft in May, both companies now face more local competition.

Giant tech firms are unlikely to go away. But neither are national or local governments, democratically elected or otherwise. With a host of new technologies coming down the line – self-driving cars, automatic shops, artificial intelligence – many controlled by the same companies, these fights are only going to get bloodier.",Commentary: Uber’s London fight a sign of tech battles to come,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-uber-commentary/commentary-ubers-london-fight-a-sign-of-tech-battles-to-come-idUSKCN1C223I

The defeat of ultra-nationalist parties in the Netherlands and in France earlier this year gave European leaders the sense that fear of a far-right surge had, after all, been misplaced. As it turns out, it was the relief that was misplaced.

Europe remains a battleground between nationalist forces, conventional right or left governments and parties which cleave to broadly liberal positions. It is not alone. Across the world, the same impulses to define a state according to ethnic or historic criteria, or to put existing states “first,” grow in diverse forms.

Two referenda illuminate the trend. One, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq on Sept. 25, produced an almost 93 percent vote in favor of Kurdish independence, followed by an immediate demand from the Iraqi government to invalidate the vote and a threat to use the army to suppress any move to independence. On Sunday the citizens of the Catalonia region will vote on whether to secede from Spain – provided that the Spanish state, which has already arrested leaders of the referendum and confiscated voting materials, does not carry out threats to block all voting stations.

The tone in the democratic world is often set by the United States – no longer the champion of greater openness and cooperation, but now the promoter of America First. Work began earlier this week on prototypes for Donald Trump’s “beautiful” wall between Mexico and the United States; the president extended his travel ban to the citizens of three more states (Chad, North Korea and Venezuela) while dropping one, Somalia, from the list – this to align immigration “with his America First foreign policy vision.”

Europe, though, is the hub of nationalist struggles. In large part, this is because the nationalist politicians pit themselves against the continent’s large ambition to create a European Union which, in its enthusiasts’ view, should become a powerful, federal state through progressive integration – a perspective powerfully supported by the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker in his “state of the Union” address earlier this month.

Immigration has been and remains the spur for the nationalists. Its growing unpopularity fills out their sails and brings them votes from all over the political compass, including a significant proportion from working class voters accustomed to voting left, even far left.

In Germany’s general election last weekend, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) soared to become the third-largest party in the Bundestag (parliament) behind the governing CDU/CSU center-right coalition and the center-left SPD, largely on strong opposition to immigration. One of the AfD leaders, Alexander Gauland, called Chancellor Angela Merkel’s opening of the borders to some one million migrants “a gift” to his party, which it gratefully accepted and used more successfully than even the party thought possible. Some commentators believe the shock to the German system – built for decades on a moderate consensus opposed to right-wing extremism of any kind – will “condemn Europe to permanent crisis.”

In Sweden, which has taken proportionately more migrants than any other European country over the past two years, crime, including shootings and riotous behavior, seems to have increased. The extent of that has been distorted by the right, but a careful analysis in the National Review does conclude that Sweden has “a growing problem with crime that is linked to immigration.”

The phenomenon was enough for the Migration Minister from neighboring Norway, Sylvi Listhaug – a member of the nationalist Progress Party, part of the governing coalition - to make a media-trailed visit to a Swedish “no-go area,” claiming during the visit that there are ""conditions of lawlessness and criminals in control"" in places with ""a large quantity of people with immigrant backgrounds."" The subtext was that this would not be permitted to happen in Norway. Her Swedish counterpart cancelled a scheduled meeting with her, saying her statement was “complete nonsense.""

In Central Europe, the Visegrad Group of states – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – have rejected requests from fellow members of the European Union to take in a quota of migrants. Earlier this week in Prague, I asked the leader of the ANO party, Andrej Babis, strongly favored to be prime minister after the October general election, what his policy toward the EU would be. He answered that he would demand a return of powers from Brussels to the national level, since the EU had no business dictating national policy – a popular view in the country. He has already made clear that he is wholly opposed to migrants being received in Europe.

In her speech on Brexit in Florence last week, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that the British had “never felt entirely comfortable” in the EU. It’s probably a fair summation of a national mood; most British have always seen the EU as a transactional, rather than political, union. When a sizable part of the population came to believe that the EU is both incomprehensible and overbearing, Brexit resulted.

Across the English Channel, Emmanuel Macron has put himself at the head of a revived and fiercely proactive campaign to rouse the EU to continue its forward march. In a speech Tuesday, the French president proclaimed that “the only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic.” Integration – in defense, security and within the eurozone, had to be more profound, he said.

It was the vision in which one will not compromise with the nationalist forces – forces which will weaken Merkel, his strongest ally, as she tries to balance Germany’s contending forces rather than embrace his euro-optimism.

Brexit has had the headlines, and attracted the most derision from the EU enthusiasts. But nationalism – the wish to create, or to strengthen, the nation state against real or mythic enemies – remains a dominant current in the politics of the democratic countries. Battles have been won on both sides.

The country that invented “Sturm und Drang” is showing a distinct lack of storm and stress as Angela Merkel heads towards a fourth term as chancellor.

That seemingly inexorable outcome on Sept. 24 has raised hopes that she will push through greater integration within the euro area, in partnership with French president Emmanuel Macron, while also championing the rules-based international order that America has forsaken under Donald Trump. But Merkel will find it hard to satisfy such expectations, since she will face new political constraints at home, while the basis for her authority, German economic strength, will come under increasing strain.

A string of polls suggests that the politics of Merkel’s fourth term will be tricky. The chancellor is a long way ahead but she is not doing as well as in the last election, in 2013. Recent findings show support for her center-right CDU party (together with the CSU in Bavaria) at around 36 percent, down from the 41.5 percent she managed four years ago. Because of Germany’s electoral system, which broadly aligns the distribution of seats in the Bundestag with the parties’ share of the vote – while excluding those that fail to reach a 5 percent voting threshold - she will once again have to form a coalition.

The most stable government would be another “grand coalition” with the center-left SPD, her current partner, which is currently polling at around 22 percent. That might appeal to the SPD leadership but many party members are opposed to playing second fiddle again, not least since this does not pay off at the polls. If Merkel cannot form a coalition with the SPD, she may have to form a coalition with not just one but two smaller parties, the FDP and the Greens. This combination would be a first in the Bundestag and it could prove fissile by bringing together the free-market FDP, Merkel’s junior partner in her second term of office between 2009 and 2013, with Germany’s environmentalist party, which has in the past allied itself with the SPD.

The coalition arithmetic could change if the election throws up surprise results for the smaller parties. But whatever alliance Merkel forms after probably protracted negotiations, it will face a disturbing new political phenomenon. Until now the Bundestag has been immune from the upsurge of populism in Europe. But the far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) looks set to break through the 5 percent threshold that held it at bay in 2013. Currently polling around 10 percent, it has mutated from its euroskeptic origins into an anti-immigration party, capitalizing upon concerns about the influx of asylum-seekers in 2015. Though riven by internal divisions and shunned by the other parties, the AfD will be able to use its presence in the Bundestag as a platform for its populist opposition to the chancellor’s policies.

The politics of Merkel’s fourth term may be more unfavorable than before, but that should be surmountable if the economy – her trump card in the election - remains buoyant. Growth prospects for this year and next year are good, continuing a robust performance in the chancellor’s last two terms. Manufacturers excel in exporting the high-quality engineering products in which Germany specializes. The current-account surplus is extraordinarily high at around 8 percent of GDP. Helped by the humming economy and low interest rates on government debt, Germany boasts healthy public finances too, running a surplus of almost 1 percent of GDP.

Peter Apps: The coming robot arms race

John Lloyd: Labor reform in France's Macron economy

German economic and fiscal strength, so crucial in underpinning the euro zone during the crisis years of 2010-12, has come to be taken for granted. Yet under the shiny paint the engine looks less reliable for the longer journey ahead. Much of the economy does not match the prowess of German manufacturers. In particular Germany lags in business services, as a report from the OECD pointed out last year. Many professions are subject to restrictions that fetter competition. Germany is overbanked with too many small lenders and the banking sector has unhelpfully high levels of public ownership.

Moreover, the business model of German manufacturing is under threat. The diesel emissions scandal that began when Volkswagen admitted cheating U.S. emissions tests has cast a shadow over the country’s premier industry and German carmakers’ big bet on the fuel now looks misplaced. They have to scramble to catch up with electric-powered models, whose time has come thanks both to technological advances and a wave of public-health measures led by cities to ban polluting vehicles. The self-driving revolution poses another challenge to German carmakers. Manufacturers fret that they may be on the wrong side of the digital divide, with Silicon Valley in effect grabbing the high value-added content of many products.

Germans are proud of their massive current-account surplus, yet the domestic counterpart is a lack of investment to absorb national savings. The government’s drive to balance the books has come at the cost of inadequate capital spending on the national infrastructure. Business investment has been subdued. Indeed, according to the OECD’s survey, German firms are behind those of other advanced countries in investing in the “knowledge-based capital”, such as software and management skills, that is increasingly important in spurring greater efficiency. That is one reason why productivity growth has been weak.

An underlying and profound weakness is that Germany’s demographics are especially unfavorable in economic terms. At almost 46, the median age of the population in 2015 was only just lower than Japan’s, the world’s oldest, according to UN data released in June. Although there was a baby boom from the mid-1950s through most of the 1960s, the birth rate fell below the replacement level (of 2.1 children per woman) at the start of the 1970s and has since been among the lowest in the world; indeed the current fertility rate of 1.5 is unusually high. These persistently low birth rates mean that there are fewer young people to replace the bulge of baby-boomers as they retire. Despite the recent upsurge in immigration the working-age population is set to fall, which will act as a persistent drag on growth by reducing the number of workers over the next couple of decades.

For the moment, Merkel still has the aura of invincibility. Yet in practice she will find the going tougher in her fourth term as political, economic and demographic vulnerabilities take their toll. That will limit her ability to meet the exaggerated expectations of what she can achieve both within Europe and on the wider international stage.",Commentary: Don’t be fooled by Merkel’s aura of invincibility,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallace-germany-commentary/commentary-dont-be-fooled-by-merkels-aura-of-invincibility-idUSKCN1BU2BJ

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Investors are increasingly excited about the prospects for much faster growth in the solar power industry in Southeast Asia, which has until now been a backwater for renewable energy.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Divisions along national lines, including actions taken by the United States against Russia’s Kaspersky Lab, are making it harder to effectively fight cross-border cyber crime, a senior Interpol official told Reuters on Tuesday.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration barred U.S. government agencies from using Kaspersky Lab anti-virus products in September, saying it was concerned the firm was vulnerable to Kremlin influence and using its software could jeopardize national security.

Kaspersky Lab has strongly denied the allegations, arguing that it has been caught up in a wider geopolitical spat between Moscow and Washington following allegations Russian hackers interfered in last year’s U.S. presidential election.

Moscow denies the accusations and some researchers have pointed to the company’s problems in the United States as an example of growing fragmentation in the cyber security industry after a series high-profile attacks which have fueled distrust and suspicion between countries.

“Balkanisation, especially in the cyber security community - that is happening and that needs to be corrected,” said Noboru Nakatani, executive director of Interpol’s Global Complex for Innovation.

“The reality is criminals, they are working together by sharing information by helping each other to make money,” he said at a cyber crime conference in Moscow. “Do you think the governments or the good people are doing the same?”

Speaking on the sidelines of the conference organized by Russian cyber security firm Group-IB, Nakatani said Kaspersky Lab’s situation was an example of Balkanisation.

He said Interpol, which coordinates international efforts to fight cyber and other crimes, had not received any information from the United States about the allegations against the company.

“Kaspersky is fighting against cyber criminals, it is very clear. Kaspersky is working with governments and companies across the world,” he said. “We should work together.”

A U.S. House of Representatives committee said last week it had scheduled a new hearing to review accusations Russia could use Kaspersky Lab products to conduct espionage.

The Oct. 25 hearing was announced a day after two newspapers reported that Russian hackers stole U.S. cyber secrets in 2015 from a National Security Agency contractor who had Kaspersky software installed on his laptop.

Groundbreaking on homes edged slightly lower in September to 217,118 units from August’s upwardly revised 225,918 as a 10.7 percent drop in multiple starts, typically condos, outweighed an 8.2 percent climb in single starts, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation said.

Analysts had expected starts to cool to a 210,000 annual rate but construction continued to defy expectations for a pullback after a near decade-long boom.

“Canadian homebuilding activity remains robust, with the best population growth in 25 years proving fundamental support. And, after declining modestly in the second quarter, residential investment looks to have added to growth again in the third quarter,” BMO senior economist Robert Kavcic wrote in a client note.

Canada’s long housing boom has shown signs of cooling, particularly in the nation’s largest city, Toronto, where the introduction in April of a foreign buyers tax has doused sales and ended many of the bidding wars that had become a hallmark of the city’s overheated market.

A separate report from Statistics Canada showed the value of Canadian building permits fell more than expected in August, the second straight monthly decrease, on lower construction intentions for multifamily homes as well as industrial facilities.

The 5.5 percent decrease in total building permits surpassed forecasts for a decline of 1.0 percent and suggested that the building boom will slow in the months ahead. July figures were revised to show a decrease of 2.8 percent from the previously reported 3.5 percent fall.

“Despite the drop (in housing starts) in September, Canadian residential construction remains at a level that is higher than demographic needs,” said Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank Financial, estimating that a 190,000 pace of starts would meet demographic needs.

A vote on the appointment of Fernando Arias, 65, is expected to be taken by the body’s 41-member executive council of Thursday.

He will succeed Ahmet Uzumcu of Turkey, who has headed the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) since July 2010.

The change of leadership comes as the OPCW and U.N. weapons inspectors investigate ongoing use of banned nerve agents, including sarin and mustard gas, in the Syrian civil war.

Syrian officials remain unable to explain how banned chemicals have been found in the country, meaning the new leader could face a showdown among members over whether Syria should be reported to the United Nations for non-compliance.

Arias will have to overcome fundamental differences between major powers Russia and the United States, which jointly drafted a deal to rid Syria of its chemical weapons in 2013 after a sarin attack killed hundreds of civilians near Damascus, but have since ended cooperation at the OPCW.

Diplomats say Arias, Spain’s ambassador to the OPCW and the Netherlands, where the organisation is based, is known as a strong negotiator and mediator, making him a good match for the job.

Under Arias’ direction, the OPCW adopted a contentious decision in 2016 condemning the use of chemical weapons by Syrian government forces and Islamic State militants.

A rare vote at the consensus-based OPCW signalled the break in cooperation between the United States and Russia, which back different sides in the war.

The United States had sought to impose sanctions on those responsible through the OPCW’s executive council, but dropped the proposal in the face of fierce Russian opposition.

An alternative text drafted by Spain was supported by a majority, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain, but opposed by Russia, China, Iran and Sudan.

Arias nomination must be formally be approved by all the OPCW’s member countries, represented through the Conference of States Parties, which is expected by December.

Arias, who previously served as Spain’s ambassador to the United Nations, will be appointed for a four-year term through July 2022 and can seek reappointment.

Below is a selection of some of the transactions involving Microsoft products and sanctioned firms and bodies, based on state procurement data:

ALMAZ-ANTEY

Russian state-owned airspace and defense corporation Almaz–Antey bought more than 500 Microsoft products between autumn 2014 and spring 2017. Those transactions included the purchase and delivery of eight Microsoft Windows Open License Program (OLP) Server licenses for NPO Almaz, a division of Almaz-Antey. The licenses were sold by Moscow-registered company Syssoft, which is mentioned among Microsoft partners on Microsoft’s website.

Neither Almaz-Antey nor Syssoft responded to requests for comment.

Almaz-Antey was added to the U.S. government’s “specially designated nationals” list in July 2014. The firm manufactures the BUK surface-to-air missile. Dutch prosecutors say that a BUK missile, launched from a site in eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, brought down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur in July 2014. All 298 people on board were killed. Russia denies that it or pro-Moscow rebels were responsible.

KRYM HEALTH RESORT

The “Krym” health resort, in Crimea, owned by the Russian Defence Ministry, in March 2017 acquired 109 Microsoft OLP Windows Server and SQLServer licenses, according to the data-base. The resort bought the software from the firm Nash Parus, registered in Simferopol in Crimea. The resort declined to comment, and the two vendor firms did not respond to requests for comment.

BELOGORSKY DISTRICT ADMINISTRATION

The administration of Crimea’s Belogorsky District in December 2015 acquired 155 Windows licenses. Eighty were OLP Windows Server licenses, and the rest were Full Packaged Product (FPP) licenses, which are sold off-the-shelf and do not require details of the license holder to be registered. The vendor was a firm called Positronika Integratsiya. The administration and the vendor did not respond to requests for comment.

NPO BAZALT

NPO Bazalt, a Russian state arms manufacturer acquired 101 Windows Server licenses in August 2016. The vendor was Moscow-registered firm OOO Ifrit. The procurement documents do not specify if the products were Open License Programs. The delivery of the Microsoft products to Bazalt was confirmed to Reuters by a participant in the deal. Bazalt was added to the U.S. government’s “specially designated nationals” list in July 2014.

Neither Bazalt nor Ifrit responded to Reuters requests for comment.

A venture with Great Wall, whose Hong-Kong listed shares leapt 20 percent on the news, would be BMW’s second in the world’s largest auto market, where foreign carmakers have to team up with local partners.

“We are in discussions with Great Wall about setting up a joint venture to produce cars in Changshu,” said a BMW executive, who was not authorized to speak on the matter and declined to be identified.

Another person familiar with the matter said the new joint venture in the eastern city of Changshu would not deal with gasoline or diesel powered cars, indicating a focus on electric vehicles was likely.

BMW’s China sales grew 11.3 percent last year. It is the country’s second-largest premium brand after Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi AG. BMW is trying to stay ahead of third-place Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz, which recorded 26.6 percent growth in China sales in 2016 thanks to a fresher model lineup.

Car manufacturers have recently announced a raft of investments and tie-ups in China.

Tesla, Ford Motor Co, Daimler AG, and General Motors are among those that have already announced plans for making electric vehicles in China.

ELECTRIC MINI?

BMW and rival Mercedes are betting they can mass produce new electric cars based on conventional vehicle design, defying skeptics who say they will need more radical plans to head off the threat from Tesla and other start-ups.

Bernstein analysts said they believed that any new venture of BMW and Great Wall would have to sell exclusively electric vehicles (EVs), given China’s moratorium on approvals for new gasoline car businesses.

“If an agreement were to be reached, we’d expect an arrangement like Denza (Mercedes-BYD), or VW-JAC, Ford-Zotye to be the most plausible outcome, whereby a new brand is used to sell EVs,” they said in a note, adding that the vehicles could be sold under the Mini brand.

China wants electric and hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of the country’s auto sales by 2025 and plans to loosen joint-venture regulations to achieve its aim.

BMW already has a joint venture in China with local carmaker Brilliance China Automotive Holdings and produces cars at two plants in Shenyang. Shares in Brilliance fell on Wednesday.

“Our business development with the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive will continue as planned, and we will carry on to invest and develop our joint venture.” a spokesman for BMW said, declining to comment on any new joint venture.

The plans were first reported by Shanghai-based www.iautodaily.com earlier on Wednesday.

A Great Wall official declined to comment.

Great Wall, which in August expressed an interest in the Jeep brand of Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV‘s, is one of China’s largest car makers.

If Spanish authorities hoped strong-arm tactics against the referendum independence for Catalonia would nip nationalist feeling in the bud, they will almost certainly be proved badly wrong. Sunday’s footage of violent police action against unarmed demonstrators may prove just the catalyst pro-independence groups wanted, handing Europe yet another crisis when it needed it least.

Ironically, the government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would have done better to simply ignore the non-binding referendum. It was always likely to produce a vote for independence, if only because those who favored it were far more likely to vote. Broader opinion polls conducted before the weekend ballot never showed majority support for independence, and most estimates suggest it has been ebbing steadily since 2013 to around 40 percent.

The scale of the violence this weekend and the brutality of the national police attempts to stop the ballot – almost 900 injured, according to local authorities – has changed everything. While the referendum was expected to be a polarizing event, the Spanish authorities have now effectively guaranteed it will be seen as a defining moment not just for Catalonia but the country at large. It would be astounding if it did not yield a substantial spike in separatist feeling. In a single day, the Rajoy government may have taken what should have been a manageable issue and escalated it into an existential challenge for Spain.

Catalonia’s governor Carles Puigdemont could always have been hoping to declare independence in the aftermath of the ballot. The widely reported violence, however, delivers a degree of political legitimacy to that fact. That doesn’t mean Spain will necessarily fracture – but it does dramatically increase the chances of that happening in the longer run.

A Spanish break-up will have broad implications for a continent that has spent much of the last decade bouncing from crisis to crisis, but had been having a better year than many U.S. and British pundits had anticipated. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both bested far-right challenges in national elections, growth is improving in eurozone economies and the refugee crisis appears to have stabilized.

Events in Spain, however, are a stark reminder that almost every European country remains trapped in a slow-burning political crisis with an ever-growing chance of unusual, unorthodox and outright aggressive nationalist or radical politics eroding the center ground.

In France, the National Front is clearly poised to take advantage of the faltering popularity of Macron, who defeated far-right leader Marine LePen in May. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in a strong third in last week’s election, and is now in parliament for the first time. The festering sore of Brexit continues to raise a host of challenges for both the EU and Britain, while Greece, Italy and Spain continue to struggle economically despite strong broader European growth.

So far, European nations are struggling to work out what their position should be with Spain. For all the public criticism of what is clearly seen as an unnecessarily heavy-handed Spanish clampdown, few European leaders have been willing to criticize Rajoy in public. Behind closed doors, however, the message will almost certainly be that the weekend’s scenes cannot be repeated.

Spain is not the only European country with separatist regions, and that will certainly be little appetite for a wider upswing in the regional nationalism. Just as serious, however, is the way events in Spain reinvigorate the wider European narrative of crisis.

Already, the euro was trading slightly lower on Monday on the news. Russian broadcasters and social media feeds – always keen to jump on anything that undermines the European political mainstream – gave front-page coverage to the news of riot police using rubber bullets and batons to stop the Catalonia vote. Wider international attention can be expected to continue, potentially exacerbating political polarization at every step.

Rajoy’s government is in a tricky situation. It must realize that more heavy-handed use of law enforcement will simply strengthen the separatist cause. Unlike more authoritarian states, Spain does not have the option of bludgeoning dissent into the ground. But nor can it afford to ignore events in Catalonia, for fear the now-heightened momentum behind the pro-independence movement grows still further.

The most obvious solution would be to offer Catalonians more regional autonomy. So far, however, there are few signs of that – and Rajoy’s early statements praising the police response and denying that the referendum has any legal force look set to aggravate tensions rather than ameliorate them.",Commentary: Spain's missteps supercharge the Catalonia crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-catalonia-commentary/commentary-spains-missteps-supercharge-the-catalonia-crisis-idUSKCN1C724O

The EU moved its mission to neighboring Tunisia in mid-2014 as security worsened in Libya amid escalating fighting between rival factions since the 2011 fall of longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi, ousted by rebels during a NATO bombing campaign.

Of 28 EU states, only Italy, Libya’s former colonial master and still the most influential European state on the ground, has an embassy in the country, where the United Nations has officially recognized the government of Fayez Seraj.

The EU has also engaged increasingly with Seraj, especially as it sought Libya’s help in curbing the flow of African refugees and migrants, hundreds of thousands of whom have been boarding smugglers’ boats on the coast of the lawless state to cross the Mediterranean for Europe.

La terza è attesa per domani.

In segno di protesta, il Movimento 5 Stelle ha convocato una manifestazione di piazza davanti a Montecitorio, alla quale hanno aderito circa 1.000 persone, e ha annunciato che non parteciperà al voto.

Roberta Lombardi, esponente di rilievo dei 5 Stelle ha detto: “Non parteciperemo di certo al voto sul primo articolo per rimanere in piazza”, mentre sui voti successivi i grillini stanno valutando il da farsi.

Anche Mdp e altri partiti di sinistra, che hanno annunciato il voto contrario alla fiducia, protesteranno al Pantheon nel pomeriggio.

Il cosiddetto Rosatellum Bis è un sistema misto, maggioritario al 36% e proporzionale per il resto con soglie di sbarramento e la possibilità di formare coalizioni.

La prima fiducia riguarda l‘articolo 1 della legge, quello relativo al sistema elettorale della Camera. Il testo prevede che 231 seggi vengano assegnati con collegi uninominali maggioritari, 386 col metodo proporzionale in piccoli collegi plurinominali (senza preferenze), uno col collegio uninominale per la Val D‘Aosta e 12 con metodo proporzionale nella circoscrizione estero.

La seconda fiducia riguarderà invece l‘articolo 2, che regola l‘elezione del Senato, dove 103 seggi verranno assegnati in collegi uninominali (il Molise e la Val d‘Aosta avrebbero un unico collegio ognuna), 206 in piccoli collegi plurinominali. Sei senatori verranno eletti col proporzionale nella circoscrizione estero.

La terza fiducia sarà relativa alla delega al governo a disegnare i nuovi collegi entro un mese dall‘approvazione definitiva della nuova legge.

Gli elettori avranno un‘unica scheda per la Camera e un‘altra per il Senato. Scegliendo un partito, si sceglie automaticamente anche il candidato collegato nel collegio uninominale.

Le soglie di sbarramento previste sono diverse: 3% per le liste singole alla Camera (5% al Senato) e 10% per cento per le coalizioni.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks set a record high on Wednesday, as relief that Catalonia had put off any plans to break away from Spain followed a two-decade peak for Asia’s biggest share market and more upbeat predictions for the global economy.

Spanish stocks and bonds rallied and the euro reached a two-week high in early European trading after Catalonia’s leader, Carles Puigdemont, declined to make a formal declaration of independence on Tuesday. That disappointed many pro-independence supporters but pleased financial markets.

A 1.5 percent jump in Spain's IBEX .IBEX helped MSCI's 47-country world stocks index .MIWD00000PUS touch a record high.

The biggest surge came from Spanish banks, which rallied as much as 4 percent .IBEXIB. Spanish government bond yields - a gauge of political tension - saw their second-biggest decline in a month [GVD/EUR].

“There was a chance Puigdemont would have made a decisive declaration, so now yields are dropping because there is room for negotiation left,” said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk.

The euro climbed as high as $1.18345 against the dollar, a two-week top. The U.S. currency was down for a fourth day running and on its worst run since July.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s feud with Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, an influential fellow Republican, has raised concern that Trump’s proposed tax-code overhaul would fail .

“Squabbles surrounding Trump’s efforts come as no surprise, but it is still not helping the dollar,” said Yukio Izhizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.

The early Spanish gains bolstered already-confident markets. The International Monetary Fund pushed up its forecasts for global growth on Tuesday, helping Wall Street to its latest record high.

Asian shares then climbed to their highest in a decade as Japan's Nikkei .N225 reached its strongest since 1996, despite more losses for scandal-hit Kobe Steel (5406.T) [.T]. South Korean stocks .KOPSI reached a new record top.

“A risk-on mood has set in and money is flowing out of bond funds into equities funds,” said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management.

“One of the biggest drivers of global equities is the United States, and some of the macro data coming out from there has been quite positive. There is also this view that China is traveling much better than many people had expected.”

FED MINUTES

The dollar was under pressure amid uncertainty over who will be the next Federal Reserve chair, with the predictions market site, PredictIt, favoring Fed Governor Jerome Powell as the most likely candidate.

Powell is regarded as more hawkish than incumbent Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February, but analysts say he probably wouldn’t look to unwind stimulus as aggressively as some of the candidates on the list.

Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan, who votes this year on Fed policy, had also said overnight that he wants to see more signs of upward inflation before raising interest rates again.

The weaker dollar helped commodities and emerging markets, which borrow heavily in the U.S. currency.

Emerging market stocks sailed to six-year highs. U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 42 cents to $51.34 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 added 25 cents to $56.86, on signs of tighter supply.

MADRID (Reuters) - Barcelona are ready to mount a new bid for Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho in January, the club said on Wednesday.

The Catalan side made multiple attempts at signing the Brazilian earlier in the year but according to reports, the Premier League club were holding out for 200 million euros ($237 million) and kept the midfielder.

Barcelona CEO Oscar Grau said the club have a record predicted revenue of 897 million euros for the 2017-18 season, up 189 million on the previous year.

“We are ready to sign Coutinho or any other player the technical staff request in the winter window,” Grau told a news conference.

“We want to have the most competitive squad possible. The club will be sustainable, we don’t want losses. If that is the case, we will look for means to generate income.”

Club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said in October 2016 the club were targeting one billion euros in revenue by 2021.

Barcelona sold winger Neymar to Paris St. Germain for a world record fee of 222 million euros in August, before spending an initial 105 million euros on Borussia Dortmund’s Ousmane Dembele.

“We’re presenting figures for this season which are the highest of any club in the world,” added Grau.

(Reuters) - Firefighters battling wildfires in California’s wine country faced the prospect of new outbreaks on Wednesday when dry, windy conditions return to an area where blazes have killed at least 17 people and destroyed 2,000 homes and businesses.

Gusts of up to 50 miles per hour (80 kph) and 10 percent humidity are forecast for later on Wednesday and into Thursday for the region, where 17 fires have forced 20,000 people to flee their homes in one of the deadliest wildfire outbreaks in California history, fire officials said.

“The potential for new fires that could grow exponentially as these fires did in such a short time period is there,” said Lynne Tolmachoff, spokeswoman for California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

The weather had given firefighters a reprieve on Tuesday as cooler temperatures, lower winds and coastal fog let them make headway against the fires that had burned 115,000 acres.

New evacuation orders were posted overnight across Sonoma County, north of San Francisco.

Some 155 people were missing in Sonoma County, although 45 others had been found and some of those unaccounted for may be due to confusion surrounding evacuations.

The city of Santa Rosa was particularly hard hit by the so-called Tubbs fire, which damaged a Hilton hotel and destroyed a mobile home park, among other damage. At least 11 people have been killed by that fire alone, officials said. It is the deadliest California wildfire since 2003, when the Cedar fire killed 15 people in San Diego, and the sixth deadliest since records began, according to state records.

Irene Fonzeca and her husband, Luis, spent their second night in a shelter on Tuesday after waking up the day before to the sound of fiery trees crashing down and flames being blown toward their home.

“We have no idea what’s there or if there’s anything to go back to,” Irene Fonzeca said outside the shelter holding a breathing mask as smoke and light ash blanketed downtown Santa Rosa.

In the shelter, emotions were raw, she said. “People are crying, hugging, helping each other. It’s devastating.”

In Napa County, the dead included 100-year-old Charles Rippey and his wife, Sarah, 98, according to the county sheriff’s office. The couple were married for 75 years, a CBS affiliate in San Francisco reported, citing their son, Mike.

Charles Rippey’s body was found outside where his wife’s bedroom once stood, he said. “He was trying to get from his room to her room,” Mike Rippey said. “He never made it.”

Napa Valley Vintners, a trade group, said it was too early to assess the economic impact on Northern California’s celebrated wine country. At least four wineries suffered “total or very significant losses” and at least nine reported damage, the group said.

Em agosto as vendas varejistas recuaram 0,5 por cento, informou o Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) nesta quarta-feira, após estabilidade em julho e alta nos três meses anteriores.

É o resultado mais fraco para agosto desde 2015, quando caiu 0,6 por cento, e a leitura foi bem pior do que a expectativa em pesquisa da Reuters de alta de 0,2 por cento.

Sobre o mesmo mês de 2016, as vendas apresentaram alta de 3,6 por cento, também abaixo da expectativa de avanço de 4,5 por cento mas no melhor resultado desde maio de 2014 (+4,6 por cento).

“A queda de agosto é mais uma acomodação. Mais parece um ajuste depois de altas do que uma reversão de tendência para o setor varejista”, afirmou a gerente do IBGE Isabella Nunes.

De acordo com o IBGE, sete das oito atividades pesquisadas apresentaram recuo nas vendas, sendo a mais forte em equipamentos e material para escritório, informática e comunicação, de 6,7 por cento.

As vendas de combustíveis e lubrificantes recuaram 2,9 por cento no mês. Em agosto, os preços dos combustíveis aumentaram 6,67 por cento, em meio a 19 reajustes de preços da gasolina dentro da nova política da Petrobras, apontou o IBGE ao divulgar os dados de inflação daquele mês.

Já as vendas de hipermercados, supermercados, produtos alimentícios, bebidas e fumo caíram 0,3 por cento em agosto sobre julho.

A única atividade a registrar aumento nas vendas foi a de móveis e eletrodomésticos, de 1,7 por cento, no quarto mês seguido de ganhos.

“A atividade que tem desempenho melhor é aquela que tem a ver com a queda de juros, com a disponibilidade do FGTS e com a inflação menor”, completou Isabella.

O varejo ampliado, que inclui veículos e material de construção, subiu 0,1 por cento em relação a julho, influenciado tanto pela alta de 2,8 por cento em veículos e motos, partes e peças, quanto pelo avanço de 1,8 por cento nas vendas de material de construção.

O resultado do varejo acompanhou o da indústria em agosto, que interrompeu quatro meses seguidos de alta porém em movimento que também não tende a atrapalhar o ritmo de recuperação do setor.

O ambiente de inflação e juros baixos no país favorecem o comércio, aliado recentemente à melhora do mercado de trabalho, o que dá base para a recuperação da economia após a recessão que afetou o país.

Em setembro, a confiança do consumidor brasileiro apurada pela Fundação Getulio Vargas voltou a avançar após três quedas seguidas, diante da melhora da percepção sobre o mercado de trabalho.","Varejo no Brasil surpreende e cai em agosto, mas movimento não é tendência, diz IBGE",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1CG1OG-OBRBS

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - On paper, Catalonia looks viable as an independent state. The region which accounts for around a fifth of Spain’s economy has gross domestic product roughly comparable to Finland’s. Its residents are on average richer and more likely to have a job than other Spaniards. Nevertheless, the economic odds are stacked against the secessionists.

First, Catalonia may become much less wealthy if it breaks away. Some large companies are taking steps to transfer their registered headquarters out of the region following the Oct. 1 independence referendum that was branded unconstitutional by the central government. They include Banco Sabadell, Spain’s fifth-largest lender, which decided on Thursday to move its legal base to Alicante. The more likely independence becomes, the greater the chances that jobs and actual activity shift elsewhere.

Second, breaking away would trigger harmful disputes over tax and debt with Madrid, which trenchantly opposes a divorce. Granted, Catalonia pays more in taxes to the central government than it receives in spending. But unilaterally declaring independence would not necessarily allow the region to stand on its own. Citizens and businesses might face duplicate tax demands from Barcelona and Madrid. In the event of a standoff, companies with branch offices in Spain could be presented with bills for the whole business.

There’s also the thorny issue of how to smooth out Catalan debt obligations, which it currently does with the help of state liquidity. Net borrowing from the central government surpassed 50 billion euros at the end of 2016, equivalent to three-quarters of Catalonia’s total debt, according to Fitch. The credit rating firm also points out that more than a quarter of debt outstanding at the end of 2016 comes due over the next three years. And that’s assuming Catalonia can escape without taking on any of Spain’s sovereign debt, currently equivalent to around 100 percent of national GDP.

A final problem is what currency Catalonia would use. Even if independence were recognised by other countries, the region is unlikely to remain a part of the euro zone. Granted, it could always create a currency that is pegged to the euro. But a newly-created Catalan central bank would need access to foreign exchange reserves that the central government has no interest in handing over. Politics are not the only bar to independence.",Breakingviews - Economic odds stacked against Catalonia breakaway,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-catalonia-breakingviews/breakingviews-economic-odds-stacked-against-catalonia-breakaway-idUSKBN1CB1DY

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israeli intelligence officials spying on Russian government hackers found they were using Kaspersky Lab antivirus software that is also used by 400 million people globally, including U.S. government agencies, according to media reports on Tuesday.

The Israeli officials who had hacked into Kaspersky’s network over two years ago then warned their U.S. counterparts of the Russian intrusion, said The New York Times, which first reported the story. nyti.ms/2yev8Vj

That led to a decision in Washington only last month to order Kaspersky software removed from government computers.

The Washington Post also reported on Tuesday that the Israeli spies had also found in Kaspersky's network hacking tools that could only have come from the U.S. National Security Agency. wapo.st/2i2clXa

After an investigation, the NSA found that those tools were in possession of the Russian government, the Post said.

And late last month, the U.S. National Intelligence Council completed a classified report that it shared with NATO allies concluding that Russia’s FSB intelligence service had “probable access” to Kaspersky customer databases and source code, the Post reported.

That access, it concluded, could help enable cyber attacks against U.S. government, commercial and industrial control networks, the Post reported.

The New York Times said the Russian operation, according to multiple people briefed on the matter, is known to have stolen classified documents from a National Security Agency employee who had improperly stored them on his home computer, which had Kaspersky antivirus software installed on it.

It is not yet publicly known what other U.S. secrets the Russian hackers may have discovered by turning the Kaspersky software into a sort of Google search for sensitive information, the Times said.

The current and former government officials who described the episode spoke about it on condition of anonymity because of classification rules, the Times said.

The newspaper said the National Security Agency and the White House declined to comment, as did the Israeli Embassy, while the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment.

The Russian embassy in Washington last month called the ban on Kaspersky Lab software “regrettable” and said it delayed the prospects of restoring bilateral ties.

Kaspersky Lab denied to the Times any knowledge of, or involvement in, the Russian hacking. “Kaspersky Lab has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday.

Eugene Kaspersky, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, has repeatedly denied charges his company conducts espionage on behalf of the Russian government.

Kaspersky spokeswoman Sarah Kitsos told the Washington Post on Tuesday that “as a private company, Kaspersky Lab does not have inappropriate ties to any government, including Russia, and the only conclusion seems to be that Kaspersky Lab is caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight.” She said the company “does not possess any knowledge” of Israel’s hack, the Post said.

Pfizer, the $215 billion U.S. drugmaker, has tasked investment banks with looking into a spinoff or sale of its consumer-goods division, which makes Advil and Preparation H. New GlaxoSmithKline boss Emma Walmsley would be well placed to offer a home.

Over-the-counter products are a tiny sideline for Pfizer, accounting for just 6.4 percent of its revenue last year. Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read therefore loses little from putting the business on the block. While these goods might share manufacturing and shipping processes with prescription medicines, the unique nature of cooking up, testing and distributing drugs to patients suggests there’s not much reason to keep them together. Germany’s Merck is considering a similar split.

Of course, some are less dismissive – including Walmsley. She took over as CEO in April, having run the consumer-goods joint venture Glaxo co-owns with Switzerland’s Novartis. Walmsley has pledged to focus on Glaxo’s drugs, like its HIV and asthma meds, rather than her old division, which makes just 15 percent of group operating profit. But as she will know, consumer goods are a game of scale – something rivals like Sanofi, Reckitt Benckiser and Johnson & Johnson also covet.

A neat solution would be to fold Pfizer’s consumer business into the Glaxo-Novartis joint venture. Valued at 15 times operating profit – roughly the 10-year average for the consumer-staples sector – the business could be worth $10 billion. That assumes Pfizer’s consumer operating margin is roughly the same 20 percent that Glaxo is targeting. Since Glaxo now values its venture with Novartis at $27 billion, Pfizer could argue for a stake somewhere south of 30 percent. One day, the enlarged company might make for a more lucrative spinoff or sale than Pfizer could muster today.

Timing matters. Read says he will make a decision some time in 2018. Ideally, Glaxo would buy Novartis out before doing any other deals, since it would otherwise have to pay the Swiss for their share of any synergies that came from adding Pfizer. Besides, Walmsley has only been in the job for six months. Nonetheless, she could do worse than toss an offer over Pfizer’s counter.",Breakingviews - Pfizer and Glaxo may find romance over the counter,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pfizer-divestiture-breakingviews/breakingviews-pfizer-and-glaxo-may-find-romance-over-the-counter-idUSKBN1CF2JQ

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - British tech firm Micro Focus International Plc (MCRO.L), the new owner of ArcSight security software, said it would restrict reviews of the core operating instructions in its products by “high-risk” governments, after Reuters reported that the application had been scrutinized by Russia.

Micro Focus did not respond to questions seeking to clarify whether the countries included Russia or how it would determine which reviews were likely to be shared with governments. But a company spokeswoman said future reviews would require approval from Micro Focus’s chief executive.

And a Micro Focus blog posted on Monday by ArcSight head Jason Schmitt defended the reviews of core software operating instructions, known as source code, as common. He said “that dozens of brand-name products have undergone the same type of certification testing.”

“Micro Focus will not allow any source code reviews if we reasonably believe the governments of high risk countries will have access to that review,” the Micro Focus spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters.

Micro Focus purchased the ArcSight product line from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE.N) in a sale completed last month. Reuters reported last week that HPE allowed a Moscow defense agency to review the inner workings of ArcSight, a cyber defense software used by the Pentagon to guard its computer networks.

Cyber security experts, former U.S. intelligence officials and former ArcSight employees said the practice could help Moscow discover weaknesses in the software, potentially helping attackers to blind the U.S. military to a cyber attack.

Russia’s evaluation of ArcSight concluded last year, at a time when Washington was accusing Moscow of an increasing number of cyber attacks against American companies, U.S. politicians and government agencies, including the Pentagon. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations.

Russia in recent years has stepped up demands for source code reviews as a requirement for doing business in the country, Reuters reported in June, and many companies have complied.

ArcSight, and other HPE security products, were sold to Micro Focus in a transaction completed in September.

Micro Focus also said it would notify the U.S. government and seek feedback before allowing source code reviews “where applicable.” The company spokeswoman did not respond to questions requesting clarification of when such notifications would apply.

Some companies have decided to stop allowing source code reviews as a condition to do business in a foreign market. For example, Symantec decided in 2016 that they would no longer allow such reviews because of security concerns.

HPE did not alert the Defense Information Systems Agency, which purchases ArcSight for the military, that it had allowed the Russian review, a DISA spokeswoman told Reuters.

The DISA spokeswoman said the agency has no immediate plans to pullback on its use of ArcSight or reconsider its procurement rules in light of the Reuters report. The Pentagon continually evaluates software for security risks, the DISA spokeswoman said.

According to Russian regulatory records and interviews with people with direct knowledge of the issue, the review of ArcSight’s code was conducted by Echelon, a company with close ties to the Russian military. The review was done on behalf of Russia’s Federal Service for Technical and Export Control (FSTEC), a defense agency that counters cyber espionage.

HPE said code reviews have taken place for years and are conducted by Russian-government accredited testing companies at an HPE research and development center outside of Russia, where the software maker closely supervises the process.

No code is allowed to leave the premises ensuring “our source code and products were in no way compromised,” an HPE spokeswoman said in an email last week. She said in a phone call on Monday that no current HPE products had gone through the Russian review process.

ArcSight source code was tested in August 2015, the Micro Focus spokeswoman said, several months before HPE was spun off from Hewlett-Packard Inc. The Russian certification process for ArcSight was completed in August 2016, according to Russian regulatory records.

HPE has said the inspection process was necessary to obtain certification from Russia’s FSTEC in order to sell software to the public sector in Russia.",UK tech firm Micro Focus to curb code reviews by 'high risk' governments,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-russia-microfocus/uk-tech-firm-micro-focus-to-curb-code-reviews-by-high-risk-governments-idUSKBN1CE2M6

Thailand is putting the finishing touches this month to a lavish five-day funeral ceremony in a final goodbye to its late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who helped shape the Southeast Asian nation for decades after World War Two.

Many of the hundreds of thousands of black-clad mourners are expected to camp for days near Bangkok's Grand Palace to capture a good view of the ceremonies, which will be guarded by 78,000 police officers and culminate in the cremation on Oct. 26.

""October is a sad period,"" Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who announced plans for a national election next year, told reporters in the capital on Tuesday. ""I ask that politicians and political parties be peaceful and orderly."" Artisans have worked for ten months in Bangkok's ancient quarter to build an elaborate cremation site fashioned after a vision of heaven, where Thais believe dead royals return to live above Mount Meru, a golden mountain in Hindu mythology.

Army officers take part in a funeral rehearsal for the king. The funeral of King Bhumibol, who died on Oct. 13 last year after seven decades on the throne, is also a time of uncertainty for some Thais, said a Thailand-based analyst, who declined to be identified because of sensitivities around the monarchy. ""In many ways the king was Thailand and his death has left a huge vacuum in the Thai psyche,"" said the analyst, pointing to social and political upheavals in recent decades. ""What happens after his funeral? Where will Thailand head next? These are profound questions that must be answered.""

Well-wishers line up to pay respect to the king near the Grand Palace.

""A strong bond has been formed between the people and the monarchy – the strongest compared to past reigns,"" Tongthong told Reuters. ""So we can see more people participation in the royal funeral of this king."" Among the many royal objects restored for the funeral is a golden chariot that will carry the king's body in a giant ornate urn to the cremation site.

The urn will move to the Royal Crematorium before the cremation on the night of Oct. 26, which has been declared a national holiday. More than 3,000 performers will join in a nightlong final tribute of music and puppet shows to end a year of mourning.

A venture with Great Wall, whose Hong-Kong listed shares leapt 20 percent on the news, would be BMW’s second in the world’s largest auto market, where foreign carmakers have to team up with local partners.

“We are in discussions with Great Wall about setting up a joint venture to produce cars in Changshu,” said a BMW executive, who was not authorized to speak on the matter and declined to be identified.

Another person familiar with the matter said the new joint venture in the eastern city of Changshu would not deal with gasoline or diesel powered cars, indicating a focus on electric vehicles was likely.

BMW’s China sales grew 11.3 percent last year. It is the country’s second-largest premium brand after Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi AG. BMW is trying to stay ahead of third-place Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz, which recorded 26.6 percent growth in China sales in 2016 thanks to a fresher model lineup.

Car manufacturers have recently announced a raft of investments and tie-ups in China.

Tesla, Ford Motor Co, Daimler AG, and General Motors are among those that have already announced plans for making electric vehicles in China.

ELECTRIC MINI?

BMW and rival Mercedes are betting they can mass produce new electric cars based on conventional vehicle design, defying skeptics who say they will need more radical plans to head off the threat from Tesla and other start-ups.

Bernstein analysts said they believed that any new venture of BMW and Great Wall would have to sell exclusively electric vehicles (EVs), given China’s moratorium on approvals for new gasoline car businesses.

“If an agreement were to be reached, we’d expect an arrangement like Denza (Mercedes-BYD), or VW-JAC, Ford-Zotye to be the most plausible outcome, whereby a new brand is used to sell EVs,” they said in a note, adding that the vehicles could be sold under the Mini brand.

China wants electric and hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of the country’s auto sales by 2025 and plans to loosen joint-venture regulations to achieve its aim.

BMW already has a joint venture in China with local carmaker Brilliance China Automotive Holdings and produces cars at two plants in Shenyang. Shares in Brilliance fell on Wednesday.

“Our business development with the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive will continue as planned, and we will carry on to invest and develop our joint venture.” a spokesman for BMW said, declining to comment on any new joint venture.

The plans were first reported by Shanghai-based www.iautodaily.com earlier on Wednesday.

“I don’t know how far along we have gone nailing this deal,” or whether the two companies have official central government approval for the venture, the BMW executive said.

A Great Wall official declined to comment.

Great Wall, which in August expressed an interest in the Jeep brand of Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV‘s, is one of China’s largest car makers.

Last month it struck a deal to secure supplies of lithium, a mineral key for developing electric vehicles.

The firm’s shares soared as much as 19.2 percent to their highest level in over two years, before paring some gains to stand up 14 percent in afternoon trade. Its Shanghai-listed shares were suspended from trading, pending an announcement.

Brilliance China Automotive’s shares were down 2.76 percent.

Brokerage Jefferies said in a note that it was “understandable that BMW needs a new partner to defend its market share in a more competitive market”, and expected that the move would hit current partner Brilliance.",BMW eyes possible electric vehicle joint venture in China: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-great-wall-bmw/bmw-eyes-possible-electric-vehicle-joint-venture-in-china-sources-idUSKBN1CG0FZ

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) said on Wednesday its third-quarter profit fell less than expected as disruptions caused by hurricanes cost the airline less than some investors had feared, sending its stock up slightly.

The No. 2 U.S. carrier by passenger traffic reported a 6 percent dip in net profit, largely due to a $120 million pretax hit from Hurricane Irma in September, which forced it to cancel flights.

Excluding some items, Delta reported adjusted earnings of $1.57 per share, ahead of analysts’ average expectation of $1.53, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The carrier forecast it would increase its fourth-quarter year-over-year passenger unit revenue by between 2 percent and 4 percent and have an operating margin of between 11 percent and 13 percent.

Its shares were up 0.7 percent at $53.03 on the New York Stock Exchange, their highest since mid-July.

Investors had been worried that the brutal hurricane season, which included three back-to-back storms and resulted in thousands of canceled flights, would have weighed more heavily on the carrier’s profitability.

Of the three storms, Hurricane Irma had the most pronounced effect on Delta’s operations, resulting in 2,200 canceled flights at airports in Florida, the Caribbean and Delta’s hub in Atlanta.

Despite the cancellations, Delta said its quarterly operating revenue rose 5.5 percent to $11.1 billion.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Software produced by Microsoft Corp has been acquired by state organizations and firms in Russia and Crimea despite sanctions barring U.S-based companies from doing business with them, official documents show.

The acquisitions, registered on the Russian state procurement database, show the limitations in the way foreign governments and firms enforce the U.S. sanctions, imposed on Russia over its annexation of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.

Some of the users gave Microsoft fictitious data about their identity, people involved in the transactions told Reuters, exploiting a gap in the U.S. company’s ability to keep its products out of their hands.

The products in each case were sold via third parties and Reuters has no evidence that Microsoft sold products directly to entities hit by the sanctions.

“Microsoft has a strong commitment to complying with legal requirements and we have been looking into this matter in recent weeks,” a Microsoft representative said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters.

“We have robust trade compliance processes around the world to help ensure that our partners comply with all conditions including immediate halting of suspected improper sales by partners, and strong measures to try to prevent banned customers from accessing and using our products and services.”

All state organizations and state firms are obliged to disclose purchases they make on the procurement database. People involved in five of the transactions confirmed to Reuters the software had been acquired.

The Reuters review of the database found state entities in Russia and Crimea that are subject to sanctions have acquired more than 5,000 Microsoft products worth about 60 million rubles ($1.03 million).

The sum is relatively small but such software is vital for many firms and organizations in Russia and Crimea to operate. The database also does not include private companies, so the scale of the problem could be much bigger.

Among entities hit by sanctions that acquired Microsoft products was Almaz-Antey, manufacturer of the BUK surface-to-air missile. Dutch prosecutors say a BUK missile brought down a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet over east Ukraine in July 2014, though Russia denies its forces shot down the plane.

Other Microsoft buyers, the database shows, include Glavgosexpertiza, a state design agency involved in work on a new bridge from Russia to Crimea and the “Krym” health spa in Crimea owned by Russia’s defense ministry.

The arms manufacturer, Almaz-Antey, did not respond to a request for comment. The defense ministry’s health spa in Crimea declined to comment. Glavgosexpertiza said “the company operates within the Russian legal framework”.

One set of U.S. sanctions prohibits the export by a U.S. entity of any goods, services or technology to Crimea.

Other sanctions bar U.S firms from carrying out transactions with companies or individuals on a list of “specially designated nationals” deemed by Washington to be linked to the Russian government and its activities in Ukraine.

Microsoft did not directly respond to detailed questions about specific users of its products and the compliance procedures it has in place.

The products acquired by organizations hit by sanctions include “Open License Program” services, where the user must provide Microsoft with the company’s full name and address.

Almaz-Antey, Glavgosexpertiza and the defense ministry spa acquired “Open License Program” products, the database showed.

After the sanctions were introduced, Microsoft took steps to prevent entities hit by sanctions acquiring its products, according to five sources involved in the software re-selling trade and a former Microsoft employee in Russia.

But people involved in transactions say ways can be found to circumvent obstacles.

The “Morye” shipyard, based in Crimea, bought 150 Windows Server, SQL Server and Office licenses in June 2016 from OOO Web-Potok, a firm registered in Moscow, the procurement database shows. All the products were “Open License Program” services.

The shipyard fell under the general prohibition on transactions by U.S. firms with entities in Crimea and is now on the “special designated nationals” list.

“If we bought directly from Microsoft, there would be sanctions,” a shipyard employee, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said by telephone. “But there were no problems with (buying third-party from) Russian firms.”

The shipyard declined to comment. Reuters called telephone numbers listed for the supplier, OOO Web-Potok, but the people who answered said they worked for a different company.

Another way to circumvent the restrictions on Crimea-based entities is for the user, when registering the product with Microsoft, not to provide a Crimean address, three people involved in the trade said.

They said addresses in Russia’s Krasnodar region, across the Kerch Strait from Crimea, were commonly used instead.

A supplier who worked with a company on the U.S. “specially designated nationals” list said a supplier and a client could circumvent restrictions by registering Microsoft products to a subsidiary or parent company of the end user.","Exclusive: Despite sanctions, Russian organizations acquire Microsoft software",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-russia-microsoft/exclusive-despite-sanctions-russian-organizations-acquire-microsoft-software-idUSKBN1CG0NS?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - European countries are scrambling to cobble together a package of measures they hope will keep the Iran nuclear deal on track if U.S. President Donald Trump ignores their pleas and decertifies the landmark 2015 agreement this week.

The package would include a strong statement backing the deal by European powers, together with efforts to lobby the U.S. Congress and put wider pressure on Iran, officials said.

But without strong U.S. support for the deal, senior officials in Berlin, Paris and London say it may be only a matter of time before the pact between Tehran and six world powers unravels, with grave consequences for Middle East security, nonproliferation efforts and transatlantic ties.

The two-year-old agreement, under which Iran agreed to freeze its nuclear program for 15 years in exchange for sanctions relief, is viewed in Europe as a rare triumph of international diplomacy in the Middle East.

As tensions over North Korea’s nuclear activities risk boiling over into all-out war, any move by the United States to undermine the Iran deal is seen in Europe as utter folly.

European capitals have been delivering this message to the White House and Congress in one of the most intense lobbying campaigns in recent memory. In the past weeks, European ambassadors have met dozens of U.S. lawmakers. And on Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May lobbied Trump by phone.

Despite this, Trump is expected declare this week that Iran is not complying with the pact. He is also due to unveil a tough new strategy toward Iran - including designating its Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization - that could sink the deal.

“If the feeling is the United States no longer supports the agreement then the political reality is that the deal will be in serious jeopardy and its implementation will be very difficult,” a senior French diplomat told Reuters.

A decision by Trump to decertify would not automatically kill the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The expectation is that Trump would kick the ball to Congress, which would then have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions lifted as part of the JCPOA.

THREE-PRONGED RESPONSE

European officials said they were preparing a three-pronged strategy if this does occur.

First, Berlin, London and Paris would issue statements reaffirming their commitment to the deal.

Second, they would redouble efforts to lobby Congress, which appears keen to keep the deal, against any rash moves.

And third, they would present measures to pressure Iran over its ballistic missile program and destabilizing policies in the Middle East -- areas that fall outside the narrowly-focused nuclear deal.

French President Emmanuel Macron alluded to this at the United Nations last month. Diplomats said the package was still in the works and they had not yet briefed Brussels on it.

With the third step, the Europeans hope to build a bridge to Washington while keeping the JCPOA intact. But a German diplomat said ratcheting up pressure on Tehran was like walking a tightrope: push too hard and the whole deal could fall apart.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo

“We all knew the JCPOA wasn’t perfect, but by calling its benefits into question I see us only losing,” said a senior European diplomat who has been involved in negotiations with Iran since 2003, well before Washington joined the talks under President Barack Obama.

If Trump follows through on his threats it will be the second time in four months that he has distanced the United States from a major multilateral agreement despite intense lobbying by partners and members of his own cabinet.

But in Europe, the Iran move would be seen as far more damaging than Trump’s decision in June to pull out of the Paris climate accord.

“The threat from Iran in terms of nuclear proliferation is more immediate. This is far more dangerous,” said Elmar Brok, a veteran foreign policy expert in the European Parliament and party ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

European officials and analysts fear a breakdown of the JCPOA could lead to an arms race in the Middle East, a military conflict between Iran and Israel and an escalation of regional proxy wars between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

They fear it would also doom any chances, no matter how slim, for a negotiated deal with North Korea.

ALL ABOUT WAR

“At the end of the day it’s all about the risk of war,” said Francois Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

There is also the danger of a further deterioration in transatlantic ties, especially if Washington targets European firms that do business in Iran.

Were that to happen, the EU ambassador to Washington, David O‘Sullivan, has said Brussels would revert to a 1990s-era law that shields European companies from extraterritorial sanctions.

Even if the EU were to take such a step, the senior French diplomat said European companies could think twice about their Iran commitments.

Among firms that have announced big deals in Iran since the JCPOA went into force are planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA), French energy group Total (TOTF.PA) and Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE).

“One of the big difficulties of the agreement is ensuring the economic operators have confidence in the system and key to that is confidence in the United States,” the diplomat said.

Any signs that European companies are pulling back could prompt the Iranians to reassess the merits of the nuclear deal.

“The agreement with Iran is like a delicate plant,” said Omid Nouripour, an Iranian-born lawmaker with the German Greens party, which is expected to be part of Merkel’s next coalition government.

“It is a sign of what diplomacy can achieve but it is fragile. The American president doesn’t appear to believe in diplomacy. He seems intent on crushing this plant.”","Fearing Trump torpedo, Europe scrambles to save Iran deal",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CG1Y0

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling bloc could come close to keeping its two-thirds “super” majority in an Oct. 22 lower house election, defying some predictions of substantial losses and solidifying his grip on power, a survey published by the Nikkei business daily on Wednesday showed.

Abe’s conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its more dovish junior partner, the Komeito, are likely to secure more than 290 seats in the 465-seat chamber, the Nikkei said.

The ruling bloc had a two-thirds “super majority” in the lower house before the chamber was dissolved. The number of seats has been cut from 475 as part of electoral reforms.

A strong showing by Abe’s coalition would boost his chances of winning a third term as LDP leader from next September, putting him on track to become Japan’s longest-serving premier.

Abe called the snap election amid confusion in the opposition camp and after an uptick in his ratings, which had been hurt earlier this year by suspected cronyism scandals, in hopes of gaining a fresh mandate after nearly five years in power.

But the outlook has been clouded by the emergence of popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike’s Party of Hope, a fledgling party that the former LDP lawmaker and defense minister calls a reformist, conservative alternative to Abe’s LDP.

The Nikkei said Koike’s party was on track to get around 69 seats, with a forecast range of 46-110.

Another new party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, formed from the liberal wing of the failed opposition Democratic Party, was set to win more than 40 seats, it said.

The Democrats, faced with rock bottom ratings and internal dissension, have said they would run no candidates of their own, freeing many to run on the Party of Hope ticket.

PRO-CONSTITUTION REVISION FORCES

The Asahi newspaper also forecast a strong showing by the ruling bloc, with the LDP set to win well over the 233 seats needed to have a simple majority on its own. It said Koike’s Party of Hope was struggling but was likely to get more than 57 seats. About 40 percent of voters were undecided, the Asahi said.

The Nikkei also forecast that parties in favor of revising the post-war, pacifist constitution - Abe’s long-held goal - were on track to win more than two-thirds.

That includes the LDP and Koike’s Party of Hope as well as another smaller right-leaning party, the Japan Innovation Party.

Amending the constitution, a politically controversial move never yet taken, requires a two-thirds majority in both chambers and a majority in a public referendum.

Koike’s party had raised expectations that it would cut into the LDP’s conservative base. But her decision not to run for a lower house seat herself and refusal to say whom her party would support for premier after the election appears to have eroded the party’s momentum.

Competition among a fragmented opposition, which also includes the Japanese Communist Party, in many districts means the anti-LDP vote could be split, a plus for Abe’s party.

Abe has led the LDP to four landslide wins since he took the helm of the party in 2012, but turnout has been low and the LDP has typically won with about 25 percent of eligible votes. The others either stayed home or backed opposition parties.

The premier has been touting the success of his “Abenomics” recipe of hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and promised structural reforms, while Koike argues that reforms have been too slow in a fast-changing global economy.

The world’s third-largest economy is on track for its longest expansion since World War Two, and the jobless rate was at a 23-year low of 2.8 percent in August while wages are starting to rise a bit. But Abe’s reflationary policies have not yet sparked a sustainable recovery led by the private sector.",Japan PM's ruling bloc seen nearing 2/3 majority in Oct 22 lower house poll: Nikkei,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-election/japan-pms-ruling-bloc-seen-nearing-2-3-majority-in-oct-22-lower-house-poll-nikkei-idUSKBN1CG1VT?il=0

Many expect that the U.S. president will decertify Iranian compliance with the deal -- returning U.S.-Iran relations to a state of overt hostility.

Not all in the administration seem to agree with Trump’s harder-line approach on Iran. Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly stated that Trump “should consider staying” in the deal, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has reportedly argued against decertification. Speaking after his first meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, Tillerson also seemed to indicate a willingness to take a longer-term view when he told a media conference that the Washington-Tehran relationship had “never had a stable, happy moment in it.” ”Is this going to be the way it is for the rest of our lives and our children’s lives and our grandchildren’s lives,” he asked.



Tillerson’s remarks evoked an encounter told to me by Mohsen Rafiqdoost, a former Iranian Revolutionary Guards Commander, of a 1982 meeting he had with Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.

Rafiqdoost recalled suggesting that the U.S. embassy grounds in Tehran be converted to a Revolutionary Guards base. Ayatollah Khomeini rejected the idea, asking “Why would you go there? Are we not going to have relations with America for a thousand years?”

It’s clear that decades of estrangement have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Iran in Washington. Notwithstanding the Obama administration’s nuclear negotiations, every U.S. administration since the 1979 Iranian revolution has failed in its declared objective to contain Iran.

If Trump wishes to free future generations of anxiety over U.S.-Iran tensions, he should pay careful attention to five points in formulating his Iran policy.

Shoppers at the Grand Bazaar in the center of Tehran, Iran, August 2, 2017. Nazanin Tabatabaee Yazdi/TIMA via REUTERS

First, American officials need to stop speaking about Iran in threatening and insulting terms. The Iranian people are proud of their thousands of years of history and above all else view mutual respect as integral to their foreign relations. However, Foreign Minister Zarif told me that Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month was the “most insulting speech of any American president toward Iran since the revolution” and that it “made any potential for dialogue with the United States meaningless.”

Second, U.S. regime-change policies have been self-defeating. The principal reason for lasting Iranian distrust of the United States since the revolution has been U.S. policies aimed at undermining and overturning the Iranian political system. In June, Tillerson openly declared that U.S. policy towards Iran included regime change -- a statement not heard from a senior U.S. official in years and which marked a sharp departure from conventional U.S. rhetoric of seeking Iranian “behavior” change.

In stark contrast, Barack Obama told the UN that “we are not seeking regime change and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy.” Consequently, he was able to diplomatically engage Iran on its nuclear program, and reach the July 2015 nuclear deal. The respectful letters exchanged between Obama and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei helped set the process in motion. This would not happen today even if Trump made a similar overture, as the key to successful negotiations with Iran is to first drop regime-change policies.

Third, since the 1953 U.S.-led coup that overthrew democratically-elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, Iranians have resented U.S. interference in Iran. The political landscape of conservatives, moderates, and reformists in Iran is in many ways similar to the competition between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. As such, any agreement between Washington and Tehran must be negotiated in a way that transcends the partisan divide in each country -- or else it would be inherently fragile. The challenges the nuclear deal has been subject to in Washington by the Republican Party is testament to this need. With respect to Iran too, negotiations must be carried out in a way that respects Iran’s political makeup and hierarchies.

Fourth, the Trump administration needs to accept that Iran, as a large country with immense natural resources and an educated population, has legitimate security concerns and interests in its neighborhood. Washington must recognize that U.S. policies aimed at isolating Tehran and refusing to accept a legitimate Iranian role in the region have only seen Iranian influence grow in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon while U.S. influence wanes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. From Iran’s perspective, its post-1979 foreign policy has been driven by the aim of deterring foreign aggression and securing the country’s borders rather than the pursuit of regional hegemony. After the revolution, Iran was invaded by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and, for much of the past decade, chaos on its thousands of miles of borders with Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan – all factors that have compelled it to play a regional role. If the United States wants to avoid scenarios where regional states aggressively compete for power it must encourage the creation of a regional security system involving the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries along with Iraq and Iran.

Finally, the record of U.S.-Iran negotiations shows that “dual track” policies of pressure and diplomacy are destined to fail. While Trump appears to be trying to bring Iran to the negotiating table in a position of weakness, Iranian policymakers tend to respond to pressure by retaliating in kind.

In a recent Washington Post op-ed, former Secretary of State John Kerry highlighted how by the time he entered into negotiations with Iran, after years of sanctions, Iran had “mastered the nuclear fuel cycle” and built a uranium stockpile large enough to make 10 to 12 bombs. “In other words, Iran was already a nuclear-threshold state,” wrote Kerry.

The lesson for Washington here is that if push comes to shove, Tehran will develop its own bargaining chips --- not capitulate in the face of whatever threats are made when Trump delivers his next policy speech on Iran.",Commentary: A former Iranian diplomat on what Trump needs to know about Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mousavian-iran-commentary/commentary-a-former-iranian-diplomat-on-what-trump-needs-to-know-about-iran-idUSKBN1CE22K

For example, American civilians detained in Iran have often received long and harsh treatment in the past, but when a U.S. Navy crew was captured in Iranian waters last year it was an embarassment, but the sailors were released the next day. NATO allies France and Germany have urged the White House to show restraint, warning that any escalation could further destabilize the region. The U.S. and Iran are backing opposing forces there, but with a mutual enemy: Islamic State. Iran says labelling its forces as terrorists would only aid the jihadists.","'Terrorist' labels for U.S., Iran forces are more than words",https://www.reuters.com/video/2017/10/10/terrorist-labels-for-us-iran-forces-are?videoId=372706388&videoChannel=2602&channelName=Most+Popular

HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s moves to slash reliance on the internal combustion engine signal tough times for the country’s oil majors. A push into new energy vehicles (NEVs) – including battery-powered and hybrid cars – could curb demand for black gold. Sinopec and PetroChina will be hardest hit. The policy will also add to downward pressure on global crude prices.

The People’s Republic is ultimately hoping to outlaw traditional gasoline-fueled cars entirely, cleaning up the air and relieving it of dependence on oil imports. There is no official deadline for the move, but Wang Chuanfu, founder of Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD, reckons the ban could come as early as 2030.

As a battery maker poised to profit from the shift, Wang’s guesstimate is certainly self-interested, and probably wishful thinking. Electric cars accounted for less than 2 percent of China’s market share in 2016, and a bottleneck in battery production will hamper the transition.

But there is no doubting China’s determination to push the pace. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology says NEVS should account for a fifth of auto sales by 2025. As soon as 2019, regulators want automakers to make NEVs at least 10 percent of total sales. That means China’s $440 billion retail fuel market is in for a bumpy ride.

GIANT PROBLEM

Sinopec will be hit hardest. Gasoline sales made up around a quarter of total revenue at the group’s listed unit China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation in 2016, and the energy giant runs almost a third of the country’s 100,000 or so service stations. These hubs boast more than 23,000 convenience stores, a valuable sideline. Non-fuel sales could grow by as much as 25.5 percent a year in the period 2016 to 2019, according to research by brokerage CLSA. There are plans to launch a Hong Kong IPO for the group’s marketing unit, but the outlook has clouded of late. There is no public prospectus, and the offering – expected to raise around $12 billion – now looks unlikely to materialize this year.

PetroChina will feel the pinch too. It controls some 20,000 petrol stations, and sold more than 62 million tonnes of gasoline last year, worth about 357 billion yuan at 2016 prices. PetroChina is slightly less dependent on refining than Sinopec – gasoline sales made up roughly a fifth of revenues. However, investors appreciate the higher margins the company earns from refining and other downstream operations when oil prices are subdued, as they are now.

If one fifth of auto sales are absorbed by the NEV market in 2025 as planned - assuming China hits its target of 35 million units sold that year - that would rob gas stations of 7 million automobiles, enough cars to support the equivalent of 3,500 gas stations, according to a conservative Breakingviews calculation.

When combined with new environmental and industrial policies, a successful EV push could make a real dent in long-term global oil demand. Absent government intervention, S&P projects China’s oil consumption would probably balloon to 41 million barrels of oil a day by 2050, compared to 10.9 million barrels a day in 2015. On the other hand, if Beijing manages to meet all its ambitious published targets for electric vehicles, emissions reductions and industrial efficiency upgrades, oil demand would attain barely half those levels, the study shows. Sinopec, PetroChina, and even upstream operator CNOOC could be vulnerable.

TRICKY MANEUVER

There is time to plan. It might be decades before the fleet of combustion engines actually shrinks. Even so the big Chinese players are already looking to diversify. Downstream operators might recalibrate refineries to focus on petrochemical products like plastics, while pushing further into natural gas. Sinopec says it is exploring geothermal energy and biomass, too. Offshore markets could help as well; exports of gasoline and diesel from Chinese refineries have been rising for the past few years.

Another strategy might be restructuring the retail business to accommodate electric vehicles. Perhaps the gigantic network of service stations could be converted into charging stations; drivers waiting for cars to charge, or swapping batteries, might shop at the convenience stores too. Sinopec is working with State Grid to offer charging services, state-backed China Daily reported earlier this year. Unfortunately in these areas the oil incumbents have little or no advantage over other competitors. Gas stations aren’t particularly convenient places to recharge compared to, say, parking lots.

Whichever route they take, energy conglomerates will still enjoy massive financial scale and unparalleled influence in the halls of government. It seems unlikely Beijing will stand aside and let them collapse. Even so, investors will watch closely to see if the oil majors can shift gears before it’s too late.",Breakingviews - China’s oil giants brace for electric car crash,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-oil-giants-brace-for-electric-car-crash-idUSKBN1CE06W

The government proposes spending an additional 15 billion euros on training over five years, with employers saying they cannot fill vacancies despite a jobless rate of close to 10 percent, higher than in many European countries.

President Emmanuel Macron also wants to bring the national unemployment insurance fund, currently jointly run by unions and employers, under the state’s control.

Macron, a former banker whose other labor market reform plans have been condemned by some trade union leaders as a deathknell for high French standards of labor protection, wants to make a professional training program less bureaucratic.

He also wants the state to have more say over how much the unemployed get in benefits and for how long, which is currently largely set by unions and employers,

On Thursday the government is due to open talks with union leaders before deciding how to overhaul training and unemployment insurance.

Training is already funded to the tune of some 30 billion euros annually, financed in part by a levy on wage-earners, but is widely criticized for not benefiting workers that need it most.

Meanwhile, unions and employers are protective of their decades-old grip over the unemployment insurance benefits system worth billions of euros.

Macron angered unionists last week with comments he made during a visit to a car parts factory, where scuffles erupted between police and workers protesting over job losses.

“Instead of kicking up a bloody mess, some of them would be better off going to see if they can get a job over there,” he said, alluding to vacancies that a nearby aluminum factory was battling to fill.

Opponents accused Macron of showing contempt toward the workforce.

Nonetheless, business owners say the skills gap is a problem.

“We just can’t get people into factories,” Pierre Tisseau, whose company makes house terraces in Cholet in western France, told Reuters.

Tisseau said he hoped reforms to professional training would help him fill vacancies he has struggled to plug since 2008.

The local branch of the Medef business federation in Cholet said 9,000 people were looking for work but that firms were finding it hard to fill 1,500 vacancies in sectors such as construction, transport and the agri-foods.

Macron defied street protests led by the Communist Party-rooted CGT union to drive through employment law reforms that critics say will weaken collective bargaining and give more power to companies to set out work conditions.","After 'bloody mess' jab, Macron eyes training, job insurance reform",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-reform-training/after-bloody-mess-jab-macron-eyes-training-job-insurance-reform-idUSKBN1CG1Y8?il=0

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As President Donald Trump promotes a tax plan critics say would raise the federal deficit by slashing corporate rates and eliminating some taxes paid by the rich, some three quarters of Americans believe the wealthiest should pay more, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows.

Trump is expected to travel on Wednesday to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he will explain to a group of workers, including many truckers, how he believes they will benefit from his tax plan released two weeks ago.

The president is expected to describe how, if his plan became law, truckers would benefit from proposals to lower tax rates for the middle class, cut taxes paid by the manufacturers whose products they transport, create a new tax category and rate for “pass-through” companies, and eliminate a tax paid by the wealthiest 0.2 percent of estates, a senior administration official said.

Trump has said his tax plan would be a “miracle for the middle class” and spur economic growth by creating a better tax climate for businesses. He is expected to tell the truckers that his tax plan “would likely give the typical American household a $4,000 pay raise,” according to an excerpt from his prepared remarks.

White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett has said that if U.S. companies brought foreign-earned profits home, the median household would see their real income rise by $4,000 over the next eight years.

“I have not seen any evidence that even comes remotely close to that,” Richard Neal, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Mean Committee, said of the calculation at a forum on Wednesday in Washington.

Independent analysts have said Trump’s blueprint would provide uneven tax relief, add to the federal budget deficit and, in some cases, benefit the very wealthy.

Taxpayers in the highest 1 percent of incomes, making more than $730,000 annually, for example, would receive about half of the total tax benefit from Trump’s proposed overhaul, with their after-tax income expected to increase an average of 8.5 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based nonprofit.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from Sept. 29 to Oct. 5 found that 53 percent of adults “strongly agree” that the wealthiest Americans should pay higher tax rates.

An additional 23 percent “somewhat agree” the wealthiest should pay higher tax rates, according to the poll of 1,504 people, which had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of plus or minus 6 percentage points.

Trump’s tax framework proposed cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and creating a new category for pass-through income earned by partners and sole proprietors, which would be taxed at 25 percent, instead of the 39.6 percent top individual rate currently paid by some.

It also proposed cutting the top individual rate to 35 percent, but the congressional tax-writing committees fleshing out Trump’s plan may opt to create an additional, higher rate for the highest earners.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Three men blew themselves up near the police headquarters in central Damascus on Wednesday, the second such attack to hit the Syrian capital this month, state media said.

The blasts killed two people and injured six others, it said, citing the Interior Ministry.

Two suicide bombers tried to storm the police command center and clashed with guards before detonating explosive devices outside on Khalid bin al-Walid street, the Damascus police chief said on state TV.

Police forces then chased down the third attacker, who blew himself up nearby at the entrance of a clothes market.

“Our investigations are ongoing to find out where they came from and how,” Mohammad Kheir Ismail said from outside the headquarters. “The issue has been controlled.”

Islamic State’s media unit Amaq reported the attack without outright claiming responsibility for it.

Earlier this month, militants struck a police station in another part of Damascus, with 17 reported dead in that suicide bombing which Islamic State claimed.

The capital has enjoyed relative security as Syria’s six-year war has raged on nearby and across the country. But several such attacks have hit Damascus in recent years, including a car bomb that killed 20 people in July.

Islamic State and Tahrir al-Sham - led by militants formerly linked to al Qaeda - have each claimed separate suicide blasts that killed scores of people in Damascus before.

“The desperate suicide attempts come as a response to the victories of the Syrian Arab Army and the Interior Ministry is fully ready to thwart any terrorist act,” state television quoted the minister as saying.

With the help of Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, the Damascus government has pushed back rebels in western Syria, shoring up its rule over the main urban centers. In recent months, it has also marched eastwards against Islamic State.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to dramatically increase the country’s nuclear arsenal, he said in a meeting with his national security advisers in July, NBC News reported on Wednesday, citing three officials who were present in the room.

Trump’s reported comments come as tensions remained high with North Korea and as Trump is expected to make an announcement on whether to decertify the international deal surrounding Iran’s nuclear program.

The president spoke on July after he was shown a chart indicating the stockpile of U.S. nuclear weapons had slid from a high of 32,000 in the 1960s. Trump said he wanted to have that same number now, NBC reported.

The United States currently has about 4,000 nuclear warheads earmarked for use in its military stockpile, according to the Federation of American Scientists.

In a post on Twitter on Wednesday, the president said, “Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a ‘tenfold’ increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction, made up to demean. NBC = CNN!”

Trump said in an interview with Reuters in February that he wanted to ensure that the U.S. nuclear arsenal was at the “top of the pack.”

Although U.S. presidents have modernized weapons stockpiles over the years, adding to the nuclear arsenal or building a prohibited type of weapon would be a violation of treaty agreements, according to NBC.

After the meeting, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson referred to Trump as a “moron,” according to NBC. U.S. news reports have painted the relationship between Trump and Tillerson as tense.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A San Diego children’s hospital unveiled a collection of remote controlled luxury mini cars on Tuesday that allow its young patients to ‘drive’ themselves to the operating room.

The cars at the Rady Children’s Hospital are actually operated by a nurse or a doctor, and are part of a new program designed to make children more relaxed before their procedures.

“The kids are having fun. The parents are seeing that they’re relaxed and that they’re happy,” said Dr. Daniela Carvalho, medical director of surgical services at the hospital.

路透10月11日 - “埃及遍地必来七个大丰年，随后又要来七个荒年，甚至埃及地都忘了先前的丰收。”

圣经中，约瑟这样解读法老梦到的七头肥美的牛和七头干瘦的牛，但他可能也是在说油市。(创世纪第41章29-30节)

就像尼罗河是否泛滥决定法老的王国经历丰足还是饥馑一样，油市也在供应的短缺与过剩之间反复。

“油市的问题总是(供应)不是太多就是太少，”纽约大学经济学教授Myron Watkins在80年前写道(石油：稳定还是保护？ Watkins, 1937)。

古埃及食物供应的充足或短缺交替出现，但很少有“刚好够用”的时候，因此埃及用谷仓来储存丰年的多余供应，以备歉收时使用。

油市也把供应过剩时的库存留到供应不足时使用，油价也随之有规律地从正价差转至逆价差。

油市的自然状态不是刚刚够用，正好像埃及食物供应的自然状态也不是刚好够用。

石油输出国组织(OPEC)和包括我自己在内的其他评论人士都把限产和降低过剩库存的过程看做是市场“恢复平衡”的一环。

将调节石油生产、消费及库存的一整套复杂过程，以“再平衡”简称，虽然很便利，但这并不代表整个过程的终点就是一个“平衡”的油市。

油市很少平衡，更从来没能长期维持平衡。

在以往，油市出现一些供应过剩及正价差时期后，很快就回到供应短缺和逆价差时期。

图表：reut.rs/2kFtoix

目前看来正在上演类似的情况，布兰特及其他国际原油品种原本从2014年年中以来皆维持正价差，但在过去三个月转为逆价差。

多数分析师已开始担心重新出现供应过剩、原油库存恢复上升、以及石油输出国组织(OPEC)及其盟友2018年将如何退出现行的限产协议。

但仍存在的一个可能是，当石油需求强劲成长时，油市正要进入供应短缺时期，供应步伐将落后，而石油库存将紧俏。

**正向反馈**

油价很少能够平顺地适应石油产量或消费的变动(“Essentials of petroleum: a key to oil economics”, Frankel, 1946)。

石油产量、消费、库存、及油价之间的关系，具有循环因果或反馈过程特色(“Cybernetics, or command and control in the animal and the human”, Wiener, 1948)。

其中一些过程促进油市稳定，并倾向于抑制最初干扰(“负反馈”)，但是其他过程则破坏稳定，并且倾向于放大初始冲击(“正反馈”)。

正反馈过程可能在中短期内造成市况极其不稳。2014至2016年油市下滑期间，正反馈使得跌势更加严重并延迟了再平衡。

例如在供应方面，油价下跌导致劳动力、原材料和服务合同的价格下降，抑制了生产商对价格下降的反应(tmsnrt.rs/2xxifGQ)。

在需求方面，产油国的经济衰退，以及钻井活动萧条和全球货运放缓，都大大降低了石油消耗，尤其是柴油，结果加剧了供应过剩。

但正反馈是把双刃剑，正如它可以加深和拉长跌势，同样也可能加快和放大涨势。

油市再平衡可能会推动成本上涨，产油国的消费增长加快，以及货运活动加速成长。

在原油市场，就像法老治下的埃及一样，一切往往都同时正确(或者错误)，在商品周期内造成剧烈波动。

**上涨要素**

2018和2019年油市周期性好转的所有要素都已齐备。

全球主要经济体都在经历近十年来最强劲同步扩张，世界贸易量的增长速度也创下2011年以来最快。

全球整体经济扩张加上相对较低的油价，促成了石油需求激增，令过去三年的石油消费增速快于长期均值水平。

根据国际能源署(IEA)的数据，全球石油消费量在2017年预估将增加160万桶/日，2016年和2015年的消费增幅则分别为130万桶/日和190万桶/日。

IEA的9月报告称，预计2018年全球石油消费进一步增加140万桶/日。

受强劲需求和沙特限制供应的影响，全球原油和油品库存正在迅速下降。

库存虽然仍高于五年均值，但正在向五年均值靠拢。考虑到2012年以来惊人的消费增长，五年均值的水平终究可能还是过低。

关键的问题在于，石油生产商将以多快的速度对需求增强和石油库存趋紧做出回应。

由于大多数生产方已经接近100%的全产能运营，因此未来两年的产出增长将主要来自于沙特阿拉伯(和其亲密盟友科威特)、内乱冲突迭起的非洲，或是美国页岩油生产商。

沙特拥有闲置产能，但该国在增加市场供应前，会希望先看到油价走高，特别是在沙特阿美部分资产临近上市之际。

尼日利亚和利比亚也拥有闲置产能，但国内安全形势堪忧，使得两国未来增产存在很大的不确定性。

美国页岩油生产商也可以提高产量，但他们的成本正在升高，股东也越来越要求他们侧重于提高回报而非增加产量。

**接下来会怎样？**

2018/19年油市可能出现的景象如下：

* 如果OPEC减产协议执行率下降、美国页岩油产量又迅速增加，超过了需求增长，那么油价涨势和逆价差可能会消失。

* 如果OPEC顺利退出减产协议，页岩油产量增长追平需求增长，那么油价和日历价差可能将继续区间盘整。

* 如果消费增长超过供应，而且库存持续下降，那么至少油价会进一步上涨，逆价差也会扩大。

许多分析师和交易商的预期带有追溯性质，假设未来将重演刚刚发生的景象，所以他们往往会错过转折点。

2011-2014年繁荣期后，市场预期过于乐观，因此许多分析师和交易商没有料到跌势已经迫近，之后还低估了下跌的幅度和持续时间。

但在这次大跌后市场预期或许已经变得过于悲观，交易商目前低估了油市反弹的前景。

当然，考虑到页岩油生产商和OPEC顺利进行调整以满足需求增长，油市总是有可能拥有充足供应。

It warned an “inevitable” AI arms race could prove as revolutionary as the invention of nuclear weapons.","Russia’s latest “Zapad” military exercise is underway on NATO’S eastern border. Tens of thousands of soldiers are taking part in the massive four-yearly war games that are both a drill as well as a show of strength for the West. Next time around, in 2021, those troops might be sharing their battle space with a different type of force: self-driving drones, tanks, ships and submersibles.

Drone warfare is hardly new – the first lethal attack conducted by an American unmanned aerial vehicle took place in Afghanistan in October 2001. What is now changing fast, however, is the ability of such unmanned systems to operate without a guiding human hand.

That’s a truly revolutionary shift – and one every major nation wants to be lead. Critics have long feared countries might be more willing to go to war with unmanned systems. Now, some see a very real risk control might pass beyond human beings altogether.

Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has long warned that humanity might be on the verge of some cataclysmic errors when it comes to artificial intelligence. Last month, he ramped that up with a warning that the development of autonomous weapons platforms might provoke a potentially devastating arms race.

As if to reinforce Musk’s point, Russian President Vladimir Putin told students shortly thereafter that he believed the technology would be a game changer, making it clear Russia would plow resources into it. “The one who becomes leader in this will become ruler of the world,” Putin was quoted as saying.

China too is pushing ahead, believed by some experts to now be the global leader when it comes to developing autonomous swarms of drones.

Already, drones are able to fly themselves independently so they can stay airborne if they lose touch with human pilots. Soon they may be able to make their own tactical decisions. At Georgia Tech in the United States this summer, researchers programmed swarms of light drones to fight their own aerial dogfights. The U.S. military is trying out similar products.

That means one operator could command many, many more drones – or that they might not need direct supervision at all.

Even more important than what is happening in robotics may be the wider developments in artificial intelligence. That won’t make warfare necessarily more deadly – a bomb dropped from a drone is not in itself less lethal than one from a manned aircraft. While it’s possible that greater accuracy might reduce casualties, some analysts fear that the changes brought by new unmanned systems might themselves fuel new conflicts.

“Radical technological change begets radical government policy ideas,” concluded a July report on the topic produced for the U.S. intelligence community by Harvard University’s Belfer Center. It warned an “inevitable” AI arms race could prove as revolutionary as the invention of nuclear weapons.

Artificial intelligence could dramatically increase the efficiency of surveillance technology, allowing a single system to monitor perhaps millions of digital conversations, hacked personal devices and other sources of information. The implications could be terrifying, particularly in the hands of a state with little or no democratic oversight.

At a recent UK panel discussion, Britain’s former Special Forces director Lieutenant General Sir Graeme Lamb predicted that by 2030, technological breakthroughs – not just AI, but quantum computing and beyond – would produce entirely unpredictable changes. Special force teams, he suggested, might well have a robotic and artificial intelligence component deployed alongside them – the U.S. Army calls this “manned-unmanned teaming.”

That sounds like something out of science fiction – and it might well look like it. Last year, Russia unveiled its FEDOR humanoid military robot, which it demonstrated firing a gun.

Most countries deliberately keep their defense AI secret, ultimately fueling the arms race Musk was warning about. Some scientists already worry about a real-world version of the premise for the Arnold Schwarzenegger-starring “Terminator” film franchise in which the United States, fearing cyber attack, hands control of key military systems to the artificial intelligence Skynet. (Skynet, fearing its human creators might choose to turn it off, immediately launches a full-scale nuclear attack on humanity.)

For now, Western nations at least look keen to keep a human in the “kill chain.” Not all countries may make that choice, however. Russia has long had a reputation for trusting machines more than people, at one stage considering – and, some evidence suggests, building – an automated system to launch its nuclear arsenal should its command structure be destroyed by a first strike.

Outside of the military, there is evidence AI algorithms have already alarmed their creators. In August, Facebook shut down an AI experiment after programs involved began communicating with each other in a language the humans monitoring them could not understand.

Is this the end for ordinary human soldiering? Almost certainly not. It’s even been argued that a more complex, high-tech battlefield might require more soldiers, not fewer.

Robotic systems may be vulnerable to hacking, jamming and simply rendered inoperable through electronic warfare. Such techniques allow U.S.-led forces in Iraq to largely negate the off-the-shelf drones being used by Islamic State. Russia used similar techniques against Western-made drones in Ukraine.

That’s a worry for armed forces betting – like many industries – on automation. Britain’s new aircraft carrier has only a fraction of the sailors on its only slightly larger U.S. carrier counterparts, relying heavily on automatic systems to manage weaponry and damage control. The latest Russian tank, the T-14 Armata, has an automated turret that will usually be out of reach to most of its crew. Such techniques have clear advantages – but also mean that interfering with electronics could leave them useless.

Such technology is coming whether it is a good idea or not. Indeed, even relatively old military equipment increasingly can be retrofitted. Russian engineers have already demonstrated that they can adapt the 20-year-old T-90 tank to be controlled remotely.

Ironically, the North Korean crisis reminds us that the most dangerous technologies may well remain those invented more than 70 years ago – atomic weapons and the missiles that carry them. Even if mankind can avoid a nuclear apocalypse, however, the coming AI and robotic revolution may prove an equal existential challenge.",Commentary: The coming robot arms race,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-robots-commentary/commentary-the-coming-robot-arms-race-idUSKCN1BT1XN

With post-Maria Puerto Rico the latest example of that trope, it’s time for a better understanding of how disaster management works.

A disaster destroys in hours infrastructure that took decades to build. Millions of people lose the services that separate a middle-class suburb from an impoverished slum – clean water, sewers, power, hospitals, roads. And Maria was the strongest storm to strike the area in 80 years.

Meanwhile, the media tends to focus on drama and controversy. They often overplay the story via anecdotal reporting (“Here’s Mrs. Hernandez without electricity,” says the reporter [pause], “with no help in sight”) and underplay the work being done, especially at the beginning of the response where progress is hard to see. First responders on laptops methodically solving supply problems are not very mediagenic, after all.

At the moment of any disaster, needs are at 100 percent while the response is at a zero point. The response starts in deficit. It always looks grim, especially to participants and outside observers unfamiliar with the process. They want what is a marathon to play out like a sprint.

In dealing with a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military follow a standard playbook. I know, I worked with both on and off for two decades while with the State Department. I trained with them, and was on the ground for relief efforts after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (more than 6,000 dead) and 2004 Asian tsunami (280,000 dead.) I worked the Washington DC-end of many other disasters. I read after-action reporting from 20-30 other such events.

The critical initial step is a needs assessment, from which everything else flows. Everyone wants to jump in and do something, but responders need time to visit sites, confer with local officials, and determine what is needed and where the needs are greatest. It is a slow process in a chaotic environment, delayed by weather, roads, and communications. From the outside it can look like nothing is being done; Mrs. Hernandez still doesn’t have electricity even as helicopters are flying around, apparently ignoring her!

The needs assessment gets the right help to the right places in order of priority. As an example, I was part of a liaison team with the American Navy at Phuket, Thailand following the Asian tsunami of 2005. Without any local input, the U.S. first helicopters brought in huge fresh water bladders. It turned out most of the water was unneeded; the city had warehouses full of the bottled version.

It took a day for us to track down, but the most urgent need the Navy could address was a buildup of medical waste at local hospitals. Waste pre-disaster was trucked out daily; the tsunami wrecked the roads, and so boxes of soiled bandages and infected sharps accumulated. When American resources turned to help dispose of that, hospitals were able to run at peak capacity. Lives were saved. The water bladders lay abandoned in parking lots around town.

Other decisions that can flow from a needs assessment might include restoring power to one school to shelter 50 families before fixing 50 individual homes. It can mean blocking people from calling internationally so limited cell capacity can be directed to local emergency calls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, set as a priority reopening dialysis centers across Puerto Rico. Somebody else didn’t get helped first to make that possible.

At the early-to-intermediate stages of a disaster response people in less affected areas will wait in long lines for supplies. It looks bad on TV, but can actually mean the system is working, as help was directed to a higher priority. It takes good reporting to know if that’s the case. Instead, progress is often too quickly defined as “make everything back to the way it was before the storm.”

The military plays a key role in disaster response. The problem is Americans are conditioned to believe there are unlimited resources of all types, instantly movable across notable distances.

Military units tend to have war fighting as their primary job, and most are somewhere doing that, or training to do that. Shifting to a disaster mission can happen quickly but not instantly. It’s also essential to gather people with the right skills – electrical engineers, teams that desalinate sea water for drinking, and sewage crews (3.4 million people’s waste festering with fecal-borne disease is a dreaded secondary killer in this disaster.)

Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant. Unlike Texas or Florida, no one can self-evacuate, by car or even on foot. Same for incoming aid. Everything must travel by plane, or, more likely, ship.

Puerto Ricans now need some two million gallons of fresh water a day. A gallon weighs about eight pounds, so that’s 16 million pounds of water. A C-130 cargo plane can carry some 42,000 pounds. So that’s 380 flights a day, every day, just for water. There are bigger aircraft, but the bottom line is always the same: you simply have to move the epic quantities required to respond to an epic island disaster by ship to a port, then inland by truck.

That last step, moving supplies from a port (or airport) to those who need them is known as the “last mile” problem. It haunts every disaster response.

Success with the last mile depends on local infrastructure. If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response. Next comes the need for trucks, fuel for those trucks, drivers, security, and personnel and equipment to offload the ships and load the vehicles. If you’re missing one link in the chain, the aid does not move.

These are tough realities, not excuses for why more hasn’t been done for desperate people. It can be a complex, methodical process, addressing a single problem (get water to that village) as a cascading string of nested problems. While the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s remark that Puerto Rico relief is the “most logistically challenging event” the United States has ever faced seems exaggerated, it does underscore the size of the job at hand.

So don’t be distracted by the apocalyptic tweets between Trump and his critics; they exist independent of the ground truth. Because while no response is ever fast and robust enough, the systemic breakdowns that hit New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have largely been fixed, well-before Trump even took office.

Responses are always imperfect; lack of drinking water remains a critical issue. The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas. For Harvey, the death toll was at least 70, Irma 72. Katrina saw 1,836 fatalities with over 700 people still missing.

But a tipping point will take place, where adequate services are restored and people will start to receive the help they need. Problems will reduce from regions without power to villages without power to an isolated home without power. The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico. Everything else right now seems to be just Twitter wars.","Commentary: For hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, an insider’s guide to disaster management",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-disaster-commentary/commentary-for-hurricane-hit-puerto-rico-an-insiders-guide-to-disaster-management-idUSKCN1C805X

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer resumed their battle for the year-end number one ranking with imperious victories to reach the third round of the Shanghai Masters on Wednesday.

Top seed Nadal extended his winning streak to 13 matches with a 6-2 6-1 demolition of American Jared Donaldson in the Qi Zhong Stadium before world number two Federer, to the delight of his sizeable Chinese fan club, got the better of Argentina’s Diego Schwartzman 7-6(4) 6-4.

Nadal, who leads Federer by 2,370 points going into the home straight of a season in which the two old rivals have shared out the game’s biggest prizes, was unstoppable against Donaldson and needed only 54 minutes to prevail.

“It was a very quick match in all aspects,” Nadal, bidding to end a year on top for the fourth time in his career, said.

”If the year-end ranking happens, it will be, I think, a very important achievement for me.

“With so many years of difference I think it’s something very difficult. But there remains work to do.”

He last finished the year as world number one in 2013.

Federer shows no sign of giving up the chase but had to battle hard against Schwartzman -- letting slip a break in the first set to get dragged into a tiebreak.

The 36-year-old Swiss always had an extra shot in his locker though and, having taken the opener, broke serve straight away in the second set to move toward victory.

YANGON (Reuters) - Rohingya Muslim villagers cut off from food and threatened by Buddhist neighbours in Myanmar’s violence-racked Rakhine state received their first substantial food supplies in months on Wednesday after international pressure on the government to help.

Diplomats and aid groups called on the government to step in after Reuters exclusively reported the dire situation faced by thousands of Rohingya Muslims trapped in the villages of Ah Nauk Pyin and Nyaung Pin Gyi last month.

“A boat arrived yesterday evening with rice bags and six Red Cross staff came to our village this morning,” Maung Maung, an administrator in the riverside Rohingya village of Ah Nauk Pyin, told Reuters by telephone.

He said it was the first time in three months that significant supplies of food had been delivered to the village.

“The aid arrived just as we’re starving,” he said.

Fragile relations between the Rohingya villagers and their ethnic Rakhine Buddhist neighbours were shattered on Aug. 25, when deadly attacks by Rohingya militants prompted a ferocious response from Myanmar’s security forces.

Rights groups say ethnic Rakhine Buddhists have joined in attacks on Rohingya, and the residents of Ah Nauk Pyin told Reuters in mid-September they had been threatened by Buddhists and they had pleaded with authorities for safe passage out.

The state government told them to stay put.

More than half a million Rohingya villagers have fled to Bangladesh to escape what the United Nations has called a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing” aimed at pushing the Rohingya out of the country for good.

Myanmar dismisses that. It says it is fighting a legitimate campaign against Rohingya “terrorists”.

Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya remain in Rakhine, many in fear of their security and facing growing hunger as food supplies dwindle, partly because of restrictions on the trade and movement of rice.

‘SUPPORT FOR ALL’

Minister for Relief and Resettlement Win Myat Aye, who is leading the government response to the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Rakhine, confirmed that the aid had arrived in Ah Nauk Pyin.

He said the government would support all vulnerable people.

“We’ll support these people continuously, until they can stand on their own feet,” he said. “Nobody wants to rely on aid all their lives.”

After Reuters reported on the plight of Ah Nauk Pyin, and the nearby village of Nyaung Pin Gyi, Myanmar-based diplomats had asked to visit on a government-organised trip to Rakhine state last week.

The itinerary of the trip mentioned the Reuters report.

Win Myat Aye has been to Ah Nauk Pyin several times with Rakhine state government officials, and has promised to protect the residents.

Myanmar has restricted access to Rakhine for most aid agencies, despite growing international calls for humanitarian groups to be allowed in to help.

Aid is being organised by three Red Cross organisations - the Myanmar Red Cross, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

The aid to the 600 families of Ah Nauk Pyin delivered on Wednesday included rice, oil, beans, salt, sugar and tinned fish for a month.

Residents of the other Rohingya village, Nyaung Pin Gyi, said they had not been visited and had yet to get any aid but ICRC communications official Khin Htay Oo said Nyaung Pin Gyi would get food aid on Tuesday.

“We help all people affected by the conflict, we do not take sides based on race or religion,” she said.",Trapped Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar get first substantial food aid in months,https://in.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya-villages/trapped-rohingya-muslims-in-myanmar-get-first-substantial-food-aid-in-months-idINKBN1CG1IT

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Trouble erupted in Dantal village near the India-Pakistan border on Sept. 27, when a Hindu priest accused folk singer Ahmad Khan of making mistakes while reciting hymns to evoke a Hindu goddess.

Khan, 45, was a member of the Langa Manganiyar community that has been singing Hindu religious songs and spiritual verses in temples and at festivals for generations. The priest suggested changes to the hymn, leading to an argument.

Police said the priest, Ramesh Suthar, and his friends then broke Khan’s musical instruments and killed him.

“The news of the murder triggered unrest between Hindus and Muslims who have been living together for generations,” said Gaurav Yadav, a senior police officer investigating the case.

He did not say how Khan was killed, but said Suthar had been arrested. The priest’s accomplices had fled, Yadav said.

Two of Suthar’s family members said he was in shock and refused to talk about the case.

Government authorities had sent paramilitary forces to the area but the Muslims, fearing clashes, refused to return home.

“For one small mistake the Hindus killed my brother,” said Rakha Khan, the dead singer’s cousin. “We can’t live in the same village ever again.”

Rakha Khan said they had sought refuge in a school and that the state government office and other local authorities were providing them with food.

The attack is the latest in a series of incidents targeting the minority Muslim community in states ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party.

Since his Bharatiya Janata Party came to power in 2014, hardline Hindu groups and cow protection vigilantes have carried out numerous attacks on Muslims accused of eating beef or killing cows.

REUTERS/Steve Crisp

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - There’s no such thing as a founder who goes quietly. Weinstein Co, the film studio that ousted one of its two eponymous brothers amid sexual-harassment allegations, now joins other companies like Fox News and Uber that parted company with influential bosses who misbehaved, or stood idly by while others did. There’s dual risk, both from what the departing founder takes away and what they leave behind.

Harvey Weinstein’s exit followed charges that the executive producer of “The King’s Speech” and “Django Unchained” settled with women who claimed he sexually harassed them over three decades. Weinstein initially responded with a statement pledging to conquer his demons, and flagging up the culture of the 60s and 70s when rules were “different”. His private production company’s board pushed him out anyway.

After the purge comes the refurb. This is always more intricate when the departing boss is a founder. Think about Uber, whose prime mover Travis Kalanick was pushed out by investors concerned by the frat-boy behaviour of company managers. The ride-hailing app has now limited Kalanick’s remaining shareholder powers, appointed a clean-cut new chief, and brought in a new investor, SoftBank.

A deep clean is also still under way at Twenty-First Century Fox, where the controlling Murdoch family had to step in and fix its TV station’s culture after late founder Roger Ailes was purged amid a sexual-harassment scandal.

Weinstein Co will face two familiar problems. Influential industry figures perpetuate internal ways of operating that tend to outlive them. Like Uber’s Kalanick or Dov Charney, the ousted founder of failed fashion chain American Apparel, Weinstein grew out of an industry with a reputation for poor treatment of women. Things may change – and scandals help – but only glacially.

The other problem is that founders can take away the spark or contacts that helped their firms in the first place. Weinstein Co will be run by the other brother, Bob, and Chief Operating Officer David Glasser while an internal investigation proceeds. But will it be as effective without its formative double act? Such uncertainties may explain why boards often miss the moment when a founders’ comportment goes from a foible to a liability.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s pound steadied on Wednesday, holding just above a one-month low hit as investors grew concerned on whether entrenched expectations of higher UK interest rates were reasonable given a backdrop of uncertain Brexit negotiations.

Noises around Brexit negotiations grew louder after finance minister Philip Hammond declared the government was planning for all possibilities, including Britain’s leaving with no agreement on the terms of its departure.

However, that had little impact on sterling with the currency hemmed in tight trading ranges as investors worried that a sharp turnaround in sterling in the currency markets to net long positions may come under pressure.

David Cheetham, the chief market analyst for XTB trading, warned that the high levels of speculative positioning risked weakening the pound.

“Recent events are unlikely to cause major downside for sterling on their own but they are weighing on the pound, and the alarming frequency with which they are occurring only increases the chances of another major political blow for the market,” he said.

Sterling GBP=D3 was broadly flat at $1.3195 after two sessions of gains. It briefly hit a day's low of $1.3176 after Hammond's comments.

Strategists said the speech had only minimal impact with markets more focused on the strong data this week and broad expectations of interest rate hikes baked into the currency markets.

“I don’t think Hammond’s speech about a ‘no deal’ is a major factor. Actions speak louder than words to the market. There has been virtually no practical preparation of a ‘no deal’ scenario,” said Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at Societe Generale.

Despite falling projections for British economic growth, futures markets are pricing in 50 basis points of Bank of England rate increases over the next year IRPR, the most in the developed world apart from Canada.

But the outlook appeared fragile, with some market watchers including such as Morgan Stanley preferring to sell sterling on rallies on Brexit worries.

(Reuters) - Uruguay, Argentina and Colombia qualified for next year’s World Cup on Tuesday after a dramatic last round of South American fixtures that also saw Peru clinch a playoff spot against New Zealand and Chile miss out completely.

Brazil were fortunate enough to escape most of the drama, having already qualified as group winners, but they still had a say in who would join them in Russia next year.

Argentina, finalists three years ago but outside the four qualifying spots going into their match in Ecuador, fell behind in the first minute but a Lionel Messi hat-trick guaranteed his side one of the three automatic berths still up for grabs.

“Luckily, we reacted quickly after Ecuador scored,” Messi said after the celebrations in Quito had died down following Argentina’s 3-1 win. “Thank God, we fulfilled our objective.”

Uruguay also went behind at home to Bolivia, to an own goal from Gaston Silva after 24 minutes, but they forged ahead with two goals in each half to finish second in the 10-team group behind five-time World Cup winners Brazil.

Martin Caceres, Edinson Cavani and two Luis Suarez strikes gave the home side a commanding lead before Diego Godin’s own goal completed the scoring in a 4-2 win for the hosts.

Peru, unbeaten in their last six qualifiers under Argentina manager Ricardo Gareca, failed to secure the win that would have ensured automatic qualification but have the consolation of a home-and-away playoff against Oceania champions New Zealand.

“To be in this position was one of our targets for the qualifiers,” Gareca said after the 1-1 draw. “There’s 180 minutes left. We know that it is difficult but we know that it is up to us.”

Five-times champions Brazil had already qualified before their game against Chile in Sao Paulo but a 3-0 home victory saw the visitors drop from third to sixth in the standings, failing to even qualify for the inter-continental playoff.

Three second-half goals, one from Paulinho and two from Gabriel Jesus, enabled the group leaders to extend their unbeaten run in the group to 17 games.

“We finished in top spot with a great win against a strong team,” Jesus said. “We were focused.”

The result marks the end of a brilliant run by the Chileans, who won the last two Copa America tournaments in 2015 and 2016 and qualified for the last two World Cups.

“My soul is destroyed,” Arturo Vidal, the midfield dynamo who missed the match through suspension, wrote on social media. “Thanks boys, for everything, for all these years together giving our lives in every game.”

PARIS (Reuters) - French investigators are preparing for an intricate operation to repatriate an Air France Airbus A380 passenger jet that was forced to make an emergency landing in Canada after one of its engines came apart in mid-flight, people familiar with the maneuver said.

The Airbus superjumbo diverted to Goose Bay in Labrador on Sept. 30 after one of its four engines exploded over Greenland, sending the front part of the engine including its 3-metre-wide fan into the ice sheet 37,000 feet below.

More than 500 passengers and crew, some of whom had reported a bang and vibration, were picked up on two replacement jets after waiting for hours onboard due to problems in accommodating the world’s largest airliner at the remote military airport.

But the aircraft itself remained stranded while French-led investigators collected evidence and developed a plan for returning it to France.

Making the roughly 2,300 nautical mile (4,260 km) trip will need a switch in engines to help the mammoth jet fly smoothly.

First, the rump of the broken engine will be taken off the wing and flown to Wales, where manufacturer General Electric can examine it at its Cardiff repair workshop, the people said.

Then a spare engine will be mounted on the right wing in the same outer position as the damaged one. But this will only be used to balance the weight during flight and that engine will not be operable.

The people declined to be quoted as the plans have not yet been announced. France’s BEA accident agency declined comment.

The operation to fetch the double-decker jet is not the only challenging errand triggered by the mid-air explosion.

Some parts of the engine were retrieved by helicopter in Greenland on Oct. 6 and dispatched to BEA headquarters in Paris. But investigators still face a tricky search in uncertain weather conditions to try to find other missing elements before they are buried by snow.

Although nobody was injured, the engine break-up has led to what could be a lengthy investigation to ensure other aircraft are not exposed to the risk of damage from high-speed engine debris. Experts say such incidents are very rare, however.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contentious new U.S. demands are set to hit NAFTA negotiating tables on Wednesday, threatening to push modernization talks toward collapse as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau again tries to remind U.S. President Donald Trump of the trade pact’s merits.

Trudeau will meet with Trump and trade-focused U.S. lawmakers on the North American Free Trade Agreement while hundreds of negotiators, government officials and lobbyists from Canada, Mexico and the United States descend on a hotel in Arlington, Virginia for a fourth round of talks.

“We’re going to be talking about NAFTA and the fact it has led to great opportunities for our citizens,” Trudeau said on Tuesday night in conciliatory remarks at a Fortune magazine dinner honoring women, where he sat next to Ivanka Trump.

He added that he would “look for areas of agreement” with President Trump to improve outcomes for both countries.

The Canadian leader’s visit comes amid increasing acrimony over NAFTA renegotiations, with Trump making fresh threats to terminate the 23-year-old agreement and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday accusing Trump’s administration of trying to sabotage the talks with “poison pill proposals.”

Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray warned that an end to NAFTA would mark a breaking point in U.S.-Mexican relations and affect bilateral cooperation in non-trade areas.

The NAFTA talks are likely to stall in the face of aggressive U.S. demands to sharply increase content requirements for autos and auto parts, trade experts say.

The Washington round promises to be difficult, with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announcing early on Wednesday that talks would be extended by two days to Oct 17.

Lighthizer also said the three nations have completed their negotiations regarding company competition policy, reaching agreement on a chapter that provides goes beyond previous U.S. trade deals to ensure “certain rights and transparency under each nation’s competition laws.”

People briefed on the new U.S. proposals to be presented this week said that USTR is seeking to sharply lift North American content threshold for autos and auto parts to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent, with a 50 percent U.S.-specific content requirement.

“These will be met with widespread opposition from Canada and Mexico. I think it’s just a bridge too far,” said Wendy Cutler, the Asia Society’s Washington policy director and former chief U.S. negotiator for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal canceled by Trump.

Other contentious U.S. proposals opposed by Canada, Mexico and U.S. business interests include a five-year sunset provision, radical changes to NAFTA’s dispute arbitration systems, changes to intellectual property provisions and new protections for U.S. seasonal produce growers.

In his meeting with Trump, Trudeau is expected to remind the president that Canada is the United States’ biggest export customer, with largely balanced two-way goods and services trade, and is not the cause of U.S. manufacturing jobs lost under NAFTA, Canadian officials said.

Mexico has that distinction, with far lower wages that have lured U.S. auto plants and other manufacturers across its northern border, resulting in a $64 billion trade surplus with the United States last year that Trump administration officials have vowed to slash.

ZURIQUE (Reuters) - A possibilidade de uma Copa do Mundo sem Cristiano Ronaldo e Lionel Messi acabou sendo um alarme falso, mas o Mundial do ano que vem terá uma grande ausência: os Estados Unidos, cuja eliminação foi a grande surpresa da rodada de terça-feira das eliminatórias pelo mundo.

Já o Panamá mostrou que é perfeitamente possível uma nação pequena se classificar sem que o torneio tenha 48 seleções, o que está planejado para a edição de 2026, e se uniu à Islândia na condição de estreante na competição.

Dos 32 times que disputarão o Mundial, 23 já foram decididos, e os restantes serão conhecidos em novembro graças a quatro duelos de repescagem na Europa, duas repescagens intercontinentais e a rodada final das eliminatórias africanas, nas quais três grupos ainda estão indefinidos.

Ronaldo e Messi, que vêm dividindo entre si o prêmio de Jogador do Ano da Fifa desde 2008, chegaram às últimas partidas da fase de grupos incertos de sua participação no Mundial do ano que vem.

Estes temores foram acalmados pela trinca de gols de Messi na vitória de 3 x 1 da Argentina sobre o Equador e pelo triunfo de Portugual por 2 x 0 sobre a Suíça.

Os EUA, um dos membros mais importantes da Fifa em termos comerciais, não teve a mesma sorte -- sua derrota chocante de 2 x 1 em Trinidad e Tobago, combinada a vitórias de Panamá e Honduras, encerrou uma sequência de sete participações sucessivas na Copa do Mundo.

A Holanda, semifinalista em 2014 e vice-campeã em 2010, tampouco se classificou, e a tetracampeã Itália, que ficou de fora do torneio pela última vez em 1958, enfrentará uma repescagem com partidas de ida e volta em novembro.

Helping one of Europe’s biggest lenders sounds like an odd way to shake up the dominance of established banks. But small-business customers will probably benefit over time.

State-owned Royal Bank of Scotland is taking measures worth about 835 million pounds to increase competition in business banking – a market currently dominated by the Edinburgh-based lender and fellow high-street behemoths Barclays, Lloyds and HSBC. The package, which was designed to meet state aid conditions arising from RBS’s crisis-era bailout, includes 425 million pounds of grants to “challenger banks and other financial services providers” to help them to grow business lending.

The catch is that the UK subsidiary of Santander qualifies for funding, which can be tapped by any bank whose gross UK assets are worth less than 350 billion pounds. Smaller lenders are reportedly cross that they have to compete for funds with a Spanish bank whose 2008 acquisition of former building society Alliance & Leicester made it a relatively large player in the UK retail market.

Critics miss the point of an aid package whose primary aim is to cut RBS’s market share. Dividing funds purely between relative minnows would have achieved this in the short term. But the risk is that one or more of TSB, Clydesdale or Metro Bank might fail to break into the mainstream, to the benefit of RBS, Barclays or Lloyds.

WILL XI REPLACE PREMIER LI KEQIANG?
The Politburo age limits usually means two relatively young leaders are “helicoptered” into the Politburo Standing Committee at the halfway mark of an administration.","WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s politicians are preparing for a pivotal event. The leadership reshuffle at the Chinese Communist Party Congress, a meeting held once every five years set to kick off on October 18, will see most of the country’s top officials step down. All eyes will be on President Xi Jinping, who could upend decades of party tradition by seizing more power. Some hope a stronger Xi will put China back on the liberalization path. The fear is he will dismantle the consensus-based checks and balances put in place to prevent a return to the excesses of the Mao era.

The president’s boosters think that if Xi can put more trusted lieutenants into position, he will finally overpower so-called vested interests and deliver more aggressive reforms in financial markets and the state-owned sector. Skeptics question how market-oriented Xi is, and suspect he is angling to stay on after his term is due to end in 2022.

The debate will be settled at the end of the conference, when members of the next Politburo Standing Committee walk out on stage in a prearranged order. These individuals will in turn help pick new leaders of key financial and economic regulatory institutions.

There are four key measurements of how much power Xi accrues at the congress.

CAN XI PERSUADE THE POLITBURO TO IGNORE THE AGE LIMIT RULE?

Since the early 2000s, Politburo members have adhered to a “seven up, eight down” rule: officials aged 67 or younger at the time of the congress are eligible for promotion, while those 68 or over step down.

Proponents say this mechanism ensures peaceful transitions of institutional power in China; a tacit agreement among the elite to restrain the executive.

However, the limit is informal, and critics note it originated in gutter politics. Former President Jiang Zemin used the rule to knock opponents out of position. An official from a party think tank said last year the age limit is “folklore” and traditions could be “adjusted.”

At this congress, this question boils down to whether Wang Qishan, the country’s anti-corruption czar, stays or goes. Wang is competent, but he’s 69. The president might use Wang’s extension as a stalking horse, as Xi himself will approach the age limit in 2022. If Wang walks out on stage, it will be an unambiguous sign of Xi’s authority.

CAN HE INSERT “XI JINPING THOUGHT” INTO THE PARTY CONSTITUTION?

While less debated than the age limit, amendments to the party constitution are important; it’s the party’s way of saying how its leaders stack up.

The latest version says the party is committed to “Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of the Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development.” What’s missing from this turgid phrase: any mention of former presidents Jiang and Hu Jintao. Their slogans – “Three Represents” and “Scientific Development,” respectively – are given pride of place, but Hu and Jiang’s names only appear later. The implication is that collective ideas are more important than individuals.

If one of Xi’s signature ideas is included in the amended party constitution without his name, that would be a sign of either institutional restraint on his authority or his own unwillingness to challenge orthodoxy. However, if the party constitution is revised to include something along the lines of “Xi Jinping Thought,” the message would be clear: the era of collective leadership is winding down, and Xi is now China’s most important leader since Mao.

WILL XI REPLACE PREMIER LI KEQIANG?

The Li Keqiang question has consumed Beijing’s rumor mill since around 2015, when whispers surfaced of a falling out with Xi. Li is a veteran of the Communist Youth League, a political faction that the president has cut down to size in recent years.

The odds currently look in favor of Li staying put. The relationship between president and premier now seems less fractious than the rumor mill initially suggested, and Xi has already sidelined Li on economic policy anyway. Plus a scapegoat might be useful if the economy falters. If Xi were to replace the premier, however, it would suggest the president is unwilling to tolerate all but the most loyal lieutenants in positions of power.

DO ANY SUCCESSORS FOR XI LAND IN PUBLIC VIEW?

The Politburo age limits usually means two relatively young leaders are “helicoptered” into the Politburo Standing Committee at the halfway mark of an administration. One is meant to replace the president, and another to take over from the premier.

The running bet is that Chongqing Party Secretary Chen Miner will land the successor spot for president, and perhaps Guangdong Party Secretary Hu Chunhua as the next premier. But if no young faces emerge in the Politburo Standing Committee at the end of the congress, it would suggest Xi plans to stay for another term.",Breakingviews - Breakdown: Xi and China’s leadership reshuffle,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress-breakingviews/breakingviews-breakdown-xi-and-chinas-leadership-reshuffle-idUSKBN1CF0A1

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya lurched deeper into political crisis on Wednesday as a court ruling and a parliamentary vote appeared to ease Uhuru Kenyatta’s path to a second term as president, a day after his rival quit an election they were to contest.

Kenyatta and Raila Odinga were due to face off in a repeat election on Oct. 26, after the Supreme Court annulled their August ballot -- in which the president was declared the winner -- due to irregularities. [nL8N1LI1QY]

But Odinga pulled out of the re-run on Tuesday, fuelling doubts about whether it would be contested at all. Wednesday’s interventions by the judiciary and legislature added to the uncertainty.

As police used teargas to disperse opposition protesters demanding electoral reform, the High Court approved a petition by Ekuru Aukot, who polled less than 1 percent in the August vote, to contest the second ballot.

Aukot has yet to announce if he will definitely run.

Further muddying the political waters, parliament passed an election law amendment stating that if one candidate withdrew from the re-run election, the remaining one would automatically win. The vote was boycotted by opposition lawmakers.

That would mean Kenyatta could be declared president if he faced no challengers. [nL8N1MM0U5]

The events stoked confusion among voters and fears that politically-driven violence might escalate. Months of political uncertainty have already blunted growth in East Africa’s richest nation, a long-time ally of the West.

“There’s a real atmosphere of confusion and uncertainty. There seems to be dozens of opinions of what should come next,” said Murithi Mutiga, a senior Horn of Africa analyst for the global thinktank International Crisis Group.

UNEASE

Justifying his pullout on Tuesday, Odinga said the election would not be free and fair and renewed calls for the electoral board (IEBC), which he blamed for the procedural irregularities identified in the first ballot, to be replaced. [nL8N1ML3OC]

Opposition supporters on Wednesday renewed their protests for electoral reform.

Demonstrators lit bonfires in Kisumu, an Odinga stronghold in the country’s west, while more than a thousand supporters marched through the central business district in the capital Nairobi. Police used teargas to disperse them in both cities, witnesses said.

A repeat of the widespread ethnic clashes that killed 1,200 people following a disputed presidential poll in 2007 appears unlikely at this stage.

But at least 37 people were killed in protests immediately following the August vote, almost all of them by police, a Kenyan rights group said Monday. [nL8N1MK1YD]

“We want a reformed IEBC,” said Elisha Odhiambo, an opposition legislator, referring to the electoral board, which has frequently relied on riot police dispersing protests outside its offices in recent weeks.

Slideshow (3 Images)

After the High Court ruling in his favour, Aukot told reporters that he still had concerns about the board and would issue a statement in a day or two giving clarity about his plans.

It was unclear if other candidates from the first ballot with little support would also seek to be included, but the election board said it still had time to print ballot papers.

The Sept. 1 Supreme Court judgement that nullified Kenyatta’s 1.4 million vote win also stipulated elections had to be held within 60 days.

If that schedule is not met, the constitution provides for the speaker of parliament, a member of Kenyatta’s party, to take power.

With two weeks to go until the elections, it is still unclear who will stand.

“I would expect one of the parties will try to seek an authoritative announcement from the Supreme Court,” International Crisis Group’s Mutiga said.

Amid the political uncertainty, the government has trimmed this year’s GDP growth forecast from 5.9 percent to 5.5 percent last month.

The country’s equity markets slid further on Wednesday. Kenya’s all share index slipped 1.24 percent while the blue chip index fell 1.14 percent.",Kenya vote in balance as crisis deepens after Odinga quits,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CG1NY-OZATP

MOMBASA, Kenya (Reuters) - Two staff members of a Kenyan university were killed south of Mombasa on Tuesday when gunmen fired on vehicles carrying them and students to their campus, the area police chief said.

The identity of the gunmen was unclear. Police in the coastal county of Kwale, where the Technical University of Mombasa (TUM) has a campus, said they could be robbers or militants.

Security is poor in the area and the convoy had a police escort. Somali Islamist militants al Shabaab frequently carry out attacks along the Kenyan coast and have been recruiting new members there.

In 2015, al Shabaab gunmen killed 148 students at a university in Kenya’s Garissa town near the Kenya-Somali border, an attack that provoked shock and outrage in Kenya and abroad.

Two staff members of the university were killed Tuesday’s attack, and a driver and two policemen were wounded, area police chief Joseph Chebusit told Reuters.

“A bus carrying students of TUM was ferrying them from their hostels to the campus in Ukunda for classes and was being escorted by a van that had some staff of the college and two escort police officers,” the policeman said.

“Armed men numbering about 10 emerged from the bushes and started firing at the van in front. As a result two ladies who are staff of TUM were killed in the van. The driver of the van and two police officers were injured,” he said.

“We have information that the attackers had other accomplices along the road who were monitoring the movement of the two vehicles and communicating with them to enable the attack,” he added.

“For now we are treating it as a crime like any other as we continue with investigations but that does not mean we are ruling out al Shabaab.”

A witness who did not want to be named told Reuters she and several other students had fled their vehicle when gunmen opened fire on them and had seen several students covered in blood.

But Chebusit said no students were injured.",Gunmen kill two in attack on university convoy in Kenya,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CF1PP-OZATP

Although May has talked up the “promise of Brexit” since gaining power last year, she had, in the run-up to the June 2016 referendum, quietly backed staying in the European Union.

She won the top job after David Cameron, who had also campaigned to remain, resigned in the chaos following the shock result of the vote. She has ruled out holding a second referendum on the final deal of the terms of Brexit, despite calls for one from some pro-EU lawmakers.

Asked three times in an interview if she had changed her mind since then, she did not answer directly, saying she wouldn’t engage with hypothetical questions and said her job was now to deliver what the people had voted for.

“I voted remain for good reasons at the time, but circumstances move on and I think the important thing now is that I think we should all be focused on delivering Brexit and delivering the best deal,” she said on British radio station LBC on Tuesday.

The United Kingdom remains deeply divided over Brexit which most senior politicians view as the most important decision Britain has taken since World War Two.

Britain's Prime Minister, Theresa May, arrives at 10 Downing Street in central London, Britain October 9, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville

In the June 23, 2016 referendum, 17.4 million voters, or 51.9 percent of votes cast, backed leaving the EU while 16.1 million voters, or 48.1 percent of votes cast, backed staying.

Britain has just over one year to negotiate the terms of the divorce and the outlines of the future relationship before it is due to leave in late March 2019. Both sides need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world’s biggest trading bloc and the fifth largest global economy.

But the other 27 members of the EU combined have about five times the economic might of Britain. They also have a strong incentive to deny the UK a deal so attractive it might encourage others to follow the British example.

May, who said she voted to remain, called a general election earlier this year in a bid to unite the country around her vision for Brexit. However, she lost her parliamentary majority, jeopardizing her premiership.

Pressed on whether she would now vote leave, she said she would look at everything and come to a judgment, but stressed that there would not be another referendum.

Minister Damian Green, who is effectively May’s deputy, was asked on BBC Newsnight the same question. He said that it would have been better had the public voted to remain, but there would not be another referendum and it was his job as a democrat to work towards making Brexit a success.

PARIS (Reuters) - Plane giants are preparing to squeeze the last drop out of a once raging torrent of airplane orders without the razzmatazz of recent years, as the aerospace industry heads to a belt-tightening Paris Airshow looking for new sources of revenue.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

A venture with Great Wall, whose Hong-Kong listed shares leapt 20 percent on the news, would be BMW’s second in the world’s largest auto market, where foreign carmakers have to team up with local partners.

“We are in discussions with Great Wall about setting up a joint venture to produce cars in Changshu,” said a BMW executive, who was not authorized to speak on the matter and declined to be identified.

Another person familiar with the matter said the new joint venture in the eastern city of Changshu would not deal with gasoline or diesel powered cars, indicating a focus on electric vehicles was likely.

BMW’s China sales grew 11.3 percent last year. It is the country’s second-largest premium brand after Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi AG. BMW is trying to stay ahead of third-place Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz, which recorded 26.6 percent growth in China sales in 2016 thanks to a fresher model lineup.

Car manufacturers have recently announced a raft of investments and tie-ups in China.

Tesla, Ford Motor Co, Daimler AG, and General Motors are among those that have already announced plans for making electric vehicles in China.

ELECTRIC MINI?

BMW and rival Mercedes are betting they can mass produce new electric cars based on conventional vehicle design, defying skeptics who say they will need more radical plans to head off the threat from Tesla and other start-ups.

Bernstein analysts said they believed that any new venture of BMW and Great Wall would have to sell exclusively electric vehicles (EVs), given China’s moratorium on approvals for new gasoline car businesses.

“If an agreement were to be reached, we’d expect an arrangement like Denza (Mercedes-BYD), or VW-JAC, Ford-Zotye to be the most plausible outcome, whereby a new brand is used to sell EVs,” they said in a note, adding that the vehicles could be sold under the Mini brand.

China wants electric and hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of the country’s auto sales by 2025 and plans to loosen joint-venture regulations to achieve its aim.

BMW already has a joint venture in China with local carmaker Brilliance China Automotive Holdings and produces cars at two plants in Shenyang. Shares in Brilliance fell on Wednesday.

“Our business development with the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive will continue as planned, and we will carry on to invest and develop our joint venture.” a spokesman for BMW said, declining to comment on any new joint venture.

The plans were first reported by Shanghai-based www.iautodaily.com earlier on Wednesday.

“I don’t know how far along we have gone nailing this deal,” or whether the two companies have official central government approval for the venture, the BMW executive said.

A Great Wall official declined to comment.

Great Wall, which in August expressed an interest in the Jeep brand of Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV‘s, is one of China’s largest car makers.

Last month it struck a deal to secure supplies of lithium, a mineral key for developing electric vehicles.

The firm’s shares soared as much as 19.2 percent to their highest level in over two years, before paring some gains to stand up 14 percent in afternoon trade. Its Shanghai-listed shares were suspended from trading, pending an announcement.

Brilliance China Automotive’s shares were down 2.76 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to dramatically increase the country’s nuclear arsenal, he said in a meeting with his national security advisers in July, NBC News reported on Wednesday, citing three officials who were present in the room.

Trump’s reported comments come as tensions remained high with North Korea and as Trump is expected to make an announcement on whether to decertify the international deal surrounding Iran’s nuclear program.

The president spoke on July after he was shown a chart indicating the stockpile of U.S. nuclear weapons had slid from a high of 32,000 in the 1960s. Trump said he wanted to have that same number now, NBC reported.

The United States currently has about 4,000 nuclear warheads earmarked for use in its military stockpile, according to the Federation of American Scientists.

In a post on Twitter on Wednesday, the president said, “Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a ‘tenfold’ increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction, made up to demean. NBC = CNN!”

Trump said in an interview with Reuters in February that he wanted to ensure that the U.S. nuclear arsenal was at the “top of the pack.”

Although U.S. presidents have modernized weapons stockpiles over the years, adding to the nuclear arsenal or building a prohibited type of weapon would be a violation of treaty agreements, according to NBC.

After the meeting, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson referred to Trump as a “moron,” according to NBC. U.S. news reports have painted the relationship between Trump and Tillerson as tense.

The retail chain is the latest victim of a widespread shift in consumer behavior demanding more convenience and up-to-date fashions that has seen nimble online operators such as Amazon.com Inc. claw market share from bricks-and-mortar retailers that have clung to their traditional business models.

It also adds to the list of retail bankruptcies this year.

Weighed down by over C$1.1 billion ($879 million) in liabilities, almost matching its assets, and falling sales every quarter since it was spun off from Sears Holdings in 2012, Sears Canada filed for creditor protection in June. It laid out a restructuring plan that included cutting 2,900 jobs and closing roughly a quarter of its stores.

It last week won court approval to close 11 stores and sell some businesses, and to extend creditor protection to Nov. 7.

The only takeover bid that offered some hope of keeping Sears Canada afloat failed, with creditors arguing liquidation would yield a better payout than to keep the company solvent.

That bid, from Executive Chairman Brandon Stranzl, who stepped away from day-to-day operations to come up with a proposal, presented “significant closing risk and uncertain recovery,” according to court-appointed monitor FTI Consulting.

A revision to the bid on Oct. 3 failed to convince the creditors otherwise. Led by Wells Fargo Capital Finance Corp and GACP Finance Co they pushed Sears Canada to enter into liquidation agreements for the rest of its assets by Oct. 7.

The operation was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters. But it was not as provocative as previous ones carried out since Trump took office in January.

The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Chafee, a guided-missile destroyer, carried out normal maneuvering operations that challenged “excessive maritime claims” near the Paracel Islands, among a string of islets, reefs and shoals over which China has territorial disputes with its neighbors.

China’s Defense Ministry said on Wednesday that a warship, two fighter jets and a helicopter had scrambled to warn the U.S. ship away, adding it had infringed upon China’s sovereignty and security with its “provocation”.

China would further strengthen its naval and air defenses, the ministry said.

“We demand the U.S. side earnestly take steps to correct its mistakes,” it added.

Related Coverage China says U.S. violated its sovereignty in South China Sea

Speaking earlier at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China had lodged “stern representations” with the United States, and reiterated that the Paracels were Chinese territory.

“China will continue to take resolute measures to protect Chinese sovereign territory and maritime interests. China urges the U.S. to conscientiously respect China’s sovereign territory and security interests, conscientiously respect the efforts regional countries have made to protect peace and stability in the South China Sea, and stop these wrong actions.”

Next month, Trump makes his first visit to Asia as president, including a stop in China, which he has been pressuring to do more to rein in North Korea. China is North Korea’s neighbor and biggest trading partner.

Unlike in August, when a U.S. Navy destroyer came within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built up by China in the South China Sea, officials said the destroyer on Tuesday sailed close to but not within that range of the islands.

USS Chafee, a US Navy destroyer which operates 100 percent on biofuel, sails about 150 miles (241 km) north of the island of Oahu during the RIMPAC Naval exercises off Hawaii July 18,2012. REUTERS/Hugh Gentry

Twelve nautical miles mark internationally recognized territorial limits. Sailing within that range is meant to show the United States does not recognize territorial claims.

The Pentagon did not comment directly on the operation, but said the United States carried out regular freedom-of-navigation operations and would continue to do so.

China’s claims in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in shipborne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.

Experts and some U.S. officials have criticized former president Barack Obama for potentially reinforcing China’s claims by sticking to innocent passage, in which a warship effectively recognized a territorial sea by crossing it speedily without stopping.

The U.S. military has a long-standing position that its operations are carried out throughout the world, including in areas claimed by allies, and that they are separate from political considerations.

The United States has said it would like to see more international participation in freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea.

NORTH KOREA ISSUE

Trump’s trip to Asia will likely be dominated by the North Korean nuclear threat. He will also visit South Korea, Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines.

In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, all in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Trump’s visit to China will reciprocate a trip to the United States made in April by Chinese President Xi Jinping. The U.S. president’s attempts to get Chinese help with North Korea have met with limited success so far, but he has gone out of his way to thank Xi for his efforts.",Exclusive: U.S. warship sails near islands Beijing claims in South China Sea - U.S. officials,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CF2QG-OCATP

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling bloc could come close to keeping its two-thirds “super” majority in an Oct. 22 lower house election, defying some predictions of substantial losses and solidifying his grip on power, a survey published by the Nikkei business daily on Wednesday showed.

Abe’s conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its more dovish junior partner, the Komeito, are likely to secure more than 290 seats in the 465-seat chamber, the Nikkei said.

The ruling bloc had a two-thirds “super majority” in the lower house before the chamber was dissolved. The number of seats has been cut from 475 as part of electoral reforms.

A strong showing by Abe’s coalition would boost his chances of winning a third term as LDP leader from next September, putting him on track to become Japan’s longest-serving premier.

Abe called the snap election amid confusion in the opposition camp and after an uptick in his ratings, which had been hurt earlier this year by suspected cronyism scandals, in hopes of gaining a fresh mandate after nearly five years in power.

But the outlook has been clouded by the emergence of popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike’s Party of Hope, a fledgling party that the former LDP lawmaker and defense minister calls a reformist, conservative alternative to Abe’s LDP.

The Nikkei said Koike’s party was on track to get around 69 seats, with a forecast range of 46-110.

Another new party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, formed from the liberal wing of the failed opposition Democratic Party, was set to win more than 40 seats, it said.

The Democrats, faced with rock bottom ratings and internal dissension, have said they would run no candidates of their own, freeing many to run on the Party of Hope ticket.

PRO-CONSTITUTION REVISION FORCES

The Asahi newspaper also forecast a strong showing by the ruling bloc, with the LDP set to win well over the 233 seats needed to have a simple majority on its own. It said Koike’s Party of Hope was struggling but was likely to get more than 57 seats. About 40 percent of voters were undecided, the Asahi said.

The Nikkei also forecast that parties in favor of revising the post-war, pacifist constitution - Abe’s long-held goal - were on track to win more than two-thirds.

That includes the LDP and Koike’s Party of Hope as well as another smaller right-leaning party, the Japan Innovation Party.

Amending the constitution, a politically controversial move never yet taken, requires a two-thirds majority in both chambers and a majority in a public referendum.

Koike’s party had raised expectations that it would cut into the LDP’s conservative base. But her decision not to run for a lower house seat herself and refusal to say whom her party would support for premier after the election appears to have eroded the party’s momentum.

Competition among a fragmented opposition, which also includes the Japanese Communist Party, in many districts means the anti-LDP vote could be split, a plus for Abe’s party.

Abe has led the LDP to four landslide wins since he took the helm of the party in 2012, but turnout has been low and the LDP has typically won with about 25 percent of eligible votes. The others either stayed home or backed opposition parties.

The premier has been touting the success of his “Abenomics” recipe of hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and promised structural reforms, while Koike argues that reforms have been too slow in a fast-changing global economy.

The world’s third-largest economy is on track for its longest expansion since World War Two, and the jobless rate was at a 23-year low of 2.8 percent in August while wages are starting to rise a bit. But Abe’s reflationary policies have not yet sparked a sustainable recovery led by the private sector.",Japan PM's ruling bloc seen nearing 2/3 majority in Oct 22 lower house poll: Nikkei,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-japan-election/japan-pms-ruling-bloc-seen-nearing-2-3-majority-in-october-22-lower-house-poll-nikkei-idUKKBN1CG1W5?il=0

Some of the users gave Microsoft fictitious data about their identity, people involved in the transactions told Reuters, exploiting a gap in the U.S. company’s ability to keep its products out of their hands.

The products in each case were sold via third parties and Reuters has no evidence that Microsoft sold products directly to entities hit by the sanctions.

“Microsoft has a strong commitment to complying with legal requirements and we have been looking into this matter in recent weeks,” a Microsoft representative said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters.

“We have robust trade compliance processes around the world to help ensure that our partners comply with all conditions including immediate halting of suspected improper sales by partners, and strong measures to try to prevent banned customers from accessing and using our products and services.”

All state organizations and state firms are obliged to disclose purchases they make on the procurement database. People involved in five of the transactions confirmed to Reuters the software had been acquired.

The Reuters review of the database found state entities in Russia and Crimea that are subject to sanctions have acquired more than 5,000 Microsoft products worth about 60 million rubles ($1.03 million).

The sum is relatively small but such software is vital for many firms and organizations in Russia and Crimea to operate. The database also does not include private companies, so the scale of the problem could be much bigger.

Among entities hit by sanctions that acquired Microsoft products was Almaz-Antey, manufacturer of the BUK surface-to-air missile. Dutch prosecutors say a BUK missile brought down a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet over east Ukraine in July 2014, though Russia denies its forces shot down the plane.

Other Microsoft buyers, the database shows, include Glavgosexpertiza, a state design agency involved in work on a new bridge from Russia to Crimea and the “Krym” health spa in Crimea owned by Russia’s defense ministry.

The arms manufacturer, Almaz-Antey, did not respond to a request for comment. The defense ministry’s health spa in Crimea declined to comment. Glavgosexpertiza said “the company operates within the Russian legal framework”.

One set of U.S. sanctions prohibits the export by a U.S. entity of any goods, services or technology to Crimea.

Other sanctions bar U.S firms from carrying out transactions with companies or individuals on a list of “specially designated nationals” deemed by Washington to be linked to the Russian government and its activities in Ukraine.

Microsoft did not directly respond to detailed questions about specific users of its products and the compliance procedures it has in place.

The products acquired by organizations hit by sanctions include “Open License Program” services, where the user must provide Microsoft with the company’s full name and address.

Almaz-Antey, Glavgosexpertiza and the defense ministry spa acquired “Open License Program” products, the database showed.

After the sanctions were introduced, Microsoft took steps to prevent entities hit by sanctions acquiring its products, according to five sources involved in the software re-selling trade and a former Microsoft employee in Russia.

But people involved in transactions say ways can be found to circumvent obstacles.

The “Morye” shipyard, based in Crimea, bought 150 Windows Server, SQL Server and Office licenses in June 2016 from OOO Web-Potok, a firm registered in Moscow, the procurement database shows. All the products were “Open License Program” services.

The shipyard fell under the general prohibition on transactions by U.S. firms with entities in Crimea and is now on the “special designated nationals” list.

“If we bought directly from Microsoft, there would be sanctions,” a shipyard employee, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said by telephone. “But there were no problems with (buying third-party from) Russian firms.”

The shipyard declined to comment. Reuters called telephone numbers listed for the supplier, OOO Web-Potok, but the people who answered said they worked for a different company.

Another way to circumvent the restrictions on Crimea-based entities is for the user, when registering the product with Microsoft, not to provide a Crimean address, three people involved in the trade said.

They said addresses in Russia’s Krasnodar region, across the Kerch Strait from Crimea, were commonly used instead.

A supplier who worked with a company on the U.S. “specially designated nationals” list said a supplier and a client could circumvent restrictions by registering Microsoft products to a subsidiary or parent company of the end user.","Exclusive: Despite sanctions, Russian organizations acquire Microsoft software",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-russia-microsoft/exclusive-despite-sanctions-russian-organizations-acquire-microsoft-software-idUKKBN1CG0NS

LONDON (Reuters) - Illegal immigrants who survived a fire that killed about 80 people in a social housing block in London will be given a clear path to obtaining permanent residency rights in Britain, the government said on Wednesday.

The 24-storey Grenfell Tower, home to a low-income, multi-cultural community, was gutted on June 14 in an inferno that started in a fourth floor apartment in the middle of the night and quickly engulfed the building.

The building is in a deprived estate within one of London’s richest boroughs, and the disaster prompted a wave of soul-searching about social inequalities and neglect of poor communities.

Some of the approximately 250 people who made it out of the building alive on the night of the fire did not have the legal right to live in Britain and as a result have been reluctant to make themselves known to the authorities.

The government had previously said that if they came forward, those people would be given leave to remain legally in Britain for 12 months -- a stance that drew widespread criticism for being ungenerous to people affected by the tragedy.

Martin Moore-Bick, chairman of a public inquiry into the fire, had asked the government to reconsider the policy, saying some survivors were unwilling to give evidence because of fears over their long-term immigration status.

“I therefore urge the government to take all necessary steps to dispel those fears,” he said in a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May in August.

The Home Office, or interior ministry, said the new policy was that after the initial period of 12 months of limited leave to remain in Britain, Grenfell survivors would be able to apply for further periods of leave, building up to five years.

At the end of the five years, if they had not committed any offences, they would be given permanent residency, the Home Office said.

A spokesman said the government had not previously indicated what would happen at the end of the first 12 months. He said the new stance provided greater certainty.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The possibility of a World Cup without Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi turned out to be a false alarm, yet next year’s tournament will still have a major absentee after the United States’ extraordinary failure to qualify on Tuesday.

Panama, meanwhile, showed it is perfectly possible for small nations to qualify without expanding the finals to 48 teams, which is planned for the 2026 edition, as they joined Iceland in reaching the tournament for the first time.

South American champions Chile, like African counterparts Cameroon, missed out on a ticket to Russia -- and, bizarrely, their elimination was the result of a successful protest made to FIFA about opponents fielding an ineligible player.

Twenty-three of the 32 finalists have now been decided while the remainder will be settled in November with four European playoffs, two intercontinental playoffs and the final round of African qualifiers, where three groups are still open.

Brazil, who will be making their 21st World Cup appearance, remain the only ever-present side at the finals and had qualified long before Tuesday’s drama.

Ronaldo and Messi, who have won FIFA’s World Player of the Year award between them since 2008, went into the final group matches uncertain of whether they would take part next year.

Those fears were allayed as Messi’s hat-trick led Argentina to a 3-1 win at high altitude in Ecuador to ensure their place and Portugal made it with a 2-0 win over Switzerland.

The U.S., one of FIFA’s most important members in commercial terms, were not so lucky as a shock 2-1 defeat in Trinidad and Tobago, combined with wins for Panama and Honduras, ended their run of seven successive finals appearances.

The Netherlands, semi-finalists in 2014 and runners-up in 2010, will also miss out while four-times champions Italy, who last failed to qualify in 1958, face a two-leg playoff in November.

The impact of the U.S.’s absence will be felt at broadcasters Fox, who take over coverage of the World Cup from ESPN starting with the 2018 tournament and a host of sponsors, such as Nike, who had been hoping for plenty of World Cup exposure.

SMALLER NATIONS

Panama’s first-ever qualification for the finals prompted President Juan Carlos Varela to declare a national holiday, describing it on Twitter as an “historic day for the country”.

But their 2-1 win over Costa Rica also highlighted global soccer body FIFA’s surprising decision not to use goal-line technology in the qualifiers, as the ball did not appear to fully cross the line for their first goal.

Panama’s success also strengthened the hand of those who argue that the expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams is not necessary to allow more smaller countries to take part.

On Monday, Iceland, with a population of less than 350,000, became the smallest nation ever to qualify for the finals while Cape Verde, with a population of 550,000, are still in contention for one of the African places.

A bigger World Cup may also devalue the qualifying competition, particularly in South America where two points separated five teams battling for two direct places and a playoff spot before Tuesday’s enthralling finale.

An evening of unremitting tension ended with Uruguay, Argentina and Colombia joining Brazil in Russia, while Peru’s 1-1 draw was enough to land them in fifth place - the playoff spot - and continue dreaming of a first appearance since 1982.

Peru sneaked ahead of Chile on goal difference after their southern neighbors lost 3-0 to Brazil and dropped to sixth. They were also indebted to Venezuela who stopped Paraguay from taking the playoff spot with a shock 1-0 win in Asuncion.

Earlier in the competition, Chile got an extra two points after protesting that Bolivia fielded an ineligible player -- Paraguay-born Nelson Cabrera -- during a 0-0 draw in Santiago.

FIFA agreed and awarded them a 3-0 walkover win -- but then did the same for Peru who lost 2-0 to Bolivia and therefore gained three extra points, compared to Chile’s two.

That extra point proved decisive on Tuesday.",Soccer: Ronaldo and Messi make it safely to World Cup but no U.S,https://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-worldcup-roundup/soccer-ronaldo-and-messi-make-it-safely-to-world-cup-but-no-u-s-idINKBN1CG1NW

A growing technology company would move fewer jobs overseas. And a regional bank would boost its spending on cybersecurity.

These are some of the uses of the tax savings that small and medium-sized U.S. companies say they would pursue if the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress slashed corporate taxes as promised.

Small companies pay the highest taxes and they would be the main beneficiaries of such a Trump windfall. Reuters contacted the 100 largest companies by market value in the benchmark Russell 2000 index of U.S. small and mid-cap stocks as well as another 50 in the Russell 2000 with no analyst coverage. None of the 17 companies that responded to Reuters queries mentioned boosting their headcount.

The administration has said the tax cuts would largely pay for themselves by spurring more investment and creating jobs.

But companies say they look to spend on technology that will allow them to improve productivity or make acquisitions rather than hire more workers.

“We want to be a company of the future, and technology is one of the key ingredients,” said Keith Cargill, chief executive at Dallas-based Texas Capital Bankshares Inc (TCBI.O), a bank with a market value of $4.2 billion. The tax cut would be a “huge plus” for earnings, Cargill said, but with little impact on the bank’s workforce.

The Russell 2000 companies tend to pay the highest effective tax rates now - an average of 31.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data - and would stand to gain the most if corporate taxes are cut to 20 percent from 35 percent as the Trump administration has proposed.

For large companies in the S&P 500, the average effective tax rate is 28 percent, a reflection of a greater share of overseas business and more leeway in reducing their tax rates.

While few companies would discuss any details in public before outlining them to their shareholders, executives, chief financial officers and treasures say they are already starting to formulate plans for a tax windfall even if they are not certain whether and in what form it will pass.

Neil Hennessy, the chief executive of Novato, California-based Hennessy Advisors Inc (HNNA.O), a mutual fund company, told Reuters he was in “acquisition mode” and would keep looking for targets in the event of a tax cut passing.

STRIP CLUBS AND SHARE BUYBACKS

One of the first firms to publicly discuss a potential tax windfall is RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc (RICK.O), a chain of 40 strip clubs headquartered in Houston, Texas. Its chief executive Eric Scott Langan told analysts on Aug. 9 that a tax cut would allow him to buy more clubs and boost the share price, which he complained failed to reflect the firm’s organic growth.

""I think that's going to change and I think that's when you're going to see the multiple expansion come into play,"" he said during an earnings call.

The tax cut would also affect companies which do not pay taxes now either because they are not yet profitable or are using past losses to offset their tax bills.

Paul Auvil, the chief financial officer at cybersecurity company Proofpoint Inc (PFPT.O), said that the $4 billion market-cap company expects to start paying taxes in 2021 when it no longer be able to offset past losses.

By then the corporate tax rate would need to sink at least below 27 percent, Auvil told Reuters. Otherwise Proofpoint would move its intellectual property to an offshore company in Europe, where corporate taxes are lower, which would mean hiring up to 100 back office staff there, said.

“These are jobs that have every reason to be in the U.S. but it will require tax reform.”

The prospects of a tax cut have helped push the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM.P) up about 10 percent over the last six weeks, compared with a 3.7 percent gain in the fund which tracks S&P 500 .SPX.

If the tax package does pass, large companies will be more likely to buy back their own stock, while smaller firms will probably reinvest in their businesses, said Tom Forte, an analyst at New York based D.A. Davidson.

“These companies are going to take every incremental cost savings from a tax cut and invest it to keep up with the Amazons (AMZN.O) and Ubers,” Forte said.

For instance, Forte expects EBay Inc (EBAY.O) to spend most of the possible windfall on increasing its stock buyback program. A smaller company like Yelp Inc (YELP.N) would probably invest in artificial intelligence technology to better harness its website’s advertising potential, he said.

GrubHub Inc (GRUB.N), meanwhile, would spend more on its service that delivers from restaurants that do not have their own delivery staff, Forte said, while Groupon Inc (GRPN.O) would invest more in marketing and advertising.

Some smaller companies are also considering share buybacks rather any significant changes to their capital allocation.

Thomas Castellano, treasurer at drug delivery company Catalent Inc (CTLT.N), told Reuters that the $5.2 billion company would keep spending on maintaining its 35 locations around the globe and look for possible acquisitions. Any extra money would go to share buybacks and Catalent was unlikely to increase its hiring rate if a tax cut passes, Castellano said.

His “behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar,” Streep said a statement.

Britain’s Dench, who won a supporting actress Oscar in 1999 for the Weinstein-produced film “Shakespeare in Love,” said in a statement she was “completely unaware of these offences, which are of course horrifying.”

Stars like Streep and Dench, whose movies had been championed by Weinstein, have been under pressure to speak out after a New York Times investigation last week detailed claims by multiple women of unwanted physical contact by Weinstein over three decades.

Weinstein, 65, initially apologized but later threatened to sue over the allegations uncovered by the newspaper. He has not been charged with any crimes but was fired on Sunday as co-chairman of the Weinstein amid fallout from the Times story.

In a statement to the Huffington Post, Streep said she had been unaware of claims that Weinstein undressed in front of actresses and assistants and asked young women to give him massages.

“The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed,” Streep said.

Producer and director Kevin Smith said on Monday he regretted taking money from Weinstein’s production company.

“He financed the first 14 years of my career - and now I know while I was profiting, others were in terrible pain. It makes me feel ashamed,” Smith, known for the comedies “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back” and “Clerks,” wrote on Twitter.

Actresses Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan have said Weinstein sexually harassed them and movie director Judd Apatow and producer Megan Ellison are among those have spoken out in support of them.

Weinstein is the latest U.S. media or entertainment industry titan to face sexual harassment accusations. At Fox News, late Chief Executive Officer Roger Ailes was forced out in 2016 and anchor Bill O‘Reilly resigned in April after similar claims.

More than 50 women have accused comedian Bill Cosby of sexual assault. He faces a retrial in April on the one criminal case against him.","Streep, Judi Dench slam Weinstein over sexual harassment claims",https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-people-harvey-weinstein-streep/streep-judi-dench-slam-weinstein-over-sexual-harassment-claims-idUKKBN1CE1SZ

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As President Donald Trump promotes a tax plan critics say would raise the federal deficit by slashing corporate rates and eliminating some taxes paid by the rich, some three quarters of Americans believe the wealthiest should pay more, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows.

Trump is expected to travel on Wednesday to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he will explain to a group of workers, including many truckers, how he believes they will benefit from his tax plan released two weeks ago.

The president is expected to describe how, if his plan became law, truckers would benefit from proposals to lower tax rates for the middle class, cut taxes paid by the manufacturers whose products they transport, create a new tax category and rate for “pass-through” companies, and eliminate a tax paid by the wealthiest 0.2 percent of estates, a senior administration official said.

Trump has said his tax plan would be a “miracle for the middle class” and spur economic growth by creating a better tax climate for businesses.

Independent analysts have said it would provide uneven tax relief, add to the federal budget deficit and, in some cases, benefit the very wealthy.

Taxpayers in the highest 1 percent of incomes, making more than $730,000 annually, for example, would receive about half of the total tax benefit from Trump’s proposed overhaul, with their after-tax income expected to increase an average of 8.5 percent,

according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based nonprofit.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from Sept. 29 to Oct. 5 found that 53 percent of adults “strongly agree” that the wealthiest Americans should pay higher tax rates.

An additional 23 percent “somewhat agree” the wealthiest should pay higher tax rates, according to the poll of 1,504 people, which had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of plus or minus 6 percentage points.

Trump’s tax framework proposed cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and creating a new category for pass-through income earned by partners and sole proprietors, which would be taxed at 25 percent, instead of the 39.6 percent top individual rate currently paid by some.

It also proposed cutting the top individual rate to 35 percent, but the congressional tax-writing committees fleshing out Trump’s plan may opt to create an additional, higher rate for the highest earners.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian ride-hailing firm Ola has raised $1.1 billion from investors led by China’s Tencent Holdings and Japan’s SoftBank Group and is in advanced talks with other investors for another $1 billion.

The funds will give a leg up to Ola that has been locked in a fierce battle with rival Uber for a bigger piece of India’s $12 billion taxi market. Both firms have already burnt millions of dollars to lure users in a bid to outdo each other.

Ola will use the funds to increase its numbers of drivers and expand its presence to more cities, it said in a statement on Wednesday.

The company, which currently has a majority share of India’s ride-hailing market, operates in 110 cities and has a wide range of transport options including bikes, auto-rickshaws and electric cars. Uber is present in about 30 cities.

It also said it would invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, which includes technologies like its in-car entertainment platform called Play that allows riders to choose music and stream videos.

The company is in advanced talks with U.S.-based financial investors for the second tranche, which would also include funds from existing investors, a source close to the company said, declining to be identified as the talks were not yet finalised.

Once the second tranche is complete Ola would have raised over $2 billion. Prior to this, the company had raised about $1.9 billion since it began operations in 2011.

Uber, valued at about $69 billion, has pumped millions of dollars into India but has not been able to grow its presence at the same speed as Ola.

And with Uber’s new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi focused on portraying the firm as a reformed company that is turning a page on concerns including sexual harassment claims and a U.S. bribery probe, Ola has an opportunity to further extend its lead in India.","Ola raises $1.1 billion in Tencent, SoftBank-led round, seeks another $1 billion",https://in.reuters.com/article/ola-fundraising-copy/ola-raises-1-1-billion-in-tencent-softbank-led-round-seeks-another-1-billion-idINKBN1CG0XL

Four days after a decisive 1-0 win in Bulgaria, Didier Deschamps’s team were never really under pressure and avoided having to go through the playoffs, as they had to reach the 2010 and 2014 finals.

“We did the job, our goal was to qualify first in our group,” France coach Didier Deschamps told a news conference.

Belarus boss Igor Kriushenko said the hosts controlled the game.

“They had speed and they were very careful at the back,” he added.

Deschamps switched from a 4-3-3 to a 4-4-2 formation with Giroud and Griezmann up front, pushing Kylian Mbappe and Alexandre Lacazette onto the bench.

France were the early aggressors but Belarus had the first clear chance when Yuri Kovalev’s low angled shot whizzed just past Hugo Lloris’s right-hand post in the 12th minute.

The hosts went close in the 18th when Rafael Varane’s point-blank header was tipped over the bar by Sergei Chernik.

Kingsley Coman was a constant menace on the right flank and his fine cross in the 21st minute was met by Giroud, whose header crashed onto the bar.

The hosts were rewarded for their efforts six minutes later, however, when Griezmann beat Chernik from close range after a Blaise Matuidi through ball tore the Belarus defence wide open.

They doubled their tally six minutes later as another through ball, this time from Griezmann, was collected by Giroud in the area and the Arsenal forward clinically slid it past Chernik.

It was Giroud’s 28th goal for France.

France’s concentration levels dipped, however, and they were punished on the stroke of halftime when Saroka’s cool finish allowed the visitors to grab a route back into the game.

Yet France maintained control in the second half as Mbappe came on as a substitute for Coman, but made little impact.

Belarus threatened on the break and Deschamps, sensing danger, replaced Griezmann with the more defensive Moussa Sissoko.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three congressional committees are scuffling over a former British spy’s reports that are central to investigations into U.S. allegations that Russia tried to help Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, people involved in the inquiries said.

The dossier assembled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele outlined Russian financial and personal links to Trump’s campaign and associates. The Senate Intelligence Committee and special counsel Robert Mueller are looking into possible collusion between Russia and Trump’s campaign and Mueller’s investigators have met with Steele.

However, the Republican chairmen of the House Intelligence and Senate Judiciary committees are challenging the dossier’s credibility and one has implied that Russians may have played a role in its preparation, sources familiar with the inquiries said.

The duel is not purely partisan. Senator Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Mark Warner, the committee’s ranking Democrat, are leading what other committee members from both parties called a serious effort to pursue the allegations dug up by Steele.

“As I understand it, a good deal of his information remains unproven, but none of it has been disproven, and considerable amounts of it have been proven,” Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an interview with Reuters. He did not elaborate.

Russia has repeatedly denied any interference in last November’s election won by businessman Trump, a Republican, against Democrat and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign or associates.

In a report published in January four U.S. intelligence agencies said they took the dossier’s allegations seriously.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley has been the harshest public critic of Steele, suggesting that Russia might have somehow had influence with Fusion GPS, the U.S. opposition research firm that hired Steele, and that they may have broken U.S. law.

The dossier was first commissioned on behalf of Trump opponents in the Republican primary and then Democrats took it up when Trump became the presidential nominee. Steele met with FBI representatives before the election to discuss his findings.

In a March 6 letter to then-FBI Director James Comey, Grassley wrote: “The idea that the FBI and associates of the Clinton campaign would pay Mr. Steele to investigate the Republican nominee for president in the run-up to the election raises further questions about the FBI’s independence from politics, as well as the Obama administration’s use of law enforcement and intelligence agencies for political ends.”

FILE PHOTO - Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) gives an update on the ongoing investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election at the Capitol Building in Washington, U.S., October 4, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein

Whitehouse, however, said that a July 27 Judiciary Committee hearing called by Grassley was part of a Republican effort to discredit Steele by creating “confusion” and the false impression that Russia paid Steele for the dossier.

“It could not have been clearer that there is no evidence of any Russian role behind the Steele dossier,” Whitehouse said.

A Judiciary Committee aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: “The American people need to be able to trust that the FBI and Justice Department are operating free from political influence. That’s what this investigation is about, and we will follow the facts wherever they lead.”

Despite recusing himself in April from the House Intelligence Committee investigation, the Republican chairman, Devin Nunes, is also trying to discredit Steele’s work, sources familiar with the probe said.

FILE PHOTO - Ranking Member Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) speaks at a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism hearing about Russian election interference on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S. March 15, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein

On Tuesday, Nunes subpoenaed the partners who run Fusion GPS, the U.S. opposition research firm that hired Steele, a source familiar with the matter said.

“This is a blatant attempt to undermine the reporting of the so-called ‘dossier,’ even as its core conclusion of a broad campaign by the Russian government to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election has been confirmed by the U.S. intelligence community and is now widely accepted as fact,” Joshua Levy, counsel to Fusion GPS, said in a statement.

Committee Democrat Eric Swalwell also fired back, saying Nunes told Congress he had recused himself and that issuing the subpoenas would violate that recusal.

“It is also a way to go it alone, not work with Democrats, and it looks like he is trying to again undermine the investigation,” Swalwell said.

Nunes also used his power last month to issue subpoenas to the FBI and Justice Department, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, demanding that they surrender their files on Steele, his dossier, and their investigations into his work.

So far, the Justice Department and FBI have not turned over the information Nunes requested because of the FBI investigation, which is supervised by special counsel Mueller.

(Reuters) - Kroger Co (KR.N), the No. 1 U.S. supermarket operator, said on Wednesday it is exploring the sale of its nearly 800 convenience stores, as it revamps its business amid a market share war among traditional and online food retailers.

Kroger shares jumped 6.4 percent to $21.84.

Liberals have a tricky task ahead, to address two different publics: one alarmed by hate speech and militant messages, the other by measures to stop them.","In a flurry of confident pronouncements within an hour of the massacre at a Las Vegas country music festival, conservative commentators and activists linked the perpetrator, Stephen Paddock, to liberal or Islamist influences. Rush Limbaugh, still the doyen of right-wing talk radio, credited Islamic State with being Paddock’s ideological home, arguing that it was disguised by the liberal media because “for the American left, there is no such thing as militant Islamic terrorism.” Pat Robertson, the socially conservative activist and televangelist, said the shooting stemmed from the news media’s and liberal protesters’ “profound disrespect for our president” and other institutions.

On the other side of the American culture war, a CBS vice president and legal counsel, Hayley Geftman-Gold, posted a Facebook comment that she was “not even sympathetic” to the victims because “country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” Unlike her right wing opposites, she suffered for her opinion: she was fired from what must have been a lawyer’s dream job.

Should any of these comments ­­­− the work of, at most, a few minutes when not that of a few seconds − be the concern of the state? They easily fall into the category of bad taste. Some remarks, especially Geftman-Gold’s sneeringly callous comment – for which she has since apologized – could cause further misery in those seeking to cope with the trauma of injury or loss of someone close to them.

The general opinion, especially in the United States, is that governments should stay out of it. For Washington, the anger such remarks may rouse and the distress they may cause must be endured in deference to the near-absolute right of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

But should we tolerate such verbal brutality? Can it not be “cured?” Do people have to suffer distress because of the voiced prejudices of others who often – as Limbaugh does – make a rich living from their display? There’s a growing faction saying no, and it has reached, at least in Europe, the stage of state action. The European Union Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourova has told the social media giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, that they must eliminate both hate speech and fake news, or face legislation criminalizing them for not doing so. That’s a sweeping statement: unpacking what it might mean in practice takes us deep into an area which should be marked with signs saying: “Danger! Free speech in Peril!”

Fake news is not the same as hate speech, but it can also be used to inflame social tensions. In Italy, the anti-trust chief Giovanni Petruzella has said that EU countries should create government-appointed bodies to remove fake news and even fine the media for violations. But how is fake news to be distinguished, by either artificial or human intelligence, from true news? It’s a delicate operation, since much news striving to be “true” contains false information, and much fake news has the ring of truth and would take careful investigation to disprove.

In Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech. Called, challengingly, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, NetzDG for short, it commands that Facebook and Twitter take down “blatantly illegal” hate speech within 24 hours or, if the offending material is less obviously illegal, in a week – on pain of a fine of up to 50 million euro ($58.6 million). The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech. It merely points to the passage in the German Criminal Code which declares the ""defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations"" illegal. What is defamation? When is one person’s unbearable insult another’s opinion?

Sticks and stones may break my bones/But words will never hurt me” has been a comfort of sorts to those who have been the victims of taunting and insult, but modern psychiatry claims it isn’t so. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, in a careful parsing of what constitutes harmful speech, argues that “there is a difference between permitting a culture of casual brutality and entertaining an opinion you strongly oppose. The former is a danger to a civil society (and to our health); the latter is the lifeblood of democracy.” Speech of the first kind, which “bullies and torments,” is “from the perspective of our brain cells… literally a form of violence.”

Put that way, it appears obvious: the speech which harms should be criminalized, as much as a physical assault, and in parts of Europe it is being so. Facebook, Twitter and Google are now under increasing state and public pressure to clean up their sites, to stop posting material that causes more than distress but, apparently, real damage to the brain. Embattled UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out at the United Nations last month, calling on the tech companies to go much further and faster in combating the dangerous messages they carry.

At a background-only session with Google staff in London this past week, where these issues were broached, I was told that the concerns of governments and the public were registered, and reform was on the way.

When I quoted the view of Fiyaz Mughal, head of the anti-extremist British advocacy organization Faith Matters, that the companies with which he had been working are “not dealing with the problem” because their “bottom line is money,” I was met with an assurance that this was not so. The automatic default of the communications behemoths to absolutism in free speech has been replaced, it was said, by a finer-grained examination of cause and effect, and of what could reasonably be done to address concerns.

It’s true that to juggle the demands of free speech and those of security now constitutes one of the largest ethical and practical problems facing democratic states − and the tech corporations. And it’s also true that even if Mughal is right that the companies’ first care is the bottom line – for which corporation is that not true? – the large fines now being prepared for not heeding the call to reform would be a large incentive to change.

Yet in the course of this complex balancing act, between security and liberty, profit and regulation, there is the danger of substantial damage to the freedoms of speech and the news media which democracies have been able to safeguard for most of the post-World War Two period.

La peine la plus lourde, sept ans, a été prononcée contre le seul absent au procès, Johachim Landwehr, 28 ans, qui réside en Suisse et est sous le coup d‘un mandat d‘arrêt.

Il a été identifié comme étant l‘homme qui a mis le feu à la voiture de police en y jetant un fumigène, avec à l‘intérieur les gardiens de la paix Kevin Philippy et Allison Barthélemy.

La seconde peine la plus lourde, cinq ans de prison dont deux avec sursis, a été infligée à Antonin Bernanos, 23 ans, étudiant et descendant direct de l‘écrivain Georges Bernanos, qui se revendique de la lutte antifasciste.

Ce jeune homme à l‘allure sage a été identifié par un témoin sous X et sur des images vidéo comme étant celui qui a défoncé la vitre arrière du véhicule, par où le fumigène a été jeté, et l‘un de ceux qui ont frappé Kevin Philippy.

Il a constamment nié avoir pris part à l‘agression mais le président du tribunal a rejeté ses dénégations en s‘appuyant sur son “identification formelle”.

(Reuters) - Firefighters battling wildfires in California’s wine country faced the prospect of new outbreaks on Wednesday when dry, windy conditions return to an area where blazes have killed at least 17 people and destroyed 2,000 homes and businesses.

Gusts of up to 50 miles per hour (80 kph) and 10 percent humidity are forecast for later on Wednesday and into Thursday for the region, where 17 fires have forced 20,000 people to flee their homes in one of the deadliest wildfire outbreaks in California history, fire officials said.

“The potential for new fires that could grow exponentially as these fires did in such a short time period is there,” said Lynne Tolmachoff, spokeswoman for California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

The weather had given firefighters a reprieve on Tuesday as cooler temperatures, lower winds and coastal fog let them make headway against the fires that had burned 115,000 acres.

The city of Santa Rosa was particularly hard hit by the so-called Tubbs fire, which damaged a Hilton hotel and destroyed a mobile home park, among other damage. At least 11 people have been killed by that fire alone, officials said. It is the deadliest California wildfire since 2003, when the Cedar fire killed 15 people in San Diego, and the sixth deadliest since records began, according to state records.

FIFA said in a statement that the suspension would prevent Pakistani teams, including the national side, from playing in international competition and the PFF from benefiting from FIFA development and training programs.

“The PFF offices and its accounts remain in control of a court-appointed administrator, which constitutes a violation of the PFF obligations to manage its affairs independently and without influence from any third parties in accordance with the FIFA Statutes,” said FIFA.

“The suspension will be lifted once the PFF offices and access to the PFF accounts are returned to the PFF.”

The U.N. report quoted a 12-year-old girl from Rathedaung township as saying the security forces had surrounded her house and started shooting.","GENEVA (Reuters) - Myanmar security forces have brutally driven out half a million Muslim Rohingya from northern Rakhine state, torching their homes, crops and villages to prevent them from returning, the U.N. human rights office said on Wednesday.

Jyoti Sanghera, head of the Asia and Pacific region of the U.N. human rights office, called on Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi to “stop the violence” and voiced fear that if the stateless Rohingya refugees return from Bangladesh they may be interned.

“If villages have been completely destroyed and livelihood possibilities have been destroyed, what we fear is that they may be incarcerated or detained in camps,” she told a news briefing.

In a report based on 65 interviews with Rohingya who have arrived in Bangladesh in the past month, it said that “clearance operations” had begun before insurgent attacks on police posts on Aug. 25 and included killings, torture and rape of children.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein - who has described the government operations as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing” - said in a statement that the actions appeared to be “a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return”.

“Credible information indicates that the Myanmar security forces purposely destroyed the property of the Rohingyas, scorched their dwellings and entire villages in northern Rakhine State, not only to drive the population out in droves but also to prevent the fleeing Rohingya victims from returning to their homes,” the report said.

It said the destruction by security forces, often joined by mobs of armed Rakhine Buddhists, of houses, fields, food stocks, crops, and livestock made the possibility of Rohingya returning to normal lives in northern Rakhine “almost impossible”.

The campaign was “well-organised, coordinated and systematic” and began with Rohingya men under 40 being arrested a month earlier, creating a “climate of fear and intimidation”.

“We are not in a position to make a finding of genocide or not, but this should in no way detract from the seriousness of the situation which the Rohingya population is currently facing,” said Thomas Hunecke, who led the team that went to Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, from Sept. 14-24.

It was “highly likely” that Myanmar security forces planted landmines along the border in recent weeks to prevent Rohingya from returning, he said, citing doctors treating injuries.

VIOLENCE CONTINUES

Despite growing international condemnation of the crisis, the military campaign is popular in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya, and for Muslims in general, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged.

Myanmar on Tuesday launched its first bid to improve relations between Buddhists and Muslims since the eruption of deadly violence inflamed the communal tension and triggered an exodus of some 520,000 Muslims to Bangladesh.

But Sanghera, noting that 11,000 Rohingya crossed into Bangladesh on Monday alone, said: “Clearly it seems that some level of eviction, displacement, forced movement and violence may be continuing.”

The U.N. experts documented Myanmar security forces “firing indiscriminately at Rohingya villagers, injuring and killing other innocent victims, setting houses on fire”.

“Almost all testimonies indicated that people were shot at close range and in the back while they tried to flee in panic,” the report said.

The U.N. report quoted a 12-year-old girl from Rathedaung township as saying the security forces had surrounded her house and started shooting.

“It was a situation of panic – they shot my sister in front of me, she was only seven years old. She cried and told me to run. I tried to protect her and care for her, but we had no medical assistance on the hillside and she was bleeding so much that after one day she died. I buried her myself.”

The girl did not know what happened to her mother and four brothers, nor her father jailed a month earlier.","'Cynical' Myanmar army operation aimed at preventing Rohingya return, U.N. says",https://in.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya-un/cynical-myanmar-army-operation-aimed-at-preventing-rohingya-return-u-n-says-idINKBN1CG0Z7

MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy took the first step on Wednesday towards suspending Catalonia’s political autonomy and ruling the region directly to thwart a push for independence.

He demanded that the regional government clarify whether it now considered itself independent following a speech by Catalan president Carles Puigdemont on Tuesday night.

This requirement is a necessary step before triggering Article 155 of the constitution, which would allow Madrid to suspend the region’s political autonomy.

Rajoy’s move could deepen the confrontation between Madrid and Catalonia but it also signals a way out of Spain’s biggest political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981.

The prime minister would be likely to call a snap regional election after activating the constitutional mechanism allowing him to do so.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence from Spain on Tuesday night but then immediately suspended it and called for talks with the Madrid government.

“The cabinet has agreed this morning to formally request the Catalan government to confirm whether it has declared the independence of Catalonia, regardless of the deliberate confusion created over its implementation,” Rajoy said in a televised address after a cabinet meeting to consider the government’s response.

Without giving a specific deadline for the Catalan government to reply, Rajoy said: “The answer from the Catalan president will determine future events, in the next few days.”

It is not yet clear if and when the Catalan government would answer the requirement but it now faces a conundrum, political analysts say.

If Puigdemont says he did declare independence, the government would likely trigger Article 155. If he says he did not declare it, then far-left party CUP would likely withdraw its support to his minority government.

“Rajoy has two objectives: if Puigdemont remains ambiguous, the pro-independence movement will get more fragmented; if Puigdemont insists on defending independence then Rajoy will be able to apply Article 155,” said Antonio Barroso, deputy director of London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence.

“Either way Rajoy’s aim would be to first restore the rule of law in Catalonia and this could at some point lead to early elections in the region”.

DIALOGUE CALL DISMISSED

Puigdemont had been widely expected to unilaterally declare Catalonia’s independence on Tuesday after the Catalan government said 90 percent of Catalans had voted for a breakaway in an Oct. 1 referendum that Spain had declared illegal and which most opponents of independence boycotted.

Madrid responded angrily to Puigdemont’s speech, saying the Catalan government could not act on the results of the referendum.

“Neither Mr. Puigdemont nor anyone else can claim, without returning to legality and democracy, to impose mediation... Dialogue between democrats takes place within the law,” Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said.

Invoking Article 155 to ease Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades would make prospects of a negotiated solution to the Catalonia crisis even more remote.

A spokesman for the Catalan government said earlier on Wednesday that if Madrid went down this road, it would press ahead with independence.

“We have given up absolutely nothing...We have taken a time out...which doesn’t mean a step backwards, or a renunciation or anything like that,” Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull told Catalunya Radio.

Socialist opposition leader Pedro Sanchez said he would back Rajoy if he had to activate Article 155 and said he had agreed with the prime minister to open a constitutional reform within six months to discuss how Catalonia could fit better in Spain.

It was not clear how the Catalan government would respond to the offer.

MARKET RELIEF

Puigdemont’s speech also disappointed supporters of independence, thousands of whom watched proceedings on giant screens outside parliament before sadly leaving for home.

Financial markets, however, were encouraged that an immediate declaration of independence had been avoided.

Following Puigdemont’s speech, Spain’s benchmark IBEX share index rose as much as 1.6 percent, outperforming the pan-European STOXX 600 index. The rally pushed the main world stocks index, the MSCI’s 47-country ‘All-World’ index, to a record high.

Spain’s 10-year government bond yield -- which moves inversely to the price -- dropped 5 basis points to 1.65 percent in early trade, according to Tradeweb data.

In Brussels, there was relief that the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy now had at least bought some time to deal with a crisis that was still far from over.

One EU official said Puigdemont “seems to have listened to advice not to do something irreversible”.

The Catalan crisis has deeply divided the northeastern region itself as well as the Spanish nation. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of about 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.

The stakes are high -- losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.

Some of Catalonia’s largest companies have moved their head offices out of the region and others were set to follow if he had declared independence.",Spain takes step towards direct rule over Catalonia's independence move,https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia/spain-takes-step-towards-direct-rule-over-catalonias-independence-move-idINKBN1CG1I6

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar edged higher on Wednesday against its U.S. counterpart as oil prices rose and the greenback dipped against a basket of major currencies.

At 9:24 a.m. ET (1324 GMT), the Canadian dollar CAD=D4 was trading at C$1.2492 to the greenback, or 80.05 U.S. cents, its strongest level of the day. It was up 0.2 percent.

The currency’s weakest level of the day was C$1.2530. It had touched on Friday its weakest in five weeks at C$1.2600.

Prices of oil, one of Canada’s major exports, rose for a third day as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said the market was gradually tightening after years of oversupply, but that the 2018 outlook was less certain.

U.S. crude CLc1 prices were up 0.35 percent at $51.10 a barrel.

Uncertainty that President Donald Trump would push through his planned tax reforms pressured the U.S. dollar .DXY, while relief that Catalonia had stopped short of formally declaring independence from the rest of Spain boosted the euro.

The loonie got a boost on Tuesday from domestic housing starts data that showed less softening than investors had expected, while data on Friday showing a pickup in wages calmed worries that the economy will slow in the second half of the year.

But renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, under which Canada sends about 75 percent of its exports to the United States, could weigh on the currency.

The operation was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters. But it was not as provocative as previous ones carried out since Trump took office in January.

The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Chafee, a guided-missile destroyer, carried out normal maneuvering operations that challenged “excessive maritime claims” near the Paracel Islands, among a string of islets, reefs and shoals over which China has territorial disputes with its neighbors.

China’s Defense Ministry said on Wednesday that a warship, two fighter jets and a helicopter had scrambled to warn the U.S. ship away, adding it had infringed upon China’s sovereignty and security with its “provocation”.

China would further strengthen its naval and air defenses, the ministry said.

“We demand the U.S. side earnestly take steps to correct its mistakes,” it added.

Related Coverage China says U.S. violated its sovereignty in South China Sea

Speaking earlier at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China had lodged “stern representations” with the United States, and reiterated that the Paracels were Chinese territory.

“China will continue to take resolute measures to protect Chinese sovereign territory and maritime interests. China urges the U.S. to conscientiously respect China’s sovereign territory and security interests, conscientiously respect the efforts regional countries have made to protect peace and stability in the South China Sea, and stop these wrong actions.”

Next month, Trump makes his first visit to Asia as president, including a stop in China, which he has been pressuring to do more to rein in North Korea. China is North Korea’s neighbor and biggest trading partner.

Unlike in August, when a U.S. Navy destroyer came within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built up by China in the South China Sea, officials said the destroyer on Tuesday sailed close to but not within that range of the islands.

Twelve nautical miles mark internationally recognized territorial limits. Sailing within that range is meant to show the United States does not recognize territorial claims.

The Pentagon did not comment directly on the operation, but said the United States carried out regular freedom-of-navigation operations and would continue to do so.

China’s claims in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in shipborne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.

Experts and some U.S. officials have criticized former president Barack Obama for potentially reinforcing China’s claims by sticking to innocent passage, in which a warship effectively recognized a territorial sea by crossing it speedily without stopping.

The U.S. military has a long-standing position that its operations are carried out throughout the world, including in areas claimed by allies, and that they are separate from political considerations.

The United States has said it would like to see more international participation in freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea.

NORTH KOREA ISSUE

Trump’s trip to Asia will likely be dominated by the North Korean nuclear threat. He will also visit South Korea, Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines.

In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, all in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Trump’s visit to China will reciprocate a trip to the United States made in April by Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

The East Midlands club have not won in the league since a 2-0 victory over Brighton and Hove Albion in August, but Shakespeare has persisted with the side’s tried-and-tested 4-4-2 line-up.

The Englishman said he is not adverse to change but the success of a different system would lie in how his players understand their responsibilities and carry them out on the pitch.

“I think you always have to be adaptable,” Shakespeare told the Leicester Mercury (www.leicestermercury.co.uk).

“When you change a shape it is important you make sure they understand their roles and responsibilities. You also have to make sure you have time to work on it,” he added.

”If you are coming up against a three-man midfield you might match them up. Ultimately, it is what you are comfortable with as a team and what the players are comfortable with because sometimes their thoughts are important.

“It is not the be-all and end-all but as a coach, you pick your team and shape accordingly.”

Ahead of their home tie against 10th-placed West Bromwich Albion on Monday, Shakespeare said he had been encouraging his players to move more off the ball.

“One of the areas recently where we have really got into the players about their work without the ball, getting it back and playing higher up the pitch.”

Leicester are just above the Premier League drop zone with five points from seven games.","Leicester players must be tactically flexible, says Shakespeare",https://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-england-lei-wba/leicester-players-must-be-tactically-flexible-says-shakespeare-idINKBN1CG213?il=0
