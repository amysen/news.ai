In the interview earlier this month, Mr. Techmanski said he was confronting logistical problems in Puerto Rico.","Mr. Bhatia said the authority did not appear to have made any open requests for proposals, to have performed any regular background checks or to have followed normal safeguards and checks before awarding the contract.

The House Committee on Natural Resources said on Tuesday that it was looking into the contract. Parish Braden, the committee’s communications director, said that members of the panel would travel to Puerto Rico this week to seek more answers about the details of the contract and how it was reached.

Also on Tuesday, after a report about the contract by The Washington Post, Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the circumstances surrounding Whitefish’s contract.

After Maria, the island’s power authority, known as Prepa, did not follow the path of most other public utilities after a disaster and activate “mutual aid” agreements to rush in utility workers and equipment to restore power. In Florida, for example, 18,000 workers were called in from out of state to help restore power after Hurricane Irma.

The American Public Power Association, the trade organization that coordinates mutual aid for municipally owned utilities, said they never got a request for aid from Puerto Rican authorities, nor the assessments needed to respond, a spokeswoman said.

Instead, Ricardo Ramos, the chief executive of the Puerto Rican power authority, turned to Mr. Techmanski. In an interview on Oct. 10, Mr. Techmanski said he got the job because he was the first to show up on the island — on Sept. 26, six days after the storm hit — and because he didn’t ask for any payment in advance.

Mr. Techmanski and Puerto Rican officials signed the contract at a conference table in an office without power, using their cellphones for light, said Ken Luce, a spokesman for Whitefish Energy. The contract awarded Whitefish an initial payment of $3.7 million and set a maximum value of $300 million.

The work covered by the contract — repairing high-voltage transmission lines in Puerto Rico’s mountainous interior — represents just a small fraction of the enormous problems affecting Puerto Rico’s 2,400 miles of transmission lines. More than a month after Maria, 75 percent of the island is still without power.

Mr. Luce, the company spokesman, said Mr. Techmanski had worked as a utility lineman and power-company executive for more than 20 years in the United States and abroad. His hometown, Whitefish, is also home to the Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke.

The two men know each other, and Mr. Zinke’s son had a job this past summer working on a Whitefish project in Washington State, according to officials with the company and the Interior Department.

But Interior officials as well as Mr. Techmanski said the secretary had not helped Whitefish Energy obtain the contract or held any meetings or taken any action on the company’s behalf.

“We both come from the same town,” Mr. Techmanski said of Mr. Zinke. “I knew him before he was a politician. But other than that, other than informing him that we were here, we have not requested anything from him.”

The Interior Department sent 50 people to Puerto Rico on Sept. 21, the day after the storm hit, to help with response and recovery operations, including assessments.

In western Montana, where Mr. Techmanski is based, a city councilman and a Chamber of Commerce official said they knew little about him or his business. Two Texas-based firms, HBC Investments and Flat Creek Capital, are investors in Whitefish Energy, as is the Brazilian company Comtrafo Transformers.

In Washington State, Whitefish Energy has done utility repair work for the Chelan County Public Utility District, which was completed “on time and on budget,” a spokeswoman for the group said. In Montana, the company currently has a deal with the Flathead Electric Cooperative to deliver a transformer to a power substation in Libby by the end of the year.

The company has also secured at least three federal Department of Energy contracts since September 2016 for work totaling about $1.5 million, according to federal data.

In Montana, one ambitious effort by Mr. Techmanski has not gotten far. He toured a closed aluminum plant in Columbia Falls, Mont., last December and spoke of revitalizing it as a manufacturing plant for transformers, according to news reports and local officials.

But the contaminated plant is on the government’s list of Superfund sites, making any development there vexing, and the plans do not seem to have advanced, local officials said.

In the interview earlier this month, Mr. Techmanski said he was confronting logistical problems in Puerto Rico. He said he was struggling to find hotel rooms for workers, and that he had considered trying to set up camps for them.

Mr. Techmanski added that he was the best person for the job, despite the difficulties getting workers on the ground.","From Montana to Puerto Rico, a Small Firm Strikes a Powerful Deal",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/from-montana-to-puerto-rico-a-small-firm-strikes-a-powerful-deal.html

At this point in Puerto Rico’s recovery, cooking and distributing too much free food could swamp the emerging economy, he said. Even though 75 percent of the island is still without power and relies largely on bottled water, officials report that about 89 percent of grocery stores have reopened, and small restaurants and roadside stands are starting to sell food.

“An NGO has no right taking money away from business,” said Mr. Andrés, 48, who immigrated to the United States from Spain.

At its peak, Mr. Andrés’s operation cost about $400,000 a day, including transportation and hotel costs for chefs and staff members he flew in from some of the 27 restaurants in his company, Think Food Group. He also paid to use some venues, and paid people like food-truck owners who took meals into isolated neighborhoods that had received little or no other support.

The money came from donations to World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit association of chefs that Mr. Andrés established in 2011 after he traveled to Haiti to help that country recover from an earthquake that killed more than 220,000 people.

Popular chefs like Mario Batali, Eric Ripert and Guy Fieri and celebrities including Lin-Manuel Miranda and Anthony Bourdain began sending money early. Laurene Powell Jobs, Steve Jobs’s widow, gave $1 million after she visited. Several business provided support, including Goya Foods, whose helicopter ferried supplies to remote areas.

Last Saturday, World Central Kitchen signed a $10 million contract with FEMA to produce 120,000 meals a day for two weeks. Other pieces of Mr. Andrés’s operation will likely feed people through Thanksgiving. And other organizations will continue to distribute millions of shelf-stable “meals ready to eat” and boxes of canned food, dried meat, beans and rice.

The Red Cross said Tuesday that since the storm struck, it had distributed 1.4 million pounds of pantry items and 540,000 meals and snacks to 40 communities. Every day up until Wednesday, it was handing out 400 of Mr. Andrés’s sandwiches and as much fruit.

A fight over taxes would be particularly rough on a Republican Party already fraying on the edges. The potential for further dissolution was strikingly apparent on Tuesday, when Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, blistered his party and President Trump in announcing his plans not to seek re-election. Mr. Flake’s broadsides came on the heels of a morning spat between Mr. Trump and another retiring Republican senator, Bob Corker of Tennessee, which exposed the growing rifts between old-guard conservatives and Mr. Trump’s new-wave populists in Washington.

In the face of those divides, Republican leaders retreated to the only safe ground they have left: a partisan, fast-tracked tax bill, which party leaders hope to introduce next week in the House and deliver to Mr. Trump’s desk by Christmas. The stakes are rising by the day, as Republican donors and voters watch the intraparty dispute unfold and worry about the party advancing the legislative priorities it has long espoused, let alone holding its congressional majorities in the 2018 midterms.

Pressure is only increasing on Republican lawmakers, with conservative commentators and other observers saying failure on a tax bill is not an option.

“I’ve sensed this shift in just the last couple of weeks. I think the Republicans are finally figuring out if they don’t pass this, the political consequences are going to be catastrophic,” said Stephen Moore, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation who is advising Mr. Trump on tax policy. “The attitude of the conservative base is, ‘If they don’t do this, they’re worthless.’”

Large donor groups are particularly blunt on this point. “Passing tax reform is critical for Republican lawmakers, and they are building momentum to get it done,” said James Davis, an executive vice president at Freedom Partners, which is part of the billionaire Koch brothers’ network of political groups.

The comity of a tax cut was evident only on Tuesday, as Republicans appeared to come apart at the seams over their party’s president.

Mr. Flake announced his retirement from the Senate floor in a speech that criticized Mr. Trump and scolded other Republicans for supporting the president’s at times erratic behavior in the White House, while Mr. Corker accused Mr. Trump of “debasing” the country with his approach.

Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, sought to bridge the gap by invoking the tax bill that is expected to be introduced in both the Senate and the House next month.

“Tax reform is what we are about,” Mr. McConnell said. “If there’s anything that unifies Republicans, it’s tax reform.”

Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said that he did not think that Mr. Trump’s dispute with Mr. Corker, which sprawled across social media on Tuesday, “changes our efforts on tax reform.”

The cohesion harkens to the roots of a party that for decades identified along free-market, limited-government lines, but is now increasingly embracing the nationalistic policies of Mr. Trump. The conservative columnist Robert D. Novak once quipped that “God put the Republican Party on earth to cut taxes,” a line many Republicans still invoke today.

The effort to cut taxes was already going to be tough, given the magnitude of the business and individual income tax cuts Republicans are considering and their ability to offset the enormous cost. Finding common ground will get only more difficult as Republicans worry about their political futures and the effect on their constituents from the various tax changes under consideration.

Polling suggests Republican voters subscribe less to the tax cut philosophy than their elected representatives. A report this week from the Pew Research Center, based on polling from August, found that “Republicans were not especially unified in support of tax cuts,” said Carroll Doherty, the center’s director of political research. “Over all, there was some division of opinion even among conservative Republicans, with about half supporting lower tax rates for corporations.”

A September poll from the online survey company SurveyMonkey found that three-quarters of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents approve of cutting corporate taxes, which is the centerpiece of the tax plan Republicans are expected to put forth next week. The same poll, and a related October SurveyMonkey survey, found a divide in the Republican Party on the issue: Republican voters who approve of Mr. Trump were far more likely to approve of corporate tax cuts and to say that they believe their individual taxes will fall next year.

The divisions in the party do not, at this point, appear to imperil the tax-cutting effort. Mr. Corker is widely viewed as having prevailed in pushing for specific limits on the cost of any tax cuts in the Republican budget. And Mr. Flake — Tuesday diatribe aside — is still viewed as a likely “yes” on whatever tax bill makes it to the Senate floor.

Still, the baby has yet to be born, and it is an open question whether its arrival will patch the divisions that are threatening to rupture the party.",Tax Cuts Are the Glue Holding a Fractured Republican Party Together,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/us/politics/republican-party-tax-cuts.html

Mr. Murdoch pointed to how the company dealt with Roger Ailes, the founding chairman of Fox News who was ousted after a sexual harassment lawsuit exposed a culture at the network where women said they were harassed and feared reporting complaints. As for Mr. O’Reilly, who was pushed out in April after the public exposure of a series of settlements involving him, Mr. Murdoch said, “there was a harassment complaint, and we ended his employment there.”

Mr. Murdoch did not address how at the time that the company renewed Mr. O’Reilly’s contract it was aware of other settlements involving Mr. O’Reilly.

“It is easy, I think, from the outside, to look at it and say, ‘Well, didn’t you know that?’” he said. “We made a decision that is clear, and I hope sends a really strong signal to all of my colleagues, to everyone in the industry, etc., that actually there are behaviors that are not to be tolerated, and we will continue to strive to live up to that.”

On Tuesday, a federal appeals court in Washington sided with the girl, sending the case back to a lower court, which immediately ordered the Trump administration to allow the girl to obtain an abortion “promptly and without delay.”

The girl remains in custody at a federally funded shelter in Brownsville, at the tip of South Texas.

You know that part in “Jurassic Park” when Dr. Grant and the kids are about to get chomped by velociraptors, but the Tyrannosaurus rex shows up and demolishes the raptors with her superior jaws? And you kind of forgive the T. rex for the first half of the movie when she was insatiably hungry for child meat, because in the end she stuck her neck out, as only a dino could, so our heroes could get away?

That’s how I feel when Megyn Kelly goes in on Fox News and Bill O’Reilly. Except, of course, that Kelly, unlike a fictional dinosaur, has been through some truly horrific sexual violations, including vile and gendered comments from a man who is now the president of the United States, as well as an online silencing campaign that will most likely continue for as long as she refuses to capitulate. (Though, by the same token, that T. rex, as far as we know, has never gone on television and insisted that “Santa just is white.”)

It’s a long, silly way to express the conflict at the heart of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” Sometimes the enemy of your enemy is still your enemy. Kelly spent more than a dozen years as part of the Fox News machine, churning out the same brand of soft propaganda that helped lead to the Iraq war, the Tea Party and, eventually, “fake news” and President Trump.

Kelly happily trafficked in racist tropes for profit — black communities have a “thug mentality,” asking repeatedly whether the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown were necessarily related to race — until her own dehumanization at the hands of Roger Ailes, O’Reilly and others became untenable. If you’ve heard the term “white feminism” tossed around your social media feeds, this is a prime example: fighting for freedom and justice as far as the boundaries of your own identity and not beyond.

It’s an unfortunate reality that Kelly’s stature as a right-of-center icon confers a degree of credibility that the Fox News rank and file — and, let’s be honest, the public — withhold from the traditional heralds of the ills of rape, abuse and sexual harassment: feminists. Activists and scholars who devote their lives to the study of gender-based violence and its legislative and social amelioration have been systematically smeared as reactionary liars. America’s traditionalist wing has set a tidy trap: The more you actually know about the way abuse functions, the less seriously you’re taken.

“There is a lot of pain,” Ms. Vardalos said.","This wasn’t the first time that someone in the Newman Theater had reacted emotionally to a monologue by Ms. Vardalos or one of her three castmates, in the play she adapted from Cheryl Strayed’s book of the same name, based on her long-running online advice column, “Dear Sugar.” It is now in its second iteration at the Public after a critically acclaimed run last fall. (Ms. Strayed now collaborates with Steve Almond on the Sweet Spot column for the Thursday Styles section of The New York Times and its accompanying podcast Dear Sugars.)

Earlier that evening, in fact, another young woman, sitting in the third row, started crying at the point when Sugar told of how her mother had never lived to see her granddaughter wear the red dress the two women had bought impulsively at a yard sale years earlier.

And she started up again — this time more loudly — near the end of the show when the character played by Teddy Cañez narrated the tale of a father who had lost his only son at age 22.

“I felt I had to carry her through the show,” Ms. Vardalos said. “We must listen constantly, not just to each other, acting and reacting, but also to what is going on in the audience. Because the audience becomes part of the performance.”

Any play is going to have its challenges, of course, from complicated monologues to quicksilver scene changes to the distractions of cellphones going off or someone snoring away in the front row. (“Oh, yes, I’ve seen that as well,” Ms. Vardalos said.)

But “Tiny Beautiful Things,” with its tales of untimely death, a miscarriage that still haunts years later and sexual assault — all taken from the letters written to Ms. Strayed and then her often deeply personal responses — has an emotional rawness that seems to grab audiences in unexpected ways. (Of course, not every story is a sad one: At least one monologue, about a sexy Santa, gets laughs every night.)

“If you have 300 people in the theater, then the odds are someone is there on the anniversary of someone they loved passing away, or maybe of a relationship ending,” said the director Thomas Kail. “So something that may mean nothing to you might resonate deeply with the person sitting behind you.”

After a recent Sunday matinee, four old friends — two visiting from Canada, two living in New York — gathered on the sidewalk outside the Public to reflect on the play they had just seen.

“It was like group therapy,” Carolyn McAskie, 71, said to her friends, laughing.

“I know,” responded Roxanne Carrillo, 65. “I believe it was 90 minutes, but it felt much shorter, like I had just left a 50-minute session with my shrink.”

On another night, Monique Bernstein, 28, stood in the lobby of the Public, holding a program for Ms. Vardalos to autograph while wiping away traces of the tears she had shed during the last extended monologue, about the father mourning his son.

“I had read the book and I loved it,” she said. “But there is something about seeing it with an audience, as opposed to just reading a book by yourself, that is sort of a bonding experience. Like there was a woman sniffling behind me, and I’m like, ‘I don’t feel so bad!’”

It’s been almost exactly a year since “Tiny Beautiful Things” was staged at the Public the first time around, selling out its brief run, and both Ms. Vardalos and Mr. Kail (a Tony Award winner for “Hamilton”) say they see small but significant differences in how audiences are now reacting.

The theater itself may be one reason the tears seem to be flowing so freely in the current production. Mr. Kail said the move to larger house — the original venue, the Shiva Theater, held 99 seats; the Newman, more than three times that — has made the experience more intimate, not less so, by letting the audience “slip into the anonymity of darkness.”

The Newman is both narrow and deep, with lights from the stage reflecting only on audience members in the first few rows.

“There is something about the length of the theater, and the darkness that unfolds, that allows deep reactions to come out,” Mr. Kail said. “And that was one of the questions we had when we first started working on this: Can we bring a group of people together, people who have never met, sitting shoulder to shoulder in the dark, and really get them to unlock?”

Mr. Kail said he was in the audience the night the young woman burst into her howl of anguish. “Each person on that stage, all four of them, were affected in their own way,” he said. “They each had to grapple with what it meant to hear someone who was clearly in pain. It opened up and expanded the show in ways I hadn’t seen on other nights.”

After each performance, Ms. Vardalos exits through the lobby of the Public, signing autographs, posing for selfies, even laughing and joking with people who might have been choking back tears in their seats a few minutes earlier but now are thrilled to meet the star of “My Big Fat Greek Wedding.”

But not every night.

“Sometimes, I will have been so affected by what happens in the audience, that I don’t come out right away,” she said. “I need to just sit by myself. I know people are waiting — and as actors, we aim to please — but there are times I can’t come out. I just can’t.”

Both she and Mr. Kail say they believe that there is something beyond the changed physical space that is causing such profound emotional reactions this time around. And that is the country itself.

Deep wounds that remain from a divisive presidential election. White supremacists marching in Charlottesville. The massacre in Las Vegas. Hurricanes in Houston, Florida and Puerto Rico. The threat of nuclear war with North Korea. All are factors the two believe may make people hungry to find comfort in the theater.

“We are also so different now,” Mr. Kail said.

A fight over taxes would be particularly rough on a Republican Party already fraying on the edges. The potential for further dissolution was strikingly apparent on Tuesday, when Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, blistered his party and President Trump in announcing his plans not to seek re-election. Mr. Flake’s broadsides came on the heels of a morning spat between Mr. Trump and another retiring Republican senator, Bob Corker of Tennessee, which exposed the growing rifts between old-guard conservatives and Mr. Trump’s new-wave populists in Washington.

In the face of those divides, Republican leaders retreated to the only safe ground they have left: a partisan, fast-tracked tax bill, which party leaders hope to introduce next week in the House and deliver to Mr. Trump’s desk by Christmas. The stakes are rising by the day, as Republican donors and voters watch the intraparty dispute unfold and worry about the party advancing the legislative priorities it has long espoused, let alone holding its congressional majorities in the 2018 midterms.

Pressure is only increasing on Republican lawmakers, with conservative commentators and other observers saying failure on a tax bill is not an option.

“I’ve sensed this shift in just the last couple of weeks. I think the Republicans are finally figuring out if they don’t pass this, the political consequences are going to be catastrophic,” said Stephen Moore, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation who is advising Mr. Trump on tax policy. “The attitude of the conservative base is, ‘If they don’t do this, they’re worthless.’”

Large donor groups are particularly blunt on this point. “Passing tax reform is critical for Republican lawmakers, and they are building momentum to get it done,” said James Davis, an executive vice president at Freedom Partners, which is part of the billionaire Koch brothers’ network of political groups.

The comity of a tax cut was evident only on Tuesday, as Republicans appeared to come apart at the seams over their party’s president.

Mr. Flake announced his retirement from the Senate floor in a speech that criticized Mr. Trump and scolded other Republicans for supporting the president’s at times erratic behavior in the White House, while Mr. Corker accused Mr. Trump of “debasing” the country with his approach.

Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, sought to bridge the gap by invoking the tax bill that is expected to be introduced in both the Senate and the House next month.

“Tax reform is what we are about,” Mr. McConnell said. “If there’s anything that unifies Republicans, it’s tax reform.”

Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said that he did not think that Mr. Trump’s dispute with Mr. Corker, which sprawled across social media on Tuesday, “changes our efforts on tax reform.”

The cohesion harkens to the roots of a party that for decades identified along free-market, limited-government lines, but is now increasingly embracing the nationalistic policies of Mr. Trump. The conservative columnist Robert D. Novak once quipped that “God put the Republican Party on earth to cut taxes,” a line many Republicans still invoke today.

The effort to cut taxes was already going to be tough, given the magnitude of the business and individual income tax cuts Republicans are considering and their ability to offset the enormous cost. Finding common ground will get only more difficult as Republicans worry about their political futures and the effect on their constituents from the various tax changes under consideration.

Polling suggests Republican voters subscribe less to the tax cut philosophy than their elected representatives. A report this week from the Pew Research Center, based on polling from August, found that “Republicans were not especially unified in support of tax cuts,” said Carroll Doherty, the center’s director of political research. “Over all, there was some division of opinion even among conservative Republicans, with about half supporting lower tax rates for corporations.”

A September poll from the online survey company SurveyMonkey found that three-quarters of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents approve of cutting corporate taxes, which is the centerpiece of the tax plan Republicans are expected to put forth next week. The same poll, and a related October SurveyMonkey survey, found a divide in the Republican Party on the issue: Republican voters who approve of Mr. Trump were far more likely to approve of corporate tax cuts and to say that they believe their individual taxes will fall next year.

The divisions in the party do not, at this point, appear to imperil the tax-cutting effort. Mr. Corker is widely viewed as having prevailed in pushing for specific limits on the cost of any tax cuts in the Republican budget. And Mr. Flake — Tuesday diatribe aside — is still viewed as a likely “yes” on whatever tax bill makes it to the Senate floor.

Still, the baby has yet to be born, and it is an open question whether its arrival will patch the divisions that are threatening to rupture the party.",Tax Cuts Are the Glue Holding a Fractured Republican Party Together,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/us/politics/republican-party-tax-cuts.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

You know that part in “Jurassic Park” when Dr. Grant and the kids are about to get chomped by velociraptors, but the Tyrannosaurus rex shows up and demolishes the raptors with her superior jaws? And you kind of forgive the T. rex for the first half of the movie when she was insatiably hungry for child meat, because in the end she stuck her neck out, as only a dino could, so our heroes could get away?

That’s how I feel when Megyn Kelly goes in on Fox News and Bill O’Reilly. Except, of course, that Kelly, unlike a fictional dinosaur, has been through some truly horrific sexual violations, including vile and gendered comments from a man who is now the president of the United States, as well as an online silencing campaign that will most likely continue for as long as she refuses to capitulate. (Though, by the same token, that T. rex, as far as we know, has never gone on television and insisted that “Santa just is white.”)

It’s a long, silly way to express the conflict at the heart of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” Sometimes the enemy of your enemy is still your enemy. Kelly spent more than a dozen years as part of the Fox News machine, churning out the same brand of soft propaganda that helped lead to the Iraq war, the Tea Party and, eventually, “fake news” and President Trump.

Kelly happily trafficked in racist tropes for profit — black communities have a “thug mentality,” asking repeatedly whether the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown were necessarily related to race — until her own dehumanization at the hands of Roger Ailes, O’Reilly and others became untenable. If you’ve heard the term “white feminism” tossed around your social media feeds, this is a prime example: fighting for freedom and justice as far as the boundaries of your own identity and not beyond.

It’s an unfortunate reality that Kelly’s stature as a right-of-center icon confers a degree of credibility that the Fox News rank and file — and, let’s be honest, the public — withhold from the traditional heralds of the ills of rape, abuse and sexual harassment: feminists. Activists and scholars who devote their lives to the study of gender-based violence and its legislative and social amelioration have been systematically smeared as reactionary liars. America’s traditionalist wing has set a tidy trap: The more you actually know about the way abuse functions, the less seriously you’re taken.

To do that, they must contain the revenue losses from reducing tax rates, both over the next decade and in the years to follow.

The party’s most difficult fights will be over how to do that — by some combination of eliminating popular tax breaks and employing accounting maneuvers, such as setting some tax cuts to expire, in order to reduce revenue losses.

Mr. Corker stands as a possible impediment to that plan. A longstanding opponent of rising federal deficits, the senator has said he will not vote for any tax bill that would increase the federal debt by a dollar. But on Thursday, the House is expected to give final approval to a budget blueprint that would protect a 10-year, $1.5 trillion tax measure from a Democratic filibuster.

A Treasury Department report released on Friday showed that the budget deficit for fiscal 2017 grew by $80 billion, to $666 billion, as federal spending eclipsed revenues and economic growth remained tepid. At the same time, Congress is contemplating what the president has promised would be the largest tax cut in history.

The protracted Tuesday-morning brawl quickly spread from taxes and debt to foreign policy and the president’s fitness for office.

Mr. Corker said Mr. Trump was “absolutely not” a role model for the children in America.

“I don’t know why he lowers himself to such a low, low standard and debases our country,” Mr. Corker said in a CNN interview, suggesting that he will soon convene hearings to examine the ways Mr. Trump “purposely has been breaking down relationships around the world.”

Mr. Trump and Mr. Corker have been locked in a public feud for weeks. Mr. Corker has said that Mr. Trump runs his White House like a reality TV show, and Mr. Trump has responded by mocking Mr. Corker’s height, calling him “Liddle’ Bob.”

Mr. Trump has made declarations about the tax plan while the legislation is still being drafted. On Monday, Mr. Trump said the plan would not include any changes to how much Americans can save in tax-deferred retirement plans like 401(k) accounts.

“Hopefully the White House will step aside and let that occur in a normal process,” Mr. Corker said on NBC’s “Today.”

Any tax plan would need all the Republican support Mr. Trump can get in the Senate, and his fight with Mr. Corker puts that support in jeopardy.

“I think it’s fine for him to come over,” Mr. Corker said of the president’s visit to Capitol Hill. “I do look at these things as more of a photo op. They’re not really about substance, but more power to him.”

The Republicans have promised the most sweeping revision of the tax code in decades, a challenging task that has already met Democratic opposition. Some supporters of the tax overhaul are concerned Mr. Trump’s streaming comments on the plan could hurt chances of getting it approved.","Trump and Corker Escalate Battle Over Taxes, in Personal Terms",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/trump-corker-feud-dog-catcher.html

“I’m wondering if these fellows are vying for the idiots of the year award or the idiots of the century award,” she said.

The Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection said on Monday that it was investigating the episode. It said the men could each face a fine of 15,000 Australian dollars, around $11,700, if they are found to have deliberately interfered with the crocodile trap.

The department said it condemned “in the strongest possible terms the stupid and reckless interference with crocodile traps.”

“It should go without saying that if a crocodile trap is deployed it is because there is a crocodile in the vicinity,” the department said, “so the best advice would be to leave the trap alone and exercise Crocwise behaviour.” Interfering with a trap, it said, could pose a threat to public safety and “be potentially life-threatening for the person concerned.”

The department issued a long list of crocodile-related warnings and guidelines in response to the picture and advised residents of North Queensland to assume that there are crocodiles in all of their waterways, whether they see a crocodile warning sign or not.

It also warned that people should be careful around bodies of water at night and keep their distance from crocodile traps, even when on a boat.

Anyone going fishing, it said, should stand back from the water’s edge and not wade in to bring back a lure. Campers should set up tents at least 50 meters, or 164 feet, from the water’s edge.

Don’t leave food or garbage lying around, the department said. And don’t provoke, feed or “harass” any crocodiles.

But perhaps the most important rule?

I believe I’ve now provided enough bone fragments so you can confidently reconstruct the rest of the dinosaur. To spare you the effort, here’s a précis. The weathered 50-somethings Atalanta and Barry, who grew up together in Providence, are mismatched with the shallow 20-somethings Freddie and Patty, who once had a disastrous affair. As hot-blooded Mediterranean stereotypes (though Patty is Puerto Rican) they cannot help but bay at the moon, write terrible poetry and shout the wrong names during sex. The play’s burden, like that of any number of romantic roundelays, is to get these wounded lovebirds repaired and re-paired before anyone is killed.

Not that the knives and fists brandished onstage ever get close to doing real damage. The play is too superficial for that. Rather, the deadliest (and funniest) weapon wielded in “The Portuguese Kid” is the ferocious stink-eye of Mary Testa as Fausta, the dragon mother to end all dragon mothers. (Her last name, alas, is Dragonetti.) “I pray to God I never have to violate these eyes with the sight of you again,” she snarls at Atalanta when the widow shows up at Barry’s office for help resolving a … tax problem.

Did I mention there’s a plot? Well there is, sort of, involving Atalanta’s various dead husbands and a real estate deal, but it doesn’t make sense. Mr. Shanley is more interested in the sound of conflict and reconciliation than in the actual details. He thus spends the first two scenes of “The Portuguese Kid” burying images the way a squirrel buries nuts, and the last two scenes trying to dig them back up. The result may sound like a play and look like a play but it isn’t a play — it’s just a collection of nuts.

Perhaps it would have been more convincing if Mr. Shanley hadn’t hired himself to direct. A strong countervailing force might have encouraged him to look beyond the sitcom laugh track — and might have informed him that his spice rack of gender and ethnic stereotypes (women are paradoxes; Puerto Ricans are firecrackers) has gone stale. The designers, all tops in their fields in other productions, might have found a less garish palette, too; “The Portuguese Kid” looks like a picture book designed for children with cataracts.

Certainly a better director would have done more than let the play coast on the sorely tried inventiveness of its stars. Ms. Scott is incapable of being uninteresting, even when furiously working to forge a character out of punch lines. And Mr. Alexander mines a surprising amount of truthfulness, if not from his role as written then from himself. Despite their ingenuity, the 100-minute play moves like a kicked horse: fast but grudging.

This is all a shame, if not a surprise. Mr. Shanley, who has proved himself capable of great dramatic discipline in works like the Pulitzer Prize-winner “Doubt” (2004), has of late been exploring his shaggier side. At least in “Outside Mullingar” (2014) and the autobiographical “Prodigal Son” (2016) it was still possible to feel that he was making deliberate choices to play with genre. There was something to take away if you were willing to suspend disbelief and work at it.

But in “The Portuguese Kid,” I fear he is no longer writing; he’s scrapbooking. Here’s the page about Atalanta, the huntress of Greek mythology who killed any suitor who could not defeat her in a race.

We’re taking “Selfies” at each of our vacation stops, with a hilarious editorial acknowledgment of the selfie phenomenon in the circled/shaded squares (they all say “ME.”)

Each of the theme entries is a destination where Ms. Gray takes a selfie and then updates her Facebook status with the photo and a description of where she is. For example, at 16D she waxes (sorry) eloquent about visiting MADAM TUSSAUD’S museum: “Facebook Status: ‘Vegas, baby!

Rather than setting rates for each energy provider based on its production costs plus a reasonable return on investment — as FERC’s top-down regulation used to do — the agency has moved steadily to let the market set prices.

As renewable energy has come online, FERC has also worked to level the playing field, allowing wind and solar power to compete too, along with strategies that manage demand, like agreements with customers to reduce consumption when prices spike. These policies have benefited consumers by controlling costs, fostering innovation and helping to advance lower-polluting energy.

Mr. Perry’s proposal would override this pro-market trajectory to benefit the Trump administration’s handpicked energy sources.

A policy reversal this momentous would normally require a strong justification, grounded in a theory of market failure, with sound evidence to back it up. Yet Mr. Perry’s proposal is so bare-bones that it failed even to define “resiliency,” an ambiguous term that evokes the grid’s ability to bounce back from unusual and unforeseen disruptions.

Selectively subsidizing coal and nuclear power is not the most obvious or best way to bolster the grid against sudden events. Nuclear plants already run nearly full-time, and coal plants are relatively slow to ramp up and down, making neither especially helpful if the grid suddenly needs more energy.

At the same time, wind power and strategies that reduce demand, like contracts with heavy electricity users to cut consumption when the system is stressed, helped grid operators manage the 2014 polar vortex, when bitterly cold temperatures struck parts of the East Coast. Why not pay these electricity providers for their contributions to resiliency?

To implement his policy, Mr. Perry must depend on FERC. The 1977 law that created the Department of Energy allows the energy secretary to propose but not to finalize rules for electricity markets.

Arbitrarily singling out coal and nuclear plants for special payments seems to violate the Federal Power Act’s requirement that FERC ensure no “undue discrimination” in electricity markets. So far, there is no evidence that would warrant intervening in the otherwise competitive markets the agency has so carefully nurtured.

Indeed, in response to Mr. Perry’s proposal, Robert Powelson, one of the three current FERC commissioners, and a Trump appointee, pledged not to “destroy” the electricity markets. “Markets have worked well and markets need to continue to work well,” he said this month. Another commissioner, Cheryl LaFleur, also expressed serious reservations.

Eight former FERC commissioners, from both parties, recently sent a letter to the agency opposing Mr. Perry’s plan after the agency requested comments. “Subsidizing resources so they do not retire would fundamentally distort the markets,” they warned. “The subsidized resources would inevitably drive out the unsubsidized resources, and the subsidies would inevitably raise prices to customers. Investor confidence would evaporate and markets would tend to collapse. This loss of faith in markets would thereby undermine reliability.”

Mr. Perry’s proposal to FERC also seeks to dramatically compress the normal timeline for approving such a complicated rule, shrinking a process that typically takes many months to a matter of weeks. This procedural anomaly prompted an outcry from nearly all of the affected stakeholders, from utilities to grid managers, who protested that there is no reason to rush.

Just this summer, the head of the North American Electric Reliability Council told Congress that “the state of reliability in North America remains strong, and the trend line shows continuing improvement year over year.”

Nevertheless, FERC has moved forward, putting the proposal out for public comment and creating uncertainty for the industry.

This process could still end well. FERC might ultimately reject Mr. Perry’s proposal because it runs contrary to decades of agency policy. Or, if FERC genuinely wants to bolster the resilience of the electricity system, it could scrap Mr. Perry’s plan and start fresh.

A good-faith proposal would start by offering a detailed definition of “resilience” that reflects the modern electricity system. It would explore the broad range of options our highly integrated and networked regional grids make available to strengthen the system’s performance — including natural gas, wind and solar power, strategies to reduce demand, and technology-based approaches that make grids operate more flexibly. Any provider that demonstrably enhances the grid’s capacity to withstand disruptions through any of these means should be eligible for additional revenue. This approach would harness market competition to incentivize innovation.

And if Congress wants to help nuclear energy, which is struggling to compete economically, it could adopt a carbon tax, which would favor nuclear power since it produces carbon-free electricity.

The difference between being in ninth grade, or a senior in college, or even a catering grunt on the cusp of 30, and now, when I am an actual, indisputable grown-up, is that I can put together a real straight-up, sit-down dinner party in two hours rather than two months. I still cut branches and collect interesting grasses on a morning walk. And my decades of spending school and rent money on yard-sale cotton cocktail napkins, silver nut picks, pearl-tipped hors d’oeuvres forks and ivory-handled cake servers means I can set a beautiful and interesting table in 10 minutes.

And I am now dead sure that the food of a dinner party wants to be made entirely in the home by that home’s cook, with all of that home’s idiosyncrasies writ large. If there is even a whiff of professional chef on the plate, your dinner party is off to a lousy start and won’t recuperate. Someone will invariably be compelled to take a photograph on her smartphone even before the salad course has been cleared, and then, as far as I’m concerned, we will have gathered for some fetishistic, unsavory purpose not meant for the home.

Table Talk Small talk need not be soporific. Before the dinner party, try to find some recent news items or weird science stories that people most likely haven’t heard about. Did you know that music is beneficial to cats undergoing surgery? Or that there is a library in Norway that is amassing 100 never-before-read books that no one can check out for 100 years?

The Martinez cocktail on this night is batched, not because I want to be slick but because I have a whisper-thin, gorgeous glass pitcher that I found for $11 at a Value Village when I was a grad student and that I am thrilled to have the opportunity to use. And while it may come off as an out-of-reach cheffy move to call for feuille de brick for the borek — and to offer no easy-to-source substitute — that is wholly a reflection of the Type A, rather rigid facet of my personality, not of my profession. I am just not ever going to be the kind of girl who says, “Go ahead, if you can’t find pigeon, make the pigeon pie with boneless chicken breasts.” Go find the brick; it’s an uncommon delight, shatteringly crisp and unusual, and most important, it’s the correct ingredient for the recipe.

But just because the cocktail is ready to pour over ice upon guests’ arrival, and the fried borek with halloumi and parsley and grape leaves is even better if fried a few minutes in advance of the party’s start, I’m still, always and forever, going to be about 10 minutes late. I’ve come to believe this is a necessary part of the successful dinner party — these decades later my good friends know this, too. They know to shepherd the uninitiated guests. Pile the newbies’ coats in the bedroom, take their flowers and get them right into water while I am still toweling off and combing my hair. And then we will roll out from there, take our seats around the table, open the wines and pour. The braised leeks and the lentils and the roasted rabbits will be resting on the sideboard. People will pass their plates to be served. At some point, you will tell your one good joke, which you got from your father. And the dessert — walnuts and tangerines and bars of bitter chocolate — will be set out when the candles have shrunk. By now, almost everyone at the table will know that there are more candles in the drawer, and that there is more brandy to be poured, and that we will be sitting around that table for many more hours, twisting the foils in our fingers as we linger.

HOUSTON — A pregnant undocumented teenager in federal custody whose attempt to have an abortion set off a monthlong legal battle with the Trump administration terminated her pregnancy on Wednesday morning. She underwent the procedure a day after a court ruling forced federal officials to allow it.

The teenager, who is 17 and is identified in court documents as Jane Doe, tried to illegally cross the border in Texas in early September and was apprehended. Her pregnancy was discovered during a physical exam, and since then she had been fighting in court to have an abortion.

In a statement released by her lawyers and her court-appointed guardian, Jane Doe, who had been nearly 16 weeks pregnant, wrote of coming to the United States with dreams of one day becoming a nurse, and of not being ready to be a parent.

“My lawyers have told me that people around the country have been calling and writing to show support for me,” Jane Doe wrote in her statement. “I am touched by this show of love from people I may never know and from a country I am just beginning to know — to all of you, thank you. This is my life, my decision. I want a better future. I want justice.”

Lawyers and advocates for the girl accused federal officials of preventing her from having an abortion and of taking extraordinary steps to persuade her and other undocumented pregnant minors to have their babies.

On Tuesday, a federal appeals court in Washington sided with the girl, sending the case back to a lower court, which immediately ordered the Trump administration to allow the girl to obtain an abortion “promptly and without delay.”

The girl remains in custody at a federally funded shelter in Brownsville, at the tip of South Texas.

The Justice Department did not immediately comment on her abortion.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — If you were not aware what a Wall Street reformer might want, you will learn it today in Jules Markey’s puzzle. This was a nice midweek theme that kept its secret until the very end for me.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Markey offers us a list theme of phrases that feel fresh: Three of the four make their New York Times Crossword debuts today, as does the revealer. Hidden in each phrase is a word that can be used before the word “BANKS,” and solvers are directed to those words by the circled/shaded squares.

For example, at 17A, the answer to the clue “Weave or tailgate, say” is DRIVE RECKLESSLY. The revealer at 62A, BREAK UP THE BANKS, is a hint that the ultimate answer to 17A is RIVER BANKS.

Tricky Clues

1A/1D: Were you flummoxed by the “Drug referenced in ‘The Joyous Cosmology’ ”? Here’s how to solve that one: First, it’s only three letters, so that narrows things down quite a bit. Second, 1A is fairly easy: The famous LOCH Lomond is in Scotland. With the L in the first square, the answer has to be LSD.

18D: R.V. TRIP is a bit random to my ears, but I know people vacation in Winnebagos.

50D: I didn’t know the director Hal ASHBY, although I know the film “Shampoo” that he directed. I guessed at ASHER, realized it was wrong when I solved 70A’s YMCAS, and guessed again at ASHBY.

Constructor Notes

The idea for this puzzle came during the election season of 2016. The revealer was heard and seen quite often at many campaign rallies, and it’s 15 letters long! It was quite natural then to try to turn it into a puzzle theme. I first thought to use the names of some banks in phrases but found that really wasn’t working, so i quickly settled on types of banks instead. What you see are the theme entries I first came up with, I’m pretty happy with the 4-1; 1-2-1; 1-4; 1-2-1 break patterns. After acceptance, I sent Will a version with all the theme entries spanning the grid, but he felt the fill had been too compromised, so he stayed with this version. Thanks to Will, Joel and team for polishing it up. I hope it was a pleasurable solve.

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

Photo

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.



The photographs will be on view in an exhibit at Morrison Hotel Gallery, New York, from Nov. 9, 2017.

Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, credited Mr. Flake as a “team player” and man of high principle after Mr. Flake’s speech. But Mr. McConnell quickly turned the Senate floor back to a minor debate over a budget point of order.

It was a jarring transition in a day of political shocks.

In a stunning one-two assault, Mr. Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Mr. Flake took on the president in terms rarely, if ever, heard from members of a sitting president’s party.

Mr. Corker, who has been feuding with the man he once contemplated serving as vice president, accused Mr. Trump of serial lying and debasing the office.

Mr. Flake, who has been a persistent Trump foe since 2016, never mentioned Mr. Trump by name in his remarks. But there was no doubt who he was talking about when he pointed to the “indecency of our discourse” and the “coarseness of our leadership,” and suggested his beloved Republican Party was being complicit in an “alarming and dangerous state of affairs.”

“We must never regard as normal the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals, we must never meekly accept the daily sundering of our country,” Mr. Flake said.

But Mr. Corker, Mr. Flake and Mr. McCain remain the outliers. Mr. Corker’s exceedingly harsh assessment of Mr. Trump — delivered in a series of morning TV interviews in a reasonable, studied tone — and Mr. Flake’s announcement and damning speech bookended what was to be the initial centerpiece of a day on Capitol Hill intended to get lawmakers and the president on the same page with a difficult tax debate looming.

Mr. McConnell left his lunch with Mr. Trump and members of the caucus to emphasize the issues that bind congressional Republicans to Mr. Trump and play down the divisions underscored by Mr. Flake and Mr. Corker.

“There’s a lot of noise out there,” said Mr. McConnell, who made clear what the interests of the party are. “Tax reform is what we are about.”

Photo

That statement defined the reluctance of other congressional Republicans to challenge Mr. Trump too directly. They have been willing to look past some actions and pronouncements by Mr. Trump that they consider beneath a president in hopes of pushing into law some of their long-sought goals, the most important of which are tax cuts. And with no substantial legislative achievements so far, the party is all in on a tax overhaul, recognizing that failure to deliver one will be a political disaster. That necessity ties them tightly to Mr. Trump, at least for now.

To be sure, there are Republicans in both the Senate and the House who are fully committed to the president and reject the views expressed by Mr. Flake or Mr. Bush, who recently expressed remorse about political “discourse degraded by casual cruelty” — an obvious reference to the Trump era in Washington.

But many others see Mr. Trump more as a means to an end, a way to enact their agenda since the president, as Mr. McConnell is fond of saying, is the only American who can sign a bill into law.

Mr. Flake’s remarks were a warning against that kind of thinking, the idea that some accomplishments — if they ever come — could compensate for the continuing upheaval and discord emanating from Washington and somehow reset the nation’s course.

“With respect and humility,” he said, “I must say that we have fooled ourselves for long enough that a pivot to governing is right around the corner, a return to civility and stability right behind it.”

Mr. Flake and Mr. Corker, along with Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain, represent significant cracks in the Republican wall of support and deference to the president despite widespread misgivings within the party. But they have nothing to lose politically.

“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

Nearly a month has passed since Stephen Paddock opened fire on a country music festival at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more — yet the shooting continues to confound the public and investigators alike. Little is known about Mr. Paddock’s motives. And investigators have revised parts of the timeline of the shooting on three occasions, raising further questions about what exactly happened.



During continuing investigations into major events, traditional reporting often relies in part on official statements from law enforcement officers. But in this case, faced with shifting reports, The New York Times wanted to try to establish a timeline independent of that offered by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.

The Times’s video unit, where I am a producer focused on visual and open data investigations, turned to a relatively new technique: investigative video reporting, or so-called video forensics, pioneered and developed by a small community of human rights groups and niche social journalism outlets over the last decade. Its greatest value is in documenting hard-to-reach places like war zones, but the tools can be used wherever there’s an abundance of visual evidence. (In May, a Times video debunked Syria and Russia’s claims about a chemical weapons attack; in June, another video identified 24 men, including members of the Turkish president’s security detail, who attacked protesters outside the Turkish ambassador’s Washington residence.)

The approach makes use of every available piece of data in a given set of video files: the videos themselves and every pixel we see in the images, but also the audio tracks and the metadata — timestamps, geolocation information — embedded in the files. The files can come from social media uploads or submissions from witnesses themselves (most cellphone videos log the hour, minute and second they were recorded in file data).

The process can be as simple as comparing a video with Google Street View to identify camera location or extracting file data with a smartphone app — or as difficult as analyzing each frame of a video and the amplitude and frequency of every second of audio.

For our video investigation on the Mandalay Bay shooting, published over the weekend, I gathered and annotated dozens of videos and audio clips recorded at various locations — inside the festival, at the hotel itself and on Las Vegas Boulevard and Giles Street, where the police responded and concertgoers fled. And I searched social platforms and downloaded clips that were verified by wire services, ending up with well over an hour of footage and two hours of police scanner and fire scanner audio.","Reporting on Las Vegas, Pixel by Pixel",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/insider/reporting-on-las-vegas-pixel-by-pixel.html

Perhaps my husband, a biographer who has spent much of his professional life searching for documents, had not been able to stand seeing the journals sitting out with the trash? Or I had misremembered, wishing I’d thrown them out but not quite able to?

In any event, there they were and we were awash in memorabilia. It was a life phase that no one had told us about: one in which a massive wave of objects, each representing a distinct shard of time, broke over us.

It arrived carrying with it the weird, disquieting distortions that all too often accompany memory. Our brains focus easily on the present and on the deep past, but the stuff between is elastic, dilating and contracting unpredictably. Whole swaths of time simply don’t compute for us. Whenever I’m faced with a standard online form requiring my birthday, I stare in bafflement as I scroll down the long column of years.

The reappearance of my diaries was disorienting. They didn’t feel like a quaint remnant of the past. They felt deeply, unpleasantly familiar: the baby-blue, fake-leather cover with “My Diary” stamped in gold letters with its little lock and key. My self-conscious 12-year-old entries seemed as if I’d written them yesterday: “I see myself with complete clarity reading this page … thinking how long ago that was when I was merely a schoolgirl not even in high school. I’m already that person of the future.”

Oh yeah? Well, here I am and I remember all too well being that annoying person writing in the diary.

So why save these remnants? In the past, relatives faded graciously into oblivion. Becoming dead and then even deader, as they were no longer known by anyone living. Their descendants easily maintained the illusion that their ancestors had never been real, breathing people like themselves. The ancient couples were quaint in the stiff, sepia photos posing in their Sunday best or in jerky 16-millimeter home movies. Or there were no images at all and they simply got out of the way when their time was over. They ghosted themselves.

To make matters even more complicated, our recent relatives, armed with endless videos, create their own highly edited narratives — virtual motion pictures — preserving what seems to them most engaging, flattering or fun. You won’t find their pictures of them eating lunch at their desk, sleeping contorted in the confines of an overnight flight, waiting on a subway platform or watching TV reruns. It’s all been a great holiday!

Will new generations need storerooms for this ever-increasing load of familial documentation? Actually, we may be the last one to have our experiences annealed to physical objects. In the future, descendants as well as historians will be able to experience their subjects’ lives virtually in real time through emails, texts, Facebook entries, Instagrams, videos. It’s exhausting to contemplate. TMI.

Yet for now, these lingering objects haunt us. Undoubtedly my patient was right. When we discard a person’s accumulated possessions, we are throwing out the record of a life. The soft thump of the garbage bags on the landing tells of a small, soft death. Is it necessary? Yes. But it’s an erasure that’s irrevocable.

Broadly speaking, it is a protectionist policy that limits foreign competition in shipping. Without it, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has argued, thousands of American jobs would be outsourced.

What are the arguments for and against repeal?

Opponents of the Jones Act, on both sides of the aisle, argue that it serves special interests and unfairly burdens some Americans in the process.

“If the government wants to subsidize the continuation of a maritime industry, it should do it with a direct subsidy, not these indirect methods that impose large costs on the territories, particularly Puerto Rico,” said Barry P. Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the left-leaning think tank.

The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank, has said that the law amounts to little more than a “legislative gift to the shipping industry.” And, in introducing a bill last month to repeal the law, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, argued that it had outlived its purpose.

In 2013, the World Trade Organization described the Jones Act as “the most restrictive” protectionist shipping or transport law in the world, calling it an “anomaly” in the otherwise open market of the United States. Even China, which has similar restrictions in place, lacks a requirement that vessels be made locally, the organization noted.

In arguing for a longer-term waiver, Puerto Rican officials say they need all the help they can get. “It couldn’t hurt. It couldn’t hurt to have it,” Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told CBS News on Oct. 9, a day after the waiver expired.

Defenders of the Jones Act argue that the act is needed to counter protectionist policies abroad and to give the military a pool of vessels and sailors to rely on in times of need.

Without it, the nation would either have to build its own expensive fleet to carry cargo or “pay exorbitant prices” for naval vessels and rely on foreign carriers to move critical military supplies, the Lexington Institute, a Washington-area policy research group, said in a 2011 report.

“Ninety years after it became law, the Jones Act continues to be vital to national security needs,” it concluded.

What would repeal look like?

Many studies have found that repealing the Jones Act would contribute hundreds of millions of dollars annually to the American economy. It would also eliminate a policy that has been blamed for driving up gas prices, moving some Texas oil to refineries abroad, and, reportedly, a decision by at least one cattle rancher from Hawaii to put his cows on a plane.

But the effect of repeal may be complicated for Puerto Rico. While it may have increased costs for some goods there, it also created a “discrete” and predictable market between the mainland United States and the island, according to a 2013 report by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office.

Under the Jones Act, a handful of American shippers provide regular service to Puerto Rico, bringing perishable goods like dairy, meat and agricultural products as well as other supplies, the report found. Foreign carriers typically operate on longer, global routes, with less-reliable service.

Repealing the law would probably lead to the outsourcing of shipbuilding and associated jobs, the report said. Loosening its requirements would make it easier for foreign carriers to compete, most likely pushing down shipping costs, according to the report.

But the effect on prices would depend on other factors, including how the government regulated those new carriers and what business decisions they made in response to the new opportunity in Puerto Rico.

“So many factors influence freight rates and product prices that the independent effect and associated economic costs of the Jones Act cannot be determined,” the agency concluded, after reviewing research and interviewing shipping industry experts.

In a 2012 report on the economic challenges facing Puerto Rico, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York acknowledged the complications associated with repeal, but suggested that a temporary reprieve from the Jones Act — for, say, five years — could help clarify its effects.

“Trends in shipping costs, volumes, and business practices could be monitored,” the bank wrote. “At the end of the period, a review could assess the costs and benefits to determine if this exemption should be made permanent.”",Would Repealing the Jones Act Help Puerto Rico?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/jones-act-puerto-rico.html

“Our team members — a diverse community of gate agents, pilots, and flight attendants — are proud to serve customers of all backgrounds,” the spokeswoman, Shannon Gilson, said in a statement. “Every day American is committed to providing a positive, safe travel experience for everyone who flies with us.”

Ms. Gilson said that N.A.A.C.P. representatives would be invited to American Airlines headquarters in Fort Worth, Tex., to discuss the issue.

“We are committed to having a meaningful dialogue about our airline, and are ready to both listen and engage,” she said.

Ms. Williams said that she believed the pilot’s actions were racially motivated based on the language he used with her, particularly since he referred to her as “belligerent” and “a threat” even as she was holding her infant daughter.

She called for the airline to grant pilots less discretion, saying that it would make it harder for their biases to affect passengers.

“Because they’re allowed to do whatever they want to, then if a pilot does have racist or misogynist or homophobic characteristics, then they’re able to utilize them to further oppress members of disenfranchised groups,” she said.

On Wednesday, the airline sent a message to employees signed by its chief executive, Doug Parker, emphasizing that the company’s mission was in line with that of the N.A.A.C.P. and that it would not “tolerate discrimination of any kind.”

Now, almost a year into the Trump presidency, a similar dynamic is playing out. There is a small but significant Republican opposition to Trump, but its leading figures still don’t want to go to war with him directly, preferring philosophical attacks and tactical withdrawal to confrontation and probable defeat.

Bob Corker, part of the dying-in-the-dark-isn’t-so-bad caucus during the primary campaign (and when he seemed to hope for a cabinet appointment), has become a fierce Trump critic — but only after deciding to retire from the Senate. George W. Bush and John McCain have each given speeches that read like broadsides against Trump — but very general critiques of his worldview, not political attacks on the man himself. And now Jeff Flake of Arizona has delivered a barnburner of a Senate address about the civic costs of the Trump presidency — while simultaneously declaring that because he can’t win his primary in a Trumpified party, he won’t even stay and fight it out.

To the extent that there’s a plausible theory behind all of these halfhearted efforts, it’s that resisting Trump too vigorously only strengthens his hold on the party’s base, by vindicating his claim to have all the establishment arrayed against him.

But the problem with this logic is that it offers a permanent excuse for doing nothing, no matter how bad Trump’s reign becomes. (“I’d criticize him for accidentally nuking Manila, but you know, then Fox News would just make it all about me …”) In the end, if you want Republican voters to reject Trumpism, you need to give them clear electoral opportunities to do so — even if you expect defeat, even if it’s all but certain. And an anti-Trump movement that gives high-minded speeches but never mounts candidates confirms Trump’s claim to face establishment opposition while also confirming his judgment of the establishment’s guts and stamina — proving that they’re all low-energy, all “liddle” men, all unwilling to fight him man to man.

If Corker really means what he keeps saying about the danger posed by Trump’s effective incapacity, he should call openly for impeachment or for 25th Amendment proceedings — and other anti-Trump Republicans should join him. If Flake really means what he said in his impassioned speech, and he doesn’t want to waste time and energy on a foredoomed Senate primary campaign, then he should choose a different hopeless-seeming cause and primary Trump in 2020. George W. Bush should endorse him. So should McCain, and Corker, and Romney, and Kasich, and Sasse, and the rest of the anti-Trump list. They should expect to lose, and badly, but they should make Trump actually defeat them, instead of just clearing the field for his second nomination.

And not only for the sake of their honor. The president’s G.O.P. critics should engage in electoral battle because the act of campaigning, the work of actually trying to persuade voters, is the only way anti-Trump Republicans will come to grips with the legitimate reasons that their ideas had become so unpopular that voters opted for demagoguery instead.

A speechifying anti-Trumpism, distant from the fray, will always be self-regarding and self-deceiving — unwilling to see how the Iraq War discredited both the Bushist and McCainian styles of right-wing internationalism, incapable of addressing the economic disappointments that turned voters against Flake’s Goldwaterite libertarianism and Romney’s “trust me, I’m a businessman” promises. Only in actual political competition can the Republican elite reckon with why it lost its party, and how it might win again without succumbing to Trumpian indecency.

I don’t expect this to happen; indeed I think the G.O.P. is more likely to be renewed by someone who currently supports Trump or someone not yet active in politics than it is by the men resisting the president today. The Republican establishment, like the House of Lords a century back, has the feel of a fated and superannuated institution that no stratagem can save.

The Way We Shop Now You’ll Wear What They Tell You to Wear Subscription clothing services should make you feel great. Shouldn’t they? The authors Emily Gould and Rumaan Alam investigate.

As so many emotional journeys do, this one began with me expressing disgust on Twitter. In this instance, I was angry about the proliferation of lifestyle-touting subscription clothing services. I’d recently seen ads for Bombfell on the subway (“If shopping isn’t your bag, you’re going to love our box”) and hit a personal tipping point.

Clothing delivery services seem somehow dystopian, and although I was freaked out by them, I didn’t fully understand why. Twitter people rushed to fill me in, as I’d hoped they would.

Clothing subscriptions provide a utilitarian uniform for cubicle-bound automatons, people said. They enforce a kind of fascistic conformity, like Mao suits but more cheaply made and less chic. They infantilize us in the same way that meal kit delivery services do: by replacing labor done by someone who might care how we’re fed or what we’re wearing (say, a loving parent) with labor done by workers at the bottom rung of a start-up, or even maybe by an algorithm designed to take key words and turn them into outfits.

It sounded so much worse than I’d even imagined, and of course this made me want to find out more. So Rumaan Alam and I decided to make ourselves his ’n’ hers guinea pigs in a harrowing experiment: Together, we would try out the experience of several of the most popular subscription services. We would take notes on our experiences and compare them. In doing so, we would learn a truth. Are clothing subscriptions the Soylent of fashion — or are they maybe just a fun and convenient new way to shop?

The deal: Seven days to return before you get charged; average price, $89 an article.

RUMAAN:

Newfangled clothing subscription services are at heart good old-fashioned businesses, in that they make so many promises that it’s impossible to keep them all. If you have someone at home all day or your UPS driver knows where to hide boxes behind your garage, the promise is convenience. If you live far from any stores or simply don’t have time to shop, the promise is access. If you feel overwhelmed by shopping, the promise is attention. If you feel underwhelmed by shopping, the promise is novelty. If you don’t care about fashion, they’ll care for you; if you do care about fashion, they’ll be your clothes buddy.

Like so many entities that pledge to disrupt, the subscription service model exchanges one set of hassles for another, more modern, set of hassles. Spend time with the computer instead of a sales clerk. Visit the post office instead of your local shop.

My first subscription was to Bombfell, the ubiquitous Instagram advertiser that sounds like a Roger Moore-era Bond film. The enrollment process emphasizes the user over the clothing; you describe your body type, your general style, and indicate anything you know you have no interest in, like boot-cut jeans or graphic tees. (Check, and check.)

I am someone who is interested in fashion, which doesn’t put me outside Bombfell’s target demographic, because what the company sells is something I’m interested in too: ease. I appreciate that the delivery was fast and the customer service attentive. The pricing was not an issue because you pay only if you keep the clothes Bombfell sends you and I returned everything.

In my enrollment, I told Bombfell that I was simply too busy to shop, that I had a modern sense of style. They sent me a long sleeve tee, a chambray shirt, a pair of brown pants and a pair of faded black jeans, all perfectly serviceable. This was more like the clothing a mother might choose for an adult son, rather than what I expect from a stylist, even if that’s just a term of art for a customer service representative.

Especially galling, I thought, was the long sleeve tee, which Bombfell assured me was a design that was theirs alone. Exclusivity is meant to be alluring, but it’s hard not to reason that per some arrangement, every customer, no matter his style or needs, is going to be sent this particular garment. Part of this site’s appeal is, I think, its prices, but I refuse to pretend that $68 is a fair price for a cotton tee.

The deal: Rent as many “totes” as you like and return when you’re done — or use their purchase service .

EMILY:

I started with Le Tote because I get served its Instagram ads most often, and because one Twitter dissenter had mentioned finding it useful when starting a new job. It also seemed to be the cheapest and most flexible of all the services; you can wear the clothes for as long as you want and then send them back, which spurs the shipment of a new box, purportedly styled just for you.

All the options it showed for outfits you would potentially wear seemed irretrievably wack to me, but Le Tote does allow you to choose what’s in your shipment from a set of options, to which it adds a few “fun” extras. My first Tote contained a striped shirt, a faux suede moto jacket, a pair of leggings with Nike written up the side, and (fun!) a vending-machine-quality ring and a floral scarf. The whole thing cost $147, if I wanted to buy it all, which I did not; $147 seemed expensive, considering the plastic fast-fashion quality of the clothes in it.

I did end up keeping the leggings with Nike written up the side because they seemed as if they wouldn’t fall off my butt during yoga if I ever go to yoga again. You win this one, Le Tote. But not any other ones, because I canceled after that shipment.

I was left with one burning question. Is Le Tote a play on words? A “litotes” is a figure of speech that uses deliberately exaggerated understatement to make a point, like “not bad” or “it’s not my first rodeo.” Like “Le Tote clothes aren’t the best I’ve ever worn.” I’m guessing it’s not a play on words, actually.

The deal: You’re sent five things, you try them, return what you don’t like. Bonus fun: You get 25 percent off if you buy all five.

RUMAAN:

Stitch Fix is in the business of style more than convenience. You can hear it in the very name, the notion that your wardrobe is something that can be fixed, and that will in turn fix your life. The style questionnaire is more rigorous than Bombfell’s, more granular, and I could imagine my fellow consumers answering those queries mindful of what the right articles of clothing might do for them. That’s part of fashion’s promise, that a girlfriend or boyfriend or a promotion are just one tie or sweater or pair of shoes away.

Bombfell emphasizes its personal touch, showing you a head shot of the stylist who’s assisting you. Stitch Fix doesn’t work quite the same way; you’re welcome to send a note to your stylist, but to me it felt like sending a note to an algorithm. Anyway, I requested some blazers. I was sent two, both perfectly serviceable if not quite what I want in a blazer.

The trade-off for the convenience of trying something on at home is that you don’t have access to much variety. Presumably, over time, your stylist (or the algorithm) will learn to anticipate your tastes, the way we’re told online advertising works. Of course, when I’m online, I find I see mostly advertisements for things I’ve already bought.

I can see how the subscription model would appeal to the entrepreneurs who adapted it in this manner . Being sent a box feels like receiving a present, and while paying for what’s inside may not be top of mind, of course, the company has your credit card on file. It’s easy enough to return what you don’t want, but it’s easier still to keep what you don’t want.

My husband tried on one of the blazers and declared that he wanted it. It was only when I pointed out that it was $200 that he noticed that the shoulder didn’t fit quite right, that the cut was not altogether flattering.

The deal: You approve your trunk preview, and after it arrives you have five days to return or buy the six to 10 items in a trunk.

EMILY:

I next tried Trunk Club Women, also based on Twitter recommendation — this one from a woman who swore that the app’s stylist had heeded her very specific requests and that she’d ended up buying several of the items from her first trunk. Unlike Le Tote, Trunk Club is expensive. You also get to have a chat with a person who is definitely not a bot about your style preferences. I actually loved this process so much.

Doubters (like Rumaan!) told me, “Well, you could have that experience at any department store, especially at Nordstrom, which owns Trunk Club.” But the illusory intimacy of digital interaction made me so much more honest with Sophie, the stylist, than I would have ever been with a stranger IRL. Very quickly, she learned about me that I teach undergrad creative writing, that I almost never wear florals or bright colors, that I usually wear boots or sneakers and jeans and a button-front shirt, and that I still have a postpartum gut even though my son is 2½.

I admitted that I was unlikely to ever wear anything bodycon and described my ideal aspirational aesthetic as “rich L.A. lesbian.” The results were so shockingly on point that there were two items in my first Trunk preview that I had to delete, not because I didn’t like them, but because I already owned them.

The experience of trying all these clothes on at home instead of in a Nordstrom dressing room, however, was not actually that luxurious. I found the box big and daunting, and it sat around unopened for days while I waited to have enough time set aside to do a little in-home fashion show for myself. But five days is all you get with Trunk Club, and once its emails started to take on a slightly chiding tone, I worried that the company would charge my credit card for thousands of dollars worth of clothes. So late one afternoon, I opened the box.

I made yes, no and maybe piles, and there was a very cozy cashmere/wool blend long sleeve Vince sweater dress in the maybe pile that seemed like the kind of thing that might be worth its $400 price tag. I was in the process of trying it on a second time when disaster struck. I had been standing on my coffee table to look in my apartment’s only mirror, and without warning the table collapsed underneath me!

My first concern, as I assessed the damage, after I determined that I hadn’t sustained anything worse than a big, rapidly purpling butt bruise, was that the scrape on my hand had maybe gotten some blood on the dress. It hadn’t, but the dress seemed somehow tainted anyway. I ended up sending it back.

I also sent back a denim pencil skirt, a Bond-villainess scuba dress and a white silk top that had looked a little bit frumpy even on the lissome teenager who modeled it on the website. I kept a soft cropped sweater and a black velvet Eileen Fisher T-shirt that I wore later that week to a dinner to celebrate my 36th birthday, which seemed appropriate.

The deal: For a $60 flat fee, you’re sent a couple of new items each month.

RUMAAN:

Stitch Fix and Bombfell use technology and language to reinvent the low-end and midrange department store experience. FiveFour Club is more like a web version of a boutique with a subscription model thrown in for good measure. Instead of appealing to customers with the siren song of a personal stylist, FiveFour charges a price of admission in exchange for regular deliveries of its own branded clothing. (There is also a web store, membership not required.)

The aesthetic here is minimal, sporty and young, so fashion-aware that it’s hard to envision who the consumer is. While it’s true we don’t all live in ZIP codes with street wear boutiques, the same person who logs onto FiveFour can log on to eBay. In exchange for my $60 membership fee, I was sent a windbreaker and a tee, both in lackluster shades of brown. On a lanky 19-year-old, they’d look stylish. On anyone else, they look like two garments that cost $30 each.

Wouldn’t I like to be a lanky 19-year-old? Of course. Fashion is about fantasy. Here in reality, FiveFour got my $60 and I’ve got these clothes I’ll never wear. Those few of us who never read Marie Kondo still have those fashionable mistakes lurking in our closets. I’m sort of fond of them, those past selves that never came to be. I’ve spent many hours of my life browsing in stores.

At 21, I admired clothes I couldn’t afford. At 30, I bought them. At 40, I sometimes go simply for the pleasure, of seeing what is new, of learning what counts as beautiful now.

So what, if anything, have we learned? One old lesson, at least. Shopping for clothes is time consuming, it’s tiring, and it can feel like a waste of an autumn afternoon. So you can subscribe to a service that makes your life simpler, although it may come at the expense of expressing who you are. You can also subscribe to the notion that there’s still pleasure in some of life’s chores. In the flesh, you can touch a wool jacket or a cashmere sweater as you imagine who you might be if each belonged to you.

All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted.
Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago.

“These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty.","Silent clues to a violent past are buried among the scores of mass graves that dot Chungui district in the mountainous Ayacucho region of Peru. There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

Photo

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

His remarks echo the concerns of Japanese and other automakers in Britain, like Germany’s BMW, which makes the Mini in the country. They worry that Brexit could add to their costs and complicate the flow of vehicles, components and employees between Britain and the Continent.

Indeed, if the British government does not manage to negotiate barrier-free access to the European market after Brexit, vehicles made in the country “may face an import tariff” of perhaps 10 percent, according to Peter Wells, a professor at the Cardiff Business School. That could hurt the competitiveness of mass-market manufacturers’ Britain-based operations.

Toyota, he said, may be particularly vulnerable because it manufactures both cars and engines in Britain. A high proportion of British content might put the company’s vehicles into a foreign-made category elsewhere in Europe.

So far, carmakers in Britain have been patient, and moved ahead with investments necessary to keep their plants on track.

Toyota, for instance, said in March that it would invest 240 million pounds, or $315 million, to upgrade its plant in Burnaston, England, with the British government kicking in a further £21 million for items like training and research.

Overall investment, though, appears to be sliding downward.

According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a trade group, publicly announced investments in the British car industry fell to £1.7 billion last year, from £2.5 billion in 2015. That trend appears to be accelerating, with the figure totaling £647 million in the first half of this year. The trade group attributes the falling numbers to the carmakers holding back from commitments until they see how Brexit is likely to play out.

“I think the issue is clarity more than anything else,” Mr. Wells said. Without knowing what sort of arrangements will emerge from Brexit, he added, the industry would find it difficult to plan ahead and make long-term investment decisions.

Car manufacturing in Britain employs about 170,000 people, according to the trade group. Largely because of the stakes involved, the government has provided aid to Toyota and other companies, and is backing research into electric, hydrogen-powered and self-driving vehicles.

Still, negotiations between Britain and the European Union have been agonizingly slow so far, with both sides seemingly unable to move into the meat-and-potatoes talks that will address the terms that businesses based in Britain will face after Brexit.

Companies like Toyota, however, are quite clear in describing their needs.

General Motors, the nation’s largest automaker, reported a third-quarter loss of $3 billion on Tuesday, stemming primarily from a large accounting charge for the sale of its European operations.

Here are highlights of the G.M. announcement:

• The company said it took a $5.4 billion charge related to unrealized tax assets and pension costs associated with the sale of its Opel and Vauxhall divisions to the European automaker PSA Group.

• G.M. also said that its pretax income in North America fell 42 percent from a year earlier to about $2.1 billion, as it reduced production at several plants to account for lower sales of some vehicles and changeovers to new products.

• A year ago, the company earned $2.8 billion in the third quarter.

• G.M.’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said the quarter reflected “solid results,” as the automaker continued its transition away from underperforming international markets such as Europe, and focused more resources on new technology such as electric-powered and self-driving vehicles.

• Investors reacted positively to the earnings report, with shares up 4 percent in premarket trading. G.M. has the highest valuation of American automakers.","General Motors Posts a Loss From Asset Sale, but Shares Rise",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/business/general-motors-earnings.html

A chant of “Build that wall!” broke out.

(On Tuesday, a week after Ms. Ingraham’s trip to Arizona, Mr. Flake announced he was out of the race. “#MeltSnowFlake accomplished,” Ms. Ingraham wrote victoriously on Twitter.)

Fox News hosts are not usually allowed to stump for candidates, but Ms. Ingraham was granted an exception because her show had not yet begun. An ardent nationalist, a Trump confidante, and a foe of open borders, Ms. Ingraham said in an interview with The New York Times that she wants to represent “the working-class, populist sensibility that is the beating heart of the Republican Party right now.”

She added, “I hope that a lot of the men and women who feel forgotten in this country really see that they have in me a champion.”

An acolyte of Ronald Reagan, Robert Bork and Pat Buchanan, Ms. Ingraham was among the first commentators to endorse Mr. Trump in the presidential campaign. Many pundits on Fox News took longer to follow her lead, especially as Mr. Trump feuded with the network’s star anchor, Megyn Kelly.

Before Election Day, Fox News executives were talking up a new focus on straight news coverage. Post-Trump, the channel’s prime-time lineup has moved to the right, installing the combative Tucker Carlson in the 8 p.m. slot and Sean Hannity at 9.

“Laura Ingraham is as about as hard-core a Trump defender as they could have put on the air at this point,” said Charlie Sykes, the longtime conservative radio host and MSNBC analyst. “Right now, that’s what the Fox News viewership wants. They want the Trump red meat.”

Ms. Ingraham is well-suited to deliver it. In Scottsdale, she was greeted as a hero by the Trump-supporting crowd.

“Everyone at Fox News was afraid to say they wanted Trump,” said Mary Waldren, 53, of Ahwatukee, Ariz., one of several hundred attendees who had paid up to $2,700 a ticket to attend the rally for Ms. Ward. “She’s going to be good for Fox News. They’re lucky to have her.”

When Ms. Ward took the microphone, she held up a copy of Ms. Ingraham’s new book, which praises the rise of Mr. Trump and economic nationalism.

“Steve Bannon tells me this is my campaign plan,” Ms. Ward told the crowd, “so I’m going to read it closely.”

As an early supporter of Mr. Trump, Ms. Ingraham landed a prime speaking slot at the Republican National Convention. She said she now speaks with the president a few times a month. “Sometimes, I call him, and occasionally, I’ll get a call,” she said nonchalantly.

But unlike Mr. Hannity, another confidant of the president, Ms. Ingraham has shown a willingness to publicly bite the hand. In the interview, she criticized the “snail’s pace” of staff appointments and knocked the president for “stepping on his own message at times.”

“This is about the movement,” she said. “Trump is invaluable — he’s the titular head of the movement. But it’s like with George W. Bush. I campaigned for him in 2004, and by the end of it, I wasn’t invited to any of the White House events.”

Shawna Noyes, who waited in line for a half-hour for Ms. Ingraham to sign a book, said that Mr. Hannity was sometimes too soft on the president. “I think she’s going to be tough,” said Ms. Noyes, who runs a steel company in Phoenix.

The president, an avid Fox viewer, has not been not shy about registering his displeasure with critical coverage. What will he think of Ms. Ingraham?

“You know, he’ll probably, uh, be irked,” Ms. Ingraham said, staring straight ahead. “We are friends, but friends tell friends when they go off course. And I’m sure he’ll tell me when he thinks I’m deviating from what’s proper and thoughtful. And I’ll do the same with him.”

Ms. Ingraham lives in Virginia with her three adopted children. She grew up in Glastonbury, Conn., the daughter of a waitress and the owner of a carwash. Media criticism began at home: She wrote in her book that she could remember her father deriding the anchor Walter Cronkite and his famed signoff, “That’s the way it is.”

“No, Walt, that’s the way you say it is!” her father would reply.

Ms. Ingraham honed her craft in college at The Dartmouth Review, the undergraduate right-wing journal that earned national recognition (and some revulsion) for stunts that, in hindsight, presaged the antics of Breitbart reporters.

“All the way back to Dartmouth, I was part of the insurgency,” she said.

In an era before mainstream acceptance of homosexuality, Ms. Ingraham assigned a reporter to attend a meeting of the campus gay students’ alliance and published a transcript of the proceedings, naming names. Years later, she apologized, citing in part the experience of her gay brother and his partner, who had AIDS.

In law school at the University of Virginia, she drove a Honda hatchback with the license plate “FARRGHT.” In Washington, as a young conservative on the rise, Ms. Ingraham worked in the Reagan White House, clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas, and founded a right-wing retreat cheekily dubbed “The Dark Ages.” (Arianna Huffington was on the steering committee.) A New York Times Magazine article described her joy-riding in Washington in her green Land Rover, blasting zydeco music at midnight.

She was among the first crop of commentators at the dawn of the cable-news era, hosting a show on MSNBC and, along with Kellyanne Conway and Ann Coulter, earning the nickname “the pundettes.” By the early 2000s, her radio talk show was carried by more than 200 stations and her books — “The Hillary Trap,” “Of Thee I Zing,” “Power to the People” — sold by the millions.

Some of her remarks brought outrage. “No one wants to see fat people on the cover of magazines in swimsuits,” she said during a television appearance. She has also been the recipient of name-calling: Ed Schultz, the former MSNBC host, was suspended for calling her “a right-wing slut.”

Still, her move into Mr. Bannon’s Breitbart circle — considered a fringe of the right-wing until Mr. Trump’s victory — was not inevitable. Her embrace of Mr. Trump strained her relationship with some of her fellow conservatives.

“Laura represents her own unique brand,” said Christopher Ruddy, who runs Newsmax, a Fox News competitor. “She comes out of the milieu of talk radio, where the economics of that business have driven a lot of hosts who were moderately conservative to be a little edgier.”

Ms. Ingraham joined Mr. Bannon in 2014 to endorse David Brat, an outsider Republican who would go on to win a surprise victory over Eric Cantor, then the Republican majority leader in the House. She had been encouraged to back Mr. Brat by a producer, Julia Hahn, who went on to write for Breitbart and now works in the White House.

Asked if she is bringing a Breitbart viewership to Fox News, Ms. Ingraham responded: “I wouldn’t call it a Breitbart audience. I would call it America.”

“I like Tom Wolfe’s description of the country,” she continued. “There’s America. The coasts are like the parentheses. In between is the country.”

Her show, she said, would go beyond politics: “Parenting, how technology is changing our lives, the pornified culture that our children are marinating in.”

So is a makeover à la Ms. Kelly — who has softened her on-air persona for her new morning show on NBC — in the cards?

“What do you think?” Ms. Ingraham said, sarcastically. “We’re going to have a stove in the back, and we’re going to have popovers.” She laughed. “No. I won’t be doing that.”",Laura Ingraham Is Ready to Rev Up Fox News,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/business/media/laura-ingraham-fox-news.html

“The caliber of coaching in the league right now is excellent from top to bottom,” Carlisle said in a phone interview.
As for Watson’s removal, it will not go down as the fastest in N.B.A.","There are some reasonable explanations to account for such an unusually favorable coaching climate. A whopping 14 teams introduced new coaches to start the 2013-14 season. Nine teams began the 2014-15 season with new coaches, followed by six new hires entering 2015-16 and 10 more to open last season. A period of relative calm after that amount of turnover was perhaps inevitable.

Throw in the presence of a few long-tenured coaches who have copious amounts of job security — namely San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich, Miami’s Erik Spoelstra and Dallas’ Rick Carlisle — and it gets easier to understand why openings have been scarce lately.

Carlisle, who also serves as president of the N.B.A. Coaches Association, has his own theory, insisting that the recent tranquillity on league benches isn’t as fluky as it might seem.

“The caliber of coaching in the league right now is excellent from top to bottom,” Carlisle said in a phone interview. “And owners have clearly come to the accurate conclusion that it’s important to commit to a coach, because there’s going to be more player movement under the rules in the new C.B.A. It’s important for teams to have as much continuity as they can.”

Of course, after Phoenix moved so swiftly in dumping Watson in the wake of its humiliating start, there will understandably be fears that a regression to the mean looms and more firings are on the way. The N.B.A. is certainly due for some upheaval in this area, especially after an off-season that failed to deliver its usual surprise coaching change (or three).

Who’s next? With Chicago having fully entered rebuilding mode and presumably taking some heat off the embattled Fred Hoiberg, uncertainty shrouds the future of the Knicks’ Jeff Hornacek, largely because the executive who hired Hornacek in June 2016 — Phil Jackson — is already gone.

Another coach to watch is Philadelphia’s Brett Brown, who is burdened with playoff expectations for the first time in his five seasons with the 76ers and faced his own 0-3 start before Monday night’s win at Detroit.

The Pelicans have missed the playoffs in Alvin Gentry’s first two seasons, which naturally invites pressure, but remember that Gentry is tasked with the challenge of trying to win with a team built around two big men — Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins — at a time when small ball and 3-point shooting reign.

The circumstances of Watson’s situation in Phoenix make it something of an outlier regardless. The Suns have left the distinct impression that they aren’t really trying to win games, but rather are focused instead on asset collection and player development with a roster that features six players aged 21 or younger. It hasn’t helped that the progress of its recent top draft packs, apart from Devin Booker, has been painfully slow.

The closest thing to a sense of anticipation Phoenix could thus boast coming into the season was the widespread belief that it will try to trade guard Eric Bledsoe and the veteran center Tyson Chandler before the league’s Feb. 8 trade deadline.

Watson, 38, earned the full-time job despite posting an underwhelming 9-24 record as interim coach after Phoenix fired Hornacek just past the midpoint of the 2015-16 season — in what was Watson’s first season on an N.B.A. bench as an assistant. Amid a seven-season playoff drought and mounting local frustrations with the tenure of the team owner Robert Sarver, it often seemed as though Watson had the Suns’ job merely as a placeholder.

What ended Watson’s tenure as head coach — beyond reports of discord between him and General Manager Ryan McDonough — was the Suns’ alarming lack of competitiveness so early in the season. They were beaten by 48 points at home by a Portland team playing without the suspended C. J. McCollum in the season opener, then absorbed a 42-point pounding in Los Angeles against the Clippers one night after allowing 132 points in a loss to the Lakers.

The Suns now turn to the experienced Jay Triano, who served as the head coach of the Toronto Raptors for two-plus seasons in addition to multiple stints in charge of the Canadian national team. Triano takes over the league’s youngest collection of players, with an average age of just 24.5 as of opening night, looking to extract more effort and discipline from this group while management actively tries to find a new home for Bledsoe.

As for Watson’s removal, it will not go down as the fastest in N.B.A. history. In 1971-72, following that 1970-71 campaign devoid of firings, Dolph Schayes was let go by the Buffalo Braves after just one game.

It’s the smallest of consolations for Watson, who departs with an unsightly record of 33-85 — and the knowledge that even the most friendly environment in his craft for decades couldn’t save him.",N.B.A. Coaches Had Long Stretch of Stability.

The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”",A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/your-money/paying-for-college/payback-college-loans.html

Mr. Domino answered: “Well, what they call rock ’n’ roll now is rhythm and blues.
PhotoReclusive and notoriously resistant to interview requests, Mr. Domino stayed home even when he received a lifetime achievement Grammy Award in 1987.","Rotund and standing 5 feet 5 inches — he would joke that he was as wide as he was tall — Mr. Domino had a big, infectious grin, a fondness for ornate, jewel-encrusted rings and an easygoing manner in performance; even in plaintive songs his voice had a smile in it. And he was a master of the wordless vocal, making hits out of songs full of “woo-woos” and “la-las.”

Working with the songwriter, producer and arranger David Bartholomew, Mr. Domino and his band carried New Orleans parade rhythms into rock ’n’ roll and put a local stamp on nearly everything they touched, even country tunes like “Jambalaya” or big-band songs like “My Blue Heaven” and “When My Dreamboat Comes Home.”

Antoine Dominique Domino Jr. was born on Feb. 26, 1928, the youngest of eight children in a family with Creole roots. He grew up in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, where he spent most of his life.

Music filled his life from the age of 10, when his family inherited an old piano. After his brother-in-law Harrison Verrett, a traditional-jazz musician, wrote down the notes on the keys and taught him a few chords, Antoine threw himself at the instrument — so enthusiastically that his parents moved it to the garage.

He was almost entirely self-taught, picking up ideas from boogie-woogie masters like Meade Lux Lewis, Pinetop Smith and Amos Milburn. “Back then I used to play everybody’s records; everybody’s records who made records,” he told the New Orleans music magazine Offbeat in 2004. “I used to hear ’em, listen at ’em five, six, seven, eight times and I could play it just like the record because I had a good ear for catchin’ notes and different things.”

He attended the Louis B. Macarty School but dropped out in the fourth grade to work as an iceman’s helper. “In the houses where people had a piano in their rooms, I’d stop and play,” he told USA Today in 2007. “That’s how I practiced.”

In his teens, he started working at a club called the Hideaway with a band led by the bassist Billy Diamond, who nicknamed him Fats. Mr. Domino soon became the band’s frontman and a local draw.

“Fats was breaking up the place, man,” Mr. Bartholomew told The Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2010. “He was singing and playing the piano and carrying on. Everyone was having a good time. When you saw Fats Domino, it was ‘Let’s have a party!’ ”

He added: “My first impression was a lasting impression. He was a great singer. He was a great artist. And whatever he was doing, nobody could beat him.”

Slide Show

In 1947 Mr. Domino married Rosemary Hall, and they had eight children, Antoine III, Anatole, Andre, Anonio, Antoinette, Andrea, Anola and Adonica. His wife died in 2008. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.

In 1949 Mr. Bartholomew brought Lew Chudd, the owner of Imperial Records in Los Angeles, to the Hideaway. Mr. Chudd signed Mr. Domino on the spot, with a contract, unusual for the time, that paid royalties rather than a one-time purchase of songs.

Immediately, Mr. Domino and Mr. Bartholomew wrote “The Fat Man,” a cleaned-up version of a song about drug addiction called “Junkers Blues,” and recorded it with Mr. Bartholomew’s studio band. By 1951 it had sold a million copies.

Mr. Domino’s trademark triplets, picked up from “It’s Midnight,” a 1949 record by the boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield, appeared on his next rhythm-and-blues hit, “Every Night About This Time.” The technique spread like wildfire, becoming a virtual requirement for rock ’n’ roll ballads.

“Fats made it popular,” Mr. Bartholomew told Rick Coleman, the author of “Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock ’n’ Roll” (2006). “Then it was on every record.”

In 1952, on a chance visit to Cosimo Matassa’s recording studio in New Orleans, Mr. Domino was asked to help out on a recording by a nervous teenager named Lloyd Price. Sitting in with Mr. Bartholomew’s band, he came up with the memorable piano part for “Lawdy Miss Clawdy,” one of the first rhythm-and-blues records to cross over to a pop audience

Through the early 1950s Mr. Domino turned out a stream of hits, taking up what seemed like permanent residence in the upper reaches of the R&B charts. His records began reaching the pop charts as well.

In that racially segregated era, white performers used his hits to build their careers. In 1955, “Ain’t It a Shame” became a No. 1 hit for Pat Boone as “Ain’t That a Shame,” while Domino’s arrangement of a traditional song, “Bo Weevil,” was imitated by Teresa Brewer.

Mr. Domino’s appeal to white teenagers broadened as he embarked on national tours and appeared with mixed-race rock ’n’ roll revues like the Moondog Jubilee of Stars Under the Stars, presented by the disc jockey Alan Freed at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Appearances on national television, on Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan’s shows, put him in millions of living rooms.

He did not flaunt his status as an innovator, or as an architect of a powerful cultural movement.

“Fats, how did this rock ’n’ roll all get started anyway?” an interviewer for a Hearst newsreel asked him in 1957. Mr. Domino answered: “Well, what they call rock ’n’ roll now is rhythm and blues. I’ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans.”

At a news conference in Las Vegas in 1969, after resuming his performing career, Elvis Presley interrupted a reporter who had called him “the king.” He pointed to Mr. Domino, who was in the room, and said, “There’s the real king of rock ’n’ roll.”

Mr. Domino had his biggest hit in 1956 with his version of “Blueberry Hill,” a song that had been recorded by Glenn Miller’s big band in 1940. It peaked at No. 2 on the pop charts and sold a reported three million copies.

“I liked that record ’cause I heard it by Louis Armstrong and I said, ‘That number gonna fit me,’ ” he told Offbeat. “We had to beg Lew Chudd for a while. I told him I wasn’t gonna make no more records till they put that record out. I could feel it, that it was a hit, a good record.”

He followed with two more Top Five pop hits: “Blue Monday” and “I’m Walkin’,” which outsold the version recorded by Ricky Nelson.

“I was lucky enough to write songs that carry a good beat and tell a real story that people could feel was their story, too — something that old people or the kids could both enjoy,” Mr. Domino told The Los Angeles Times in 1985.

Mr. Domino performed in 1950s movies like “Shake, Rattle and Rock,” “The Big Beat” (for which he and Mr. Bartholomew wrote the title song) and “The Girl Can’t Help It.” In 1957, he toured for three months with Chuck Berry, Clyde McPhatter, the Moonglows and others.

Well into the early 1960s, Mr. Domino continued to reach both the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts with songs like “Whole Lotta Lovin’,” “I’m Ready,” “I’m Gonna Be a Wheel Someday,” “Be My Guest,” “Walkin’ to New Orleans” and “My Girl Josephine.”

He toured Europe for the first time in 1962 and met the Beatles in Liverpool, before they were famous. His contract with Imperial ended in 1963, and he went on to record for ABC-Paramount, Mercury, Broadmoor, Reprise and other labels.

His last appearance in the pop Top 100 was in 1968, with a version of “Lady Madonna,” the Beatles song that had been inspired by Mr. Domino’s piano-pounding style. In 1982, he had a country hit with “Whiskey Heaven.”

Although he was no longer a pop sensation, Mr. Domino continued to perform worldwide and appeared for 10 months a year in Las Vegas in the mid-1960s. On tour, he would bring his own pots and pans so he could cook.

His life on the road ended in the early 1980s, when he decided that he did not want to leave New Orleans, saying it was the only place where he liked the food.

He went on to perform regularly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and in 1987 Jerry Lee Lewis and Ray Charles joined him for a Cinemax special, “Fats Domino and Friends.” He released a holiday album, “Christmas Is a Special Day,” in 1993.

Reclusive and notoriously resistant to interview requests, Mr. Domino stayed home even when he received a lifetime achievement Grammy Award in 1987. (He did travel to New York when he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 as one of its first members, although he did not take part in the jam session that concluded the ceremony.) In 1999, when he was awarded the National Medal of Arts, he sent his daughter Antoinette to the White House to pick up the prize.

He even refused to leave New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city on Aug. 29, 2005, remaining at his flooded home — he was living in the Lower Ninth Ward then — until he was rescued by helicopter on Sept. 1.

“I wasn’t too nervous” about waiting to be saved, he told The New York Times in 2006. “I had my little wine and a couple of beers with me; I’m all right.”

His rescue was loosely the basis for “Saving Fats,” a tall tale in Sam Shepard’s 2010 short-story collection, “Day Out of Days.”

President George W. Bush visited Mr. Domino’s home in 2006 in recognition of New Orleans’s cultural resilience; that same year, Mr. Domino released “Alive and Kickin,’ ” his first album in more than a decade. The title song began, “All over the country, people want to know / Whatever happened to Fats Domino,” then continued, “I’m alive and kicking and I’m where I wanna be.”

He was often seen around New Orleans, emerging from his pink-roofed mansion driving a pink Cadillac. “I just drink my little beers, do some cookin’, anything I feel like ” he told The Daily Telegraph of London in 2007, describing his retirement.

In 1953, in Down Beat magazine, the Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler made a bold-sounding prediction that turned out to be, in retrospect, quite timid. “Can’t you envision a collector in 1993 discovering a Fats Domino record in a Salvation Army depot and rushing home to put it on the turntable?” he wrote. “We can. It’s good blues, it’s good jazz, and it’s the kind of good that never wears out.”","Fats Domino, Early Rock ’n’ Roller With a Boogie-Woogie Piano, Is Dead at 89",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/obituaries/fats-domino-89-one-of-rock-n-rolls-first-stars-is-dead.html

Like anyone with rowdy neighbors, oysters may be feeling stressed thanks to the growing problem of underwater noise pollution, and are trying to filter out the racket.

New research published Wednesday in PLoS One reveals that oysters will close their shells when exposed to noises along a range of frequencies that includes the sounds emitted by known noise polluters like cargo ships and underwater oil exploration.

In oysters, closed shells are an indicator of distress. Under optimal conditions, bivalve mollusks will keep their shells open, and are thought to shut them only when feeling stressed or threatened. Clamping their shells to screen out noise pollution or other artificial irritants could prevent oysters from perceiving important biological cues, said the authors of the study.

Oysters “must be able to hear breaking waves and water currents,” which could trigger their biological rhythms, said Jean-Charles Massabuau, research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research and an author of the study. “To hear the current arriving could prepare them for eating and digesting, possibly as when we hear and smell that somebody is preparing dinner.”

Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, credited Mr. Flake as a “team player” and man of high principle after Mr. Flake’s speech. But Mr. McConnell quickly turned the Senate floor back to a minor debate over a budget point of order.

It was a jarring transition in a day of political shocks.

In a stunning one-two assault, Mr. Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Mr. Flake took on the president in terms rarely, if ever, heard from members of a sitting president’s party.

Mr. Corker, who has been feuding with the man he once contemplated serving as vice president, accused Mr. Trump of serial lying and debasing the office.

Mr. Flake, who has been a persistent Trump foe since 2016, never mentioned Mr. Trump by name in his remarks. But there was no doubt who he was talking about when he pointed to the “indecency of our discourse” and the “coarseness of our leadership,” and suggested his beloved Republican Party was being complicit in an “alarming and dangerous state of affairs.”

“We must never regard as normal the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals, we must never meekly accept the daily sundering of our country,” Mr. Flake said.

But Mr. Corker, Mr. Flake and Mr. McCain remain the outliers. Mr. Corker’s exceedingly harsh assessment of Mr. Trump — delivered in a series of morning TV interviews in a reasonable, studied tone — and Mr. Flake’s announcement and damning speech bookended what was to be the initial centerpiece of a day on Capitol Hill intended to get lawmakers and the president on the same page with a difficult tax debate looming.

Mr. McConnell left his lunch with Mr. Trump and members of the caucus to emphasize the issues that bind congressional Republicans to Mr. Trump and play down the divisions underscored by Mr. Flake and Mr. Corker.

“There’s a lot of noise out there,” said Mr. McConnell, who made clear what the interests of the party are. “Tax reform is what we are about.”

Photo

That statement defined the reluctance of other congressional Republicans to challenge Mr. Trump too directly. They have been willing to look past some actions and pronouncements by Mr. Trump that they consider beneath a president in hopes of pushing into law some of their long-sought goals, the most important of which are tax cuts. And with no substantial legislative achievements so far, the party is all in on a tax overhaul, recognizing that failure to deliver one will be a political disaster. That necessity ties them tightly to Mr. Trump, at least for now.

To be sure, there are Republicans in both the Senate and the House who are fully committed to the president and reject the views expressed by Mr. Flake or Mr. Bush, who recently expressed remorse about political “discourse degraded by casual cruelty” — an obvious reference to the Trump era in Washington.

But many others see Mr. Trump more as a means to an end, a way to enact their agenda since the president, as Mr. McConnell is fond of saying, is the only American who can sign a bill into law.

Mr. Flake’s remarks were a warning against that kind of thinking, the idea that some accomplishments — if they ever come — could compensate for the continuing upheaval and discord emanating from Washington and somehow reset the nation’s course.

“With respect and humility,” he said, “I must say that we have fooled ourselves for long enough that a pivot to governing is right around the corner, a return to civility and stability right behind it.”

Mr. Flake and Mr. Corker, along with Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain, represent significant cracks in the Republican wall of support and deference to the president despite widespread misgivings within the party. But they have nothing to lose politically. What is uncertain at this stage is whether Republicans with more at stake are going to join them in tearing down that wall.","Another Republican Call to Arms, but Who Will Answer?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/republican-party-flake-mccain-corker-bush-trump.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Today we get to watch a face-off between the good guys and the bad guys, courtesy of David J. Kahn.

Today’s Theme

The GUNFIGHT AT / THE O.K. CORRAL (28D and 62A) took place in October 1881, and was a 30-second shootout between the lawmen of Tombstone, Ariz., and a group of outlaws called the Cowboys (in those days, it was considered an insult to call a law-abiding cattleman a “cowboy”). Mr. Kahn was able to get only one law man (DOC HOLLIDAY) and one bad guy (IKE CLANTON) into his grid for space reasons.

In addition, we have four entries forming a circular “corral” of sorts (31A, 37D, 52A and 35D). All of them are synonyms for the word “O.K.,” but all are clued as something different, neatly hiding the connection to the theme in plain sight. That’s a pretty nice bonus.

Tricky Clues

1A: I had MACAU and MACAW (wrong, Deb! That’s a bird) before MACAO.

49A: Do you get tripped up by clues where the first word is actually a proper name? “Banks of Chicago” sounds as if it refers to places in Chicago where you can keep your money, but we’ve got only a five-letter slot. The constructor and editors have sneakily used the capital-letter-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence rule against you. “Banks” refers to the baseball player ERNIE Banks.

Constructor Notes

I guess I can say with a smile that this is just an O.K. puzzle. This worked only because I was able to find 4 four-letter synonyms for O.K. that could be clued otherwise, which is why “so-so,” at first an obvious synonym, wasn’t included. I also wanted to include a gunfighter on each side. Fun fact: Kirk Douglas, who played Doc Holliday in the 1957 movie, celebrated his centennial last year.

A chant of “Build that wall!” broke out.

(On Tuesday, a week after Ms. Ingraham’s trip to Arizona, Mr. Flake announced he was out of the race. “#MeltSnowFlake accomplished,” Ms. Ingraham wrote victoriously on Twitter.)

Fox News hosts are not usually allowed to stump for candidates, but Ms. Ingraham was granted an exception because her show had not yet begun. An ardent nationalist, a Trump confidante, and a foe of open borders, Ms. Ingraham said in an interview with The New York Times that she wants to represent “the working-class, populist sensibility that is the beating heart of the Republican Party right now.”

She added, “I hope that a lot of the men and women who feel forgotten in this country really see that they have in me a champion.”

An acolyte of Ronald Reagan, Robert Bork and Pat Buchanan, Ms. Ingraham was among the first commentators to endorse Mr. Trump in the presidential campaign. Many pundits on Fox News took longer to follow her lead, especially as Mr. Trump feuded with the network’s star anchor, Megyn Kelly.

Before Election Day, Fox News executives were talking up a new focus on straight news coverage. Post-Trump, the channel’s prime-time lineup has moved to the right, installing the combative Tucker Carlson in the 8 p.m. slot and Sean Hannity at 9.

“Laura Ingraham is as about as hard-core a Trump defender as they could have put on the air at this point,” said Charlie Sykes, the longtime conservative radio host and MSNBC analyst. “Right now, that’s what the Fox News viewership wants. They want the Trump red meat.”

Ms. Ingraham is well-suited to deliver it. In Scottsdale, she was greeted as a hero by the Trump-supporting crowd.

“Everyone at Fox News was afraid to say they wanted Trump,” said Mary Waldren, 53, of Ahwatukee, Ariz., one of several hundred attendees who had paid up to $2,700 a ticket to attend the rally for Ms. Ward. “She’s going to be good for Fox News. They’re lucky to have her.”

When Ms. Ward took the microphone, she held up a copy of Ms. Ingraham’s new book, which praises the rise of Mr. Trump and economic nationalism.

“Steve Bannon tells me this is my campaign plan,” Ms. Ward told the crowd, “so I’m going to read it closely.”

As an early supporter of Mr. Trump, Ms. Ingraham landed a prime speaking slot at the Republican National Convention. She said she now speaks with the president a few times a month. “Sometimes, I call him, and occasionally, I’ll get a call,” she said nonchalantly.

Photo

But unlike Mr. Hannity, another confidant of the president, Ms. Ingraham has shown a willingness to publicly bite the hand. In the interview, she criticized the “snail’s pace” of staff appointments and knocked the president for “stepping on his own message at times.”

“This is about the movement,” she said. “Trump is invaluable — he’s the titular head of the movement. But it’s like with George W. Bush. I campaigned for him in 2004, and by the end of it, I wasn’t invited to any of the White House events.”

Shawna Noyes, who waited in line for a half-hour for Ms. Ingraham to sign a book, said that Mr. Hannity was sometimes too soft on the president. “I think she’s going to be tough,” said Ms. Noyes, who runs a steel company in Phoenix.

The president, an avid Fox viewer, has not been not shy about registering his displeasure with critical coverage. What will he think of Ms. Ingraham?

“You know, he’ll probably, uh, be irked,” Ms. Ingraham said, staring straight ahead. “We are friends, but friends tell friends when they go off course. And I’m sure he’ll tell me when he thinks I’m deviating from what’s proper and thoughtful. And I’ll do the same with him.”

Ms. Ingraham lives in Virginia with her three adopted children. She grew up in Glastonbury, Conn., the daughter of a waitress and the owner of a carwash. Media criticism began at home: She wrote in her book that she could remember her father deriding the anchor Walter Cronkite and his famed signoff, “That’s the way it is.”

“No, Walt, that’s the way you say it is!” her father would reply.

Ms. Ingraham honed her craft in college at The Dartmouth Review, the undergraduate right-wing journal that earned national recognition (and some revulsion) for stunts that, in hindsight, presaged the antics of Breitbart reporters.

“All the way back to Dartmouth, I was part of the insurgency,” she said.

In an era before mainstream acceptance of homosexuality, Ms. Ingraham assigned a reporter to attend a meeting of the campus gay students’ alliance and published a transcript of the proceedings, naming names. Years later, she apologized, citing in part the experience of her gay brother and his partner, who had AIDS.

In law school at the University of Virginia, she drove a Honda hatchback with the license plate “FARRGHT.” In Washington, as a young conservative on the rise, Ms. Ingraham worked in the Reagan White House, clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas, and founded a right-wing retreat cheekily dubbed “The Dark Ages.” (Arianna Huffington was on the steering committee.) A New York Times Magazine article described her joy-riding in Washington in her green Land Rover, blasting zydeco music at midnight.

She was among the first crop of commentators at the dawn of the cable-news era, hosting a show on MSNBC and, along with Kellyanne Conway and Ann Coulter, earning the nickname “the pundettes.” By the early 2000s, her radio talk show was carried by more than 200 stations and her books — “The Hillary Trap,” “Of Thee I Zing,” “Power to the People” — sold by the millions.

Some of her remarks brought outrage. “No one wants to see fat people on the cover of magazines in swimsuits,” she said during a television appearance. She has also been the recipient of name-calling: Ed Schultz, the former MSNBC host, was suspended for calling her “a right-wing slut.”

Still, her move into Mr. Bannon’s Breitbart circle — considered a fringe of the right-wing until Mr. Trump’s victory — was not inevitable. Her embrace of Mr. Trump strained her relationship with some of her fellow conservatives.

“Laura represents her own unique brand,” said Christopher Ruddy, who runs Newsmax, a Fox News competitor. “She comes out of the milieu of talk radio, where the economics of that business have driven a lot of hosts who were moderately conservative to be a little edgier.”

Ms. Ingraham joined Mr. Bannon in 2014 to endorse David Brat, an outsider Republican who would go on to win a surprise victory over Eric Cantor, then the Republican majority leader in the House. She had been encouraged to back Mr. Brat by a producer, Julia Hahn, who went on to write for Breitbart and now works in the White House.

Asked if she is bringing a Breitbart viewership to Fox News, Ms. Ingraham responded: “I wouldn’t call it a Breitbart audience. I would call it America.”

“I like Tom Wolfe’s description of the country,” she continued. “There’s America. The coasts are like the parentheses. In between is the country.”

Her show, she said, would go beyond politics: “Parenting, how technology is changing our lives, the pornified culture that our children are marinating in.”

So is a makeover à la Ms. Kelly — who has softened her on-air persona for her new morning show on NBC — in the cards?

“What do you think?” Ms. Ingraham said, sarcastically. “We’re going to have a stove in the back, and we’re going to have popovers.” She laughed. “No. I won’t be doing that.”",Laura Ingraham Is Ready to Rev Up Fox News,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/business/media/laura-ingraham-fox-news.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Most designer coffee-table books are, to be honest, really just glossy accessories to egos and living rooms. This one may well be something different: once again a lightning rod for debate, and possibly censure, given the current conversation. Certainly it will raise questions that should be raised. Especially since, at 74, Mr. Klein, who has been busy building houses and designing uniforms for the Harlem Village Academies, is ready to think about many of them — if not to completely address the implications.

Why did you decide to finally publish a book?

People had suggested it for many years. Mrs. Onassis was the first one who asked me. God knows why. Anna Wintour had been pushing me to do it for a long time. But I don’t like looking back; I like to be in the moment, and think about the future. Plus I thought it might be emotional, and I didn’t want to go there. But I do a lot of speaking to students, and I realized they knew my name, but they certainly had no idea of the imagery we used. And I wanted them to be able to learn from that.

Do you think people will be suspicious of that imagery, given the current groundswell of discussion on women being put in uncomfortable situations?

I never thought publication would coincide with this conversation, though I also think it’s about time we had this conversation. But all of these images came from my life in one way or another, especially my life with Kelly [his former wife]. It was really a reflection of what was happening. The 1970s were a pretty crazy time in New York. There was Berlin in the 1920s, and Paris in the 1930s, and New York in the 1970s. The orgy campaign started with me thinking about Studio 54. People ask me if it was really like that. Probably, yeah.

The culture of the 1970s was one of the justifications Harvey Weinstein used for his behavior.

But what is happening in the culture does not give anyone the right to act in an abusive way. In terms of Harvey, not everyone did what he did in the 1970s and after. That’s not about culture; it’s about character. He used his position to take advantage of women right from the beginning.

Did you deliberately set out to be provocative?

When I was thinking about our campaign for our first fragrance, I was looking at the competition and they always had these young, pretty girls running through a field of wheat. And I just thought: “Is that why women buy fragrance? Because they want to run through wheat?” No. They buy it because they want to attract men, or they want to be attractive to themselves. So I always put men and women together. Is that being provocative? That is being realistic.

Photo

In those days I would look at Vogue, and it was thick with hundreds of pages, and I wanted my company to stand out. So I did six-, eight-page spreads — once I did a 27-page outsert. They weren’t always about sex, but they often went in that direction because that’s me. That’s who I am. I did what I did, and I put it out there for students.

How did you choose the images?

I picked the images the same way I always did: what got my heart racing. No matter which photographer was doing the shoot, we would discuss what we were trying to say, where we would shoot, who the model would be. In the early days, I would be on shoots, styling. Then I would edit the film at night. We always pushed to be more creative and exciting, and sometimes we went over the top. Sometimes we pushed the envelope too far. I understand that.

There was a shoot that got referred to as kiddie porn, for example. It was for jeans, photographed in what looked like a basement with knobby pine paneling and shag carpeting. We thought it was funny and provocative, but the Justice Department did not. They investigated us.

But it was during a year when everyone was talking about family values, and Bill Clinton, who was president, stood up and said he didn’t approve of the Calvin Klein ads. I ended up pulling the campaign and taking out a page advertisement in The New York Times trying to apologize. Steven Meisel shot it, and to this day he can’t get over the attacks. For me, it came with the territory.

You were used to it by then?

My feeling was: If you start to think about what everyone else might think before you design something or put an image out there, you’ll never get anything done. I built my company with my childhood friend — just like Donna Karan did and Ralph Lauren did — and we built it based on creativity, with the assumption that if people wanted what we created, it would be profitable.

That’s how we ended up working with Kate. I went to Paris to see how other designers did shows — I went to Chanel and a few others — and I saw all these women whom I had thought were really special, and they were in every show. So then I started to think: That’s not really so special. It was a period when lots of models were enhancing their breasts and doing crazy things to their bodies, and I found it pretty offensive. So I came back from Paris and thought: I have to do something different.

She had some personal photographs that Mario Sorrenti, her boyfriend at the time, had taken of her. He wasn’t even a professional photographer then. So I asked to meet Mario, and then I gave him a camera and sent them off to an island together.

Did any of the reactions make you rethink your decisions?

The strangest reaction we ever got, to me, was for a children’s underwear shoot. Rosie O’Donnell denounced me on her TV show. She said, “I’ll never buy anything from Calvin Klein again.” I understand now that, at that time, everything I did was assumed to have an ulterior motive.

We tried to be sensitive. One time we did an underwear shoot with Christy Turlington, who was always very careful about how she was photographed and what was revealed. And the pictures were revealing. But they were not obscene. Anyway, we gave her all the negatives afterward, so they could never be used again.

Why did you stop?

I left because I thought I’d done everything creatively I wanted to do. I didn’t want to expand into areas that didn’t feel natural, and I didn’t want to design the same thing for the rest of my life. I had design studios for every collection, and I was there for the beginning and middle and end, and there’d be young people sketching and they would show me what they’d drawn, and I would say, “But we did this already.” And they’d say, “No, it’s new.” And I’d say, “But I remember it.” And I just thought, “If I don’t do it now, when?” I wanted to live a different way.

Now large corporations have gobbled up designers, and they stay two years and then move on. I think that’s unfortunate.

Do you feel any responsibility for that, given your own contribution to branding?

Mr. Lithgow himself is anything but eldritch, despite his dazzling and dark portrayal of the serial killer Arthur Mitchell on the Showtime series “Dexter,” for which he won a Golden Globe and a Primetime Emmy. A sunny and enthusiastic personality, Mr. Lithgow calls his crossword puzzle collaboration with the veteran New York Times constructor Brendan Emmett Quigley an “exhilarating experience.”

As part of the 75th anniversary of The New York Times Crossword, our editor Will Shortz is running a series of crossword collaborations between people of note and popular Times constructors, and today it is Mr. Lithgow’s turn to make a different kind of debut. Rather than walk onto the stage of a theater, step onto a television or film set, or put pen to paper to write one of his books for children, Mr. Lithgow scaled a very steep learning curve with Mr. Quigley, and the result is an entertaining puzzle that definitely has his signature on it.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — The romantic in Ned White emerges today with a 76-word puzzle that plays around with a popular phrase.

Today’s Theme

I managed to solve the revealer, HEAD OVER HEELS, before I figured out the theme, which may or may not have helped me.

The theme itself places phrases used to designate people as the “head” of something (NUMERO UNO at 13A, for example) on top of phrases used to call someone a “heel” (SCOUNDREL at 17A), thus giving us HEAD OVER HEELS. I liked this idea, and Mr. White does it well, except I had trouble locating the central pair because they were staggered at 56A (BIG WHEEL) and 42A (DIRTY RAT).

Tricky Clues

8A: Yes, a five-letter entry for “One of the Obamas” could be either SASHA or MALIA. But check those crossings. They’re not all easy, but perhaps you knew that a SPORE was “One of billions in a puffball” at 8D.

How well do air purifiers work?

In Mr. Heffernan’s in-depth test and review of HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Arrestance) air purifiers for Wirecutter, he found that on the whole, they are extremely effective at reducing the particle pollution in your home. Air purifiers capture small particles in the air that are generally not visible to the naked eye by trapping them in a dense mat of fine fibers.

To put it simply, they draw in polluted air, trap the particles, then blow out clean air.

In order to be HEPA certified, air filters have to remove 99.97 percent of particles that are exactly 0.3 microns in diameter — a size that’s especially difficult to filter mechanically. The models Wirecutter has tested were able to remove virtually all particles as small as 0.01 micron, one-thirtieth the HEPA standard.

Again, while the long-term effects of short-term smoke exposure may be low, any kind of particle pollution can still affect our health, and that pollution is more concentrated indoors — meaning nearly all of us can benefit from cleaner air.

“Most of us spend a lot of time indoors,” Mr. Heffernan said. “And indoor air is more polluted than outdoor air. It kind of comes down to what we have in our homes: pets, rugs, furniture that traps dust. And many homes are not terribly well ventilated.”

Especially if you’re older or have asthma or other respiratory conditions, you may want to consider an air purifier. All of the HEPA-certified models Mr. Heffernan tested with his colleague John Holecek were effective at removing particulate pollution.

For homes in smoke-prone areas, including those near wildfire-affected areas, Heffernan suggested running the purifier on high for an hour, then turning it down to medium or low, which should keep the amount of smoke in your home to a minimum.

How to choose an air purifier

When choosing an air purifier, it’s important to ensure first that the purifier is indeed HEPA certified; it’ll usually be listed as “true HEPA.” You’ll also want a model with a tight seal around the filter. “If it’s not well sealed, air is going to flow around the edges,” Mr. Heffernan said. “If it’s letting dirty air around the edges, you’re not getting the full effect.”

Some models may list a CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) rating. This measures the volume of air that will pass through the unit, telling you how efficiently the model will work depending on the size of the room. Mr. Heffernan suggested looking for a CADR rating of at least 200, which means the unit effectively delivers the equivalent of 200 cubic feet of pure air per minute.

These models are often recommended for smaller rooms of about 300 square feet, and they will cycle the air four to five times per hour in a room that size, ensuring that pollutants are filtered quickly. This isn’t to say a model with a 200 CADR rating won’t work in a larger room, but it will work more slowly.

If you’re looking for a more cost-effective solution, you can also upgrade your existing HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system to improve air quality.

HVAC systems come with basic filters that trap larger particles, like pet hair. You can upgrade your filter to one that traps smaller particles, as noted by the filter’s MERV rating, or Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value. This metric indicates how efficiently the filter will reduce particulates that pass through it.

The higher the number, the better the rating. According to the E.P.A., “Filters with a MERV between 7 and 13 are likely to be nearly as effective as true HEPA filters at controlling most airborne indoor particles.” There are also “whole house” purifiers that provide true HEPA filtration in HVAC systems, but these are expensive and may require upgrading your home’s air handler.

As effective as HEPA-certified air purifiers are, some come with dubious additional features. Many of them claim to produce ozone to destroy pathogens, which sounds impressive, but the California Air Resources Board warns against them. Ozone, or O3, is a respiratory system irritant that can cause health problems.

A 2008 ARB report said the “introduction of any amount of ozone into indoor spaces may result in increased levels of formaldehyde, ultrafine particles, and other pollutants.” In fact, if you are indeed in California, you may not even be able to order these types of units on Amazon.

Many purifiers claim to reduce VOCs, or volatile organic compounds, using an activated charcoal filter. “Very few of them actually do,” Mr. Heffernan added. “It comes down to the mass of the activated charcoal filter.” In order to be effective, the activated charcoal filter would have to be a minimum of five pounds to have any statistically significant effect, he said. Most contain a tiny fraction of that.

How to care for your air purifier

Maintenance of your air purifier should be minimal. Most HEPA filters are designed to run continuously for a year, though many manufacturers recommend checking them every six months. If there’s a fair amount of buildup on your filter, or you just want peace of mind, simply replace it.

Beyond purifying your air, there are additional precautions to take if you live in a smoke-adjacent area or you’re concerned about pollutants.

Many of these tips are common sense: Keep your windows closed, and avoid spending too much time outdoors to keep from bringing particulates into your home.

“I would also recommend simple tasks, like washing your sheets and pillowcases. You don’t want to spend eight to 10 hours on sheets filled with smoke,” Mr. Heffernan said. And if you’re planning to vacuum, remember that vacuuming can also kick up dust and smoke that has settled, so mopping may be a better approach.

Finally, if you’re using a paper face mask instead, or want one so you can go outside in a smoke-adjacent area, keep in mind that most of them have limited utility, as the E.P.A. points out in its guide. In order to offer adequate protection from smoke particles, you would need a mask that’s rated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as N95 or P100. These ratings indicate that the mask or respirator blocks out 95 to 99.9 percent of particles 0.3 microns or larger.

“So if you’re going to be outside and you want a mask, you need one of these certified masks,” Mr. Heffernan said. “A paper one won’t do any harm, but it shouldn’t give you a false sense of security.”",What to Know Before Buying an Air Purifier to Clear Wildfire Smoke,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/smarter-living/what-to-know-before-buying-an-air-purifier.html

But Romney couldn’t talk Kasich into being that independent candidate, all the other possibilities demurred — and then as a group, the Republican resisters declined to endorse anyone, neither Hillary Clinton nor the Libertarian ticket nor Evan McMullin, making their opposition a private matter rather than a public challenge to the nominee.

Now, almost a year into the Trump presidency, a similar dynamic is playing out. There is a small but significant Republican opposition to Trump, but its leading figures still don’t want to go to war with him directly, preferring philosophical attacks and tactical withdrawal to confrontation and probable defeat.

Bob Corker, part of the dying-in-the-dark-isn’t-so-bad caucus during the primary campaign (and when he seemed to hope for a cabinet appointment), has become a fierce Trump critic — but only after deciding to retire from the Senate. George W. Bush and John McCain have each given speeches that read like broadsides against Trump — but very general critiques of his worldview, not political attacks on the man himself. And now Jeff Flake of Arizona has delivered a barnburner of a Senate address about the civic costs of the Trump presidency — while simultaneously declaring that because he can’t win his primary in a Trumpified party, he won’t even stay and fight it out.

To the extent that there’s a plausible theory behind all of these halfhearted efforts, it’s that resisting Trump too vigorously only strengthens his hold on the party’s base, by vindicating his claim to have all the establishment arrayed against him.

But the problem with this logic is that it offers a permanent excuse for doing nothing, no matter how bad Trump’s reign becomes. (“I’d criticize him for accidentally nuking Manila, but you know, then Fox News would just make it all about me …”) In the end, if you want Republican voters to reject Trumpism, you need to give them clear electoral opportunities to do so — even if you expect defeat, even if it’s all but certain. And an anti-Trump movement that gives high-minded speeches but never mounts candidates confirms Trump’s claim to face establishment opposition while also confirming his judgment of the establishment’s guts and stamina — proving that they’re all low-energy, all “liddle” men, all unwilling to fight him man to man.

If Corker really means what he keeps saying about the danger posed by Trump’s effective incapacity, he should call openly for impeachment or for 25th Amendment proceedings — and other anti-Trump Republicans should join him. If Flake really means what he said in his impassioned speech, and he doesn’t want to waste time and energy on a foredoomed Senate primary campaign, then he should choose a different hopeless-seeming cause and primary Trump in 2020. George W. Bush should endorse him. So should McCain, and Corker, and Romney, and Kasich, and Sasse, and the rest of the anti-Trump list. They should expect to lose, and badly, but they should make Trump actually defeat them, instead of just clearing the field for his second nomination.

And not only for the sake of their honor. The president’s G.O.P. critics should engage in electoral battle because the act of campaigning, the work of actually trying to persuade voters, is the only way anti-Trump Republicans will come to grips with the legitimate reasons that their ideas had become so unpopular that voters opted for demagoguery instead.

A speechifying anti-Trumpism, distant from the fray, will always be self-regarding and self-deceiving — unwilling to see how the Iraq War discredited both the Bushist and McCainian styles of right-wing internationalism, incapable of addressing the economic disappointments that turned voters against Flake’s Goldwaterite libertarianism and Romney’s “trust me, I’m a businessman” promises. Only in actual political competition can the Republican elite reckon with why it lost its party, and how it might win again without succumbing to Trumpian indecency.

I don’t expect this to happen; indeed I think the G.O.P. is more likely to be renewed by someone who currently supports Trump or someone not yet active in politics than it is by the men resisting the president today. The Republican establishment, like the House of Lords a century back, has the feel of a fated and superannuated institution that no stratagem can save. In the end the Lords chose to perish in the dark, to vote themselves into irrelevance. Defiant retirements no less than craven collaboration are likely to carry the G.O.P.’s present leaders to the same unhappy destination, the same ultimate irrelevance.

Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government.
A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today’s tech giants.","Now, that attitude is beginning to change. I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants’ power through government — and, if so, how.

There are growing efforts in Washington to do something about big tech. The recognition that networks like Facebook, Google and YouTube played a great and mainly hidden role in last year’s presidential election has spurred an urgent effort to regulate political ads online.

On the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five — Amazon, Facebook and Google. Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Steve Bannon wing of the right. Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech. And, as my colleague Cecilia Kang notes, media, telecom and other industries are pushing these arguments on both sides.

But there is little to suggest we’ll see drastic action anytime soon. Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants’ vast powers might be harmful. The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague. The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout.

“Individuals, lawmakers, we’re all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies,” said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power. For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable — so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.

Mr. Lynn thinks that view is shifting. In June, Open Markets was forced from its previous home, the New America Foundation, reportedly because of pressure from Google, a huge New America funder. (Google and New America have denied that claim.)

“Our firing has transformed the discussions among people about the power of these companies,” Mr. Lynn said. “Folks in this town saw this, noticed it, and I’d bet a lot of money a year from now we’ll see real huge shifts in feelings around here.”

Part of what has hampered governmental action against the Five is the unusual nature of their power. Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what we’ve ever expected from corporations. In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships. They’re being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.

They’re creating machines that could one day approximate and surpass human intelligence — a technological achievement that may come with as many complications as the advent of nuclear weapons. And all of them figure into economic inequality in the United States, since their digital wares provide vast riches to a relative few employees and investors in liberal West Coast enclaves, while passing over much of the rest of the world.

But in other ways, the Five do not cleanly fit traditional notions of what constitutes dangerous corporate power. Only a couple of them enjoy monopolies or duopolies in their markets — Google and Facebook in digital ads, for example.

Apple’s iPhone is the world’s most profitable product, its App Store the most important digital marketplace, and yet two out of three smartphones sold in the United States are not iPhones.

Amazon is considered ground zero in the vast transformation of American retail, and is implicated in the unfolding story of how our jobs and our lunches will be gobbled up by machines. But only in the last year did Amazon’s annual revenue surpass that of Costco. It does not yet enjoy a majority share of online commerce in America, has a single-digit share of American retail and is still a minor satellite compared with Walmart’s sun.

Then there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants. We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street. The Five’s power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices. We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them. For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.

“We’ve all become a bit cyborg,” writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in “World Without Mind,” one of several new books examining the giants. “What we need to always remember is that we’re not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.”

The complicated nature of the Five’s power has sparked novel ideas about how to regulate them. In January, Lina M. Khan, a fellow at Open Markets, published an article in The Yale Law Journal arguing for a complete reconception of antitrust laws to deal with the rise of Amazon. Ms. Khan argued that the modern view of antitrust laws, which were conceived under the Reagan administration, overemphasized low prices as a test for whether a company is gaining too much market power.

Because Amazon manages to keep lowering prices, the antitrust authorities have overlooked other harms caused by Amazon’s growth, she said, including the way it has created platforms for shipping and cloud storage that give it deep hooks into much of the rest of the economy. Open Markets has offered a similar critique of Google and Facebook.

Yet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because it’s politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices. Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didn’t need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement.

That, too, seems to be lacking. Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government. European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review. During last year’s presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasn’t done much in office to carry that out. Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods, for example, sailed through regulatory review.

Put all this together and you get a story of apathy and indecision in the face of colossal corporate power.

“We are looking at a set of circumstances where the monopolies have become so much more pervasive and intrusive,” said Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who took on Microsoft at its peak two decades ago, prompting the historic trial against the company.

Mr. Reback, who is now working against Google, argued that the government’s antitrust prosecution of Microsoft had altered the company’s culture — which in turn created room in the market for entrants like Google and Facebook.

A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today’s tech giants. But that’s a big if.

“The big hurdle is, are we going to decide to address these problems as a society?” Mr. Reback said. “Had we been more diligent, we wouldn’t have nearly the problems we have today.”",Can Washington Stop Big Tech Companies?

His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

Unfortunately, Jeff Flake is only the latest example of a Republican whose willingness to speak out against his party’s current standard-bearer has cost him politically.

The president has spent weeks impugning Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for pointing out that the Mr. Trump is “debasing” the nation. Mr. Trump, as a candidate and as president, has also repeatedly and viciously attacked Senator John McCain, a war hero who has sacrificed more for the United States than most of us can even imagine.

Republican leaders have offered occasional defenses of their colleagues from these attacks: Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, called Mr. Flake “a very fine man” of “high principles” on Tuesday. But they have largely remained on the sidelines as Mr. Trump and his allies have attacked those few Republicans who have dared to call for civility and compromise.

The consequences of this could be grave.

If the Republican Party under Donald Trump has no room for independent-minded conservatives, and if, in the coming years, senators like Jeff Flake and Bob Corker are replaced by fringe conservatives handpicked because of their blind loyalty to this president, it will be too late for responsible conservatives to salvage the party they’ve built over generations.

As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I’m particularly worried by the prospect of Mr. Trump’s narrow, nationalist “America First” foreign policy replacing the vision of lawmakers like Mr. McCain, Mr. Corker and Mr. Flake who have pushed for strong American global leadership based on human rights, the rule of law and strong international agreements. I sincerely hope that Republican leaders recognize this before it’s too late.

As for Democrats, there should be no sense of satisfaction in what is happening to the Republican Party. The balance of two functioning political parties has been essential to our country’s success. In fact, we should take this moment to look at ourselves in the mirror and ask: How much do our own party’s internal battles resemble the fight happening within the Republican Party? As Democrats call for independence and pragmatism from Republicans, we should be asking ourselves how tolerant we are of dissent within our own party and how much we are really willing to reach across the aisle.

Senator Flake finished his remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday by quoting Abraham Lincoln, who reminded Americans on the eve of the Civil War that “we are not enemies, but friends” and “though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.” Mr. Flake wisely warned Republicans and Democrats that our bonds are dangerously strained. Now is the time to ensure they don’t break.

You know when you go to the mall and get your picture taken with Santa? My family took those Polaroids. It was their job.

Every time I visit my parents, I love going through old photos. Not the thousands of digital ones we have now, but ones that took some effort — 35 mm, 110 mm and Polaroids. Flipping through the albums, I see our selective family history recorded in flashbulb splashes and unintended grain. The misdirected movements of everyday life are recorded for posterity, through unwitting subjects not realizing their photo was being taken. I’ve looked at these photos for 40 years and it’s still addictive. You see the same things differently with time.

Recently I was home and looking through the photos again, and I saw some family Polaroids. Photos of me with a strange robot from the 1980s, and ones of me at a haunted house. Then more haunted house photos of a werewolf. Then photos of the Easter bunny. And then I realized — those are my parents.

I flashed back. When I was 11, our basement was full of masks, makeup and costumes, cool stuff for every holiday and popular characters. Mostly Halloween monsters that we used to help run a local haunted house. Bizarre homemade masks on the window sill next to fancy store-bought masks. Frankenstein’s Monster and The Werewolf and Darth Vader and the aforementioned giant rabbit. You didn’t have to be a kid for it to be an insanely magical atmosphere.

Mr. Kahn is letting his gifts as a sculptor and colorist, which are real, get the upper hand.","Critics have been divided, too. Half of them seemed to be trying to describe the experience in the most unpleasant terms possible, while the other half was looking for something nice to say. The first group appeared to have the easier job. Even Jonathan Gold of The Los Angeles Times, who named Vespertine the city’s best restaurant this week, acknowledged that the experience “is going to drive many of you insane.”

Anybody inclined to paint the restaurant as a steaming pile of pretentious nonsense will find that Jordan Kahn, Vespertine’s chef and overall impresario, is standing there with an open paint bucket and a brush. Vespertine is dedicated to “exploring a dimension of cuisine that is neither rooted in tradition nor culture,” a press release read. “It is a spirit that exists between worlds.” To Marian Bull of GQ, he described the building, one of several the architect Eric Owen Moss has designed in this low-rise district of vintage studio lots and start-ups, as “a machine artifact from an extraterrestrial planet that was left here like a billion years ago by a species that were moon worshippers.”

I spent most of an evening in that building and I still have no idea what he was talking about. The servers acted less like ancient space aliens than like monks running a monastic retreat for stressed-out nonbelievers. They glided around in black slippers and flowing black tunics, quiet as ninjas. When they were not going up the staircase to the third-floor kitchen or depositing food arrangements on the acrylic tabletops with a semi-explanatory murmur (“giant kelp with whipped honey and yuzu emulsion”), they stood motionlessly off to the side, looking either at the horizon or at the wall.

When he defines the cooking as rootless, Mr. Kahn is on more solid footing. Early in his career he worked in the pastry kitchens of Per Se and Alinea, so he knows how to take pains. A great deal of the pains he takes at Vespertine seem to go into making the food look like something other than food.

That, at least, is how it struck me after one meal at this “gastronomical experiment,” as the website has it. Writing up my preliminary impressions seems more appropriate than a full starred review for a work that is explicitly, intentionally in progress, one whose aim is to do something restaurants haven’t done before. Never mind that this has been the aim of a small parade of restaurants from El Bullí on, and that Vespertine falls right in step with that parade, however much it may pretend to have sprung from a fallen spore from another galaxy.

The first dish of the night seemed to be a sequined branch on an inclined black tortilla. The tortilla was a clay plate made, like many of the serving pieces, by a local sculptor named Robert Boldz. The branch was a water spinach stem brushed with turkey emulsion and bedazzled with little yellow pike eggs, tiny finger-lime orbs, pink and purple flowers the size of shirt-collar buttons, and whatnot. I like salads flavored with poultry juices, and I liked this.

Next came what I thought of as A Wheel Inside a Wheel, a wide looping belt of kelp stuck with blots of lovage sauce to the inside of a black ceramic hoop. There was a bloop of whipped honey inside the hoop, too. I stared, looking for a way in, until a server said, “You can think of it as chips and dip.” Oh, of course.

Some courses were almost inviting. Others seemed determined not to be eaten at all, like the C-curve of black wafer pressed into a C-curve of black ceramic. It wasn’t at all clear which part was supposed to go in my mouth. I gambled on the wafer, which was a crumbly savory cookie made from black currants and dried onions and brushed with black currant jam.

It went on from there, the portions growing slightly more substantial. Nothing tasted as weird as it looked. For this I was grateful. Nearly every dish tasted good, in one way or another, although more than one juxtaposed something unquestionably delicious with other things that turned up empty-handed to the flavor party: wonderful lobster in a bittersweet sauce of malted barley syrup and butter with a dull white spill of tapioca; exceptional brined scallop, sauced with yuzu and a tea made from Douglas fir tips, with unexciting ovals of white asparagus standing up like marble headstones in a cemetery.

Mr. Kahn has strong ideas about Vespertine’s food, but in these early months his interests seem predominantly visual. Drinking the juice pairing, I was amazed to realize that each of my drinks looked like my companion’s wines or beers; the ruby tone of his pinot noir nearly matched that of my beet and rose-hip juice. Our pairings converged at one point, a tea made from flowers of the butterfly pea plant. Its flavor was flat, almost imperceptible, but its color was a profound blue almost never seen at the dinner table.

Heightened attention to visuals is routine for chefs these days, when a pretty food picture can rocket around the world in minutes. This is not Mr. Kahn’s game. Certain Vespertine dishes are virtually unphotographable by design. The caramelized lobster, for instance, is squirreled away inside a black ceramic globe. A small opening lets in almost no light.

He isn’t trying to dress up his cooking so much as he’s trying to wrestle it away from familiarity. He certainly uses flowers for their colors — none of them tasted like much — but the blossoms he chooses are not normal restaurant ingredients. Gardeners may spot sweet alyssum, passionflower and yarrow, but others probably won’t.

The urge to make food unrecognizable as food has been going strong since the rise of Ferran Adrià, whose lasting legacy is his emphasis on transforming ingredients into unfamiliar shapes and states. Some chefs who followed Mr. Adrià’s plunge into the weird, such as Grant Achatz and Wylie Dufresne, often combined flavors in ways that were immediately recognizable, even if the shapes were new. The taste of pastrami and rye at Mr. Dufresne’s WD-50, or birthday cake at Mr. Achatz’s Alinea, provided a sensory thread back to the known world.

Photo

Mr. Kahn’s innovation is to cut that thread. The rhubarb compote he serves with heirloom turkey may or may not be an analogue for cranberries, but in general he faithfully carries out his promise to uproot Vespertine’s cooking from tradition and culture. You’re not meant to know what you’re eating, which may be why the servers’ monkish murmurs cover just a fraction of what they are depositing in front of you.

This would be all right if the flavors made as strong an impression as the shapes they’d taken. But I remember the way my meal looked much more vividly than how it tasted. Mr. Kahn is letting his gifts as a sculptor and colorist, which are real, get the upper hand.

For the first two hours or so, Vespertine had me going. The music, by the Texas ambient outfit This Will Destroy You, made me slow down and listen for small shifts and surprise harmonies. (Five recordings of violas, guitars, synthesizers, xylophones and music boxes, among other instruments, play in different parts of the restaurant, composed in relative keys so they mesh together when you hear more than one at a time.) I appreciated the way the murmuring monks, instead of telling me how “Chef” wanted the food to enter my body, left me to puzzle it out on my own. And up to a point, I enjoyed solving those puzzles.

Before dinner ended, though, I’d had enough. If I hadn’t been guilted into paying $30 in advance for after-dinner drinks in the garden by an unsubtle poke from the ticketing website (“We ask that all guests participate”), I would have called for the car.

Another Adrià legacy is the idea that creativity in cooking means a sharp break with the past. Mr. Achatz picked up on this when he named his restaurant Alinea, after the medieval symbol marking a new paragraph — a new line of thought.

I have never seen a restaurant try as hard as Vespertine to erase everything that came before. While I was eating there I didn’t miss the good old earth, but I did think that Mr. Kahn’s new planet needed a few more signs of life.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — People don’t believe me when I tell them that there is always a way into a puzzle, even the late week ones, but it’s true. What seems to happen is that some solvers quickly scan the list of clues on, say, a Friday puzzle,, see nothing that they know on the first pass, and decide that they can’t solve it. Many times, they give up and walk away.

But take a moment to think about this logically: What would be the point of making and editing a puzzle that no one can solve? It would be like building a house with no door or windows. It might be an interesting feat, but it’s ultimately unwelcoming. So the constructor and the editors always make sure that a porch light is left on for solvers, even if that light is in a different spot for different people.

• In Washington, President Trump continued his attacks on Jeff Flake and Bob Corker, two of his harshest Republican critics, who have said they will not run for re-election to the Senate.

With divisions roiling the Republicans, the prospect of a once-in-a-generation bill to cut taxes increasingly appears to be the last, best hope for the party to find some common ground.

But they are unifying in condemnation after revelations that Hillary Clinton’s campaign helped finance a dossier of salacious claims about Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia.

“Do I look like a gangster? I’m a businessman!”

Such is life in the world of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, an installment in the long-running video game series that was originally released 13 years ago today.

The Grand Theft Auto games, an action-adventure series in which players pursue a life of crime, has stretched over 20 years and more than a dozen titles.

With $250 million in sales, it’s one of the most successful franchises in video game history, falling behind only famous names like Mario and Pokémon.

The games are known for their nonlinear, open-world style, which allows players to cause random mayhem in fictionalized versions of U.S. cities.

As such, the series has long been accused of glamorizing violence. (In 2009, Guinness World Records labeled it the most controversial video game series ever, citing more than 4,000 news articles.)

Even so, the series has been a critical success — several titles are among the most well-reviewed games of all time — and celebrated for its soundtracks, voice acting and the sly sense of humor it applies to American culture.

As one character notes, guns blazing, “Ain’t the American dream grand!”

Thomas Furse contributed reporting.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — We’re doing some heavy lifting today, so make sure you do some warm-ups. John Guzzetta and Michael Hawkins are back and are asking us to help them move.

Today’s Theme

What we are moving are the Ys at the end of the first word of each of the theme entries, like the original phrase GRAVY TRAIN at 23A. The Ys (or their sound) move to the end of the second word of each theme phrase and are then pluralized to make an entirely different phrase, which is clued in a punny way. That changes the phrase to GRAVE TRAINEES, clued as “Interns at a cemetery?”

Please remember to lift with your knees and set the Ys down gently.

Similarly, the phrase JUICY PARTS (15D) is changed to JUICE PARTIES, which are “Social gatherings where fruit drinks are served?”

In nontheme news, there’s some really nice fill in Mr. Guzzetta’s and Mr. Hawkins’s grid. I liked NOSE JOB, POWER NAP, SO MEAN, MAIN MAN, SOUR MASH, EASY NOW, AWAY GAME, CHEEZIT, EVEN STEVEN, STONE TOOL, MEDIA STORM and TOY GUN.

Daniel Day-Lewis has always been unpredictable, and he may have delivered his biggest surprise yet when he announced in June that he would retire from acting after reteaming with his “There Will Be Blood” director, Paul Thomas Anderson, on one final film, “Phantom Thread.” The trailer for the movie has just been released, and it looks to be a portrait of an artist as intense and focused as the man who plays him.

Mr. Day-Lewis stars as Reynolds Woodcock, a 1950s London couturier who has always been married to his work. Into his life comes Alma (Vicky Krieps), a young woman who becomes his muse and, seemingly, his obsession. Lesley Manville, known for her roles in Mike Leigh films like “Mr. Turner” and “Topsy-Turvy,” plays Woodcock’s sister.

“Whatever you do, do it carefully,” Alma advises Woodcock in the teaser’s final line. That sentiment certainly applies to Mr. Day-Lewis, who has thoughtfully chosen parts like the painter with cerebral palsy in “My Left Foot” and the legendary president in “Lincoln.” Both those roles won Oscars for the actor, and so did his turn as an avaricious oilman in “There Will Be Blood.”

Mr. Xi already holds the title “guojia zhuxi,” which can be translated as “state chairman.” Since 1982, though, the government has translated this into English as “president.” Some critics say China adopted that translation to look more like other modern countries.

Many of Mr. Xi’s official positions relate to the military and national security, reflecting his ambition to strengthen his grip on a critical pillar of Communist Party power.

He also leads several entities that he created, including the National Security Commission, which has broad powers over domestic and foreign policy, including counterespionage laws. He is also chairman of the Central Commission for Integrated Military and Civilian Development, a group that tries to break down barriers between military and civilian research and development.

Mr. Xi has sought new ways to demonstrate he is serious about building a modern military force that can rival those of other major countries, including the United States. Last year, he appeared in fatigues at China’s joint battle command center in Beijing to unveil yet another title: “commander in chief.”

Driving Policy

In China’s vast bureaucracy, Mr. Xi is omnipresent. He has created several so-called leading groups, which he heads, to drive policy across a range of areas, including finance, cybersecurity and relations with Taiwan. Other agencies make decisions in these areas too, but the leading groups place Mr. Xi at the center of policymaking.

“Xi obviously believes that the title ‘general secretary’ alone doesn’t grant him sufficient power to push forward with his agenda,” said Jude Blanchette, a researcher at the Conference Board, a nonprofit research group, who studies Chinese politics. “Adding new and authoritative-sounding titles indicates a level of legitimacy within the system.”

‘Core’ Leader

Chairman or not, Mr. Xi has made clear that he considers himself a transformational figure leading China and the party into a new era. The Communist Party has bowed to his wishes, last year naming him China’s “core leader,” a designation that places him on the same pedestal as Mao, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin. While the title did not come with any special powers, it sent a message that Mr. Xi was not to be challenged.

The adulations have continued. At the party congress that ended this week, officials trying to prove their devotion lavished praise on Mr. Xi, including by calling him “helmsman,” a term that echoes Mao’s famous nickname, the “Great Helmsman.”

In Mr. Xi’s second term, the titles are likely to keep proliferating.

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

By setting himself up as the strongest ruler since Deng, Mr. Xi has pushed the world’s newest superpower into new and potentially dangerous political territory. On Tuesday, its final day, the congress elevated Mr. Xi, 64, to the same exalted status as the nation’s founder, Mao Zedong, by enshrining “Xi Jinping Thought” into the party’s constitution.

“If Xi goes for broke and breaks precedent by not preparing for an orderly and peaceful succession, he is putting a target on his back and risking a backlash from other ambitious politicians,” said Susan L. Shirk, the chairwoman of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego.

“By taking such a risk, he shows himself to be more like Mao than we originally thought — he demonstrates his power by overturning institutions,” she added.

Mr. Xi’s authoritarian approach was meant to bring faster policymaking after years of stagnation under his predecessor, Hu Jintao. Instead, critics say, the concentration of power in one man’s hands has created its own bottlenecks, with officials unsure how to execute policies or afraid to deviate from top-down demands.

Such problems could worsen. “Mr. Xi’s accrual of power heralds a more determined push around his favored economic policy initiatives and efforts to reassert the party’s role within public life,” said Tom Rafferty, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit. “However, aggressive centralization will also bring risks.”

The lack of a potential successor could be seen as a sign that Mr. Xi intends to dominate beyond this next five-year term, which ends in 2023, either by staying in office or behind the scenes. Mr. Xi may also want more time to test possible successors, while avoiding lame duck status with an heir waiting in the wings.

In a possible nod to concerns about Mr. Xi amassing too much power, most of the five new Standing Committee members were not longtime associates of his, though all have worked with him in some capacity. Premier Li Keqiang, the only holdover from the outgoing committee besides Mr. Xi, was once seen as a possible rival to lead the country.

“Xi has seemingly chosen magnanimity with the list,” said Christopher K. Johnson, an expert on Chinese elite politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Of course, that’s easy to do when you’ve achieved your two core objectives — making yourself the party’s untenured ideological arbiter and refraining from signaling the succession.”

Mr. Xi’s victory at the congress means he will welcome President Trump to China next month more confident than ever in his hold on power and the party’s support for his more assertive foreign policy.

His signature initiatives to extend China’s influence overseas, such as the global infrastructure program known as “One Belt, One Road” and a drive to build artificial islands in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, are now likely to stay unchallenged.

Some China watchers have said they also expect Mr. Xi to place more emphasis on overhauling the economy and cleaning up finances, after spending the past five years stamping out dissent and tightening his control over the party and the military, China’s other political power center.

One sign was the promotion of Liu He, his closest economic adviser and a longtime advocate of curbing debt and financial hazards. As a new member of the Politburo, a broader 25-member council that is less powerful than its Standing Committee, Mr. Liu appears likely to wield greater influence on policy.

In his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Xi noted that next year would mark 40 years since Deng opened up China to market forces and vowed to “firmly and unwaveringly deepen reform in every aspect.”

“He wants a team around him that will implement his vision,” said Evan S. Medeiros, the senior director for Asian affairs in the National Security Council in the Obama administration. “On economic issues, one could tentatively say that this Politburo Standing Committee is more reform-minded than the current lineup.”

This week’s congress, the party’s 19th since its establishment by Marxist revolutionaries in 1921, has portrayed Mr. Xi as a transformational leader guiding the nation into a “new era” of Chinese socialism. Mao unified China after nearly a century of civil war and foreign invasions, Deng brought it prosperity and Mr. Xi is said to be restoring the nation to global strength and leadership.

The congress blessed Mr. Xi’s agenda by writing his name and ideas into the party’s constitution, in effect declaring any effort to challenge him to be an act of ideological heresy.

Under Mao and then Deng, the party struggled with succession arrangements that ended in purges and division. Then, in steps from the 1990s onward, the party established a pattern of installing likely successors on the Standing Committee well in advance, with party leaders serving no more than two terms.

Mr. Xi himself joined the committee in 2007, before taking power in 2012. Before him, Mr. Hu served on the committee for a decade before succeeding Jiang Zemin.

The party has promoted a phalanx of officials loyal to Mr. Xi into the broader Politburo. About two-thirds of the 15 new members joining the body once worked under Mr. Xi or have other longstanding ties to him, including some younger leaders seen as potential successors.

They included Chen Min’er, 57, who worked as a propaganda functionary with Mr. Xi when they were both officials in the eastern province of Zhejiang in the early 2000s. Some experts had speculated that Mr. Xi might attempt to catapult Mr. Chen into the current Standing Committee.

SAN JUAN, P.R. — Girls raced up the school steps in their plaid pinafores and backpacks on Tuesday, ponytails tied tight with colorful ribbons. They hugged and squealed and swapped dramatic hurricane stories, eager to catch up after more than a month away.

“We are ready,” Kenia Caraballo Rivera, the principal at the Dr. Francisco Hernández y Gaetan school in San Juan, said with a smile as students stopped to say hello or embrace her.

“And this,” she added, pointing to a beige folding table and chair in the main hallway near the entrance, “is my office.” With no electricity in the school and no windows in her office, Ms. Caraballo works in the hall, where daylight streams in through the front door.

The resumption of classes at the school on Tuesday was a joyous, achingly needed milestone on the plodding path back to normality in Puerto Rico’s newest era: After Maria. But the island’s education system is hardly picking up where it left off before the storm.

Only 98 of the island’s public schools reopened on Tuesday, 9 percent of the total, and the ones that did were in San Juan and Mayagüez, two major cities. Another 112 schools in those areas will open as soon as their final paperwork is turned in.

Few, if any of the reopened schools have generators, or internet access, or air-conditioning. School days have been slashed in half, at least for now. And the students — the ones who have not moved to the mainland — must bring their own water bottles and douse themselves in repellent to fend off the island’s mosquito invasion.

Photo

Since most of the students have no electricity at home, either, homework is now out of the question. Many of them lost clothes and furniture to the storm, so uniforms have been made optional. Old-school is an all too literal way to describe classroom work: white boards, markers, flash cards, board games, and the occasional textbook have reappeared.

With more than a month of lost instructional time to make up at the reopened schools, and still more at the ones that have yet to reopen, the curriculum will have to be truncated, focusing strictly on the most important core elements for each grade. And the school calendar will have to be extended, perhaps into next summer.

“In terms of education, we know that it will not be a perfect year, but we need to take the first step,” Julia Keleher, Puerto Rico’s secretary of education, said in a statement on Tuesday. “It’s important to start wherever we can as soon as possible. But, I repeat again, only when it’s safe for the school population.”

Inside Hernández y Gaetan, a public elementary school that serves two poor neighborhoods in San Juan, students buzzed with stories about rising floodwaters, felled trees and soggy furniture. A teacher sat the school’s fifth-grade students in a circle and asked them to share their experiences, if they felt comfortable talking about them. The discussion was part of a larger strategy to incorporate the hurricane into lesson plans, both to help students cope and to help teach subjects like climate change, geography, plant life and the ocean.

Most of the students seized the chance.

“Are you happy to be back?” asked the teacher, Lorimar Morales.

“Well, not so much, because there is no power and it’s hot,” Heidi L. Rojas de Jesus, a talkative 10-year-old, said with a smile as she fanned herself with a piece of paper.

Photo

The students rattled off their losses, which were relatively minor compared with harder hit parts of Puerto Rico. Toppled avocado trees. Clothes ruined by rain or floodwaters. A wrecked mattress. A nearly destroyed Sony PlayStation. One student spoke of a dramatic rescue of an older woman whose house filled with water. Many reeled off a litany of grievances about the heat, the darkness and the endless waits in line for money, for gasoline, for bottled water.

“But the funniest thing is that our garbage can floated away in the water,” Heidi said.

Getting even the 98 least-damaged schools reopened was a difficult undertaking in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which roared across the island on Sept. 20 as a Category 4 storm, demolishing houses and buildings, trees and roads, and knocking out power and telecommunications. The power is still out in three-quarters of the island, and about one-third lacks cellphone service. Few homes have working generators.

Each school building had to be inspected by the Army Corps of Engineers and had to have working water before it could reopen. They had to be repaired, disinfected, and scrubbed of mud, mold and rat droppings; much of that work was done by determined teachers. The schools had to be able to feed the students, and there was paperwork to file. As a test run, the schools first opened as community centers to work out the kinks.

Ms. Keleher, the education secretary, said in an interview that so far, 150 of the island’s 1,113 schools have been rated as too badly damaged to reopen; their students will have to be accommodated elsewhere. It was not clear yet how many students have moved to the mainland. The Hernández y Gaetan school counted five.

Teachers have left, too: Islandwide, about 116 have applied for a special sabbatical that ends in January.

Mari Lopez, who teaches English at the Hernández y Gaetan school, may soon join them. As she kept her eye on a downcast little girl who was ordinarily cheerful and lively, Ms. Lopez, 59, said the devastation on the island has been hard to bear, and she misses family members who have gone to the mainland.

“It’s too much,” she said. “I don’t know how long it will take to get the power back on. It never comes.”

About 30 miles away in Humacao, where Maria left lines of concrete poles snapped in half and wrecked big-box stores, teachers at the Lidia Fiol Scarano school are desperate to get back to work. They already know which songs will greet the children; they have chosen what to grow in the garden in the school’s now-barren courtyard. Even the script for the Christmas show, with amusing skits about facets of post-Maria life like washing clothes by hand, is close to finished. All they need is a reopening date, which may still be far-off because of the extensive damage to other area schools.

The day after the hurricane, the principal, Migdalia Torres, and many of the teachers went to the school to take stock. All 19 of the big trees in the courtyard had been toppled, blocking access to the mud-caked classrooms and robbing the school of shade. Ms. Torres went to a local National Guard station and got 22 soldiers to follow her to the school, where everyone donned gloves and masks and got to work chopping, cleaning, wiping up and discarding debris.

Another school in Humacao had been flooded with five feet of water from the ocean and an adjacent lake. Soldiers pitched in there too, helping the school staff rescue a building that had looked like a lost cause. One wing is still in bad structural shape, but the staff is pushing hard to reopen the rest.

“The teachers have been the heroes here,” said Sonia L. Rodriguez Gonzalez, the principal.

Ms. Keleher said she hoped to give Puerto Rico’s long-ailing schools a boost after Hurricane Maria by decentralizing the school system, instituting greater local control and modernizing the curriculum.

The students in San Juan spoke of another transformation: People are being nicer to one another. One boy said that his neighbors had shared their brooms and machetes. A girl said an ambulance driver had said hello to her.

“And my neighbor used to be mean to me,” said Alanis Santiago, 13. “Now that I have a generator, she’s very nice.”","Some Puerto Rico Schools Reopen, Making Do Without Power",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/puerto-rico-schools.html

The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Photo

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

Photo

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Yes, hi, remember yesterday, when I said that you might as well solve the Friday because it wasn’t as hard as you would imagine it to be and besides, the Saturday puzzle would be much harder? Well, they don’t pay me the medium-sized bucks for nothing. Today’s puzzle by Samuel A. Donaldson and Brad Wilber is a real ... let’s just call it a learning experience, O.K.?

The bottom line on this very worthy puzzle: It’s tough, but it’s not tougher than you. Forget the horse-drawn carriage at 15A and the sainted archbishop of Canterbury at 19A for a second and drop in REID for TARA of the “Sharknado” films. There is no shame in knowing that. It will help you get the crossings. Maybe. If you know that Adobe makes the software that creates PDFs, put that in at 27A. Now you’ve got _ _ _ _ RP at 1D, which is a musical note. That’s got to be a SHARP note, right? Fill that in to help you get started on the northwest. You can come back for the first letter later. Now continue on like that until you get your toehold.

As tough as it is, it is also as close to a perfect Saturday crossword as they come. The grid is pristine, even if you are not familiar with some of the answers. The entries fluctuate between highly entertaining (HOSTESS TWINKIES) and hard to reach without help (IMARETS, which I feel like I should have known), but each of them are exquisite gems and they are all clued nearly perfectly. It just may take some reliance on outside references. The cluing is ramped up to 11, as evidenced, for one, by “Jet launcher” for GEYSER. That Kellogg brand at 40A is EGGO, of course.

THE GROWN-UPS’ Table

By Gabrielle Hamilton

For me, it was always a bit of an adult thrill to come downstairs on a Sunday morning, the household still sleeping, and find the table — the long formal one in the dining room — strewn with the last debris of the late-finishing dinner party given by my parents the night before. To walk the table’s perimeter, weaving around the pushed-back chairs, and to collect the foils and corks, the stained wineglasses and the scattered cloth napkins, to get the pancake spatula and pry up the candle wax that had overflowed, felt not unlike sneaking into their bedroom and finding the sheets curiously twisted, the pillows dented and, as long as I was there, furtively helping myself to the loose change left on the bureau. A little like trespassing.

I used to “read” the dinner-table detritus left behind — the felt-tip pen, the ivory silk kerchief, the little pile of strawberry hulls — as if they were fossil impressions not of sea horses or prehistoric invertebrates but of the conversations that were had there just hours earlier, records of a grown-up discussion I was dying to be allowed to join. Examining the remains, I imagined that the Champagne cages someone twisted into the shape of beautiful rudimentary butterflies were formed during a spontaneous recitation of a few lines of poetry. The torn, still-fragrant tangerine peels must have been stacked into neat piles when the conversation turned to the subject of parenting an ungovernable teenager; the cigarette butt crushed into in a walnut husk obviously, in my mind, stubbed out during the heated topic of money. I cleared and cleaned and then polished that table, and I cataloged — loosely, just in my brain — all the tangible things people held and worried in their hands during the lengthy meanderings and the reaching pauses of those adult-dinner-party conversations. The brandy snifters had to have landed, I was certain, around the second punch line of my dad’s best joke, as he dryly delivered the one about the hockey players and hookers.

Setting The Table In the following articles, our five food columnists provide menus and inspiration to help you host your own dinner parties this season. But that's not all. There are also details of the dinner parties that celebrities dream of hosting and tips for sparking great conversations from Rico Gagliano and Brendan Francis Newnam, hosts of the podcast “The Dinner Party Download.”

Enjoy your meal.

To me it has always been clear that a dinner party is about what is said, not what is eaten. There would always be wine and salad and bread and stew; chocolate and fruit and nuts and sparkling cold duck. But those were just the props — the conduits for funny and real and meaningful conversation; the set pieces of a lively, engaged, lingering old-school dinner party. The one that I have been chasing ever since.

I gave my first in ninth grade, several years after my parents split, at the home of a temporary surrogate guardian. I shopped and prepped and cooked and folded napkins and picked out serving utensils and made candle scapes down the center of the table. But even before the salad course was cleared, my teenage cohort was wasted on red wine, shouting for vodka shots. In the Polaroid I still have, it’s glassy eyes and crimson noses all around — drunken 14-year-olds at a well-set table, in formalwear. I recall I talked to my right-side tablemate, for unending minutes, about his puppy.

Still, over the next five years I persisted in spending my school money on brisket and whole sea bass and bone-in fresh ham, and my weekends sketching table arrangements, clomping through fields collecting grasses and branches to be laid artfully down the centers of tables for dinner parties at which, unfailingly, three people I invited and accounted for said they would come and then didn’t. Or someone I did invite showed up, late, with three people I didn’t invite. They arrived without a bottle or a bouquet. Even in my last year of college, my dinner parties had a juvenile feel — everybody still wasted on the red wine and inevitably looking to do shots — but at least not until dessert, which, alas, they could not quite stay seated through. I remember this as the restless age, with everybody up and down from the table, and outside smoking, leaving an empty seat, an orphaned tablemate, which chokes a conversation as surely as water in a carburetor stalls an engine.

But there were always, also, a couple of guests who knew exactly what to do. Who never arrived too early but allowed you a 10-minute breather just past the hour they were expected. Who never just plopped their paper cone of bodega flowers on the kitchen prep table in the middle of your work but instinctively scanned the cabinets for a vase and arranged the gerbera daisies then and there. They found the trash and put the wrapping in it, leaving your counters clean and your nascent friendship secured for eternity. When less-experienced guests arrived, those perfect friends guided them quickly to the bedroom to stash their coats and bags so they wouldn’t sling them willy-nilly over the backs of the chairs at the dinner table I had spent a week setting.

Questlove 1/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Dave Chappelle, Tania Bruguera, Shep Gordon, Jimmy Jam Harris, Mathew Knowles, Beth Stelling, Jessica Williams, Phonte Coleman, Gavin Turek. Dave Chappelle is the greatest icebreaker of all time. He once interrupted a 15-person prayer meeting in Prince’s hotel suite at 2 a.m. Super awkward for me, another engaged audience for him. What food would you serve? I don’t cook myself, but I know a lot of chefs. I'd want to hang out with them in the kitchen, and I'd want my guests to see how things are being created. Where would you host it? I want to create a kind of cultural clubhouse in New York. There would be a kitchen for my chef-mafia friends to jam in. What would you be drinking? Cedric Nicaise at Eleven Madison Park is my go-to for wine selections. If the party was dope enough, hopefully he would help me out. What sort of music would you play? Sixties music from Detroit. How would you get people to leave? They can stay, up to a point. But more than once, I’ve called in a noise complaint on my own house. Questlove’s third book, “Creative Quest,” will be published in 2018. Alice Waters 2/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Ruth Reichl, Mark Danner, Calvin Trillin, Bob Carrau, Davia Nelson, Fanny Singer and Michael and Judith Pollan. I invite everybody to come early and help cook, so I guess I’d have to drop Mark Danner and Calvin Trillin in that configuration, because neither of those two people participate. What food would you serve? Soup with pesto, a roast chicken, salad, potato gratin, grapes, Japanese persimmons, pears and chocolate. I always serve mint tea at the end of a meal: It revives you a little bit after you’ve been drinking wine. Where would you host it? At home. What would you be drinking? Rosé while we’re preparing. A red Domaine Tempier with dinner. What sort of music would you play? Miles Davis’s ‘‘Kind of Blue.’’ But ideally, I would have Bob Carrau play piano in the other room. How would you get people to leave? I just turn on Aretha Franklin, and we all wash dishes together. It’s so nice to get up out of your seat and stretch your legs. I love to dance at the end of dinner. Then I just turn off the music, and we say bye. Alice Waters is a chef and the owner of Chez Panisse. Busy Philipps 3/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Marc Silverstein, Irene Neuwirth, Phil Lord, Ed Droste, Simon Renggli, Johnathan Rice, Jason Greene, Paul F. Tompkins, Janie Haddad Tompkins, Danny McBride, Gia Ruiz. What food would you serve? A fresh tomato-broth pasta dish, a butter-lettuce salad with a buttermilk dressing, flank stank with chimichurri, roasted potatoes, asparagus, ice-cream sundaes. I like having several different kinds of ice cream, including a sorbet, which doesn’t lend itself to a sundae — but some people, especially in Los Angeles, will only have just, like, a bite of sorbet, so that’s what you have to do. Where would you host it? At home. You can see the Hollywood sign, you can see downtown. What would you be drinking? Margaritas or some sort of tequila drink. What sort of music would you play? Rostam, Frank Ocean, Chance the Rapper, Alex G, Lana Del Rey, Belle and Sebastian. We could play Grizzly Bear’s new album, although Ed might get a little embarrassed that we’re playing his music. How would you get people to leave? I just go to bed. People get the hint. Busy Philipps appears on “Vice Principals” on HBO. DJ Khaled 4/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Obama, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Nas, Rihanna, Drake, Michael Jordan, Oprah. And whomever my 1-year-old son, Asahd, wants to invite. What food would you serve? Maqluba, an Arabic dish with rice, chicken and eggplant. Where would you host it? My home. What would you be drinking? Cîroc, Luc Belaire, D’ussé, wine. What sort of music would you play? Sizzla, Buju Banton, Bob Marley, Sadé. How would you get people to leave? I would just keep bringing dessert out. DJ Khaled’s most recent album, “Grateful,” was released in June. John Waters 5/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Eminem, though I know he’d never come; the Fassbinder star Irm Hermann; Judy Clarke, the defense lawyer who has never talked to the press (hopefully she’d loosen up after a few drinks); Lana Del Rey; the Argentine sexpot Isabel Sarli; Ingrid Superstar, Warhol’s almost-forgotten actress, who wandered away from her mother’s home and was never seen again. I refuse to believe she’s dead. Ingrid! Dinner’s served! What food would you serve? Liver. Shut up and eat it. Where would you host it? In my Baltimore dining room, so the guests would look up at that great Mike Kelley drawing I have that kind of looks like a big turd. What would you be drinking? Open bar, including “mocktails” for guests who might be in A.A. What sort of music would you play? King Krule, Elvis Perkins, Future Islands, Iris DeMent, Glenn Gould. How would you get people to leave? Easy. Just put on that soundtrack of Gaspar Noé’s “Irreversible.” The “A John Waters Christmas” spoken-word tour begins Nov. 27 in Chicago.

And over the next 20 years, those couple of perfect friends grew to be many, and because I worked in catering, I was often given excesses to take home — oysters, flowers, steamed lobsters — around which I could organize a dinner. So even if the plumber’s candles came from the hardware store, and the place settings were marked with kitchen work towels, and the table was just a door set on sawhorses, the chairs a bunch of overturned milk crates with Sunday newspapers as cushions, it was still, no matter, a good long decade of people facing one another. The dripping of the candles that formed a frothy white-water wax centerpiece like the one my mother had held us all transfixed. We sat, ate, drank, talked and talked. Smoked, drank, told jokes, argued and talked more. And the wineglasses, the bottles, the foils and the corks, the bread heels were left on the table to be cleared the following day.

I’ve always been against the insistent, well-meaning cleanup brigade that convenes in the kitchen before anybody has even digested. Those people who are pushing back their chairs and clearing the dessert plates from the table just as you are squeezing the oily tangerine peels into the flames to watch the blue shower of sparks, who are emptying all the ashtrays just as you are dipping your finger in the wine and then running it around the rim of your wineglasses to make tones like those from a monastery in Tibet. When I invite you over, I mean it. I mean: Sit down. I will take care of you. I will buy the food and get the drinks and set the table and do the cooking, and I will clean up after. And when I come to your house, you will do the same. I will get to have the honor of being a guest. To perfectly show up, 10 minutes after the appointed time, with a bottle in hand for you, to bring my outgoing, conversational self, my good mood, my appetite, and to then enjoy all that is offered to me, and to then get my coat at the very end and leave without having lifted a finger. It is just the greatest thing of all time.

But just when I could finally afford to buy my first 13-quart heavy enamel Le Creuset lidded pot, and invite people to dinner around a real table — not a Salvation Army jobbie — guests started coming to dinner with their phones, the glow of those screens as lethal to the conversation as empty seats had been. People passed them back and forth to show photos meant to illustrate things that they used to describe verbally. We stopped looking at one another across the table and started crowding in on one another staring together at a tiny hand-held screen someone was holding up in explanation of a trip to India, the fog from a morning run. Quickly our vocabularies shrank. Instead of summoning words, people tapped on images. People stopped finishing their sentences. And in startlingly short order, they could no longer describe with language the places they had been; the way they had felt in the dark night; the powerful weight of the tropical winds and the humidity of their recent vacations, the dirt road they got lost on, the woman who brought milk and bread and butter and yogurt to their pensione. There were fewer well-told stories at the dinner table, fewer compelling twists and pauses, fewer meandering conversations among the group, until there were almost no more wire Champagne cages gently twisted into the shapes of animals. We had our hands full with our phones.

And then suddenly, any talking was about the food itself. Not just the food on the table in front of us but the food at last night’s table, and the lunch the day before that, the food at the restaurant on vacation, the food in the magazine, the food on Instagram. I set the table and cooked the food and poured the wine as I had for decades, but now, as soon as the first course landed, someone snapped a photo of it. Had my children come downstairs to say good night, they would not have felt any ripple of excitement at the din of adult conversation they were allowed to glimpse. Nothing adult to trespass upon. The dinner party nearly died for me then.

But if I had given up on people not quite knowing what to do at a dinner party, I would have given up back in ninth grade. The dinner party now depends more than ever on having one frequently, offhandedly, with abandon. If there are only eight seats and you know a few are going to end up with someone who’s got his head down to check his phone every 20 minutes, or who will be drunk on red wine by the salad course, just think of next month. To know that there will always be, for you, month after month, year after year, decade after decade, a well-set table and a roast and a salad and still, always, the wine, is to know that you are always going to find along the way another perfect friend, and then yet another.

Invite some outliers in there, some unexpecteds. Your several perfect friends, of course, who really know how it’s done but also that person you’ve always had such affection for at your coffee shop but with whom you never had any exchange that lasted longer than 20 minutes. The new couple who moved in across the street. The cousin of your old friend who is having empty-nest syndrome. The line cook at your restaurant who never asks for a day off. Your editor at the magazine whom you torture monthly with deadline trauma.

Set the table. Arrange the chairs. Even if you can now afford real flowers, trudge across a field for a morning anyway collecting attractive branches and grasses to arrange down the center of the table — it will put you right. Roast the rabbits and braise the lentils, and clean the leeks and light all the candles. Even now, someone may get a little lit on the red wine and want to do a shot. But that may be just what your dinner party needs. Get out the Fernet Branca, and pour everyone a shot, and tell your dad’s best one-liner, the one about Mrs. Katz. When your kids come downstairs to say good night, give them a glimpse of something unforgettable.

Violence against women was only one of the issues Ms. Jensen and the journalists she edited and mentored dug into at Women’s eNews.
She had recently left Women’s eNews and started the Jane Crow Project to combat that problem, especially among African-American women.","About two years later, when the fund withdrew its sponsorship, Ms. Jensen took the site over, turning into fund-raiser in chief in addition to editor in chief to keep it afloat and further its mission of writing about women’s issues, which she defined expansively.

“It’s not just about abortion,” she said in a 2007 interview with CUNY-TV in New York. “It’s about economic opportunity. It’s about the nutrition programs. It’s about who’s going on the Supreme Court next. It’s about everything that impacts women, which is everything.”

Rita Jane Henley was born on Jan. 1, 1947, in Columbus. Her father, Justin, was a journalist, and her mother, the former Mary Elizabeth Downey, was a homemaker.

Her first journalism job was with The Paterson News in New Jersey, where she was a reporter from 1977 to 1979. Then came the position at the Stamford paper and the Brink’s robbery, a botched job attempted by members of the Black Liberation Army and other radicals, for which Ms. Boudin went to prison. (She was released in 2003 and is now an assistant professor at Columbia.)

Ms. Jensen brought legal action against the company. Central to the dispute was whether she had known the real identity of Ms. Boudin, who was using the name Lynn Adams. Ms. Jensen said at the time that she had known who Ms. Boudin was and had so informed her editor, but that later news accounts had misconstrued the careful wording they had devised to skirt the issue.

“The media picked up the story, added and subtracted a word here and there, and suddenly I was quoted denying that I knew Lynn Adams was actually Kathy Boudin,” she said.

As Ms. Jensen eased back into journalism, she was writing about women’s issues even before she started Women’s eNews. Her personal experience with spousal abuse made her a lifelong advocate for providing women in difficult circumstances with support.

“The resources available to battered women in need of assistance have drifted steadily downward during the past 20 years,” she wrote in 1996, when President Bill Clinton was pushing changes to the welfare system.

“In 1973, my children and I lived in Ohio and received $204 a month or about 75 percent of the average need,” she said, adding, “Twenty-three years later, the maximum family of three in Ohio receives $341 or less than half of the average need.”

The issue was not just dollars and cents, she continued.

“I am willing to go so far as to say the ongoing Republican and conservative Democratic campaigns against welfare inflame the hatred of the attackers and further diminish low-income women’s self-respect and are therefore contributing factors to domestic violence,” she wrote.

Violence against women was only one of the issues Ms. Jensen and the journalists she edited and mentored dug into at Women’s eNews. Single motherhood, health, women’s legal status and more received scrutiny, and the site looked far beyond the borders of the United States. In 2003 it started an Arabic version after noticing that its articles were drawing a lot of readers in countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

Most recently, Ms. Jensen had been concerned with high mortality rates among women giving birth in parts of the United States, a subject she wrote about for cnn.com in May. She had recently left Women’s eNews and started the Jane Crow Project to combat that problem, especially among African-American women.

She also occasionally wrote about her breast cancer. In a straightforward, often droll article for sheknows.com in 2016, she recounted her decision not to have reconstructive surgery after a mastectomy.

“I do not regret that I decided to drop a boob,” she wrote. “I do regret that the post-mastectomy bathing suit I bought is ugly, by my lights. I would really like my black Speedo back.”

Ms. Jensen’s marriage to James Jensen in 1965 ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Jensen-Vargas, she is survived by another daughter, Shasta Jensen; three brothers, Dick, Paul and Mark Henley; and four grandchildren.

Ms. Jensen was always quick to acknowledge the help she received in hard times, whether from an aid program or the good Samaritan who got her to orientation on her first day at Ohio State.

Having no money for transportation, she hoped to hitchhike to the university, dropping her two girls off at two different day care centers on the way. That improbable plan succeeded when a man in a red sports car pulled over in the rain; the stranger dropped the two children off, then dropped her off, even letting her bum one of his cigarettes.

“When he let me out, I thanked him,” she recalled, recounting the moment in the anthology “Nothing but the Truth So Help Me God: 73 Women on Life’s Transitions” (2014). “He nodded, revved his engine and sped off.”","Rita Henley Jensen, Founder of Women’s eNews, Dies at 70",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/obituaries/rita-jensen-dead-journalist-founded-womens-enews.html

There’s a similar pattern in well-educated districts across the country.
The enthusiasm among well-educated Democrats and the relative lack of success recruiting established politicians in working-class areas has occasionally led to an odd mismatch: affluent, liberal types running in working-class districts.","Over all, there are 11 districts (out of the 50 districts that ought to be most competitive, by our estimates) where the Democrats don’t have a candidate who raised $100,000. On average, those 11 districts are much less educated than the battlegrounds as a whole; just 31 percent of whites over age 25 have a degree. In comparison, whites with a degree represent 41 percent of the population in the other 39 districts that ought to be most competitive.

Democratic Fund-Raising Lagging in Working-Class Districts Democratic share of fund-raising in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018, by white educational attainment. 20% 40 60 100% 75 50 25 0 Whites with degree Democratic share of fund-raising 20% 30 40 50 60 100% 75 50 25 0 Whites with a college degree Democratic share of fund-raising

There is still plenty of time for Democrats to find candidates in those districts. And even in working-class areas, Democrats are doing far better at recruiting and fund-raising than in recent years. They have attracted strong recruits in many competitive working-class districts, like Maine’s Second, New York’s 21st and Illinois’s 12th. Democrats even have well-funded challenges in a few working-class districts that weren’t bound to be competitive at all, like Paul Ryan’s district in Wisconsin, Kentucky’s Sixth or Kansas’ Second. And working-class districts are often in less expensive media markets, making it easier for Democrats to make a late bid.

The Democrats will clearly have the money to compete in expensive markets like Los Angeles and New York. They’ve posted staggering fund-raising totals in many of the best-educated districts, often outpacing longtime Republican congressmen. If anything, Democrats might have the opposite problem in these well-educated areas: too many viable candidates.

In Orange County, Calif., Democratic challengers have outraised Republican incumbents by a two-to-one margin this year, even though the Republicans got a head start before their Democratic challengers entered the race. But there’s a catch: There are 15 Democratic candidates who have raised more than $100,000 in just those four districts, setting up a series of costly primaries that might ultimately prove detrimental to the party’s general election chances. There’s a similar pattern in well-educated districts across the country.

Democrats Have Many Candidates in Well-Educated Districts Number of Democrats who have raised over $100,000 in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018. 20% 40 60 6 4 2 0 ↑ Number of Dems over $100k Whites with a degree → Number of Democrats who have raised over $100,000 in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018. 20% 30 40 50 60 6 4 2 0 Pct. whites with a degree → ↑ Number of Dems over $100k

The abundance of Democratic challengers in these well-educated districts is a reflection of huge enthusiasm. In these areas, there’s no shortage of well-to-do and well-connected political novices looking to “do something” about Mr. Trump’s presidency, just as there was no shortage of well-educated Democrats lining up for the Jan. 21 Women’s March or donating to the campaign of Jon Ossoff in Georgia’s Sixth District special election.

Few established politicians are standing in the way of these political newcomers. The Democratic bench is quite weak in these traditionally Republican and often heavily gerrymandered areas. There are no obvious contenders strong enough to clear the field.

The enthusiasm among well-educated Democrats and the relative lack of success recruiting established politicians in working-class areas has occasionally led to an odd mismatch: affluent, liberal types running in working-class districts. Take Josh Harder, who worked for a San Francisco venture capital firm but is now running in California’s typically competitive 10th District in the Central Valley, or ex-Obama administration officials like Elissa Slotkin, Lauren Baer and Andy Kim, who are running in middle-class districts in Michigan, Florida and New Jersey.

The good news for Democrats is that they don’t need perfect recruits to pull off big wins if it’s a so-called wave election year. Mr. Ossoff was a true political novice and still came close to winning, and the 2006 and 2010 wave midterm elections are full of examples of fairly weak recruits who pulled off important victories.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Jeff Chen is back with a surprisingly straightforward puzzle, which made me wonder if he was secretly taking us for a ride. His puzzles have had some pretty neat gimmicks in them, so when I see a list theme from him, my first thought is that perhaps he is pulling the old bluff on us.

Today’s Theme

It’s actually a list theme, but it’s a tight one. A total of four, two-word phrases each have a synonym for “victim” as their first word, and the CON MEN who target them are hiding away at 43D. For example, at 30A, the answer to “A mere pittance” is CHUMP CHANGE and, at 40A, the answer to the clue “Unexpected hit” is SUCKER PUNCH.

Tricky Clues

21A: A “Person setting the stage?” could be a narrator, but today it’s a ROADIE setting up for a concert.

57A: This puzzle was one of the entries in the Westchester Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and quite a few of the solvers were bamboozled by the spelling of MARK ANTONY with a ‘K.’ Many contestants thought that his name was spelled with a ‘C,’ but it’s not. And you have that easy crossing of PORKY’S to confirm.

23D: My first reaction to IBANKER was “What? No!” but it’s a thing.

37D: UNDEROOS were haute couture when The Boy was a wee one. He preferred the Batman ones.

Constructor Notes

My mother-in-law’s name is Patsy and I’m a big fan of Patsy Cline — “Walkin’ After Midnight” is one of my favorites. Not hard to see where I got the idea for the puzzle. What is hard to see is PATSY CLINE in the grid. She could have gone where PIGEON COOP is, but my mother-in-law in a crossword where PATSY is associated with CHUMP, SUCKER, and MARK ... hmm.

Probably not good for your marriage, Mr. Chen. Or your life.

Eugene Smith Memorial Fund’s 2017 grant in Humanistic Photography for his project on the European migrant and refugee crisis.

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Photo

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

Ms. Gilson said that N.A.A.C.P. representatives would be invited to American Airlines headquarters in Fort Worth, Tex., to discuss the issue.

“We are committed to having a meaningful dialogue about our airline, and are ready to both listen and engage,” she said.

Ms. Williams said that she believed the pilot’s actions were racially motivated based on the language he used with her, particularly since he referred to her as “belligerent” and “a threat” even as she was holding her infant daughter.

She called for the airline to grant pilots less discretion, saying that it would make it harder for their biases to affect passengers.

“Because they’re allowed to do whatever they want to, then if a pilot does have racist or misogynist or homophobic characteristics, then they’re able to utilize them to further oppress members of disenfranchised groups,” she said.

On Wednesday, the airline sent a message to employees signed by its chief executive, Doug Parker, emphasizing that the company’s mission was in line with that of the N.A.A.C.P. and that it would not “tolerate discrimination of any kind.”

Here’s how the Dodgers won Game 1 of the World Series:

Photo

Top 1st: Clayton Kershaw delivers ...

The 2017 World Series is underway. The first pitch of Game 1 was thrown by Clayton Kershaw at 8:11 p.m. Eastern. The 94 mile-per-hour fastball was fouled off by George Springer.

Kershaw finished Springer off in four pitches, striking him out on a slider that dove toward the center fielder’s feet. Alex Bregman flew out to left, and Jose Altuve grounded out to shortstop, giving Kershaw a perfect inning on just nine pitches. Seven of his nine pitches were strikes.

Waldstein: Clayton Kershaw looking sharp at the outset. As colleague Tyler Kepner pointed out, he recorded three outs on his three pitches: Fastball, slider, curve. Kepner, who is sitting beside me and will have fascinating insight all game, also noted that as much as people laud Kershaw’s curveball, his slider is really his most devastating pitch.

Photo

Bottom 1st: Taylor puts Dodgers on the board.

Chris Taylor got the Dodgers on the board first, hitting Dallas Keuchel’s first pitch of the World Series well over the left field wall for a 1-0 lead.

The breakout performer for the Dodgers, who has firmly established himself as the team’s leadoff batter, was sitting on a fastball and got one right down the middle.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Keuchel settled down to strike out Justin Turner on seven pitches. Cody Bellinger was retired on a groundout to second, and Yasiel Puig grounded out to short to end the inning. For 10 of Keuchel’s 11 pitches he looked dominant, but he can’t get back that first offering to Taylor.

Top 2nd: Kershaw cruises through middle of order.

Staked to a lead, Clayton Kershaw started off the inning by retiring Carlos Correa on a fly ball to center field. He caught Yulieski Gurriel sleeping on a 94 mile-per-hour fastball that sailed right through the zone for strike three. And then he induced a ground ball from Brian McCann which second baseman Logan Forsythe fielded in shallow right field before throwing him out to end the inning.

Kepner: The Dodgers’ ballpark organist played a few bars of “Paint It Black” by the Rolling Stones after Kershaw painted the black (hit the corner) to strike out Yuli Gurriel in the top of the second. Pretty sharp.

Photo

Bottom 2nd: Keuchel settles in after early disaster.

Dallas Keuchel has continued to look strong since his first pitch of the game went for a home run. Kike Hernandez got things started in the half-inning by singling to left but Corey Seager, making his return to the team after missing the N.L.C.S. with back trouble, grounded into an easy double-play to erase the threat. Logan Forsythe was nearly out on a foul pop to right field that a diving Josh Reddick couldn’t handle, but on the next pitch he ended the inning by popping out to center.

Top 3rd: Astros get a base runner, but that’s it.

The Astros got their first hit of the game, but they were not able to do anything with the base runner.

Clayton Kershaw started the inning by getting another called strike three, this time to Marwin Gonzalez, but Josh Reddick, the former Dodger, followed that up with a hard grounder to right that scooted just past Cody Bellinger’s glove for Houston’s first hit.

Dallas Keuchel, who seemed lost trying to bunt Reddick over to second, ended up striking out on a foul bunt attempt, and then George Springer flailed at strike three to end the inning. Kershaw now has five strikeouts.

Photo

Kepner: Josh Reddick went 0 for 22 before his first hit in the ALCS. So, naturally, he gets a left-on-left single against Kershaw in his first at-bat of the World Series. The fans here have been booing Reddick every chance they get, as he predicted. They didn’t like him when he played here last year, and the feeling apparently is mutual.

That’s 5 strikeouts in 10 batters for Kershaw: two on sliders, two on fastballs, and one on a curveball. Even more impressive considering that the Astros had the fewest strikeouts in the majors this season.

Bottom 3rd: Taylor hits it hard again. Too hard.

The leadoff batter for the Dodgers reached for the third consecutive inning, as Austin Barnes hit a grounder through the infield into shallow left for a single. Clayton Kershaw, who has considerably more experience as a batter than Dallas Keuchel, showed him how the National League does things with a bunt that sent Barnes to second. But Chris Taylor, who started the game with a home run on the first pitch he saw, ended the inning by hitting a rope to shortstop Carlos Correa, who easily doubled Barnes off second base to end the inning.

Kepner: It hardly seemed likely at the time, but the Dodgers got two Game 1 World Series starters in the same deal in Dec. 2014: Enrique Hernandez and Austin Barnes. The Dodgers got those two, plus pitchers Chris Hatcher and Andrew Heaney, from the Marlins for Dee Gordon, Dan Haren and Miguel Rojas.

Top 4th: Bregman takes Kershaw deep.

The game is tied. Alex Bregman took Clayton Kershaw’s third pitch of the inning over the wall in left-center for a home run, evening the score at 1-1. It was the seventh home run that Kershaw has allowed this postseason. Going back to the regular season, he has now allowed at least one homer in nine consecutive games. After allowing Bregman’s blast, Kershaw got consecutive called strike threes on Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa, with home plate umpire Phil Cuzzi giving him some help on a low slider that retired Altuve. Yulieski Gurriel swung helplessly at a slider to end the half-inning, and Kershaw is up to eight strikeouts.

Waldstein: I spoke to Carlos Beltran yesterday and he was raving about Bregman. Beltran said Bregman just has an unquenchable thirst for the game and always wants to talk baseball. They often go over video of pitchers and Beltran said sometimes they do their video scouting back at the hotel. Bregman picked a really good guy to learn from.

Bregman, at 23 years and 208 days, became the youngest American League player to hit a home run in the World Series since Manny Ramirez for Cleveland against Atlanta in 1995. Ramirez was 60 days younger.

Bottom 4th: Dodgers struggle to hit Keuchel hard.

It was a remarkably quiet half-inning for the Dodgers. Justin Turner popped out to first, Cody Bellinger grounded out to first, and Yasiel Puig grounded out to short. Dallas Keuchel continues to induce soft contact to great effect.

Kepner: He’s one section out of view from the center field cameras, but Scott Boras, the powerful agent who sits directly behind home plate in Anaheim, is here in the front row just to the third-base side of the plate. Boras represents both team’s No. 3 hitters — Jose Altuve and Cody Bellinger. Neither has hit free agency yet; Bellinger is a rookie, and the Astros control Altuve’s rights on a bargain deal (signed with a different agent) through 2019. Here are Altuve’s salaries: 2014: $1.25M, 15: $2.5M, 16: $3.5M, 17: $4.5M, 18: $6M club option, 19: $6.5M club option.

Top 5th: Kershaw and Keuchel are dueling.

This game has settled into a solid pitcher’s duel (minus the two solo homers) and it continued with Clayton Kershaw having yet another perfect inning. Brian McCann grounded right into the shift to start things off, and then Kershaw got some help from his defense when Justin Turner handled an awkward bounce on a grounder from Marwin Gonzalez, throwing out Gonzalez easily at first. Kershaw then ended the half-inning by freezing Josh Reddick with a 95 mile-per-hour fastball for strike three.

Waldstein: With two good pitchers doing their thing — minus one home run each — this game is moving along at a rapid pace. Kershaw is getting strikeouts and Keuchel inducing ground balls. Kershaw has nine strikeouts already against the team that struck out the least in baseball. His stuff is very crisp.

Photo

Bottom 5th: Double play gets Keuchel out of inning.

Dallas Keuchel got his second strikeout of the game on a changeup to Kike Hernandez. Corey Seager followed that up by looping a single into shallow center, but Keuchel was able to get out of trouble quickly thanks to Logan Forsythe grounding into a double play to end the inning. Keuchel has been efficient all game, and has thrown just 55 pitches in five innings. Kershaw is at 66.

Waldstein: Alex Bregman starts another double play, the third for the Astros through five innings, two of which were initiated by Bregman. I am sure most fans can guess why he wears No. 2. Like most players today, it is because of Derek Jeter. Bregman said his mother was a Yankees fan, and even though he rooted against the Yankees, he always rooted for Jeter.

Top 6th: Kershaw records 11th strikeout.

Dallas Keuchel’s misadventures at the plate continued, with the American League hurler waving at one strike, and then watching two more before sitting down as Clayton Kershaw’s 10th strikeout victim. In a moral victory, he drew two balls before being retired.

George Springer was strikeout No. 11 on a changeup that was nearly in the dirt, and Alex Bregman ended the half-inning with a groundout to short.

Kershaw is the first Dodgers pitcher to have double-digit strikeouts in a World Series game since Sandy Koufax had 10 in Game 7 of the 1965 Series.

Waldstein: As if Kershaw was not already dominating with his curve, slider and fastball, he drops a rare changeup on Springer for his 11th strikeout. He has retired nine in a row since the Alex Bregman home run. He is averaging an extremely efficient 11 pitches per inning, especially impressive considering all the strikeouts.

Photo

Bottom 6th: Turner’s shot gives Kershaw a cushion.

Justin Turner hit a two-run home run to left field, giving the Dodgers a 3-1 lead.

Dallas Keuchel needed just one pitch to get the first out of the half-inning, retiring Austin Barnes on a grounder to short. Clayton Kershaw also grounded out to short, but then Chris Taylor walked on five pitches. Turner made Keuchel pay for the base runner by crushing an 87 mile-per-hour cutter over the wall, with the crowd in Dodger Stadium exploding in cheers for the popular player.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Keuchel was able to get out of the inning without any further trouble by striking out Cody Bellinger, but with the way Kershaw has been pitching, a two-run lead feels gigantic.

Waldstein: Turner picks up where he left off. The last game here was Game 2 of the N.L.C.S. and Turner hit a walk-off, three-run home run to win Game 2 of that series. Tonight he blasts a two-run shot after Keuchel made the big mistake of walking Chris Taylor ahead of him with two outs. Turner has 4 home runs in the postseason, tied for second-most by a Dodger. Davey Lopes had the most, 5, in 1978.

I think Turner is going to tie Lopes’s record. He also has 26 career postseason R.B.I. for the Dodgers. That ties Duke Snider, who collected all of his in the World Series. For Turner, 14 of his postseason R.B.I. have come this year, establishing a new Dodgers single-season postseason record. And yes, the Mets let him go for nothing.","How the Dodgers Won World Series Game 1, Inning by Inning",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/sports/dodgers-astros-world-series.html

Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants’ vast powers might be harmful.
For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable — so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.
Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government.
A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today’s tech giants.","Now, that attitude is beginning to change. I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants’ power through government — and, if so, how.

There are growing efforts in Washington to do something about big tech. The recognition that networks like Facebook, Google and YouTube played a great and mainly hidden role in last year’s presidential election has spurred an urgent effort to regulate political ads online.

On the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five — Amazon, Facebook and Google. Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Steve Bannon wing of the right. Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech. And, as my colleague Cecilia Kang notes, media, telecom and other industries are pushing these arguments on both sides.

But there is little to suggest we’ll see drastic action anytime soon. Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants’ vast powers might be harmful. The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague. The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout.

“Individuals, lawmakers, we’re all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies,” said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power. For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable — so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.

Mr. Lynn thinks that view is shifting. In June, Open Markets was forced from its previous home, the New America Foundation, reportedly because of pressure from Google, a huge New America funder. (Google and New America have denied that claim.)

“Our firing has transformed the discussions among people about the power of these companies,” Mr. Lynn said. “Folks in this town saw this, noticed it, and I’d bet a lot of money a year from now we’ll see real huge shifts in feelings around here.”

Part of what has hampered governmental action against the Five is the unusual nature of their power. Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what we’ve ever expected from corporations. In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships. They’re being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.

They’re creating machines that could one day approximate and surpass human intelligence — a technological achievement that may come with as many complications as the advent of nuclear weapons. And all of them figure into economic inequality in the United States, since their digital wares provide vast riches to a relative few employees and investors in liberal West Coast enclaves, while passing over much of the rest of the world.

But in other ways, the Five do not cleanly fit traditional notions of what constitutes dangerous corporate power. Only a couple of them enjoy monopolies or duopolies in their markets — Google and Facebook in digital ads, for example.

Apple’s iPhone is the world’s most profitable product, its App Store the most important digital marketplace, and yet two out of three smartphones sold in the United States are not iPhones.

Amazon is considered ground zero in the vast transformation of American retail, and is implicated in the unfolding story of how our jobs and our lunches will be gobbled up by machines. But only in the last year did Amazon’s annual revenue surpass that of Costco. It does not yet enjoy a majority share of online commerce in America, has a single-digit share of American retail and is still a minor satellite compared with Walmart’s sun.

Then there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants. We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street. The Five’s power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices. We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them. For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.

“We’ve all become a bit cyborg,” writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in “World Without Mind,” one of several new books examining the giants. “What we need to always remember is that we’re not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.”

The complicated nature of the Five’s power has sparked novel ideas about how to regulate them. In January, Lina M. Khan, a fellow at Open Markets, published an article in The Yale Law Journal arguing for a complete reconception of antitrust laws to deal with the rise of Amazon. Ms. Khan argued that the modern view of antitrust laws, which were conceived under the Reagan administration, overemphasized low prices as a test for whether a company is gaining too much market power.

Because Amazon manages to keep lowering prices, the antitrust authorities have overlooked other harms caused by Amazon’s growth, she said, including the way it has created platforms for shipping and cloud storage that give it deep hooks into much of the rest of the economy. Open Markets has offered a similar critique of Google and Facebook.

Yet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because it’s politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices. Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didn’t need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement.

That, too, seems to be lacking. Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government. European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review. During last year’s presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasn’t done much in office to carry that out. Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods, for example, sailed through regulatory review.

Put all this together and you get a story of apathy and indecision in the face of colossal corporate power.

“We are looking at a set of circumstances where the monopolies have become so much more pervasive and intrusive,” said Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who took on Microsoft at its peak two decades ago, prompting the historic trial against the company.

Mr. Reback, who is now working against Google, argued that the government’s antitrust prosecution of Microsoft had altered the company’s culture — which in turn created room in the market for entrants like Google and Facebook.

A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today’s tech giants. But that’s a big if.

“The big hurdle is, are we going to decide to address these problems as a society?” Mr. Reback said. “Had we been more diligent, we wouldn’t have nearly the problems we have today.”",Can Washington Stop Big Tech Companies?

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

Photo

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.

At the same time these agencies declared, “We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election,” which was outside their writ and expertise.

It was tragic. In an instant he went from General Kelly to Kellyanne Conway, just another Trump apologist.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders must have known that Kelly had lost his moral authority, because, the next day, when reporters challenged Kelly’s comments about the congresswoman, the White House spokeswoman tried to shut them up by holding up Kelly’s formal uniform, saying, “If you want to get into a debate with a four-star Marine general, I think that’s something highly inappropriate.” Sorry, Sarah, when a general lies, he loses his moral and formal credibility.

That leaves Mattis as the last man standing — the only one who has not been infected by Trump’s metastasizing ethical cancer, the only one who has not visibly lied on Trump’s behalf, and who can still put some fear into Trump.

But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

With so few A.I. specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia. In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.

Uber hired 40 people from Carnegie Mellon’s groundbreaking A.I. program in 2015 to work on its self-driving-car project. Over the last several years, four of the best-known A.I. researchers in academia have left or taken leave from their professorships at Stanford University. At the University of Washington, six of 20 artificial intelligence professors are now on leave or partial leave and working for outside companies.

“There is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry,” said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

Some professors are finding a way to compromise. Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records). Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.

“There are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia,” Mr. Zettlemoyer said. “The salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.”

To bring in new A.I. engineers, companies like Google and Facebook are running classes that aim to teach “deep learning” and related techniques to existing employees. And nonprofits like Fast.ai and companies like Deeplearning.ai, founded by a former Stanford professor who helped create the Google Brain lab, offer online courses.

The basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math. But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call “a dark art.” Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.

In order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places. Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills. Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.

“I can’t compete with Google, and I don’t want to,” said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries. “So I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.”

But the industry’s giants are doing much the same. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have opened A.I. labs in Toronto and Montreal, where much of this research outside the United States is being done. Google also is hiring in China, where Microsoft has long had a strong presence.

Not surprisingly, many think the talent shortage won’t be alleviated for years.

You know that part in “Jurassic Park” when Dr. Grant and the kids are about to get chomped by velociraptors, but the Tyrannosaurus rex shows up and demolishes the raptors with her superior jaws? And you kind of forgive the T. rex for the first half of the movie when she was insatiably hungry for child meat, because in the end she stuck her neck out, as only a dino could, so our heroes could get away?

That’s how I feel when Megyn Kelly goes in on Fox News and Bill O’Reilly. Except, of course, that Kelly, unlike a fictional dinosaur, has been through some truly horrific sexual violations, including vile and gendered comments from a man who is now the president of the United States, as well as an online silencing campaign that will most likely continue for as long as she refuses to capitulate. (Though, by the same token, that T. rex, as far as we know, has never gone on television and insisted that “Santa just is white.”)

It’s a long, silly way to express the conflict at the heart of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” Sometimes the enemy of your enemy is still your enemy. Kelly spent more than a dozen years as part of the Fox News machine, churning out the same brand of soft propaganda that helped lead to the Iraq war, the Tea Party and, eventually, “fake news” and President Trump.

Kelly happily trafficked in racist tropes for profit — black communities have a “thug mentality,” asking repeatedly whether the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown were necessarily related to race — until her own dehumanization at the hands of Roger Ailes, O’Reilly and others became untenable.

Though we may have endured powerlessness at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, by speaking up, speaking out and speaking together, we regain that power.","“Why not?” I remember him asking. “Because I don’t like vodka, and I don’t like diet soda, and I don’t like them together,” I said. “You are going to drink that,” he insisted. I smiled again and said that I wouldn’t. He gave up and called me stubborn. I said, “I know.” And the meal proceeded without much further ado. In this second encounter with Harvey, I found him to be pushy and idiosyncratic more than anything.

We got to his home after lunch and I met his domestic staff and his young children. He took me on a brief tour of the house before he rounded us all up in the screening room to watch the film. He had just produced a similar film of his own, but everyone was raving about this rival version.

I settled in for the film, but about 15 minutes in, Harvey came for me, saying he wanted to show me something. I protested that I wanted to finish the film first, but he insisted I go with him, laying down the law as though I too was one of his children. I did not want another back-and-forth in front of his kids, so I complied and left the room with him. I explained that I really wanted to see the film. He said we’d go back shortly.

Harvey led me into a bedroom — his bedroom — and announced that he wanted to give me a massage. I thought he was joking at first. He was not. For the first time since I met him, I felt unsafe. I panicked a little and thought quickly to offer to give him one instead: It would allow me to be in control physically, to know exactly where his hands were at all times.

Part of our drama school curriculum at Yale included body work, using massage techniques on one another to understand the connection between body, mind and emotion, and so I felt I could rationalize giving him one and keep a semblance of professionalism in spite of the bizarre circumstance. He agreed to this and lay on the bed. I began to massage his back to buy myself time to figure out how to extricate myself from this undesirable situation. Before long he said he wanted to take off his pants. I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable. He got up anyway to do so and I headed for the door, saying that I was not at all comfortable with that. “If we’re not going to watch the film, I really should head back to school,” I said.

I opened the door and stood by the frame. He put his shirt on and again mentioned how stubborn I was. I agreed with an easy laugh, trying to get myself out of the situation safely. I was after all on his premises, and the members of his household, the potential witnesses, were all (strategically, it seems to me now) in a soundproof room.

Earlier Harvey had sent the driver to the store to buy a boxed collection of “The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency,” an HBO show that he had produced. This was the project he thought I would be right for, he said. (I later found out that the show had not been on the air for some time.) As I prepared to leave his home, he presented it to me. He wanted me to check it out and let him know what I thought. He would be in touch about it. I left for New Haven with his driver.

I didn’t quite know how to process the massage incident. I reasoned that it had been inappropriate and uncalled-for, but not overtly sexual. I was entering into a business where the intimate is often professional and so the lines are blurred. I was in an educational program where I was giving massages to my classmates and colleagues every day. Though the incident with Harvey had made me uncomfortable, I was able to explain and justify it to myself, and shelve it as an awkward moment. His offer to me to be a part of the HBO show was a very attractive one and I was excited about it, especially as I would be graduating in another year. I didn’t know how to proceed without jeopardizing my future. But I knew I would not be accepting any more visits to private spaces with Harvey Weinstein.

I decided to invite Harvey to come to a production I was in at school. Perhaps that way he would really see what I had to offer, and he would see my colleagues, too. He accepted the invitation, but the night of the production, he sent a message saying he had been caught up in New York and would be unable to attend. He would make it up to me. So when I received an official invitation to a staged reading of his new Broadway show, “Finding Neverland,” I was not surprised. I was still debating whether I should accept his invitation, and so I responded saying I was not certain that I could make it because of my school schedule. He responded with exactly the words I needed to hear: Come with whomever you want to come with. And so I invited two of my trusted male friends.

We attended the reading, and afterward Harvey invited us all to a restaurant for dinner with his comrades and collaborators. He sat me next to him, and another actress sat across from me. He had my friends sit at a different table. The talk was shop the whole time and Harvey held court with ease. He was charming and funny once more, and I felt confused about the discomfort I had previously experienced. I looked at the actress who I was informed had just worked with him on a project, searching her face for any sort of indication that she too had been made to feel uncomfortable by this powerful man, but of course I saw nothing. We did not stay very long because we had to catch a train back to New Haven. My friends had been equally charmed by Harvey. He knew when to turn it on if he wanted something. He was definitely a bully, but he could be really charming, which was disarming and confusing. I left feeling that perhaps he had learned my boundaries and was going to respect them.

A couple of months later, I received an email from Harvey, inviting me again to New York for a screening of “W.E.” After the screening, we would have drinks in TriBeCa. I then received a phone call from one of his male assistants to arrange my transportation. Feeling more confident about the new sense of boundaries that we had established in our last meeting, I attended the screening on my own this time. Afterward, as planned, his male assistant arranged for me to get to the Tribeca Grill, where Harvey would be joining us. I met a female assistant when I arrived there. I was expecting that it would be a group of us, as it had been for the reading, but she informed me it would just be Mr. Weinstein. She would sit with me until he arrived. She seemed on edge, but I could only imagine how stressful it was to work for a man who had so much going on.

Harvey arrived and the assistant immediately disappeared. We ordered drinks and starters. Again he was offended by my nonalcoholic beverage choice but he didn’t fight me on it as hard. Before the starters arrived, he announced: “Let’s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal.” I was stunned. I told him I preferred to eat in the restaurant. He told me not to be so naïve. If I wanted to be an actress, then I had to be willing to do this sort of thing. He said he had dated Famous Actress X and Y and look where that had gotten them.

I was silent for a while before I mustered up the courage to politely decline his offer. “You have no idea what you are passing up,” he said. “With all due respect, I would not be able to sleep at night if I did what you are asking, so I must pass,” I replied.

His whole demeanor changed at that point. “Then I guess we are two ships passing in the night.” I had never heard that saying before, so I remember asking him what it meant. “It means just that,” he said. “We are two ships going in two different directions.”

“Yes, I guess we are.”

“So we are done here,” he said. “You can leave.”

We got up, having not eaten anything, and he led me out of the restaurant. My heart was beating very fast. A cab was hailed for me. I said I would take the subway (I could not afford a cab at the time), but he handed me some money and told me not to be silly, take the cab. Before I got in, I needed to make sure that I had not awakened a beast that would go on to ruin my name and destroy my chances in the business even before I got there.

The Weinstein Investigation

“I just want to know that we are good,” I said.

“I don’t know about your career, but you’ll be fine,” he said. It felt like both a threat and a reassurance at the same time; of what, I couldn’t be sure.

I did not see Harvey again until September 2013 when I was in Toronto for the premiere of “12 Years a Slave,” the first feature film I was in. At an after-party, he found me and evicted whoever was sitting next to me to sit beside me. He said he couldn’t believe how fast I had gotten to where I was, and that he had treated me so badly in the past. He was ashamed of his actions and he promised to respect me moving forward. I said thank you and left it at that. But I made a quiet promise to myself to never ever work with Harvey Weinstein.

Not long after I won the Academy Award in 2014, I received an offer to play a role in one of the Weinstein Company’s forthcoming films. I knew I would not do it simply because it was the Weinstein Company, but I did not feel comfortable telling this to anybody. I turned down the role, but Harvey would not take no for an answer. While at Cannes, he insisted on meeting with me in person. I agreed to do it only because my agent would be present. In the meeting, he was honest about intending to persuade me to do his movie. I told him I simply did not feel it was a role I needed to play. He said he was open to making it bigger, more significant, maybe they could add a love scene. He said if I did this one for him, he would do another one for me — basically guaranteeing backing a star-vehicle film for me. I ran out of ways of politely saying no and so did my agent. I was so exasperated by the end that I just kept quiet. Harvey finally accepted my position and expressed that he still wanted to work with me at some point. “Thank you, I hope so,” I lied.

And that was the last of my personal encounters with Harvey Weinstein. I share all of this now because I know now what I did not know then. I was part of a growing community of women who were secretly dealing with harassment by Harvey Weinstein. But I also did not know that there was a world in which anybody would care about my experience with him. You see, I was entering into a community that Harvey Weinstein had been in, and even shaped, long before I got there. He was one of the first people I met in the industry, and he told me, “This is the way it is.” And wherever I looked, everyone seemed to be bracing themselves and dealing with him, unchallenged. I did not know that things could change. I did not know that anybody wanted things to change. So my survival plan was to avoid Harvey and men like him at all costs, and I did not know that I had allies in this.

Fortunately for me, I have not dealt with any such incidents in the business since. And I think it is because all the projects I have been a part of have had women in positions of power, along with men who are feminists in their own right who have not abused their power. What I am most interested in now is combating the shame we go through that keeps us isolated and allows for harm to continue to be done. I wish I had known that there were women in the business I could have talked to. I wish I had known that there were ears to hear me. That justice could be served. There is clearly power in numbers. I thank the women who have spoken up and given me the strength to revisit this unfortunate moment in my past.

Our business is complicated because intimacy is part and parcel of our profession; as actors we are paid to do very intimate things in public. That’s why someone can have the audacity to invite you to their home or hotel and you show up. Precisely because of this we must stay vigilant and ensure that the professional intimacy is not abused. I hope we are in a pivotal moment where a sisterhood — and brotherhood of allies — is being formed in our industry. I hope we can form a community where a woman can speak up about abuse and not suffer another abuse by not being believed and instead being ridiculed. That’s why we don’t speak up — for fear of suffering twice, and for fear of being labeled and characterized by our moment of powerlessness. Though we may have endured powerlessness at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, by speaking up, speaking out and speaking together, we regain that power. And we hopefully ensure that this kind of rampant predatory behavior as an accepted feature of our industry dies here and now.

Now that we are speaking, let us never shut up about this kind of thing. I speak up to make certain that this is not the kind of misconduct that deserves a second chance. I speak up to contribute to the end of the conspiracy of silence.",Lupita Nyong’o: Speaking Out About Harvey Weinstein,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/lupita-nyongo-harvey-weinstein.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

At the time that Democrats began paying for the research, Mr. Trump was in the process of clinching the Republican presidential nomination, and Ms. Clinton’s allies were scrambling to figure out how to run against a candidate who had already weathered attacks from Republican rivals about his shifting policy positions, his character and his business record.

Fusion GPS hired Christopher Steele, a respected former British spy with extensive experience in Russia, to conduct research into any possible connections between Mr. Trump, his businesses, campaign team and Russia.

Mr. Steele produced a series of memos that alleged a broad conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the 2016 election on behalf of Mr. Trump. The memos also contained unsubstantiated accounts of encounters between Mr. Trump and Russian prostitutes, and real estate deals that were intended as bribes.

The contents of the memos circulated in Washington in late 2016, and were briefed to Mr. Trump by senior American intelligence officials during the presidential transition. The memos, which became known as the “Steele Dossier,” were made public by Buzzfeed — sparking an ongoing debate about their accuracy and about who funded the research.

Fusion GPS was started by three former Wall Street Journal employees. The firm worked directly with Perkins Coie and its lead election lawyer, Marc Elias, according to the law firm spokesperson, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information about confidential business relationships. The law firm’s payments to Fusion GPS for the Russia research ended just before Election Day, the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said that neither the Clinton campaign, nor the D.N.C., was aware that Fusion GPS had been hired to conduct the research.

Earlier this year, Mr. Elias had denied that he had possessed the dossier before the election.

Anita Dunn, a veteran Democratic operative working with Perkins Coie, said on Tuesday that Mr. Elias “was certainly familiar with some of, but not all, of the information” in the dossier. But, she said “he didn’t have and hadn’t seen the full document, nor was he involved in pitching it to reporters.” And Mr. Elias “was not at liberty to confirm Perkins Coie as the client at that point,” Ms. Dunn said.

Brian Fallon, who served as a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, on Tuesday wrote on Twitter that he did not know that Mr. Steele had been working on behalf of the Clinton campaign before the election.

“If I had, I would have volunteered to go to Europe and try to help him,” Mr. Fallon wrote.

A lawyer and spokeswoman for Fusion GPS did not respond to requests for comment.

A spokeswoman for the D.N.C. sought to distance the national party from the work, noting that the party’s chairman, Tom Perez, was elected only after last year’s election. He and his leadership team “were not involved in any decision-making regarding Fusion GPS, nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization,” said Xochitl Hinojosa, the D.N.C. spokeswoman.

The work by Fusion GPS on the dossier has come under scrutiny from congressional investigators, who have questioned one of its founders and subpoenaed its banking records to try to determine who funded the research.

Fusion GPS is fighting the subpoena in federal court, and Mr. Gehringer’s letter was produced in connection with that legal case.

In the letter, Mr. Gehringer praised Fusion GPS for its “efforts to fulfill your obligation to maintain client confidentiality. In the circumstances, however, we believe it is appropriate to release Fusion GPS from this obligation as it relates to the identity of Perkins Coie.”

Mr. Gehringer added that, “given the interest in this issue, we believe it would be appropriate for all parties who hired Fusion GPS in connection with the 2016 presidential campaign to release Fusion GPS from this obligation as well.”",Clinton Campaign and Democratic Party Helped Pay for Russia Trump Dossier,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/clinton-dnc-russia-dossier.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

They might say that they would have made a different choice had they known what we know now about the vulnerability of the teenage brain to cannabis. In the same vein, they could take the opportunity to note how very lucky they were that nothing went wrong, or to explain what did.

Parents sometimes worry that talking about their past use, or talking about illegal substances at all, might be taken as granting permission to experiment with drugs. If this is a concern, it can be addressed head on: “I did try pot, but I don’t want you to hear that as me saying that it’s O.K. for you. I want you to be smarter about it than I was.”

Other adults might welcome the opportunity to articulate the conditions under which they would give their blessing. For instance, the mother of a teenager in my practice said that she wouldn’t mind if her son tried marijuana, but only once he was in college, and only by smoking the supply of an uncle who grows his own. For parents who have no objections to cannabis use, questions about the past can open the door to discussions of what has changed in recent years, such as the growing availability of edible and concentrated forms of marijuana, and what hasn’t: recreational use of it is still illegal for minors in the United States.

Research consistently shows that adolescents take their parents’ guidance to heart even if they don’t always indicate as much. Regardless of the parent’s stance on marijuana use, it might be worth adding, “I’m asking you to be careful because I don’t want you to get hurt or find yourself on a path that you don’t mean to be on.”

The results of the same recent study on direct conversations about drugs suggest that personal or vicarious accounts of the downsides of substance use are especially compelling for teenagers. A parent who has a lot of stories to share might say, “Your grandparents were not paying attention when I was growing up and I got myself into situations that I should have never been in. When I became a parent I knew I wanted to do it differently. Let’s keep talking about this because I did enough learning for both of us.”

Some teenagers who ask about their parents’ past use are actually seeking the opposite of permission to try marijuana. They’re looking for reassurance that it’s O.K. not to. As one of my adolescent clients put it, “You can worry that you’re missing out on something — that it’s part of the ‘high school experience’ that a teenager is supposed to have.”

Mr. Hice addressed this concern by encouraging his son to see if he could have fun without using drugs and to “think about the pitfalls, your health, getting caught, getting expelled.” He also told his son that he watched his fraternity brothers closely both when they were high and also on the next day. From there Mr. Hice explained that, “it just didn’t look like the benefits outweighed the risks.”

Parents won’t always know what’s behind their teenager’s sudden interest in their personal choices and responding with either a detailed confessional or an abrupt, “That’s none of your business,” will probably make it harder to find out.

And adults who aren’t prepared to answer the opening question can still keep the lines of communication open, so long as “I’m not sure I’m ready to have this conversation” gently gives way to “but how come you’re asking?”","When Your Teenager Asks, ‘Did You Smoke Weed?’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/well/family/when-your-teenager-asks-did-you-smoke-weed.html

Artistic director, Ballet Theater’s Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School; former principal dancer, American Ballet Theater

When Lermontov asks Vicky why she wants to dance, there’s a closeup on Moira Shearer’s gorgeous face, and she says, “Why do you want to live?” Those were absolutely the right words to describe what I was thinking at the ripe old age of 12.

Connor Holloway, 23

Corps de ballet, American Ballet Theater

It’s amazing how nothing has changed, but also everything has changed. Before a premiere [in the film], the overture’s playing, and they’ve put this whole lavish production together in three weeks. They’ve composed it and choreographed it from scratch, and they’re backstage still screwing the doors together. People are like, “I don’t know my entrance choreography!” “I don’t know my music!” And it just reminded me so much of A.B.T. and how we have this miracle of pulling things together in, literally, the last second.

Julie Kent, 48

Artistic director, Washington Ballet; former principal dancer, American Ballet Theater

The storyline is like a ballet of a ballet. So I sort of went along with: this isn’t real, obviously. I wasn’t expecting a wrapped-up ending, a legit ending. I was all ready for the “Swan Lake” ending: Jump off the cliff and who knows what happens? It was a dramatic, theatrical experience. I thought it was beautiful.

I saw bits and pieces of “The Red Shoes” on YouTube. I grew up with “Center Stage.” When Ethan Stiefel and Julie Kent [Ballet Theater stars who are in “Center Stage”] started teaching me or I saw them, I was like, oh my gosh — what is happening? The A.B.T. film of “Swan Lake” was my classic go-to ballerina movie growing up.

Marcelo Gomes, 38

Principal dancer, American Ballet Theater; Julian Craster in “The Red Shoes”

My first dance film was “A Chorus Line.” I had more of a love for musical theater than for ballet. When I first watched “The Red Shoes,” I knew I was watching something important, but I thought it spoke more to a ballerina. And I was too young to understand the whole premise: Do you sacrifice your profession for love? Is there room for both of those things? It’s amazing that it’s a subject that dancers have dealt with their whole lives.

Christine Redpath, 66

Ballet master, New York City Ballet; former soloist with City Ballet

As a young person loving ballet, I thought, “Oh, that doesn’t happen in real life, but how beautiful.” I loved the dresses and the romance of it. Mr. B [George Balanchine, who ran City Ballet] was not at all like Lermontov. But there was some of that — the girls that he liked had to leave their boyfriends down the block. [laughs]

I feel the dancers nowadays are more open to the world outside. I was more of the nun type. I was totally devoted. Yes, I had a boyfriend, but my purpose in life was to dance. I do feel that I was more like Vicky than I ever thought I would be when I first looked at the film as a little girl. Or I became more like that when I actually was performing. The love and the passion grew exponentially.

Gillian Murphy, 38

Principal dancer, American Ballet Theater

It was my favorite film when I was a kid — I just loved Moira Shearer. It’s a classic tale about choosing your path in life, but luckily in this day and age, you can have a healthy life outside of dance and be completely dedicated and devoted and driven to dance. It’s not supposed to be depicting our everyday experience and it’s definitely melodramatic in parts, but at least it speaks to the seriousness of the profession and of the pursuit and the passion to dance. That is real.

Sara Mearns, 31

“Swan Lake” was more what I was watching as a child. Doing this project is what really got me into paying attention to the film. I couldn’t believe the amount of dancing Moira Shearer was doing. Even now, I don’t see anybody move that fast. Her footwork is crazy.

Also, what really got me was how detailed she was with her acting — she didn’t have to do a lot with her face. It was very subtle. She had a very wide-open face, so you saw everything that she was thinking. She wasn’t somebody trying to be a dancer — she was a legit, professional, big ballerina. The movie itself is over the top, but she didn’t play it that way. She did it honestly.

Allegra Kent, 80

Former principal dancer, New York City Ballet

I watched it before I came to New York City, and I had no idea how a company ran. I was sort of skeptical about the story in the beginning, about the cruelty of the artistic director [Lermontov]. But Moira Shearer: Her dancing, how exquisite! And also in that first time Lermontov sees her doing the “Swan Lake” variation — the way she used her head, the way she spotted, was so spectacular.

After waiting nine months to debut its second local site, Toronto, and another five months for its third, Cleveland, the company planned to grow the number of local sites slowly, before tackling national ones.
The Athletic, he said, promised not to start a Pittsburgh site.
Instead, The Athletic Pittsburgh hired a second writer away from DK Pittsburgh Sports recently.
According to skeptical media executives and investors interviewed for this article, something similar is most likely the best-case scenario for The Athletic.","These reporters are skilled experts feeling the strains of a crippled industry, and many are looking for a way out. Mather knows it.

Mather, 37, founded The Athletic with Adam Hansmann, 29. They worked together at Strava, an app and website for weekend warriors and elite competitors that calls itself the social network for athletes.

That experience, along with their frustration at the difficulty of finding high-quality sportswriting that wasn’t bogged down by pop-up ads, informed their big bet. They believe there are hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions, of enthusiastic sports fans willing to pay $60 annually — less with frequently offered discounts — for good reporting and writing, a clean app and no ads.

They have raised almost $8 million in venture capital funding and have recurring subscription revenue, ensuring the site won’t shutter soon. But the question everybody in sports media is asking is, What happens in three, five, seven years? Will The Athletic’s business model allow it to survive that long?

Newspapers are a classic example of a bundle. Subscribers might read just one section, but their subscription gets them the entire paper. Mather and Hansmann believe that sports is an undervalued part of that bundle, and that there are tens of thousands of sports fans in each city who don’t care about the other sections, and would rather jettison their subscription and pay for The Athletic instead.

“I think the sports page has carried local papers for a while, and they don’t treat it well,” Mather said.

After waiting nine months to debut its second local site, Toronto, and another five months for its third, Cleveland, the company planned to grow the number of local sites slowly, before tackling national ones. But that timeline was drastically altered after layoffs at ESPN, Sports Illustrated, Yahoo Sports, Fox Sports, Bleacher Report, Vice Sports and Vocativ this spring and summer put dozens of talented, well-connected journalists on the market.

“I’d say it’s probably the largest talent displacement in sports media ever,” Hansmann said.

The Athletic raised $5.6 million in venture capital financing in July to take advantage of the moment, adding to the $2.3 million seed round it raised in January.

“It was really hard to see everything that was happening in terms of the layoffs,” said Deepen Parikh, an executive at Courtside Ventures, one of The Athletic’s largest investors, “and knowing we really, genuinely had an opportunity to capitalize on it and not take it.”

The Athletic did not need to raise any financing, its executives said. Only one of the local sites, Toronto, breaks even — Chicago and the Bay Area and “a few smaller markets” are on track to do so by the end of the year, executives said — but most subscribers pay upfront for an annual subscription, so The Athletic had cash in hand to continue operations.

The company has wasted no time spending the new money. It started sites in Detroit, Philadelphia, the Bay Area and Minnesota, brought on the former Fox Sports writer Stewart Mandel to lead a national college football site and hired the former Sports Illustrated writer Seth Davis to head up another for national college basketball.

Paul Fichtenbaum, a former top Sports Illustrated editor who had been working for The Athletic as a consultant, was hired to oversee the national sites and start a longform vertical, called Ink. “Building a company is exciting,” he said, but the “bigger opportunity to change an industry is really something that we all aspire to.”

Now the plan is to raise even more money soon, and to gain a foothold in every American and Canadian professional sports market within two years. “If there is a hockey, basketball, baseball or football team” in a city, Hansmann said, “that’s the starting point.”

It is that kind of ambition, in an industry that has sustained a decade of retrenchment, that has most of the sports media industry rooting for The Athletic’s success. Every writer knows he or she could be the next victim of a naïve pivot to video.

But Mather and Hansmann have displayed sharp elbows, and not everybody is happy with them. Newspaper sports editors have been left smarting after losing reporters to The Athletic — four writers for The Athletic Bay Area worked at the Bay Area Newspaper Group a few months ago. And then there is Dejan Kovacevic, a longtime Pittsburgh sportswriter who started DK Pittsburgh Sports, a subscription-based local sports site that in some ways is a model for The Athletic, three years ago.

In an email, Kovacevic said that Mather and Hansmann had approached him to be an adviser but that they couldn’t agree on compensation. The Athletic, he said, promised not to start a Pittsburgh site. Instead, The Athletic Pittsburgh hired a second writer away from DK Pittsburgh Sports recently. Kovacevic also said that Mather and Hansmann were unhappy when he sold a copy of his publishing platform to Greg Bedard, who launched a subscription sports site in Boston this summer, because they said it raised their cost of doing business.

Mather said that when The Athletic’s executives spoke with Kovacevic, they had no intention of expanding into Pittsburgh in the near term, and that he and Hansmann “only make ‘promises’ to our customers, employees, investors and partners.”

“We are doing great work,” Mather said. “We treat our writers really well, we pay them well, and we are doing amazing journalism. If someone has a problem with that, that’s on them.”

Mather and Hansmann also don’t hew to traditional — they would say antiquated — norms about the separation of business and advertising efforts, and are already cozier with the teams they cover than many outlets. They have an agreement with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, for instance, whereby Argonauts season-ticket holders can receive a trial subscription to The Athletic, paid for by the Argonauts.

Hansmann said The Athletic pulled no punches in its reporting on the Argonauts, while Mather suggested The Athletic could partner with teams on insider video or events in which subscribers go to the stadium early for exclusive access. Fichtenbaum said his understanding was that the Argonauts partnership was a one-off.

Similarly, many of The Athletic’s representatives sang the virtues of its digital presentation, which shuns banner ads. But Parikh, the investor, said, “Advertising has a very real opportunity down the road with The Athletic,” before adding that it would have to be “customer centric.”

Mather and Hansmann declined to disclose subscription numbers, but they have said Toronto, their most successful local site, has more than 15,000 subscribers. The national sites figure to boost local subscription numbers.

As The Athletic’s costs rise — it will soon need a bigger office, and the company is beginning to hire nonrevenue-generating support staff like accountants and human resources personnel — the company will seemingly need to attract casual sports fans. But Mather and Hansmann are not convinced.

“In a city like Chicago, there are 100,000 die-hard fans,” Mather said. “That is a very lucrative subscription business. There are over 100,000 die-hard fans of Chicago teams outside of Chicago,” he added, and he says they aren’t served well. “Bleacher Report is empty calories. SB Nation is empty calories. The newspapers are doing nothing.”

More journalists and investors will pay attention if The Athletic can get to the point that it can rely only on its own revenue, rather than having to turn to venture capital. Successful online media subscription products usually either cost hundreds or thousands of dollars annually and appeal to information-starved professionals — like The Information and Politico Pro — or have relatively inexpensive subscriptions that support relatively few writers — like DK Pittsburgh Sports and Stratechery.

While The Athletic aspires to be the Spotify or Netflix of sports media, the only media companies that have achieved scale with a relatively low price point (and the help of ads) are the very same newspapers The Athletic is intent on destroying.

Bleacher Report was the big sports media winner of the era when scale and online advertising revenue seemed like the future of media. It was rarely profitable and raised $40 million in venture capital funding before being bought by Turner in 2012 for about $175 million. According to skeptical media executives and investors interviewed for this article, something similar is most likely the best-case scenario for The Athletic.

Mather and Hansmann insist that they, and their investors, are in it for the long haul, and that the time is finally right for a subscription media product to go big. “The advertising business model does not align with quality,” Mather said. “It’s hot takes instead of objective analysis, it’s short-term instead of long-term, it’s serving sponsors instead of users, it’s thinking big instead of great.”

“It really comes down to the business model,” he added. “That is our core belief.”",Why The Athletic Wants to Pillage Newspapers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/sports/the-athletic-newspapers.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

We ate our last meal there before heading out of the city toward the vast tea estates and spice gardens that lace the Cardamom Hills of Kerala.

To get there, we spent nearly five hours in a van grinding our way up the steep hills of the Western Ghats, stopping only for plates of vegetable curry and glasses of fresh pineapple juice. The road narrowed as we worked our way past wildlife sanctuaries and forests of sandalwood. The oppressive mugginess of the city had lifted, giving way to weather cool enough that I considered digging out the one light sweater I brought. Tea estates cascaded down the steep valleys, their tight, trimmed shrubs looking as manicured as a formal English garden.

Manoj Vasudevan, a photographer who teaches tourism in Kerala and who has been exploring the mountains here for decades, was our guide. That included explaining the finer points of mountain driving in India, which required faith, acceptance and a good horn.

The strips of pavement hugging the mountainside were often only wide enough to hold one vehicle, but sometimes three would try to navigate a stretch at once. Horns were essential to blast our gentle warnings on blind curves. Inevitable traffic knots that brought traffic to a stop were solved when a driver or a passenger would hop out and calmly direct cars and buses to back up or edge around each other. Everyone would then head on without a harsh word or even a friendly wave.

“We practice a kind of practical politeness,” he explained.

Many of the sprawling tea estates we passed are owned by Tata Global Beverages, which maintains 51 estates in India and Sri Lanka. We stopped for lunch at the Briar Tea Bungalow, a rambling, low-slung Colonial-style building northwest of Munnar that the British built on a mountain top surrounded by 2,500 acres of tea plants.

We waded out into hip-high tea bushes and hiked to where women armed with small hedge clippers spend the day trimming the very tips from the tea bushes. A day’s work brings in a little over $6, more if they can beat their daily quotas.

Soon, we were back on the road headed for the heart of spice country. Small spice gardens started to pop up the way “u-pick” apple orchards do in upstate New York. Some offer tours for a couple of hundred rupees, about $3. Others declare themselves to be organic, and have small shops where packets of vibrant ground turmeric, nutmeg and green cardamom pods can be had for prices that would make a cook used to prices at an American grocery store fall to her knees.

Touring spice gardens is a fairly new pursuit here, driven by an increasing appreciation of agriculture and cooking among tourists.

“Twenty years ago when I traveled this way there was not even a single place,” Mr. Vasudevan said. “Ten years ago there were maybe a few places. Now, they’re all over. Somebody started it then everyone started copying it because they saw that people were becoming curious to see how spices grow.”

Photo

And then there’s black pepper. From the time of the Roman Empire, people have been coming to Kerala for black pepper. Wars have been fought over it. The plants that produce the fruit are everywhere. Their thin green vines wrap around jackfruit, mango and coconut trees that grow with such abandon they don’t seem to need a bit of human effort to thrive.

Cardomom is a big money maker here, but black pepper remains the coin of the realm. Even though Indian pepper growers are fighting off cheaper production in countries like Vietnam, there are still plenty of wealthy owners who oversee vast plots of pepper plants. But in every village and small town, you can find someone who grows a little pepper and sells a few kilos when a bill comes due or there’s a wedding to fund. About 30 percent of the people who live here are involved in the spice trade, Mr. Vasudevan estimated.

Ms. Gomez and I found our way to a small, organic spice garden in Thekkady where Thomas Puttampurakkal, a retired Kerala police officer in his 80s, tends to pepper vines that twist around jackfruit and nutmeg trees growing in what seems to be an agricultural system with no real pattern or structure.

He uses only elephant dung for fertilizer. Pepper, he explained, is all about terroir. The best grows naturally here in the high elevations, the green berries protected by the shade until they ripen.

The green pepper berries become black pepper after they spend four or five days in the sun. Those same green berries can also produce white pepper, whose pungency is softened by a long soak in water before they are dried and their husks removed.

Photo

Ms. Gomez and I wandered through Mr. Puttampurakkal’s spice garden like kids in a toy store. We rubbed curry leaves between our fingers and dug up turmeric roots. We searched around the bottom of willowy cardamom stalks 12 feet tall, looking for green buds. We sucked the custardy pulp off the seeds inside cacao pods, smelled clove buds and peeled a bit of bark from a cinnamon tree.

We found a nutmeg tree and pulled down a round piece of fruit the size of my palm. Someone had a knife, so we sliced it open to reveal a glossy dark gem covered in a lacy red coat. The seed is nutmeg, the red covering mace.

In the little shop Mr. Puttampurakkal runs, I bought bags of the small, local black Malabar peppercorns locals call tribal pepper and another of the fat, fragrant peppercorns called Tellicherry, named after the famed growing region in Northern Kerala.

I bit into one. It tasted like citrus and flowers. In a split-second, heat overtook the flavor, like hot perfume in my mouth.

Ms. Gomez wandered in, her hands filled with nutmeg. “You have no idea how excited I am,” she said.

Photo

Mr. Puttampurakkal was laughing, probably at us. It was hard to tell. It didn’t matter.

I had made it to the Cardamom hills. Ms. Gomez was right. It was God’s own country. Or, at least, a cook’s.

If You Go

Kerala is always warm, but can get downright hot and muggy from March to May. December through February is reliably dry and cooler, and also more crowded. The monsoon season comes in May and can last until November. The mountains with their spice gardens and teas estates are always cooler than the coast. It’s relatively easy to rent a car or van with a driver, or take a small tour bus to the spice and tea regions. Car rentals are available, too.

Tea fans can visit the Briar Tea Bungalows (V-363, Kannan Devan Hills Village, Talliar post, Idukki; teabungalows.com/talayar-valley-bungalow-munnar/) in the Talayar Valley in Munnar, where you can pick your own tea onthe 2,500-acre estate.

Scarce inventory in Santa Rosa, with a population of about 175,000 people, had already been helping to drive yearly increases of home prices in the 10 percent range, said Ruben Gonzalez, an economist with Keller Williams.

“So this further reduction in supply is just likely to exacerbate that trend,” he said.

Jennielynn Holmes, director of shelter and housing at Catholic Charities’ Santa Rosa office, said she was bracing for a growing wave people of forced into destitution by the housing sqeeze.

“My biggest fear,” she said, “is that we will lose the amazing community that we have because people can’t afford to live here.”

Santa Rosa’s leaders have been huddling over potential emergency measures aimed at creating more temporary dwellings.

Among the ideas are relaxed rules for granny units and an ordinance that lets people to live in RVs at the sites of their destroyed homes.

They are also looking to target landlords.

California law already makes it illegal to raise rents by more than 10 percent after a disaster.

Mr. Coursey, the mayor, said Santa Rosa officials would discuss making the rule even more stringent. It’s a tricky proposition, he acknowledged.

“There’s a market rate and the market has obviously changed,” Mr. Coursey said. “But if I was king — and I’m not — I wouldn’t raise anybody’s rent right now.”

Jonathan Gold, the celebrated chronicler of Los Angeles food culture, has released his yearly ranking of the area’s best 101 restaurants.

For this edition, a newcomer edged its way into the top spot.

Vespertine opened in Culver City in July with a pledge to “disrupt the course of the modern restaurant.”

Mr. Gold acknowledged that the restaurant’s throbbing music, abstract food and princely cost might be off-putting for some diners.

But according to Mr. Gold, “Vespertine is in its way perfect.”

The restaurant also caught the attention of Pete Wells, the New York Times food critic. Vespertine, he wrote this week, “gets inside your head.”

Check out Mr. Gold’s the full ranking. You need a subscription to access it, or you can see just his top 10 for free here.

Mr. Gold fielded a few questions via email:

Q. How many restaurants do you visit a year? Is it exhausting?

A. I eat out about 10-12 times a week. There’s obviously overlap — I tend to visit restaurants I’m reviewing 4-5 times, but I’d guess it ends up being about 300 each year. I’ve never complained about my job, and I’m not about to here.

A pair of food writers suggested that you wanted to reward Vespertine’s ambition. Any truth in that?

Vespertine is perfect in what it is trying to do: a seamless integration between architecture, flavor and sound. In my review, I called it a gesamtkunstwerk, a term associated with Richard Wagner that means more or less “total work of art.”

Is [Vespertine’s chef] Jordan Kahn perhaps more concerned with unsettling his customers than delighting them? Perhaps. But I think both his ambition and his execution deserve to be rewarded.

How would you rank L.A.’s food culture against the world right now?

I still maintain that Los Angeles is the best place to eat in the world — for its splendid produce, for its informality, and for its unimaginable diversity.

“I wanted black people to be proud of Benson,” he wrote in his autobiography, “Guillaume: A Life” (with David Ritz, 2002).

Mr. Guillaume said Benson’s sharp tongue and dignified mien had allowed him to transcend his station while getting laughs. “What made the humor was that he didn’t care what people thought about him,” he said of the character in an interview for this obituary in 2011. “He wasn’t trying to be mean; he was just trying to be his own man.”

On “Soap,” Susan Harris’s soap-opera satire, Benson would admonish the members of the wealthy Tate family for their antics amid the show’s absurd plot twists, which included demonic possession and alien abduction. He won the Emmy for best supporting actor in a comedy series in 1979.

That same year, Benson left the Tates for the governor’s mansion and his own series. In its first seasons he was the head of household affairs for Gov. Eugene Gatling (James Noble); he eventually rose to budget director, lieutenant governor and finally a rival for the governor’s seat itself.

“Benson” ended in 1986 with Benson and Gatling, now consummate equals, seated side by side awaiting the results of the election in which they had run against each other.

Mr. Guillaume won the Emmy for best lead actor in a comedy series in 1985.

“Benson” was followed in 1989 by “The Robert Guillaume Show,” a comedy in which he played a psychologist who becomes romantically involved with a white woman. The show was canceled after 12 episodes.

Mr. Guillaume, who had had interracial relationships long before they were more widely accepted in the United States, blamed his own naïveté for the show’s demise.

“I was ultimately responsible for that failure by not understanding what a wrenching change it would represent” to an audience still uncomfortable with the subject, he said in 2011.

Mr. Guillaume went on to play an executive producer, Isaac Jaffe, on Aaron Sorkin’s “Sports Night” (1998-2000), a sitcom about the inner workings of a show much like ESPN’s “SportsCenter.” When Mr. Guillaume had a stroke in 1999, Mr. Sorkin wrote a stroke into the script for the character so that he could continue playing the part.

Mr. Guillaume was born Robert Peter Williams on Nov. 30, 1927, in St. Louis. His mother, Zoe Bertha Edwards, was an alcoholic and a prostitute. He never knew his father. His grandmother Jeanette Williams reared him after a stepfather struck him in the head with a red-hot poker.

Robert attended a Roman Catholic high school, where he sang in the choir. He joined the Army in 1945, but the war was over by the time he reached Okinawa in the Pacific. He was honorably discharged in 1947.

After the war he enrolled at St. Louis University to study business on the G.I. Bill. He later studied singing and theater at Washington University in St. Louis but never earned a degree.

He married Marlene Scott in 1955. They separated but remained married for nearly three decades before divorcing in the mid-1980s.

In the late 1950s Mr. Guillaume moved to Cleveland to play Billy Bigelow in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical “Carousel” at Karamu House, a historically black theater. It was there that he adopted the surname Guillaume (the French form of William), inspired by his grandfather’s tales of his family’s French heritage. (He also had Native American ancestors.)

“You know how many Robert Williamses there are in this country?” Mr. Guillaume said in a 1977 interview with The Times. “I wanted something different.” He later wrote that frequent mispronunciations of Guillaume (gee-YOME, with a hard g) were “the price I’ve paid for my pretentiousness.”

Photo

Mr. Guillaume left Cleveland in 1959 to tour with the short-lived Harold Arlen musical “Free and Easy,” which played in Amsterdam but did not make it to the United States. Soon afterward he moved to New York, where his stage career would flourish.

Mr. Guillaume played the drug dealer Sportin’ Life in a 1964 revival of “Porgy and Bess” at City Center and the lead role, the preacher Purlie Victorious Judson, in the 1972 Broadway revival of “Purlie,” a musical set in the Jim Crow South. He also toured for four years with the musical revue “Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris.”

Mr. Guillaume never made it to the Metropolitan Opera, although he did star in the Los Angeles production of “The Phantom of the Opera” in 1990.

He landed his part in “Soap” in 1977 after a Tony-nominated run as Nathan Detroit in an all-black Broadway revival of “Guys and Dolls.”

Mr. Guillaume appeared in a few feature films, notably “Lean on Me” (1989) and “Big Fish” (2003); guest-starred on shows like “All in the Family” and “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air”; voiced the baboon Rafiki in “The Lion King” and its straight-to-video sequels; released several albums of his singing; and received four N.A.A.C.P. Image Awards. He also won a Grammy in 1995 for best spoken word album for children for his narration on “The Lion King Read Along.”

He married Donna Brown in 1985. He is also survived by three daughters, Patricia Carpenter and Melissa and Rachel Guillaume; one son, Kevin; four grandchildren; five great-grandchildren; and one great-great-granddaughter.

Mr. Guillaume acknowledged that racism created problems for him, but he never considered them insurmountable.

“I have trouble handling the whole idea that it’s tough to get a job because you’re black,” he told The Times in 1977. “White actors have problems, too; if you’re black it’s just one more problem that you have to deal with.”","Robert Guillaume, Emmy-Winning Star of ‘Benson,’ Dies at 89",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/obituaries/robert-guillaume-dead-emmy-winning-star-of-benson.html

This mathematical idea dates back to the 1950s, but it remained on the fringes of academia and industry until about five years ago.

Neural networks now help recognize faces in photos posted to Facebook, identify commands spoken into living-room digital assistants like the Amazon Echo and instantly translate foreign languages on Microsoft’s Skype phone service.

Using the same mathematical techniques, researchers are improving self-driving cars and developing hospital services that can identify illness and disease in medical scans, digital assistants that can not only recognize spoken words but understand them, automated stock-trading systems and robots that pick up objects they’ve never seen before.

With so few A.I. specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia. In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.

Uber hired 40 people from Carnegie Mellon’s groundbreaking A.I. program in 2015 to work on its self-driving-car project. Over the last several years, four of the best-known A.I. researchers in academia have left or taken leave from their professorships at Stanford University. At the University of Washington, six of 20 artificial intelligence professors are now on leave or partial leave and working for outside companies.

“There is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry,” said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

Some professors are finding a way to compromise. Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records). Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.

“There are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia,” Mr. Zettlemoyer said. “The salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.”

To bring in new A.I. engineers, companies like Google and Facebook are running classes that aim to teach “deep learning” and related techniques to existing employees. And nonprofits like Fast.ai and companies like Deeplearning.ai, founded by a former Stanford professor who helped create the Google Brain lab, offer online courses.

The basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math. But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call “a dark art.” Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.

In order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places. Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills. Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.

“I can’t compete with Google, and I don’t want to,” said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries. “So I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.”

But the industry’s giants are doing much the same. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have opened A.I. labs in Toronto and Montreal, where much of this research outside the United States is being done. Google also is hiring in China, where Microsoft has long had a strong presence.

Not surprisingly, many think the talent shortage won’t be alleviated for years.

“Of course demand outweighs supply. And things are not getting better any time soon,” Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal and a prominent A.I. researcher, said. “It takes many years to train a Ph.D.”",Tech Giants Are Paying Huge Salaries for Scarce A.I.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city.","Devastated by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Photo

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

By then, the Communist Party had merged into the Mexican Socialist Party.
That party put Mr. Cárdenas up as the candidate of the left in the presidential elections of 1988.
Yet one more time, the Mexican Revolution had absorbed and transformed (and sidelined) the Russian Revolution.","Perhaps the most significant proof of Mexican autonomy with respect to the Russian Revolution came in 1936, when Mr. Cárdenas gave asylum to Leon Trotsky, at the request of Mr. Rivera. When the Communist Party of Mexico refused to participate in the assassination of Mr. Trotsky, carried out in 1940 by a Stalinist agent, it sealed its fate. During the Cold War, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or P.R.I., could present itself openly as a nationalist and progressive alternative to Communism, while the Communist Party remained quite marginal, supported mainly by the railroad unions and some prominent cultural figures.

Frida Kahlo, when she died in 1954, received the first official homage ever accorded to an artist, in Mexico City’s Palace of Fine Arts. Her coffin was covered with a banner of the hammer and sickle. This was emblematic of a resurgence of Communism in Mexico, not stemming from parties and unions but from artistic, academic and literary circles, where Marxism had begun to gain renewed vigor thanks to Jean-Paul Sartre’s writings. Nevertheless, in the arena of politics, the P.R.I. continued its undisputed reign. At least until the student movement of 1968 (when its dominion over the new middle classes began to crack), the official party was an all-powerful alliance that ran from right to left, with only the extremes on both sides excluded.

Not even the Cuban Revolution changed the situation. Showing impressive political skill, the P.R.I. regime did not condemn Fidel Castro and abstained from the vote by the Organization of American States to expel Cuba, yet it also became the buffer between the United States and the Communist tendencies of the rest of Latin America. In exchange, the United States accepted a certain degree of nationalist rhetoric by Mexico.

The compromise with Havana was clear. The expedition led by Mr. Castro in 1956 had set sail from Mexico, and Mexico would defend Cuba from the United States through diplomacy. Cuba, for its part, would not sponsor guerrilla uprisings in Mexico. Although this tacit agreement was no longer totally functional by the 1970s, guerrilla movements in Mexico had much less reach and impact than those in Central America. When such movements were brutally repressed, Havana and Moscow reacted with indifference. And when Mexican guerrillas seized planes and flew them to Cuba, Mr. Castro either immediately returned the hijackers or imprisoned them.

Although the Castro government made its arrangements with the P.R.I., the prestige of the Cuban Revolution, among recent generations, overshadowed the Mexican, which many younger people saw as antiquated and false. In the 1970s and 1980s, Marxism in all its varieties became a common language in Mexican public universities, and this cultural and academic hegemony of Marxism is a key factor in understanding the paradoxical strengthening of the Mexican left at the very moment of the fall of the Berlin Wall.

Young people in the universities were the base for the popularity of Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, the son of the president, when in 1987 he abandoned the P.R.I., which had governed nationally since the 1930s. Partisans of the left welcomed Mr. Cárdenas and his dissident comrades.

By then, the Communist Party had merged into the Mexican Socialist Party. That party put Mr. Cárdenas up as the candidate of the left in the presidential elections of 1988. Orchestrated electoral fraud prevented his victory.

But instead of calling for an armed revolt, Mr. Cárdenas united the entire left into one party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution. Although it was defeated in the presidential elections of 1994 and 2000, the party entered the new century as a consolidated force with a strong presence in state governments and legislatures and with power in Mexico City. The city’s leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, greatly admired Che Guevara and Mr. Castro but was no Marxist and came, like Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, originally from the P.R.I.

Mr. López Obrador would become the populist caudillo of the Mexican left. In 2006 he ran for president, came within fractions of a percent of victory and accused the government of electoral fraud. Significantly, his closest advisers included no Communist politicians of the old guard but many academics influenced by Marxism as well as various former politicians of the old P.R.I. of the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s.

But in almost all species, the poison frog carries tadpoles on its back to a rain forest pool for their final growth stage.

One species, Allobates femoralis, may or may not be mildly poisonous, and for color it has a splash of orange on its thighs. Thus its endearing common name, the brilliant-thighed poison frog. And sure enough, the females lay the eggs in a relatively dry spot in the rain forest, and once the embryos reach tadpole stage, the males load them on their backs and take off.

Andrius Pasukonis, a researcher associated with the University of Vienna and Harvard University, has been studying these frogs in the rain forest of French Guiana to learn how the males find the pools and what triggers this complicated act of tadpole transport. He and Kristina Beck, a graduate student at the University of Vienna, and others, determined in one project that the frogs don’t search for pools but return directly to pools they know.

“They really rely on their spatial memory; they don’t randomly wander around the forest until they bump into pools,” Dr. Pasukonis said. The publication of that research was the first time the navigational behavior of the frogs was described, he said.

He and his colleagues also found that they could trigger the complex behavior of tadpole transport simply by putting tadpoles on a frog’s back. The tadpoles could come from any frog at all. And the method worked just as well with females as males. That was a surprise, because in nature females only carry tadpoles if the male has disappeared, and then they will only carry tadpoles from the exact spot where they laid their eggs.

Vicki Noble, who with Karen Vogel created the Motherpeace Tarot Deck in the late 1970s, hasn’t really kept up with the latest happenings in the community of divinatory playing cards. But when Maria Grazia Chiuri, the artistic director of Christian Dior, called and said she wanted to incorporate the Motherpeace into a fashion line, she and Ms. Vogel agreed. Both felt that it could breathe new life into their 40-year-old deck.

Almost six months after Dior’s fashion show in Santa Monica, Calif., Motherpeace sales have skyrocketed, up 263 percent from last year, according to Stuart Kaplan, the chairman and owner of U.S. Games Systems, a global distributor.

“I feel like this is a wave, and we should catch it,” Ms. Noble said.

Tarot-deck sales in general are up 30 percent this year, after rising 30 percent in 2016 — the highest in 50 years, according to Lynn Araujo, the editorial and communications director for U.S. Games Systems. The company sells hundreds of thousands of decks a year, including Motherpeace, the Rider-Waite Tarot Deck and 123 other varieties.

The tarot boom comes as no surprise to Libby Edelson, a senior editor at HarperCollins. In 2015 an unusual new deck called the Wild Unknown caught her eye. With images of plants and animals instead of people, the deck had attracted a dedicated following and was selling out with each new edition. Ms. Edelson acquired the rights to sell the deck with the accompanying guidebook and watched this package climb best-seller lists.

“Now there’s this whole new wave of tarot,” said Kim Krans, the creator of the Wild Unknown Tarot deck. “People are saying things like, ‘I’m going to quit my job and become a tarot reader.’” Ms. Krans attributes her success both to Instagram, on which she has posted images of her cards, and tarot’s incursion, like crystals and yoga mats before it, into modern boutiques rather than dusty occult stores.

MEXICO CITY — Ernesto Che Guevara died 50 years ago in the wilds of Bolivia, near Vallegrande. He was captured in Quebrada del Yuro, a barren ravine close to the town of La Higuera, where he spent his last night in a small schoolhouse, which is still there. The following morning, he was executed, on the orders of the Bolivian president and the Central Intelligence Agency officer present during his interrogation. His body was flown to Vallegrande, where it was exhibited to the press. That was when the iconic photograph of a Christ-like Guevara was taken and made famous, along with the photo Alberto Korda shot in Havana in 1960, of Guevara with his starred beret. It appears today on millions of T-shirts and posters all over the world — a world he would not recognize.

Half a century since his death, Guevara’s legacy and relevance is practically nil, in terms of his aspirations and achievements. Paradoxically, though, he became a symbol of historical changes that he did not identify with, that he did not fight for and that only came of age after his death. He is remembered far more for the momentous events that took place less than a year after he perished, when in 1968 hundreds of thousands of young people took to the streets in dozens of capitals and universities across the globe and changed the way they, their children and today their grandchildren live.

Guevara, an Argentine doctor, stood for various ideas and causes during his lifetime. All failed or were discarded. Although initially he was a passionate advocate of the young Cuban Revolution’s alliance with the Soviet Union, by the mid-1960s he became a critic of the crucial role Moscow was playing in Cuba. That mattered little. By July of 1967, when Premier Alexei Kosygin visited Havana, Fidel Castro had aligned his regime unconditionally with the U.S.S.R. In August 1968, Castro supported the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, and the end of the Prague Spring. Similarly, Guevara opposed Cuba’s former dependence on sugar cane. But by 1970, Castro had committed his country to producing 10 million tons of sugar for the Soviet Union, disrupting the island economy, yet nonetheless failing to achieve his goal.

Guevara also fought for the creation of a “new man” under socialism in Cuba, and against the vices of the former regime, centered on tourism, prostitution and gambling. Little did he know that not only would there be no new man in Cuba but also, nearly 60 years after the revolution, one of Cuba’s main sources of income continues to be tourism. Widespread prostitution has endured for half a century, at levels not dissimilar to those during the Batista era, and thousands of Cubans attempt to leave the island nearly every day, any way they can.

Photo

Guevara was known for seeking to spread the Cuban Revolution. He sought to do so as an insightful but ultimately mistaken observer and participant in what actually occurred in the Sierra Maestra: revolution through the barrel of a gun. He preached the armed struggle to hundreds, if not thousands, of young enthusiasts across Latin America and in Africa; he gave his life for it, and they lost theirs. Until 1979 in Nicaragua, not one of the fires he or Castro tried to light throughout the region survived, let alone burst into flames. The results were not glorious snapshots of the barbudos entering Havana in January of 1959 but rather military coups, torture, disappearances and thousands of student lives lost in vain.",What Is Che Guevara’s Legacy 50 Years After His Death?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/opinion/che-guevara-legacy-50-years.html

SPECIAL POST — A team from Japan won the 26th World Puzzle Championship, which ended Saturday in Bangalore, India. The U.S.A. and Germany finished second and third.

The three-day competition — a companion to the World Sudoku Championship, held earlier in the week — drew 169 contestants from 27 countries. Over three days, the competitors tackled more than 300 pencil-and-paper puzzles involving logic, numbers and pictures. There were no crosswords or other puzzles testing vocabulary or knowledge, so everyone could compete on an equal basis irrespective of language or nationality.

In some rounds, lasting up to 60 minutes, the puzzles were so challenging that many contestants scored zero points. Three example puzzles from the competition, not the hardest ones, appear below.

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

Comey, the F.B.I. director he fired in May, particularly the fact that Mr. Comey began drafting a statement exonerating Mrs. Clinton several months before the investigation closed.

Democrats immediately dismissed the inquiries as nakedly partisan attempts to distract attention from four continuing investigations — by the Senate and House intelligence committees, the Senate Judiciary Committee and Robert S. Mueller III, a special counsel — into Russia’s interference in last year’s presidential election and whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russian officials in any way.

Representatives Elijah E. Cummings and John Conyers Jr., the top Democrats on the Oversight and Judiciary Committees, said in a joint statement that the investigations amounted to “a massive diversion to distract from the lack of Republican oversight of the Trump administration and the national security threat that Russia poses.”

The Senate Judiciary Committee is already examining the Justice Department’s handling of the Clinton email case as a part of its broader investigation. In recent weeks, the committee has also raised questions about the uranium deal with the Justice Department and other federal agencies. The committee’s chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, wrote in a tweet late Tuesday that the Justice Department ought to appoint a special counsel to investigate the matter.

Representatives Robert W. Goodlatte and Trey Gowdy, the chairmen of the Judiciary and Oversight committees, said on Tuesday that their inquiry would center on decisions by Mr. Comey to break agency custom and publicly announce the close of the Clinton investigation and to alert Congress of the investigation’s status on multiple occasions. In addition, they said they would study what role Justice Department officials, presumably including the former attorney general Loretta E. Lynch, played in finalizing the case during last year’s election.

“The committees will review these decisions and others to better understand the reasoning behind how certain conclusions were drawn,” the chairmen wrote in a joint statement.

Mr. Nunes said his investigation would focus on how the Obama administration handled the uranium agreement in 2010, when Russia’s nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, was allowed to acquire Uranium One, a company that owned access to significant uranium holdings in the United States.

Republicans have long tried to tie Mrs. Clinton to the deal. It required the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, on which Mrs. Clinton’s State Department had a voting seat. Republicans have made unproven allegations that Mrs. Clinton was part of a quid pro quo in which the Clinton Foundation received large donations in exchange for support of the deal.

Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign and State Department officials have said Mrs. Clinton was not involved in the decision, and that all other members of the committee had signed on anyway.

The issue has been revived in recent weeks by The Hill newspaper, which reported that the F.B.I. had gathered evidence before the deal was finalized that Russian officials were engaged in bribery, extortion and money laundering to expand Russia’s nuclear interests in the United States.

Mr. Nunes said the Republicans want to know whether the F.B.I. or the Justice Department had opened an investigation at the time into any attempts by Russian officials to curry favor for the deal.

“Our job here is to get the facts,” Mr. Nunes said. “We are the legislative branch of government, and we will do just that.”

Representative Ron DeSantis, Republican of Florida and a member of the Oversight Committee, said on Tuesday that the committees had identified a confidential informant in the case who wanted to talk about the deal but had entered into a nondisclosure agreement with the Justice Department.

Brian Fallon, a former spokesman for Mrs. Clinton and the Justice Department, dismissed the new investigations on Tuesday, saying the committees were taking their cues from Mr. Trump on two issues that have been exhaustively examined.

“This is clearly an attempt to throw sand at the eyes of the public at a time when Bob Mueller’s investigation is closing in on allegations related to Russia’s involvement in the election,” Mr. Fallon said. “It’s transparent to the point of being farcical.”

Democrats have squared off with Mr. Nunes and Mr. Gowdy in the past. Mr. Nunes was forced to step aside from leading the investigation in April after it was disclosed that he had received classified information from the White House that showed that Mr. Trump and his associates were incidentally swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies. He said on Tuesday that the new inquiry was a separate matter.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Solvers are naturally curious when entries appear frequently or on the same day in different puzzles. Do constructors and editors really get together in secret, Oreo-fueled meetings to compare notes? Are repetitions committed deliberately, to send messages to puzzle solvers?

The answer is no, there aren’t enough Oreos in the world to make them do that. Any commonalities between puzzles, be they entries like OWIE or even an entire theme, are purely coincidental.

I bring this up because Damon Gulczynski, the constructor of today’s puzzle, explains in his notes below that a theme very similar to his own ran in The Wall Street Journal recently, and the truth is, these things happen all the time. It’s not because of laziness on the part of the constructor. More than one person can have the same great idea, and because editors work at different companies and don’t consult each other, sometimes identical entries or themes run close together.

Today’s puzzle by Mr. Gulczynski is a fresh, three dimensional take on an interesting topic.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city.","Devastated by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Photo

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

One of the bright lights in this celebration has been the series of crosswords made by celebrity and veteran constructor teams, paired up by crosswords editor Will Shortz.

All of the celebrities that created puzzles for The New York Times were avid solvers, but none had undertaken the task of constructing a crossword before, except for former president Bill Clinton, who had a slight advantage after making one with constructor Cathy Allis (then Millhauser) for The New York Times Magazine in 2007 (answers to that puzzle are here). Each celebrity expressed surprise at how difficult it was to create a New York Times-worthy crossword, but they all had this in common: they stuck with it and they are now published New York Times Crossword constructors.

Much of the income inequality in the county, which is still acutely felt, is due to the aftereffects of the systematic racism of apartheid, which ended in 1994. Decades of work to abolish that system culminated in the swearing-in of Nelson Mandela as the nation’s first black head of state.

If you’re looking to experience the essentials of that history, a visit to Soweto is a must. Just a 25-minute drive from downtown, Soweto (which stands for South Western Township) was a major center of apartheid resistance in the ’70s and ’80s. I went along on a half-day Soweto tour booked through the Curiocity Backpackers hostel (350 rand) with about a dozen other people and found the experience more than worth the effort.

Our guide, Semphiwe, was sharp-witted and sharp-tongued, giving us all names in Zulu or Xhosa and ribbing us if we couldn’t pronounce them properly. He was from Soweto, and extremely proud of it, noting that it has over a million residents. And it was the only place, he said, where you could, at one point, find two Nobel Peace Prize winners (Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu) living on one street. “And they say it’s not safe!” he said, feigning exasperation.

We first stopped by Kliptown, one of Soweto’s poorest areas, and the Little Rose Center, a school and youth center. The overwhelming poverty of the shanties and tin-roof shacks of Kliptown was sobering — we spent roughly 30 minutes winding through the mazelike, dirt roads, distinguished only by the odd spray-painted wooden board or the rusted-out iron coils of a mattress.

We also saw the Hector Pieterson Memorial and Museum in the Orlando West neighborhood (admission, 30 rand), which documents the killing of 12-year-old Pieterson by police, a key moment during the 1976 Soweto Uprising; and we saw the Apartheid Museum (85 rand), about 10 miles east of Orlando West, which captures the nuances and the horrors of that system. A significant portion of the museum is dedicated to Mandela, including old letters and personal effects as well as a replica of his tiny cell on Robben Island.

AFTER AN EMOTIONAL TOUR of Johannesburg and Soweto, a meditative train ride was just what I needed. In planes, you’re typically traveling too quickly and high up to notice anything, and cars are inherently confining. On a train, though, you can do almost anything you would do at home: Eat, nap, read, play cards.

Another benefit of riding the Shosholoza Meyl was having a sharpened sense of movement and travel. Harry Emanuel, a fellow passenger, noted that border crossings are more meaningful when done by land. “On a plane you just stamp your passport,” he said. “Physically crossing you actually get a sense that, oh, this is a big deal.”

Meals, generally an attempt at something upscale, were good overall. A dinner might start with soup followed by a hake filet, leg of lamb, then tiramisù, and finally a plate of cheese and biscuits. It was not quite gourmet, but on par with, say, first-class airline food. Service was friendly and helpful.

Trains force your brain to slow down. With no internet access and the knowledge you’ll be on a train for an entire day, you have to mine your creative resources. I played a game of Scrabble — in Afrikaans, no less — with a friendly woman named Lueen and her two friends. My traveling companion and I sat for hours after dinner quizzing each other on world capitals. I finished an actual book for the first time in longer than I care to admit. It was wonderful and sad — wonderful to recapture this organic way of having fun, and sad to realize I’d likely soon be back to my old ways.

I also spent a decent amount of time just looking out the window, as the scenery gradually morphed from flat grassland to sharp mountain peaks. I usually travel by plane, an environment where people are usually slightly harried and irritated. Here, it was the opposite: We chatted, drank coffee, relaxed and counted ourselves lucky to take part in such a special journey.

I caught Mr. Stander, the train’s employee, gazing out the window several times. A 40-year veteran of the industry, from a small township four hours east of Cape Town, he seemed to be showing no signs of tiring of his job. “Like I say,” he said, “Here you do not need a TV.”",A Meditative Train Ride Through South Africa,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/travel/south-africa-train-johannesburg-soweto.html

One species, Allobates femoralis, may or may not be mildly poisonous, and for color it has a splash of orange on its thighs. Thus its endearing common name, the brilliant-thighed poison frog. And sure enough, the females lay the eggs in a relatively dry spot in the rain forest, and once the embryos reach tadpole stage, the males load them on their backs and take off.

Andrius Pasukonis, a researcher associated with the University of Vienna and Harvard University, has been studying these frogs in the rain forest of French Guiana to learn how the males find the pools and what triggers this complicated act of tadpole transport. He and Kristina Beck, a graduate student at the University of Vienna, and others, determined in one project that the frogs don’t search for pools but return directly to pools they know.

“They really rely on their spatial memory; they don’t randomly wander around the forest until they bump into pools,” Dr. Pasukonis said. The publication of that research was the first time the navigational behavior of the frogs was described, he said.

He and his colleagues also found that they could trigger the complex behavior of tadpole transport simply by putting tadpoles on a frog’s back. The tadpoles could come from any frog at all. And the method worked just as well with females as males. That was a surprise, because in nature females only carry tadpoles if the male has disappeared, and then they will only carry tadpoles from the exact spot where they laid their eggs.

They take the modest cash value, if there is any; if it’s a term life policy, there is no cash value.

Life settlement still looks somewhat tricky to navigate, but it’s an option to keep in mind.","If a life-settlement company likes its odds of turning a profit, it will buy the policy, paying out more than the policy’s cash value — the amount received if the policy were canceled — but less than the face value, or death benefit.

The firm acquires the policy and continues paying the premiums. Then the company (or a big investor who buys bundles of policies) collects when the seller dies. It’s something like a reverse mortgage, but on your life instead of your house.

“There are so many seniors sitting on these assets, and they’re throwing them away,” said Chris Orestis, executive vice president of GWG Life, who points out that most Americans simply let policies lapse.

For now, life settlement remains a seldom-used option. About 1,650 Americans received settlements for their policies last year, according to statistics compiled annually by journalist Donna Horowitz for The Deal, a financial publication.

But the industry, which previously targeted the very affluent, has begun courting middle-class people who own policies with face values of $100,000 to $500,000. Moreover, in a business once heavily reliant on brokers as intermediaries, several companies now market directly to consumers — like Coventry, the largest life-settlement provider, which runs national TV ads.

GWG Life works with nursing homes and assisted living chains to reach people contemplating the daunting costs of long-term care. The policyholder can set up an irrevocable bank account to funnel the proceeds of the sale directly to a care provider.

The company’s strategy, as articulated by Mr. Orestis: “When a family walks into a community and says, ‘Jeez, we can’t afford this,’ everyone in the long-term care industry should say, ‘Do you have a life insurance policy?’”

Odds are, then, that you’ll be hearing more about this possibility. A business that began with so-called viatical settlements at the height of the AIDS epidemic is now coming after older adults.

Sometimes, selling makes sense. Older people may no longer need life insurance bought to protect a spouse who has since died or children who have reached financial independence. Perhaps rising premiums have become a financial struggle or other needs have grown more pressing.

At that point, most policyholders just stop paying premiums. They take the modest cash value, if there is any; if it’s a term life policy, there is no cash value. In any event, the insurer never pays a death benefit, an advantage the insurance industry has come to rely on.

“Insurance companies make money when people give up their policies,” said Kent Smetters, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, who has written about life settlement. “Now the life-settlement guys are coming in and offering better deals.”

Why sell a policy for a fraction of what it would bring your heirs? One Texan who sold his policy to Abacus took his family on an around-the-world cruise, Mr. Jackson said. But most use life settlements not for luxuries or fantasies, but for medical treatment or living expenses.

How much a policy will fetch depends on its face value and premiums (settlement companies buy whole life, universal life, term insurance or hybrids), as well as on your life expectancy. That explains Mr. Jackson’s questions about my health.

The industry calls this “reverse underwriting.” When you buy life insurance, companies offer a better deal if you’re young and healthy. To get an attractive price when you want to unload that policy years later, it helps to be old and sick.

Life-settlement companies and their investors don’t want to hold onto your policy, paying the premiums, for more than seven to 10 years. “The longer your life expectancy, the lower your offer,” Ms. Horowitz said.

But if your policy looks profitable, a life settlement typically amounts to 20 to 30 percent of its death benefit. That may represent a better deal than simply surrendering a policy, but it isn’t necessarily smarter than keeping it in force.

If you need money immediately and have a policy with cash value, you can borrow against it. If high premiums have become problematic, your beneficiaries might want to take over the payments to receive the face value upon your death.

Moreover, while a death benefit flows to your beneficiaries tax-free, life-settlement proceeds are taxable, to the extent they exceed what you have paid in premiums. And owning or selling the policy could stall or complicate the process of qualifying for Medicaid.

Then there’s the question of how much a broker, who submits your information to several life-settlement companies, will take in commission — generally 20 to 30 percent of the price a company offers.

You could avoid that by approaching several settlement companies directly, going through interviews, supplying documentation and then comparing offers. But some policyholders will appreciate having someone shepherd them through the process, especially given the industry’s somewhat dodgy past.

Sellers found it hard to ascertain whether they were receiving a fair price, for instance, and how much of it a broker was pocketing, the federal Government Accountability Office reported in 2010.

In response, 43 states have adopted life-settlement regulations, usually requiring that companies be licensed and make consumer disclosures. “The industry cleaned itself up a lot,” Dr. Smetters said. “But caution is appropriate.”

State regulations differ, and it still requires legwork and fine-print reading to know how much you’ll walk away with and to determine what’s in your interest.

“You have to really understand the contract you’re signing,” Dr. Smetters said. “If I were doing this, I’d try to find out who the major companies are and call myself. But I’d also sit down with a fee-only financial adviser experienced in this area and do the analytics. Is this a good deal?”

So, caution advised. But simply walking away, surrendering a policy you’ve already paid a lot for, rarely represents the best option.

“If my policy is worth $100,000 the day I die, is it worth nothing the day before?” said Darwin Bayston, chief executive of the Life Insurance Settlement Association, a trade group. “The answer is no.”

After Mr. Jackson and I finished the interview, he cheerfully informed me, “There’s almost no probability we’d buy your policy.” My life expectancy, according to Abacus models, is another 280 months, or 23-plus years.

No life-settlement provider or investor wants to hold onto a policy and pay premiums for that long before seeing a payoff.

The premiums on my whole-life policy are low and won’t increase. So I’ll keep writing semiannual checks for now, hoping my family will pocket the death benefit.

Still, scary news from an oncologist or simply the passage of time could upend that plan. Life settlement still looks somewhat tricky to navigate, but it’s an option to keep in mind.",Wringing Cash From Life Insurance,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/health/life-insurance-policy-settlements.html

It was boogie-woogie. It was R&B. Then it was rock ’n’ roll. Then it was pop. And it was all Fats Domino, the New Orleans musician whose easygoing image cheerfully concealed the boldness and subtlety of his music. Domino, who died in Louisiana at 89, both embodied and extended the New Orleans piano heritage of styles that are at once unswervingly propulsive and floridly improvisational; he also gave early rock ’n’ roll an infusion of New Orleans syncopations. His songs, most of them written with his longtime producer and bandleader Dave Bartholomew, were often concise sketches of romantic strife involving heartbreak, betrayal, loneliness and spite. But he sang them with such sly good humor in his voice and his timing that they sounded like a good time. Here are 12 songs from Domino’s prime years, just a small taste of his hundreds of tracks.

‘The Fat Man’ (1949)

Fats Domino announced himself to the world with this single: a two-fisted boogie-woogie piano intro with tremolo flourishes, verses that establish his 200-pound physique and his New Orleans locale, a falsetto vocal like a trumpet solo and more splashy piano. Mr. Bartholomew thought at first that the piano was recorded too loud.

‘Blueberry Hill’ (1956)

Now indelibly associated with Domino, “Blueberry Hill” had been around since 1940, recorded by Gene Autry, Glenn Miller and Louis Armstrong, among others. But it took Domino’s utterly satiated vocal, atop a New Orleans backbeat and his trademark piano triplets, to make the “thrill” so thoroughly lusty.

‘I’m Walkin’’ (1957)

Handclaps and a breezy, bluesy guitar riff conceal yet another tale of romantic woe coupled with resentment. Sure, he wants her back, but once he has her, he might just “say bye-bye” himself.

To do that, they must contain the revenue losses from reducing tax rates, both over the next decade and in the years to follow.

The party’s most difficult fights will be over how to do that — by some combination of eliminating popular tax breaks and employing accounting maneuvers, such as setting some tax cuts to expire, in order to reduce revenue losses.

Mr. Corker stands as a possible impediment to that plan. A longstanding opponent of rising federal deficits, the senator has said he will not vote for any tax bill that would increase the federal debt by a dollar. But on Thursday, the House is expected to give final approval to a budget blueprint that would protect a 10-year, $1.5 trillion tax measure from a Democratic filibuster.

A Treasury Department report released on Friday showed that the budget deficit for fiscal 2017 grew by $80 billion, to $666 billion, as federal spending eclipsed revenues and economic growth remained tepid. At the same time, Congress is contemplating what the president has promised would be the largest tax cut in history.

The protracted Tuesday-morning brawl quickly spread from taxes and debt to foreign policy and the president’s fitness for office.

Mr. Corker said Mr. Trump was “absolutely not” a role model for the children in America.

“I don’t know why he lowers himself to such a low, low standard and debases our country,” Mr. Corker said in a CNN interview, suggesting that he will soon convene hearings to examine the ways Mr. Trump “purposely has been breaking down relationships around the world.”

Mr. Trump and Mr. Corker have been locked in a public feud for weeks. Mr. Corker has said that Mr. Trump runs his White House like a reality TV show, and Mr. Trump has responded by mocking Mr. Corker’s height, calling him “Liddle’ Bob.”

Mr. Trump has made declarations about the tax plan while the legislation is still being drafted. On Monday, Mr. Trump said the plan would not include any changes to how much Americans can save in tax-deferred retirement plans like 401(k) accounts.

“Hopefully the White House will step aside and let that occur in a normal process,” Mr. Corker said on NBC’s “Today.”

Any tax plan would need all the Republican support Mr. Trump can get in the Senate, and his fight with Mr. Corker puts that support in jeopardy.

Now, at 57, Moix is perhaps the closest thing Saurí has to a local celebrity, having built a career exhibiting work at the Brooklyn Museum and Milan’s M77 Gallery, and at Prada’s SoHo store (a 2013 commission) featuring his abstract, hypersaturated flora and fauna murals.

Five years ago, the local government and bishop asked if the artist might come and paint the interior of St. Victor, the village’s 1,100-year-old Romanesque church, whose plain stone walls had become dull and decrepit over time. Moix, who isn’t religious, was reluctant. Finally, after many months of negotiations, he agreed — but only if he’d be granted full artistic license, free from conceptual obligations to church or state. “I was clear that I would not paint saints or martyrs,” he says.

What he ended up producing is his largest piece to date, some 1,200 square feet of frescoes that cover most of the church, which he describes as a “huge garden full of fantasy.” This new Eden — painstakingly mapped out in his Brooklyn studio — abounds with psychedelic daisies, spotted salamanders, beasts with tentacles and copulating sheep, all rendered in cloudlike swaths of grass green, cornflower yellow and strawberry pink. After assistants sanded and plastered St. Victor’s walls (and covered up some mediocre art), Moix spent three years in Saurí, off and on, painting these scenes directly onto the building’s surfaces for up to 15 hours a day using handmade boar-bristle brushes and organic pigments diluted with water. “Like human skin and tattoos,” he says, “the colors will continue to absorb for months to come.”

The motifs that appear in this Fauvist natural world are central to Moix’s work, though he says that what he found more inspiring was the opportunity to strip a place of worship of its religious iconography. (St. Victor, which has welcomed parishioners continuously since its founding in the ninth century, closed during the transformation, but will open again this month.) “Churches used to strike fear with images of demons and fire,” Moix says. “I loved the idea of overwhelming with colors instead.” The Catalan government and the diocese that hired him agree; its members conceived of this residency — which will expand to pair other regional artists with neglected Catholic properties — as a way of replacing the once-vibrant biblical paintings that had filled hundreds of churches in the region before they were sold or stolen.

In painting St. Victor, Moix was joining a storied tradition: The Catholic Church is, of course, responsible for much of the Christian world’s greatest artistic endeavors. But he is also part of a more recent movement, one that sees contemporary artists remaking religious spaces. Earlier this year, the American painter Julie Mehretu converted an out-of-use Harlem church into a soaring studio where she made giant, 32-foot-wide paintings (now on display at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) and occasionally hosted visitors. The U.K.-based sculptor Gareth Neal and the designer Chris Eckersley recently reskinned one London church, and Neal will hold a solo show in another this March. And this winter, a space inspired by Romanesque chapels that was designed by the late Ellsworth Kelly will be unveiled at the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Tex.

It’s easy to dismiss these projects as opportunistic, a way of claiming magnificent buildings that have been left behind in increasingly godless times in service of the art world’s love of larger-than-life spectacle. But Moix sees the commission as a way to revive a region — one currently fraught with conflict — that he once called home. “I want to give something to the locals that they can be proud of,” he says. Occasionally, as he’s been painting, Saurí residents have popped in, offering approving nods, or even prayers. In those moments, Moix just lets them be.","In Catalonia, a Church Becomes a Place of Artistic Pilgrimage",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/t-magazine/santi-moix-catalonia-st-victor-church.html

A fight over taxes would be particularly rough on a Republican Party already fraying on the edges. The potential for further dissolution was strikingly apparent on Tuesday, when Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, blistered his party and President Trump in announcing his plans not to seek re-election. Mr. Flake’s broadsides came on the heels of a morning spat between Mr. Trump and another retiring Republican senator, Bob Corker of Tennessee, which exposed the growing rifts between old-guard conservatives and Mr. Trump’s new-wave populists in Washington.

In the face of those divides, Republican leaders retreated to the only safe ground they have left: a partisan, fast-tracked tax bill, which party leaders hope to introduce next week in the House and deliver to Mr. Trump’s desk by Christmas. The stakes are rising by the day, as Republican donors and voters watch the intraparty dispute unfold and worry about the party advancing the legislative priorities it has long espoused, let alone holding its congressional majorities in the 2018 midterms.

Pressure is only increasing on Republican lawmakers, with conservative commentators and other observers saying failure on a tax bill is not an option.

“I’ve sensed this shift in just the last couple of weeks. I think the Republicans are finally figuring out if they don’t pass this, the political consequences are going to be catastrophic,” said Stephen Moore, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation who is advising Mr. Trump on tax policy. “The attitude of the conservative base is, ‘If they don’t do this, they’re worthless.’”

Large donor groups are particularly blunt on this point. “Passing tax reform is critical for Republican lawmakers, and they are building momentum to get it done,” said James Davis, an executive vice president at Freedom Partners, which is part of the billionaire Koch brothers’ network of political groups.

The effort to cut taxes was already going to be tough, given the magnitude of the business and individual income tax cuts Republicans are considering and their ability to offset the enormous cost. Finding common ground will get only more difficult as Republicans worry about their political futures and the effect on their constituents from the various tax changes under consideration.

Polling suggests Republican voters subscribe less to the tax cut philosophy than their elected representatives. A report this week from the Pew Research Center, based on polling from August, found that “Republicans were not especially unified in support of tax cuts,” said Carroll Doherty, the center’s director of political research. “Over all, there was some division of opinion even among conservative Republicans, with about half supporting lower tax rates for corporations.”

A September poll from the online survey company SurveyMonkey found that three-quarters of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents approve of cutting corporate taxes, which is the centerpiece of the tax plan Republicans are expected to put forth next week. The same poll, and a related October SurveyMonkey survey, found a divide in the Republican Party on the issue: Republican voters who approve of Mr. Trump were far more likely to approve of corporate tax cuts and to say that they believe their individual taxes will fall next year.

The divisions in the party do not, at this point, appear to imperil the tax-cutting effort. Mr. Corker is widely viewed as having prevailed in pushing for specific limits on the cost of any tax cuts in the Republican budget. And Mr. Flake — Tuesday diatribe aside — is still viewed as a likely “yes” on whatever tax bill makes it to the Senate floor.

Still, the baby has yet to be born, and it is an open question whether its arrival will patch the divisions that are threatening to rupture the party.",Tax Cuts Are the Glue Holding a Fractured Republican Party Together,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/us/politics/republican-party-tax-cuts.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

You know when you go to the mall and get your picture taken with Santa? My family took those Polaroids. It was their job.

Every time I visit my parents, I love going through old photos. Not the thousands of digital ones we have now, but ones that took some effort — 35 mm, 110 mm and Polaroids. Flipping through the albums, I see our selective family history recorded in flashbulb splashes and unintended grain. The misdirected movements of everyday life are recorded for posterity, through unwitting subjects not realizing their photo was being taken. I’ve looked at these photos for 40 years and it’s still addictive. You see the same things differently with time.

Recently I was home and looking through the photos again, and I saw some family Polaroids. Photos of me with a strange robot from the 1980s, and ones of me at a haunted house. Then more haunted house photos of a werewolf. Then photos of the Easter bunny. And then I realized — those are my parents.

No industry in America spends more on lobbying than health care.

In 2016, the health care industry spent half a billion dollars on lobbying, with pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and health professionals making the largest contributions. In 2009, the year the Affordable Care Act was debated, health care lobbying exceeded $550 million. (Last year, by comparison, defense lobbying totaled $129 million, and the gun lobby spent just $10.5 million.)

Closely related to industry lobbying is the political maneuvering that congressional leaders use in an effort to pass legislation — specifically, targeted provisions known as earmarks, “sweeteners” or pork barrel spending.

The final version of the Graham-Cassidy health bill, for example, would have sent extra money to Alaska and Maine for the crucial votes of senators from those states, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins. In 2010, Democrats hoping to secure votes from reluctant rural state senators added the “Frontier States” provision to the A.C.A., which increased Medicare payments to five states with low population densities.

We all know earmarks and lobbying influence policymakers and policy. In health care, this has critical implications: who gets care, how much they get, how we pay for it. But there’s little hard data on exactly who benefits and how large the effects can be. A new study illuminates the ways these political dynamics can change congressional and hospital behavior — and how they can increase health care costs for the rest of us.

Research by Zack Cooper, Amanda Kowalski and Jennifer Wu at Yale and by Eleanor Powell at the University of Wisconsin-Madison analyzed a provision in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (M.M.A.), known as Section 508, that helped secure Republican votes for the law’s passage.

The M.M.A., which created Medicare Part D and provided prescription drug coverage for seniors, was a political priority for President George W. Bush ahead of his 2004 re-election campaign. But fiscally conservative Republicans were hesitant to sign on to what amounted to the largest expansion of Medicare in its history, and the bill seemed unlikely to pass.

That’s when Section 508 was added.

The rate at which Medicare pays individual hospitals is determined largely by a hospital’s location and the labor costs, or wage index, in its area. Hospitals can, however, request to be reclassified into a different wage index area to raise their payments. Sometimes there are good reasons for this: Two hospitals might be competing in the same region, and because they’re separated by an arbitrary bureaucratic line, one gets paid more than the other.

But Section 508 waivers created new, more ambiguous ways that hospitals in specific districts could appeal their assigned wage index, and gave the executive branch considerable discretion about which requests would be granted and how big the pay increases would be.

The Section 508 waivers had large effects on how both politicians and hospitals operated. About 400 hospitals applied for a Medicare pay increase, and 120 waivers were granted. Hospitals in districts represented by a Republican member of Congress who voted for the M.M.A. were seven times more likely to receive a waiver compared with those in districts of members who voted against it. On average, these hospitals saw a 6.5 percent increase in Medicare payments, but the 29 hospitals with the biggest payment increases — “high 508 recipient hospitals” — received a 10 percent boost.

How did hospitals spend the extra money? Perhaps unsurprisingly, they started treating more Medicare patients — about 8 percent more per year. They also expanded nursing staffing by roughly a third, and invested in new technologies. But extra cash also meant big raises for hospital C.E.O.s: nearly half a million dollars per year at each hospital. Over all, “high 508 recipient hospitals” had $1.25 billion in additional spending from 2005 to 2010 — about 25 percent more than they otherwise would have. There was no evidence of improved quality or outcomes.

“If you told me in advance that we’d find this tight a link between Congress and hospitals, I would have been very surprised,” Mr. Cooper said. “We knew there was some connection, of course, but the more we kept digging, the stronger and more precise the link became.”

Section 508 payment changes were supposed to expire after three years. But hospitals with lucrative waivers had considerable interest in seeing the program extended, and worked together to form the Section 508 Hospital Coalition.

In the years between passage of the M.M.A., and its reauthorization in 2007, legislators in districts with a Section 508 hospital saw a 22 percent rise in total campaign contributions, and a 65 percent increase in donations from the health care sector specifically. In the end, a provision that budgeted $900 million over three years led to billions in extra spending for nearly a decade.

Pork, it seems, is as bad for budgets as it is for waistlines.

“Every time you pass legislation, big or small, these elements are added in,” Mr. Cooper said. “It’s not that any single one is hugely offensive. It’s their accumulation and continuation over time.”

Although Mr. Cooper’s research offers perhaps the clearest empirical glimpse of the links between lobbying, earmarks and medical spending, this political maneuvering is not new — and Medicare hospital payment seems to be a particularly susceptible target.

Both Democrats and Republicans have won pay increases for hospitals they represent. In the 1999 budget, the House Republican whip, Tom DeLay, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert reclassified hospitals in their districts into other regions, leading to hundreds of thousands of dollars of extra funding per year.

About a dozen years later, in what was called the Bay State Boondoggle , John Kerry, then a senator, succeeded in lobbying for Medicare to pay Massachusetts’ urban hospitals at the same rate it paid the state’s rural hospitals. The catch: There was only one hospital that qualified as “rural” in Massachusetts — on the wealthy island of Nantucket.

None of this is surprising. A primary motive of elected representatives is getting re-elected. Passing expansive legislation — like Medicare Part D or the A.C.A. — is hard, especially when legislators can’t point to specific benefits for their constituents. But a critical flaw in our current system is that payments are hugely influenced by politicians who have every incentive to increase them for their own districts.

“You can’t get upset at a snake for having fangs,” Mr. Cooper told me. “We need to design a system that takes payment decisions out of the hands of elected representatives. We think of interest rates as so important and complicated that we’ve tried to remove politics and give the responsibility to the Fed. The same argument holds for health care. When the government spends a trillion dollars on health care, it’s too easy for members to direct funds to their districts.”

We’ve been close to a possible solution. The A.C.A. called for establishing an Independent Payment Advisory Board , a 15-member panel charged with making changes to Medicare to control costs. The proposed reforms would have been put into effect unless Congress introduced alternate policies to achieve the same savings. But the advisory board faced fierce bipartisan opposition and was never created.

America’s increasingly burdensome health care spending has many roots: new technologies, high drug prices, fragmented care, administrative expenses and the like. But lobbying and political maneuvering can increase costs, too — without clear benefits for patients, communities or society at large.

Often these costs are borne by all of us, while the benefits — if any — go to a favored few. Excess medical spending, then, is driven not only by inefficiencies in our health system, but also by those in our political system. Our solutions, it seems, must confront that uncomfortable reality.

It seemed like there was more to this narrative. I decided to learn as many as possible of the stories of the girls who had been sent on suicide missions and then found a way out. I interviewed 18 of them for today’s story, with photos of the girls by Adam Ferguson.

My amazing fixer and I consulted aid workers and security forces, who helped us locate the girls during two separate reporting trips to Maiduguri. Finding a safe place to interview and photograph them would be a challenge regardless of the topic. Maiduguri is a bustling city — full of teahouses, meat stalls and busy people going about their day — that feels a lot safer than it probably is. And foreign journalists draw a lot of attention.

We were at risk, but we were especially worried about the girls. If Boko Haram found out these girls had failed to detonate their bombs, they could possibly be killed. And if regular people discovered they had spent time with Boko Haram, even as hostages, they could be stigmatized as sympathizers. We settled on a quiet park, a hotel room, an empty restaurant.

Adam’s job was particularly difficult. Imagine being tasked with taking portraits of girls whose faces, we felt, should not be shown?

The girls did not request anonymity, but based on the advice of our local fixer, we obscured their faces and did not use their full names. The girls seemed relieved to have the chance to tell their stories.

I knew from my experience reporting on the insurgency that these girls had been through a string of horrible circumstances, beginning with their capture. Some had family members killed before their eyes. Fighters stuck one girl in a room with corpses, and when militants asked about her strength, she presumed they wanted her to clear the bodies. But they wanted her to carry a bomb.

Far from willing participants, each girl said that the armed militants had forcibly tied the bombs to them — many times after they had refused to have sex with their captors.

I tried to get the girls to explain their suicide missions. “What happened when Boko Haram told you to carry a bomb?” I asked. Their stories flowed.

Every one of the 18 had a narrative worthy of a dissertation on the horrors of war. Some of the girls cried as they recalled their terror. Some told their stories in squeaky voices that revealed their young age. Others were fierce, proud of how they had saved lives by not carrying out their missions.

As a reporter, my job isn’t to take sides. But I couldn’t stop myself from believing these girls were heroes. Think of the lives saved by not detonating a hidden bomb at a crowded marketplace or manned checkpoint as they had been ordered to do.

I asked the Nigerian military whether bomber girls who surrender themselves are rewarded. Why not give them cash? Why not offer scholarships?

A military spokesman said girls who surrender their bombs are celebrated. But that wasn’t the case for any of the girls with whom I talked. After they surrendered, each had been detained, some for months, while officials tried to determine whether they were loyal to Boko Haram. I asked each girl at the end of her interview what she wanted to be when she grew up. They were still mostly children, after all, and I thought that ending with a question that focused them on the future might leave them with a sense of hope.

He also leads several entities that he created, including the National Security Commission, which has broad powers over domestic and foreign policy, including counterespionage laws. He is also chairman of the Central Commission for Integrated Military and Civilian Development, a group that tries to break down barriers between military and civilian research and development.

Mr. Xi has sought new ways to demonstrate he is serious about building a modern military force that can rival those of other major countries, including the United States. Last year, he appeared in fatigues at China’s joint battle command center in Beijing to unveil yet another title: “commander in chief.”

Driving Policy

In China’s vast bureaucracy, Mr. Xi is omnipresent. He has created several so-called leading groups, which he heads, to drive policy across a range of areas, including finance, cybersecurity and relations with Taiwan. Other agencies make decisions in these areas too, but the leading groups place Mr. Xi at the center of policymaking.

“Xi obviously believes that the title ‘general secretary’ alone doesn’t grant him sufficient power to push forward with his agenda,” said Jude Blanchette, a researcher at the Conference Board, a nonprofit research group, who studies Chinese politics. “Adding new and authoritative-sounding titles indicates a level of legitimacy within the system.”

‘Core’ Leader

Chairman or not, Mr. Xi has made clear that he considers himself a transformational figure leading China and the party into a new era. The Communist Party has bowed to his wishes, last year naming him China’s “core leader,” a designation that places him on the same pedestal as Mao, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin. While the title did not come with any special powers, it sent a message that Mr. Xi was not to be challenged.

The adulations have continued. At the party congress that ended this week, officials trying to prove their devotion lavished praise on Mr. Xi, including by calling him “helmsman,” a term that echoes Mao’s famous nickname, the “Great Helmsman.”

In Mr. Xi’s second term, the titles are likely to keep proliferating.

Last November, news of the “Mud Men” chat spread like wildfire.

Students started noticing the racist chat on the morning of Nov. 11 when freshmen who were targeted posted screenshots of the threats on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, forcing students inside the Penn bubble — and plenty outside of it — to pay attention. Black organizations sent a barrage of emails and texts to their constituencies about the situation and began to plan for an emergency town hall. By the afternoon, the news had been picked up by national civil rights activists, including Shaun King and DeRay Mckesson. The news was trending on Twitter for hours before the school issued an official response.

There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of Penn’s black freshmen and in turn, Penn’s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.

The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on Penn’s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.

That problem is not exclusive to the University of Pennsylvania: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.

Don’t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat’s existence.

Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the Penn administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.

Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.

The racist chat appeared to have been created in Oklahoma, but for the creator to have known so many members of the black freshman class, he or she would have to have been at Penn. So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus. There were multiple individuals who were taunting students on this chat, and all were anonymized by pseudonyms. So the big questions were: How many people were involved? Would they act on their covert threats? How much of the population of the school did they speak for? The chats also included a racial taunt that invoked the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, some chapters of which have been shut down at other campuses for racist behavior. (The Penn S.A.E. chapter immediately denounced the online attacks.)

Working with the F.B.I., the administration was able to identify the creator of the GroupMe chat within a few weeks — a student at the University of Oklahoma who had been accepted to Penn but chose not to attend. The student was suspended, and both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Oklahoma issued condemnations of his actions. Ultimately, the investigation found that no Penn students were involved in the chat. But these kinds of incidents make black and brown students increasingly wary.

GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It’s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.

An anonymous attack on GroupMe doesn’t feel that different from racist propaganda in “real life.” Just a few months ago, someone put up neo-Nazi recruitment fliers around campus. They were promptly removed, but the incident had an important thing in common with the GroupMe disaster: anonymity.

The creator of the GroupMe and the people who hung the fliers hid their names and faces, putting the students they were targeting in the precarious position of questioning who to trust.

Who is to blame for a faceless flier or for anonymous internet trolling? Either incident could be indicative of the racist opinions of one person or of many.

Photo“I did it that way because it reflects the style of performance from that region of the world,” Mr. Morris said.
More than anything, Mr. Morris’s concept highlights the ecstatic and improvisatory style of the music.","Hajibeyli’s opera, the basis of Mr. Morris’s staging, is considered the first opera of the Middle Eastern world, and is a product of the internationalism of its time. “Hajibeyli had this mega-project in mind, to integrate his nation into the rest of the world while keeping its heritage,” Aida Huseynova, a musicologist involved in the Silk Road adaptation of the work, explained via Skype.

You could see it as an early example of multiculturalism. It was composed in Baku — the capital of Azerbaijan, then under Russian control — in 1908, a time of prosperity and foreign influence, the result of an oil rush. And it quickly became a classic — to this day it is performed yearly at the Baku opera house.

The composition is a highly original hybrid of the usual operatic elements (orchestral passages, choruses and recitatives) with a native Azerbaijani style of sung storytelling, known as mugham, characterized by long passages of structured improvisation and ornamentation. The orchestration uses Western instruments alongside local ones like the tar (a plucked stringed instrument) and the kamancheh (a bowed one). For his staging, Mr. Morris drew upon a 2007 adaptation of the work created for the Silk Road Ensemble, which reduced the opera to less than an hour from three, distilling the story to its essence and shrinking the musical ensemble from several dozen to 10.

In Mr. Morris’s version, which had its premiere at Cal Performances in Berkeley, Calif., last fall, the two singers sit on cushions on a platform at the center of the stage while the musicians surround them in a semicircle. “This is how court poetry was performed in the 12th century,” explained Fatemeh Shams, a University of Pennsylvania professor and specialist in Persian poetry, “with minstrels and poets performing together.”

The singers don’t move or act, they just sing — but their voices are at the heart of the performance. Alim Qasimov, who interprets Majnun, is a silver-voiced powerhouse and a riveting performer. “He’s a giant star!” exclaimed Mr. Morris. “People at the airport in Baku push Yo-Yo Ma out of the way to get to him.” Layla is sung by the equally distinguished Fargana Qasimova, his daughter.

While they sing, the dancers interpret the story through movement. Four pairs represent the lovers at different stages. (This choice further depersonalizes their love. They represent Layla and Majnun and all lovers — and beyond that, love itself.) Behind them rises a striking backdrop of red and green brush strokes, an enlarged version of a painting by Howard Hodgkin entitled “Love and Death.” They dance, in red and blue Azerbajani-inspired costumes, on the floor in front of the singers and along platforms lining three sides of the stage.

“I did it that way because it reflects the style of performance from that region of the world,” Mr. Morris said. (Mugham was traditionally performed in small gatherings at court or in upper-class homes.) “And I wanted it to be a group of people doing something together.”

Because the singers are improvising (within limits), the dancers have learned to follow the Azerbaijani text and inflections of the voice so that they can adapt to the length of each mugham “aria” on any particular night; the singers and dancers take cues from each other.

Some of the dancing is more abstract, others clearly gestural, meant to evoke specific situations (and even small details like a description of a flickering flame). Mr. Morris incorporated elements of Azerbaijani dance into his personal dance vocabulary, things like strong, rhythmic footwork and a very specific way of holding the hands, different for men and women. But the dancing also reflects more general Middle Eastern motifs like Sufi whirling.

More than anything, Mr. Morris’s concept highlights the ecstatic and improvisatory style of the music. “That kind of singing is about what’s being spun out at that moment,” he said, “and with people who are great at that, like South Indian musicians and great jazz players and these great mugham singers, there’s nothing like it.”","Love, Ecstasy, Infinity: Mark Morris’s ‘Layla and Majnun’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/arts/dance/mark-morris-layla-and-majnun.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Photo

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

Photo

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

Music can also connect children born in the United States to the rhythms and cultures left behind by their parents.

The Nuevo Amanecer Mariachi Academy is one of those places where the traditions of Mexico are passed onto new generations. Students between the ages of 6 and 20 meet in a church basement in East Elmhurst, Queens, to learn violin, trumpet or guitar, while more experienced students rehearse for gigs in local restaurants and churches.

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

“They are a generation in transition since they are the first to be born here, yet they have not lost their roots,” said Ms. Vincenti, 28. “They are American, but they consider themselves Mexican, too.”

The young people, she said, approach their studies eagerly, unlike those of us who balked at weekly piano lessons as children. Even in their spare time, they kick back and play their instruments just for the fun of it. Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

“What’s exciting about these data is there’s some suggestion that wild apes look very similar to what we would expect in terms of basic dispositional traits and continuity of those traits — and I don’t mean just to captive chimpanzees, but to humans,” he said. “The work in the wild underscores how similar these animals truly are to humans.”

Alexander Weiss, who led the new study, said he was particularly interested in examining the personality traits of animals in the wild. His findings were in line with previous research he’s done on chimpanzees in captivity.

“The fact that we’re showing this consistency in the wild is nice, because it allows us to draw more general conclusions,” said Dr. Weiss, a senior lecturer at the University of Edinburgh. “It’s not just being in a zoo that’s causing these individual traits to be stable.”

The study’s underlying data will be made publicly available so other scientists can use them in their own research, he said.

Although most of the animals tested in 1973 had died by the time the recent analysis was conducted, the study also concluded that an animal’s personality traits were generally consistent over time.

Dr. Goodall said that fits what she’s seen, too. She only visits Gombe twice a year now, and only two animals are still alive from the days when she knew them as individuals. One, a mother of twins named Gremlin, has changed a bit, Dr. Goodall said.

“I think the main difference in her personality is she’s become more confident as she gets older, just like people do,” she said.

Dr. Goodall added that she’s pleased that researchers are still finding so much of interest at Gombe, and tapping into the expertise of Tanzanian field workers.

And, of course, she’s happy that the academic perspective has shifted from the time when she was told only humans had personalities, minds and emotions.

Let me be clear: If Baghdad cannot guarantee the Kurdish people in Iraq the security, freedom and opportunities they desire, and if the United States is forced to choose between Iranian-backed militias and our longstanding Kurdish partners, I choose the Kurds.

The clashes in Kirkuk are symptomatic of a deeper problem that the United States has failed to address for many years: Both within countries and between them, the regional order in the Middle East is rapidly collapsing. American power and influence is diminishing there, largely because over the past eight years the United States has withdrawn from the region. The resulting vacuum is being filled by anti-American forces.

While the current administration, like its predecessor, remains singularly focused on defeating the Islamic State — which is, of course, essential — our adversaries are taking advantage of us everywhere else.

In Iraq, the United States seems to still be basking in the feeling of victory after the liberation of Mosul this summer. Meanwhile, Iranian forces are working to sow discord inside Iraq, as we saw in Kirkuk; maneuver Iraqi politics against the United States; and turn next year’s election into a strategic setback that drives American influence out of the country.

Across the border in Syria, the Assad regime, backed by Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and an array of militias, has retaken most of the country, including many eastern areas that the United States has identified as strategically important. The future of Syria is being determined by force on the ground with little American initiative.

A web of Iranian proxies and allies is spreading from the Levant to the Arabian Peninsula, threatening stability, freedom of navigation and the territory of our partners and allies, including with advanced conventional weapons. Iran itself continues to test ballistic missiles, menace its neighbors and use its sanctions relief windfall to harmful ends.

Our Arab allies are absorbed in a diplomatic dispute with Qatar in the face of far more pressing threats. And behind all this is the shadow of Vladimir Putin’s Russia, which is re-establishing itself as a regional power broker actively hostile to American interests — and wholly unconcerned about human rights or civilian life.

This is a complicated and confusing set of problems, to be sure. But Americans need to understand the greater challenge: The Middle East is vitally important to the future of international security and the global economy, both of which benefit the American people. And right now, a network of anti-American groups — at times working together, at times on their own — is trying to drive American influence out of the Middle East and to remake the region in ways that are contrary to our interests and values. They are doing so by supporting terrorists and militias, subverting and intimidating our friends, displacing us diplomatically, and deploying and distributing military technology that makes it harder and more dangerous for the United States to maintain its presence.

If we keep sleepwalking on our current trajectory, we could wake up in the near future and find that American influence has been pushed out of one of the most important parts of the world. That is why Americans need to care about what is going on in the Middle East right now. That is why we need to stick with our true friends, like the Kurds. And that is why, now more than ever, we need a strategy that lifts our sights above the tactical level and separates the urgent from the truly important.",John McCain: We Need a Strategy for the Middle East,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/opinion/john-mccain-kurds-iraq.html

And he was a master of the wordless vocal, making hits out of songs full of “woo-woos” and “la-las.”

Working with the songwriter, producer and arranger David Bartholomew, Mr. Domino and his band carried New Orleans parade rhythms into rock ’n’ roll and put a local stamp on nearly everything they touched, even country tunes like “Jambalaya” or big-band songs like “My Blue Heaven” and “When My Dreamboat Comes Home.”

Antoine Dominique Domino Jr. was born on Feb. 26, 1928, the youngest of eight children in a family with Creole roots. He grew up in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, where he spent most of his life.

Music filled his life from the age of 10, when his family inherited an old piano. After his brother-in-law Harrison Verrett, a traditional-jazz musician, wrote down the notes on the keys and taught him a few chords, Antoine threw himself at the instrument — so enthusiastically that his parents moved it to the garage.

He was almost entirely self-taught, picking up ideas from boogie-woogie masters like Meade Lux Lewis, Pinetop Smith and Amos Milburn. “Back then I used to play everybody’s records; everybody’s records who made records,” he told the New Orleans music magazine Offbeat in 2004. “I used to hear ’em, listen at ’em five, six, seven, eight times and I could play it just like the record because I had a good ear for catchin’ notes and different things.”

He attended the Louis B. Macarty School but dropped out in the fourth grade to work as an iceman’s helper. “In the houses where people had a piano in their rooms, I’d stop and play,” he told USA Today in 2007. “That’s how I practiced.”

In his teens, he started working at a club called the Hideaway with a band led by the bassist Billy Diamond, who nicknamed him Fats. Mr. Domino soon became the band’s frontman and a local draw.

“Fats was breaking up the place, man,” Mr. Bartholomew told The Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2010. “He was singing and playing the piano and carrying on. Everyone was having a good time. When you saw Fats Domino, it was ‘Let’s have a party!’ ”

He added: “My first impression was a lasting impression. He was a great singer. He was a great artist. And whatever he was doing, nobody could beat him.”

Slide Show

In 1947 Mr. Domino married Rosemary Hall, and they had eight children, Antoine III, Anatole, Andre, Anonio, Antoinette, Andrea, Anola and Adonica. His wife died in 2008. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.

In 1949 Mr. Bartholomew brought Lew Chudd, the owner of Imperial Records in Los Angeles, to the Hideaway. Mr. Chudd signed Mr. Domino on the spot, with a contract, unusual for the time, that paid royalties rather than a one-time purchase of songs.

Immediately, Mr. Domino and Mr. Bartholomew wrote “The Fat Man,” a cleaned-up version of a song about drug addiction called “Junkers Blues,” and recorded it with Mr. Bartholomew’s studio band. By 1951 it had sold a million copies.

Mr. Domino’s trademark triplets, picked up from “It’s Midnight,” a 1949 record by the boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield, appeared on his next rhythm-and-blues hit, “Every Night About This Time.” The technique spread like wildfire, becoming a virtual requirement for rock ’n’ roll ballads.

“Fats made it popular,” Mr. Bartholomew told Rick Coleman, the author of “Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock ’n’ Roll” (2006). “Then it was on every record.”

In 1952, on a chance visit to Cosimo Matassa’s recording studio in New Orleans, Mr. Domino was asked to help out on a recording by a nervous teenager named Lloyd Price. Sitting in with Mr. Bartholomew’s band, he came up with the memorable piano part for “Lawdy Miss Clawdy,” one of the first rhythm-and-blues records to cross over to a pop audience

Through the early 1950s Mr. Domino turned out a stream of hits, taking up what seemed like permanent residence in the upper reaches of the R&B charts. His records began reaching the pop charts as well.

In that racially segregated era, white performers used his hits to build their careers. In 1955, “Ain’t It a Shame” became a No. 1 hit for Pat Boone as “Ain’t That a Shame,” while Domino’s arrangement of a traditional song, “Bo Weevil,” was imitated by Teresa Brewer.

Mr. Domino’s appeal to white teenagers broadened as he embarked on national tours and appeared with mixed-race rock ’n’ roll revues like the Moondog Jubilee of Stars Under the Stars, presented by the disc jockey Alan Freed at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Appearances on national television, on Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan’s shows, put him in millions of living rooms.

He did not flaunt his status as an innovator, or as an architect of a powerful cultural movement.

“Fats, how did this rock ’n’ roll all get started anyway?” an interviewer for a Hearst newsreel asked him in 1957. Mr. Domino answered: “Well, what they call rock ’n’ roll now is rhythm and blues. I’ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans.”

At a news conference in Las Vegas in 1969, after resuming his performing career, Elvis Presley interrupted a reporter who had called him “the king.” He pointed to Mr. Domino, who was in the room, and said, “There’s the real king of rock ’n’ roll.”

Mr. Domino had his biggest hit in 1956 with his version of “Blueberry Hill,” a song that had been recorded by Glenn Miller’s big band in 1940. It peaked at No. 2 on the pop charts and sold a reported three million copies.

“I liked that record ’cause I heard it by Louis Armstrong and I said, ‘That number gonna fit me,’ ” he told Offbeat. “We had to beg Lew Chudd for a while. I told him I wasn’t gonna make no more records till they put that record out. I could feel it, that it was a hit, a good record.”

He followed with two more Top Five pop hits: “Blue Monday” and “I’m Walkin’,” which outsold the version recorded by Ricky Nelson.

“I was lucky enough to write songs that carry a good beat and tell a real story that people could feel was their story, too — something that old people or the kids could both enjoy,” Mr. Domino told The Los Angeles Times in 1985.

Mr. Domino performed in 1950s movies like “Shake, Rattle and Rock,” “The Big Beat” (for which he and Mr. Bartholomew wrote the title song) and “The Girl Can’t Help It.” In 1957, he toured for three months with Chuck Berry, Clyde McPhatter, the Moonglows and others.

Well into the early 1960s, Mr. Domino continued to reach both the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts with songs like “Whole Lotta Lovin’,” “I’m Ready,” “I’m Gonna Be a Wheel Someday,” “Be My Guest,” “Walkin’ to New Orleans” and “My Girl Josephine.”

He toured Europe for the first time in 1962 and met the Beatles in Liverpool, before they were famous. His contract with Imperial ended in 1963, and he went on to record for ABC-Paramount, Mercury, Broadmoor, Reprise and other labels.

His last appearance in the pop Top 100 was in 1968, with a version of “Lady Madonna,” the Beatles song that had been inspired by Mr. Domino’s piano-pounding style. In 1982, he had a country hit with “Whiskey Heaven.”

Although he was no longer a pop sensation, Mr. Domino continued to perform worldwide and appeared for 10 months a year in Las Vegas in the mid-1960s. On tour, he would bring his own pots and pans so he could cook.

His life on the road ended in the early 1980s, when he decided that he did not want to leave New Orleans, saying it was the only place where he liked the food.

He went on to perform regularly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and in 1987 Jerry Lee Lewis and Ray Charles joined him for a Cinemax special, “Fats Domino and Friends.” He released a holiday album, “Christmas Is a Special Day,” in 1993.

Reclusive and notoriously resistant to interview requests, Mr. Domino stayed home even when he received a lifetime achievement Grammy Award in 1987. (He did travel to New York when he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 as one of its first members, although he did not take part in the jam session that concluded the ceremony.) In 1999, when he was awarded the National Medal of Arts, he sent his daughter Antoinette to the White House to pick up the prize.

He even refused to leave New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city on Aug. 29, 2005, remaining at his flooded home — he was living in the Lower Ninth Ward then — until he was rescued by helicopter on Sept. 1.

“I wasn’t too nervous” about waiting to be saved, he told The New York Times in 2006. “I had my little wine and a couple of beers with me; I’m all right.”

His rescue was loosely the basis for “Saving Fats,” a tall tale in Sam Shepard’s 2010 short-story collection, “Day Out of Days.”

President George W. Bush visited Mr. Domino’s home in 2006 in recognition of New Orleans’s cultural resilience; that same year, Mr. Domino released “Alive and Kickin,’ ” his first album in more than a decade. The title song began, “All over the country, people want to know / Whatever happened to Fats Domino,” then continued, “I’m alive and kicking and I’m where I wanna be.”

He was often seen around New Orleans, emerging from his pink-roofed mansion driving a pink Cadillac. “I just drink my little beers, do some cookin’, anything I feel like ” he told The Daily Telegraph of London in 2007, describing his retirement.

In 1953, in Down Beat magazine, the Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler made a bold-sounding prediction that turned out to be, in retrospect, quite timid. “Can’t you envision a collector in 1993 discovering a Fats Domino record in a Salvation Army depot and rushing home to put it on the turntable?” he wrote. “We can. It’s good blues, it’s good jazz, and it’s the kind of good that never wears out.”","Fats Domino, Early Rock ’n’ Roller With a Boogie-Woogie Piano, Is Dead at 89",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/obituaries/fats-domino-89-one-of-rock-n-rolls-first-stars-is-dead.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“The caliber of coaching in the league right now is excellent from top to bottom,” Carlisle said in a phone interview.
As for Watson’s removal, it will not go down as the fastest in N.B.A.","There are some reasonable explanations to account for such an unusually favorable coaching climate. A whopping 14 teams introduced new coaches to start the 2013-14 season. Nine teams began the 2014-15 season with new coaches, followed by six new hires entering 2015-16 and 10 more to open last season. A period of relative calm after that amount of turnover was perhaps inevitable.

Throw in the presence of a few long-tenured coaches who have copious amounts of job security — namely San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich, Miami’s Erik Spoelstra and Dallas’ Rick Carlisle — and it gets easier to understand why openings have been scarce lately.

Carlisle, who also serves as president of the N.B.A. Coaches Association, has his own theory, insisting that the recent tranquillity on league benches isn’t as fluky as it might seem.

“The caliber of coaching in the league right now is excellent from top to bottom,” Carlisle said in a phone interview. “And owners have clearly come to the accurate conclusion that it’s important to commit to a coach, because there’s going to be more player movement under the rules in the new C.B.A. It’s important for teams to have as much continuity as they can.”

Of course, after Phoenix moved so swiftly in dumping Watson in the wake of its humiliating start, there will understandably be fears that a regression to the mean looms and more firings are on the way. The N.B.A. is certainly due for some upheaval in this area, especially after an off-season that failed to deliver its usual surprise coaching change (or three).

Who’s next? With Chicago having fully entered rebuilding mode and presumably taking some heat off the embattled Fred Hoiberg, uncertainty shrouds the future of the Knicks’ Jeff Hornacek, largely because the executive who hired Hornacek in June 2016 — Phil Jackson — is already gone.

Another coach to watch is Philadelphia’s Brett Brown, who is burdened with playoff expectations for the first time in his five seasons with the 76ers and faced his own 0-3 start before Monday night’s win at Detroit.

The Pelicans have missed the playoffs in Alvin Gentry’s first two seasons, which naturally invites pressure, but remember that Gentry is tasked with the challenge of trying to win with a team built around two big men — Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins — at a time when small ball and 3-point shooting reign.

The circumstances of Watson’s situation in Phoenix make it something of an outlier regardless. The Suns have left the distinct impression that they aren’t really trying to win games, but rather are focused instead on asset collection and player development with a roster that features six players aged 21 or younger. It hasn’t helped that the progress of its recent top draft packs, apart from Devin Booker, has been painfully slow.

The closest thing to a sense of anticipation Phoenix could thus boast coming into the season was the widespread belief that it will try to trade guard Eric Bledsoe and the veteran center Tyson Chandler before the league’s Feb. 8 trade deadline.

Watson, 38, earned the full-time job despite posting an underwhelming 9-24 record as interim coach after Phoenix fired Hornacek just past the midpoint of the 2015-16 season — in what was Watson’s first season on an N.B.A. bench as an assistant. Amid a seven-season playoff drought and mounting local frustrations with the tenure of the team owner Robert Sarver, it often seemed as though Watson had the Suns’ job merely as a placeholder.

What ended Watson’s tenure as head coach — beyond reports of discord between him and General Manager Ryan McDonough — was the Suns’ alarming lack of competitiveness so early in the season. They were beaten by 48 points at home by a Portland team playing without the suspended C. J. McCollum in the season opener, then absorbed a 42-point pounding in Los Angeles against the Clippers one night after allowing 132 points in a loss to the Lakers.

The Suns now turn to the experienced Jay Triano, who served as the head coach of the Toronto Raptors for two-plus seasons in addition to multiple stints in charge of the Canadian national team. Triano takes over the league’s youngest collection of players, with an average age of just 24.5 as of opening night, looking to extract more effort and discipline from this group while management actively tries to find a new home for Bledsoe.

As for Watson’s removal, it will not go down as the fastest in N.B.A. history. In 1971-72, following that 1970-71 campaign devoid of firings, Dolph Schayes was let go by the Buffalo Braves after just one game.

It’s the smallest of consolations for Watson, who departs with an unsightly record of 33-85 — and the knowledge that even the most friendly environment in his craft for decades couldn’t save him.",N.B.A. Coaches Had Long Stretch of Stability.

And before that was “The Beguiled,” with Sofia Coppola, and “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” which was shot last summer in Cincinnati and, of Mr. Farrell’s recent films, has perhaps affected him the most.

Written by Mr. Lanthimos with Efthymis Filippou, the film is far darker than “The Lobster,” and suffused with an increasingly claustrophobic dread. Mr. Farrell adopted a monotone for the part similar to that of his “Lobster” role, but the characters’ similarity ends there.

David, his “Lobster” character, was doughy, inward, guileless and desperately lonely, all of which felt especially poignant coming from a live wire like Mr. Farrell, who said he felt great liberation in being so contained. “There was no attempt and no desire, as written, to be in any way cool, any way interesting, any way suave,” he said. But Steven, the heart surgeon he played in “Killing,” is cunning and arrogant, and by the end of the production, Mr. Farrell said, he felt very depressed.

“It’s a gift to have that kind of relationship, it’s easier to go further and explore other things,” Mr. Lanthimos said. “This was a challenge, something more different and complex and dark, and I knew he had the understanding and tone.”

For all his work on big films, Mr. Farrell has long preferred smaller films anyway and the specific stories they can tell. When Martin McDonagh approached him to play a hit man for “In Bruges,” basically throwing him a lifeline, he almost turned down the part. He’d been in a string of bad movies and was still feeling the lingering burn of his Alexander the Great movie. (Among the sharper barbs: “He seems like a moody sad sack that I wouldn’t follow to the grocery store much less into battle.”) He worried his name might scare people away.

Mr. McDonagh persuaded him anyway. “The character needed to be lovable and appealing even though he’s done something horrific and unforgivable, and it’s easy to love Colin, and to believe that sense of guilt he showed so well,” Mr. McDonagh wrote by email. “Also, I don’t think he ever really didn’t want to do the part for a second!”

For Mr. Farrell, it was a shaky time. He was scant months out of rehab, having finally caved to his family’s pressures to get straight. Asked what hastened his bottoming out, Mr. Farrell quipped, “Just existing.” But really, he added, it was the intensity of sudden fame, which came fast after Joel Schumacher cast him in “Tigerland” (2000) and then “Phone Booth” (2002).

“Getting all these platitudes and things being said about you, and all these gifts, it wasn’t in my DNA to believe any of this stuff,” he said. “You try and match the hype, but I never believed it.”

Mr. Farrell is from Castleknock, a relatively well-to-do Dublin suburb, and studied at the Gaiety School of Acting in Dublin before landing a role in 1998 on the BBC soap “Ballykissangel.” He took the Irish national commandment of not getting ahead of yourself to Hollywood, “foolishly and understandably,” he now says, equating personal change with betraying his roots.

“I remember making a promise to myself, ‘Don’t change, don’t change, remember where you come from,’” he said, “But change is inevitable. You don’t change, you get sickness, your life will fall apart on the inside.”

His antics filled gossip pages, but he swears many of them were lost to blackouts. I asked about the time he kissed a reporter on camera on the red carpet, and his eyes widened. “Did I? Who? Which one?” he asked. “I swear to God, I lost so much time.” A little while later, a button on my blouse popped, and as I quickly refastened it, he steadfastly held my gaze, and then pointed to his eyes. “I kept right here, the whole time,” he teased. “Back in the day I would’ve leaned in for a kiss, obviously.”

The exchange was light and playful, and the interview took place before The New York Times published its exposé on the producer Harvey Weinstein, whose reported sexual misconduct Mr. Farrell would later denounce as “atrocious.” In our chat, though, Mr. Farrell did address the latitude given to stars.

“The one thing that fame asks you to do, I have learned, is to police yourself,” he said. “You get away with murder, you get away with mistreating people, you won’t be called out on things you really should be called out with, you really do.”

He was glad that those days were behind him, he said, not least because sobriety has made him a much better dad. His first son, James Padraig, was born in 2003 (James’s mother is the model Kim Bordenave), and initially Mr. Farrell figured he’d be his son’s friend. “’Cause that’s what a 6-month-old grub needs,” he cracked, “a 27-year-old drunk, high friend.” He had his second son, Henry, with his former girlfriend the actress Alicja Bachleda-Curus. Mr. Farrell shares custody of his sons, and says he can’t think of a decision he has made in the last dozen or so years without thinking about how it would impact them.

Now his life centers on the boys, his home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, yoga (“I said I love it, I didn’t say I’m doing it”), and saunas (“very purifying”).

“He was a wild guy, and now I think he’s channeled all of that into his family, and his work,” said the director Dan Gilroy, who said he cast Mr. Farrell in “Roman Israel” in part because he knew he could hold his own with Denzel Washington.

Mr. Farrell said he planned to take a long break, and he was open to what’s next, be it action heroes, even though he loathes guns (“Hate em!”) or, in the vein of Mr. Lanthimos’s films, more unsexy roles, even if he might be somewhat alone in characterizing them that way.

“Two people who couldn’t have been happy with Flake’s announcement: Republican Kelli Ward and Democrat Kyrsten Sinema.”

How will Mr. Flake’s decision not to seek another term affect the race in Arizona? According to Ms. Roberts, not having Mr. Flake as a primary opponent is bad news for the Bannon-backed candidate, Kelli Ward, whose “entire campaign was ‘I’m not Sanctuary Senator Jeff Flake.’” Now, Ms. Ward will probably be challenged by an establishment Republican with a better shot to win than Mr. Flake did. It is also bad news for the Democratic candidate, Kyrsten Sinema, who was hoping to run against Ms. Ward in the general election. The only thing for certain, writes Ms. Roberts, is that Joe Arpaio, the former Maricopa County sheriff, will tease that he is considering a run but won’t ultimately pull the trigger. Read more »

Leonid Bershidsky in Bloomberg:



“In Europe, politicians who feel their party has been hijacked generally go further, sometimes as far as setting up a splinter party.”

News of Mr. Flake’s speech made it into the international news cycle, explains Mr. Bershidsky, where Europeans were left “scratching their heads at what amounted to a rancorous admission of defeat where his rhetoric would have suggested he should fight on.” Sometimes, argues Mr. Bershidsky, a two-party system merely “suppresses representation and makes people cling to increasingly meaningless political brands.” There is nothing wrong with a little “political innovation” when it becomes clear that the traditional dualism isn’t working anymore. However, he is skeptical that Mr. Flake is the type of “responsible leader” to form a new, strong party. Read more »

Benjamin Wittes in Lawfare:

“This speech will be remembered not merely for its eloquence and its moral correctness but also for its intellectual content and its courage at a particular moment in time.”

Mr. Wittes addresses those Never Trump conservatives who had hoped that Republican leaders like Mr. Corker and Mr. Flake would have stayed and fought. For Mr. Wittes, “the salient fact is that neither Flake nor Corker felt able to be true to themselves without taking the step of not having to face Republican voters again.” He admires these men who have “manufacture” the conditions in which they could speak the truth.

Prenatal Surgery for Spina Bifida Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spinal column does not close properly during the earliest stages of fetal development.
But Mrs. Royer had health problems that doctors said made pregnancy unlikely.
Termination was offered as an option, and Mrs. Royer felt that doctors were pushing it.","But now Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead are testing a new, experimental technique — one that some in the field are eager to learn, but that others regard warily, questioning its long-term safety for the fetus.

The surgeons had made a wide incision in the mother’s lower abdomen, gently lifted out her uterus — still attached internally — and made two tiny, 4-millimeter slits. In one, they inserted a “fetoscope,” a small telescope fitted with a camera, light and grasping tool. The second slit was for other miniature instruments.

Lit from within, the uterus glowed, red and magical in the darkened room.

Spina bifida occurs early, at three to four weeks of pregnancy, when the tissue forming the spinal column should fold into a tube but does not close properly. There are 1,500 to 2,000 cases a year in the United States.

The causes are not fully understood, but in some cases a deficiency in the B-vitamin folic acid plays a role, which is why supplements are recommended for pregnant women and the vitamin is added to grain and cereal products.

Introducing prenatal surgery for spina bifida was a bold step. In the early days, doctors were so worried about risk that they operated only for conditions that would be fatal if left unrepaired; if the surgery did harm, it would be to a fetus that would have died anyway.

Spina bifida is generally not fatal, so the standard practice was to operate after birth. But the results of postnatal surgery were mixed: most children could not walk and had other problems.

Doctors began to suspect that outcomes might be better if they could fix the defect before birth. Some of the spinal damage is caused by amniotic fluid, which turns increasingly toxic to the exposed nerve tissue as the pregnancy progresses and the fetus passes more and more wastes into the fluid.

Surgeons thought that if the opening could be closed before birth, sealing out the fluid, some of the nerve damage might be averted. They began operating in the 1990s, but it was not clear the surgery was helping.

A landmark study published in 2011 found that — for carefully selected fetuses — prenatal surgery was better than operating after birth. The percentage of children who could walk independently rose to 40 percent from 20 percent, and the need for a shunt was cut in half, to 40 percent from 82 percent.

“The percent who benefit, I wish it was higher,” Dr. Whitehead said, adding that so far prenatal surgery does not seem to help with bladder incontinence, and most children with spina bifida need catheters to pass urine.

The ideal time for the surgery is from 24 to 26 weeks of pregnancy, Dr. Belfort said — early enough to prevent some nerve damage, but late enough so that the baby has a decent chance of surviving and doing well if something goes wrong and it has to be delivered.

Prenatal Surgery for Spina Bifida Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spinal column does not close properly during the earliest stages of fetal development. In some cases, surgery on the fetus may reduce the severity of the condition. EMBRYO A groove along the embryo’s back folds together to form the neural tube, an enclosed space that will fill with the brain and spinal column. But a gap at the base of the tube can lead to spina bifida. Embryo at 21 days 22 days 28 days Head Back Gap DEVELOPING FETUS If the base of the neural tube fails to close, the spinal cord and nerves may be exposed or protrude through a gap in the spine, and the brain stem may be pulled down into the spinal column.

His patient, Lexi Royer, 28, and her husband, Joshuwa, 29, were high-school sweethearts who had always wanted children. But Mrs. Royer had health problems that doctors said made pregnancy unlikely. She had one miscarriage and then did not conceive again.

So the couple were thrilled in May to discover that she was pregnant. During an ultrasound exam at 13 weeks, they saw their son for the first time.

“There were a lot of happy tears,” Mrs. Royer said. “Then the ultrasound tech said she had to go back and get the doctor.”

A wrenching series of tests and visits to specialists followed. With each one, the news got worse. The defect was big and severe, and the brain stem was being pulled down into the spinal column.

“It sounded like we were looking at brain damage, feeding tubes, a breathing tube, a wheelchair, just a bad quality of life,” Mrs. Royer said.

Termination was offered as an option, and Mrs. Royer felt that doctors were pushing it. But this might be their only chance to have a child.

They wanted to learn more about their son’s condition. Mrs. Royer, a hairdresser, and her husband, a firefighter and emergency medical technician, turned to the internet and discovered Facebook groups for parents of children with spina bifida. Some reported good results from a procedure that doctors in their home city, San Diego, had never even heard of: fetoscopic surgery.

In early September, they went to Houston for two days of testing. The results confirmed that their son had a severe spinal defect, but still gave them hope.","To Mend a Birth Defect, Surgeons Operate on the Patient Within the Patient",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/health/fetal-surgery-spina-bifida.html

And he was a master of the wordless vocal, making hits out of songs full of “woo-woos” and “la-las.”

Working with the songwriter, producer and arranger David Bartholomew, Mr. Domino and his band carried New Orleans parade rhythms into rock ’n’ roll and put a local stamp on nearly everything they touched, even country tunes like “Jambalaya” or big-band songs like “My Blue Heaven” and “When My Dreamboat Comes Home.”

Antoine Dominique Domino Jr. was born on Feb. 26, 1928, the youngest of eight children in a family with Creole roots. He grew up in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, where he spent most of his life.

Music filled his life from the age of 10, when his family inherited an old piano. After his brother-in-law Harrison Verrett, a traditional-jazz musician, wrote down the notes on the keys and taught him a few chords, Antoine threw himself at the instrument — so enthusiastically that his parents moved it to the garage.

He was almost entirely self-taught, picking up ideas from boogie-woogie masters like Meade Lux Lewis, Pinetop Smith and Amos Milburn. “Back then I used to play everybody’s records; everybody’s records who made records,” he told the New Orleans music magazine Offbeat in 2004. “I used to hear ’em, listen at ’em five, six, seven, eight times and I could play it just like the record because I had a good ear for catchin’ notes and different things.”

He attended the Louis B. Macarty School but dropped out in the fourth grade to work as an iceman’s helper. “In the houses where people had a piano in their rooms, I’d stop and play,” he told USA Today in 2007. “That’s how I practiced.”

In his teens, he started working at a club called the Hideaway with a band led by the bassist Billy Diamond, who nicknamed him Fats. Mr. Domino soon became the band’s frontman and a local draw.

“Fats was breaking up the place, man,” Mr. Bartholomew told The Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2010. “He was singing and playing the piano and carrying on. Everyone was having a good time. When you saw Fats Domino, it was ‘Let’s have a party!’ ”

He added: “My first impression was a lasting impression. He was a great singer. He was a great artist. And whatever he was doing, nobody could beat him.”

Slide Show

In 1947 Mr. Domino married Rosemary Hall, and they had eight children, Antoine III, Anatole, Andre, Anonio, Antoinette, Andrea, Anola and Adonica. His wife died in 2008. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.

In 1949 Mr. Bartholomew brought Lew Chudd, the owner of Imperial Records in Los Angeles, to the Hideaway. Mr. Chudd signed Mr. Domino on the spot, with a contract, unusual for the time, that paid royalties rather than a one-time purchase of songs.

Immediately, Mr. Domino and Mr. Bartholomew wrote “The Fat Man,” a cleaned-up version of a song about drug addiction called “Junkers Blues,” and recorded it with Mr. Bartholomew’s studio band. By 1951 it had sold a million copies.

Mr. Domino’s trademark triplets, picked up from “It’s Midnight,” a 1949 record by the boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield, appeared on his next rhythm-and-blues hit, “Every Night About This Time.” The technique spread like wildfire, becoming a virtual requirement for rock ’n’ roll ballads.

“Fats made it popular,” Mr. Bartholomew told Rick Coleman, the author of “Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock ’n’ Roll” (2006). “Then it was on every record.”

In 1952, on a chance visit to Cosimo Matassa’s recording studio in New Orleans, Mr. Domino was asked to help out on a recording by a nervous teenager named Lloyd Price. Sitting in with Mr. Bartholomew’s band, he came up with the memorable piano part for “Lawdy Miss Clawdy,” one of the first rhythm-and-blues records to cross over to a pop audience

Through the early 1950s Mr. Domino turned out a stream of hits, taking up what seemed like permanent residence in the upper reaches of the R&B charts. His records began reaching the pop charts as well.

In that racially segregated era, white performers used his hits to build their careers. In 1955, “Ain’t It a Shame” became a No. 1 hit for Pat Boone as “Ain’t That a Shame,” while Domino’s arrangement of a traditional song, “Bo Weevil,” was imitated by Teresa Brewer.

Mr. Domino’s appeal to white teenagers broadened as he embarked on national tours and appeared with mixed-race rock ’n’ roll revues like the Moondog Jubilee of Stars Under the Stars, presented by the disc jockey Alan Freed at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Appearances on national television, on Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan’s shows, put him in millions of living rooms.

He did not flaunt his status as an innovator, or as an architect of a powerful cultural movement.

“Fats, how did this rock ’n’ roll all get started anyway?” an interviewer for a Hearst newsreel asked him in 1957. Mr. Domino answered: “Well, what they call rock ’n’ roll now is rhythm and blues. I’ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans.”

At a news conference in Las Vegas in 1969, after resuming his performing career, Elvis Presley interrupted a reporter who had called him “the king.” He pointed to Mr. Domino, who was in the room, and said, “There’s the real king of rock ’n’ roll.”

Mr. Domino had his biggest hit in 1956 with his version of “Blueberry Hill,” a song that had been recorded by Glenn Miller’s big band in 1940. It peaked at No. 2 on the pop charts and sold a reported three million copies.

“I liked that record ’cause I heard it by Louis Armstrong and I said, ‘That number gonna fit me,’ ” he told Offbeat. “We had to beg Lew Chudd for a while. I told him I wasn’t gonna make no more records till they put that record out. I could feel it, that it was a hit, a good record.”

He followed with two more Top Five pop hits: “Blue Monday” and “I’m Walkin’,” which outsold the version recorded by Ricky Nelson.

“I was lucky enough to write songs that carry a good beat and tell a real story that people could feel was their story, too — something that old people or the kids could both enjoy,” Mr. Domino told The Los Angeles Times in 1985.

Mr. Domino performed in 1950s movies like “Shake, Rattle and Rock,” “The Big Beat” (for which he and Mr. Bartholomew wrote the title song) and “The Girl Can’t Help It.” In 1957, he toured for three months with Chuck Berry, Clyde McPhatter, the Moonglows and others.

Well into the early 1960s, Mr. Domino continued to reach both the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts with songs like “Whole Lotta Lovin’,” “I’m Ready,” “I’m Gonna Be a Wheel Someday,” “Be My Guest,” “Walkin’ to New Orleans” and “My Girl Josephine.”

He toured Europe for the first time in 1962 and met the Beatles in Liverpool, before they were famous. His contract with Imperial ended in 1963, and he went on to record for ABC-Paramount, Mercury, Broadmoor, Reprise and other labels.

His last appearance in the pop Top 100 was in 1968, with a version of “Lady Madonna,” the Beatles song that had been inspired by Mr. Domino’s piano-pounding style. In 1982, he had a country hit with “Whiskey Heaven.”

Although he was no longer a pop sensation, Mr. Domino continued to perform worldwide and appeared for 10 months a year in Las Vegas in the mid-1960s. On tour, he would bring his own pots and pans so he could cook.

His life on the road ended in the early 1980s, when he decided that he did not want to leave New Orleans, saying it was the only place where he liked the food.

He went on to perform regularly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and in 1987 Jerry Lee Lewis and Ray Charles joined him for a Cinemax special, “Fats Domino and Friends.” He released a holiday album, “Christmas Is a Special Day,” in 1993.

Reclusive and notoriously resistant to interview requests, Mr. Domino stayed home even when he received a lifetime achievement Grammy Award in 1987. (He did travel to New York when he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 as one of its first members, although he did not take part in the jam session that concluded the ceremony.) In 1999, when he was awarded the National Medal of Arts, he sent his daughter Antoinette to the White House to pick up the prize.

He even refused to leave New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city on Aug. 29, 2005, remaining at his flooded home — he was living in the Lower Ninth Ward then — until he was rescued by helicopter on Sept. 1.

“I wasn’t too nervous” about waiting to be saved, he told The New York Times in 2006. “I had my little wine and a couple of beers with me; I’m all right.”

His rescue was loosely the basis for “Saving Fats,” a tall tale in Sam Shepard’s 2010 short-story collection, “Day Out of Days.”

President George W. Bush visited Mr. Domino’s home in 2006 in recognition of New Orleans’s cultural resilience; that same year, Mr. Domino released “Alive and Kickin,’ ” his first album in more than a decade. The title song began, “All over the country, people want to know / Whatever happened to Fats Domino,” then continued, “I’m alive and kicking and I’m where I wanna be.”

He was often seen around New Orleans, emerging from his pink-roofed mansion driving a pink Cadillac. “I just drink my little beers, do some cookin’, anything I feel like ” he told The Daily Telegraph of London in 2007, describing his retirement.

In 1953, in Down Beat magazine, the Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler made a bold-sounding prediction that turned out to be, in retrospect, quite timid. “Can’t you envision a collector in 1993 discovering a Fats Domino record in a Salvation Army depot and rushing home to put it on the turntable?” he wrote. “We can. It’s good blues, it’s good jazz, and it’s the kind of good that never wears out.”","Fats Domino, Early Rock ’n’ Roller With a Boogie-Woogie Piano, Is Dead at 89",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/obituaries/fats-domino-89-one-of-rock-n-rolls-first-stars-is-dead.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

There is the bumbling repetition of interview questions, because no one seems to be able to hear anything over the screaming audience members. There is the smoke that engulfs guests as they enter, and that in a few cases has left them disoriented. And there is the occasional paternal pat on the shoulder the guests give the hosts, a gesture of dominance and control, the sort of thing an elder does to let the youth know to turn it down a notch.

The seams are visible, and frayed, on “TRL,” which is currently in its fourth week and no steadier than it was in its first. In its initial incarnation, which ran from 1998 to 2008, “TRL” — originally “Total Request Live” — was the essential countdown show of the teen-pop era. It took place after school and often filled the streets of Times Square with shrieking teenagers.

But that was when the phone screen was less enticing than the television screen, when music was closer to the heart of MTV’s mission.

The “TRL” of 2017 is less a coherent show than a series of loosely threaded distractions. Each episode is an hour but feels like two. It is preoccupied with viral moments but creates none of its own, or barely anything even worth a GIF. (One exception: the recent sketch that found DJ Khaled break dancing and dropping to the floor for a backspin.)

The fact that the internet has leached attention and relevance away from television is only part of what’s befuddling this show — plenty of television is premised on digesting and commenting on things that happen online. But those shows — say, “Desus & Mero,” or even late-night talk-show monologues — specialize in personalities and commentary. “TRL” is a mishmash and has the additional problem of trying to build a tentpole television series out of the component parts of internet personalities, who are generally poorly suited to the task.

MARKET OVERVIEW

The Copenhagen real estate market is hot these days, with home sales up 9 percent in September, compared to a year earlier, said Thomas Hovgaard, the press officer for Nybolig, a real estate agency.

Demand is particularly high for small apartments, Mr. Hovgaard said. In recent years, the local government has prioritized building larger apartments to attract families, he said, but “Copenhagen has too many students and far too few apartments.” Prices for apartments in the city, he said, have increased 11 percent in the last year, from 35,000 to 39,000 krone a square meter (or about $511 to $566 a square foot).

Copenhagen K is one of the most popular neighborhoods in the city — and one of the most expensive, agents said. There are about 4,850 apartments in the area, said Phillip Siesbye, an owner of the real estate agency Siesbye Kapsch. Copenhagen, he added, is “a very small town.”

The average price of an apartment in Copenhagen K was 49,551 krone a square meter (or about $726 a square foot), in the second quarter of 2017, compared to 41,922 krone a square meter (about $614 a square foot), a year earlier, an 18 percent increase, Mr. Siesbye said.

There is little land available for new construction in the area, increasing demand for available apartments, Mr. Siesbye said: “Most of the city is very old buildings, and people are not allowed to change them.”

Buildings completed before 1992 are rent-controlled, making newer apartments more popular with investors, Mr. Hovgaard said. “We see some exceptionally high prices in new apartments, typically by the waterfront,” he said.

WHO BUYS IN COPENHAGEN

Like many cities around the world, Copenhagen has seen an influx of people from rural areas. It is expected to gain 100,000 residents in the next 10 years, Mr. Hovgaard said, a significant increase in a city of 1.3 million people.

Buyers include European Union residents with jobs in the city and parents buying apartments for their children to use while they attend school in the city, agents said.

Those moving to the city after their children go off to school have increased demand for bigger apartments, Mr. Siesbye said. In the city center, he said, “it is only the rich people who can afford to buy, just like in New York and other big cities.”

BUYING BASICS

Denmark restricts noncitizens from buying property unless they meet strict residency requirements. There are exemptions for citizens of the European Union, as long as the property is used as a primary residence. There are also restrictions on buying in certain coastal areas, aimed at preventing noncitizens from buying property as vacation homes.

Buyers typically hire a lawyer to navigate the process and review documents. “All the deals are with lawyers on the buyers’ side,” Mr. Siesbye said.

TAXES AND FEES

Hiring a lawyer typically costs buyers between $1,500 and $3,000, agents said, while sellers pay the agents’ fees. There is also a registration fee of 0.6 percent of the purchase price, plus a flat fee of about $200. Fees on mortgages include a charge of 1.5 percent of the mortgage value.

The condo association/maintenance fees on this apartment are about 21,490 krone a year (or about $3,400), Ms. Osterlin said. The annual property taxes total about 28,216 krone (or $4,500).

At the time that Democrats began paying for the research, Mr. Trump was in the process of clinching the Republican presidential nomination, and Ms. Clinton’s allies were scrambling to figure out how to run against a candidate who had already weathered attacks from Republican rivals about his shifting policy positions, his character and his business record.

Fusion GPS hired Christopher Steele, a respected former British spy with extensive experience in Russia, to conduct research into any possible connections between Mr. Trump, his businesses, campaign team and Russia.

Mr. Steele produced a series of memos that alleged a broad conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the 2016 election on behalf of Mr. Trump. The memos also contained unsubstantiated accounts of encounters between Mr. Trump and Russian prostitutes, and real estate deals that were intended as bribes.

The contents of the memos circulated in Washington in late 2016, and were briefed to Mr. Trump by senior American intelligence officials during the presidential transition. The memos, which became known as the “Steele Dossier,” were made public by Buzzfeed — sparking an ongoing debate about their accuracy and about who funded the research.

Fusion GPS was started by three former Wall Street Journal employees. The firm worked directly with Perkins Coie and its lead election lawyer, Marc Elias, according to the law firm spokesperson, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information about confidential business relationships. The law firm’s payments to Fusion GPS for the Russia research ended just before Election Day, the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said that neither the Clinton campaign, nor the D.N.C., was aware that Fusion GPS had been hired to conduct the research.

Earlier this year, Mr. Elias had denied that he had possessed the dossier before the election.

Anita Dunn, a veteran Democratic operative working with Perkins Coie, said on Tuesday that Mr. Elias “was certainly familiar with some of, but not all, of the information” in the dossier. But, she said “he didn’t have and hadn’t seen the full document, nor was he involved in pitching it to reporters.” And Mr. Elias “was not at liberty to confirm Perkins Coie as the client at that point,” Ms. Dunn said.

Brian Fallon, who served as a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, on Tuesday wrote on Twitter that he did not know that Mr. Steele had been working on behalf of the Clinton campaign before the election.

“If I had, I would have volunteered to go to Europe and try to help him,” Mr. Fallon wrote.

A lawyer and spokeswoman for Fusion GPS did not respond to requests for comment.

A spokeswoman for the D.N.C. sought to distance the national party from the work, noting that the party’s chairman, Tom Perez, was elected only after last year’s election. He and his leadership team “were not involved in any decision-making regarding Fusion GPS, nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization,” said Xochitl Hinojosa, the D.N.C. spokeswoman.

The work by Fusion GPS on the dossier has come under scrutiny from congressional investigators, who have questioned one of its founders and subpoenaed its banking records to try to determine who funded the research.

Fusion GPS is fighting the subpoena in federal court, and Mr. Gehringer’s letter was produced in connection with that legal case.

In the letter, Mr. Gehringer praised Fusion GPS for its “efforts to fulfill your obligation to maintain client confidentiality. In the circumstances, however, we believe it is appropriate to release Fusion GPS from this obligation as it relates to the identity of Perkins Coie.”

Mr. Gehringer added that, “given the interest in this issue, we believe it would be appropriate for all parties who hired Fusion GPS in connection with the 2016 presidential campaign to release Fusion GPS from this obligation as well.”",Clinton Campaign and Democratic Party Helped Pay for Russia Trump Dossier,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/clinton-dnc-russia-dossier.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“We must listen constantly, not just to each other, acting and reacting, but also to what is going on in the audience.
(“Oh, yes, I’ve seen that as well,” Ms. Vardalos said.)
“We are also so different now,” Mr. Kail said.
“There is a lot of pain,” Ms. Vardalos said.","This wasn’t the first time that someone in the Newman Theater had reacted emotionally to a monologue by Ms. Vardalos or one of her three castmates, in the play she adapted from Cheryl Strayed’s book of the same name, based on her long-running online advice column, “Dear Sugar.” It is now in its second iteration at the Public after a critically acclaimed run last fall. (Ms. Strayed now collaborates with Steve Almond on the Sweet Spot column for the Thursday Styles section of The New York Times and its accompanying podcast Dear Sugars.)

Earlier that evening, in fact, another young woman, sitting in the third row, started crying at the point when Sugar told of how her mother had never lived to see her granddaughter wear the red dress the two women had bought impulsively at a yard sale years earlier.

And she started up again — this time more loudly — near the end of the show when the character played by Teddy Cañez narrated the tale of a father who had lost his only son at age 22.

“I felt I had to carry her through the show,” Ms. Vardalos said. “We must listen constantly, not just to each other, acting and reacting, but also to what is going on in the audience. Because the audience becomes part of the performance.”

Any play is going to have its challenges, of course, from complicated monologues to quicksilver scene changes to the distractions of cellphones going off or someone snoring away in the front row. (“Oh, yes, I’ve seen that as well,” Ms. Vardalos said.)

But “Tiny Beautiful Things,” with its tales of untimely death, a miscarriage that still haunts years later and sexual assault — all taken from the letters written to Ms. Strayed and then her often deeply personal responses — has an emotional rawness that seems to grab audiences in unexpected ways. (Of course, not every story is a sad one: At least one monologue, about a sexy Santa, gets laughs every night.)

“If you have 300 people in the theater, then the odds are someone is there on the anniversary of someone they loved passing away, or maybe of a relationship ending,” said the director Thomas Kail. “So something that may mean nothing to you might resonate deeply with the person sitting behind you.”

After a recent Sunday matinee, four old friends — two visiting from Canada, two living in New York — gathered on the sidewalk outside the Public to reflect on the play they had just seen.

“It was like group therapy,” Carolyn McAskie, 71, said to her friends, laughing.

“I know,” responded Roxanne Carrillo, 65. “I believe it was 90 minutes, but it felt much shorter, like I had just left a 50-minute session with my shrink.”

On another night, Monique Bernstein, 28, stood in the lobby of the Public, holding a program for Ms. Vardalos to autograph while wiping away traces of the tears she had shed during the last extended monologue, about the father mourning his son.

“I had read the book and I loved it,” she said. “But there is something about seeing it with an audience, as opposed to just reading a book by yourself, that is sort of a bonding experience. Like there was a woman sniffling behind me, and I’m like, ‘I don’t feel so bad!’”

It’s been almost exactly a year since “Tiny Beautiful Things” was staged at the Public the first time around, selling out its brief run, and both Ms. Vardalos and Mr. Kail (a Tony Award winner for “Hamilton”) say they see small but significant differences in how audiences are now reacting.

The theater itself may be one reason the tears seem to be flowing so freely in the current production. Mr. Kail said the move to larger house — the original venue, the Shiva Theater, held 99 seats; the Newman, more than three times that — has made the experience more intimate, not less so, by letting the audience “slip into the anonymity of darkness.”

The Newman is both narrow and deep, with lights from the stage reflecting only on audience members in the first few rows.

“There is something about the length of the theater, and the darkness that unfolds, that allows deep reactions to come out,” Mr. Kail said. “And that was one of the questions we had when we first started working on this: Can we bring a group of people together, people who have never met, sitting shoulder to shoulder in the dark, and really get them to unlock?”

Mr. Kail said he was in the audience the night the young woman burst into her howl of anguish. “Each person on that stage, all four of them, were affected in their own way,” he said. “They each had to grapple with what it meant to hear someone who was clearly in pain. It opened up and expanded the show in ways I hadn’t seen on other nights.”

After each performance, Ms. Vardalos exits through the lobby of the Public, signing autographs, posing for selfies, even laughing and joking with people who might have been choking back tears in their seats a few minutes earlier but now are thrilled to meet the star of “My Big Fat Greek Wedding.”

But not every night.

“Sometimes, I will have been so affected by what happens in the audience, that I don’t come out right away,” she said. “I need to just sit by myself. I know people are waiting — and as actors, we aim to please — but there are times I can’t come out. I just can’t.”

Both she and Mr. Kail say they believe that there is something beyond the changed physical space that is causing such profound emotional reactions this time around. And that is the country itself.

Deep wounds that remain from a divisive presidential election. White supremacists marching in Charlottesville. The massacre in Las Vegas. Hurricanes in Houston, Florida and Puerto Rico. The threat of nuclear war with North Korea. All are factors the two believe may make people hungry to find comfort in the theater.

“We are also so different now,” Mr. Kail said.

Mr. Arbesfeld debuts a puzzle called “Walls and Doors,” and the idea behind it is that we are given nine 5x5 “rooms” that need to be filled in. Each answer is five letters long and the clues are not hard to solve. The roadblock occurs because the clues are not given in any particular order, so it is up to us to figure out where each word goes.

For me, that was the hardest part of the puzzle. One letter in each grid is filled in (spelling out the phrase “floor plan”), but that was only of nominal help to me. After much erasing — you want to do this one in pencil — I was able to get the central grid No. 5. That was encouraging, but then I needed to start all over again and solve another grid.

When lighting struck the Pinaleño Mountains in southeast Arizona at around 2:45 p.m. on June 7, igniting a 48,000 acre fire that reduced an ancient forest to blackened poles and stumps, a scurry of rare squirrels — 217 of the 252 left in existence — disappeared.

Some were fitted with radio transmitters that burned to ash; conservationists deduced their fates. They hoped others had managed to escape.

But for those 35 survivors — biological remnants from the last ice age — Jeff Humphrey, a spokesman with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, was deeply concerned.

“Most of them have lost the cones they’ve stored for their winter nourishment,” Mr. Humphrey said. “How do we get them through this winter?”

The Mount Graham red squirrel is among more than a dozen rare or threatened species that either perished or suffered habitat loss during recent hurricanes and wildfires across the United States.

Southwest Fires

The red squirrel was not the only creature affected during the Arizona wildfires, intensified by heat waves in the state’s south. After the fire, biologists and wildlife officers rescued Gila and Apache trout from forest streams before the water became clogged with ash, which happens when normal forest ground cover isn’t there to filter the runoff.

The Mexican spotted owl, which lives in wooded and canyon areas throughout New Mexico and southern Utah, was also vulnerable. “Its primary threat is wildfires, but it’s far more abundant,” Mr. Humphrey said.

California Wildfires

In Southern California, the mountain yellow-legged frog, of which there were about 400 living in remote, drying streams in the San Gabriel, San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountains, could face a hard winter after fires destroyed their habitat . Dr. Bruce Stein, a conservation scientist at the National Wildlife Federation, said he also worried for the California red-legged frog in wine country, as well as for endangered salmon and steelhead living in the Russian River (as in Arizona, sediment flowing into the water could harm the fish).

One of North America’s rarest species, the Amargosa vole, also lost part of its remaining habitat in a September fire in the Mojave National Preserve. About 50 of the few hundred remaining mammals perished, said Janet Foley, a professor at the U.C. Davis Veterinary Medicine protection program. “It killed off all the vegetation,” she said, “and they need to live in that.”

Hurricane Harvey

Just five of the 29 rare prairie chickens being tracked at the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge near Houston survived Hurricane Harvey. The bird — known for its funky mating dance — was already critically endangered. During the last century, its prairie grassland habitat in Texas and Louisiana was plowed to create space for farmlands and cities.

“It was a devastating impact,” said Mike Morrow, the refuge’s lead biologist. “The good news is we have an established captive breeding program,” he said. “Had it not been for that captive flock, it could have resulted in near-extinction.”

Whooping cranes “dodged a bullet” Dr. Stein said, when Harvey made landfall at their winter spot in Aransas County. At that time, the bird was breeding in Canada, but had it been in Texas, the species could have been wiped out, said Dr. Stein. “The concern is what effect the hurricane may have had on the habitat,” he added. Ocelots (a small Texan cat) and Kemp’s ridley sea turtles, which conservationists feared would be affected, also managed to survive the storm.

Hurricane Irma

Irma hit a number of species hard, including the Barbuda warbler and the Everglade snail kite. In Florida’s Keys — which Dr. Stein referred to as a “biological hot spot” — the storm was bad news for butterflies like the Miami blue, Schaus swallowtail and Bartram’s hairstreak; as well as green and loggerhead sea turtles and Key deer.

The Key deer is “a really charismatic animal,” said Brian Hires, a spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Fewer than 1,000 Key deer are left in existence. All but 33 survived the storm, but may face challenges with restricted access to fresh drinking water. The Miami blue butterfly (there are fewer than 100 left) are only “hanging on in a couple of Keys,” Dr. Stein said.

Hurricane Irma also cut off power to a Florida grasshopper sparrow aviary where the species, teetering on the edge of extinction, was successfully bred in captivity for the first time last year. Hours away from their backup generator shutting down, a service truck delivered 100 gallons of fuel to the facility. The grasshopper sparrow chicks survived. The fate of the Bahama oriole, found only in North Andros, South Andros, and Mangrove Cay, is still unknown.

Hurricane Maria

In 1989, Hurricane Hugo killed almost half the wild population of Puerto Rico’s native parrots — the only remaining bird of its type in the United States. The animal — with white-ringed eyes and a red stripe above its beak — had, by this year, recovered to about 500 wild and captive individuals. While most of those at the Iguaca Aviary in Puerto Rico’s rain forest survived, the fate of those wild birds in the Rio Abajo and El Yunque forests is unknown.

Correction : An earlier version of this article identified incorrectly the area where the Barbuda warbler is found. It is Barbuda, not the Florida Keys. An earlier version also referred incorrectly to the range and conservation status of another bird. The snail kite is not generally threatened over its entire range; the Everglade snail kite, which is not found in the Florida Keys, is endangered.","For an Endangered Animal, a Fire or Hurricane Can Mean the End",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/climate/fires-hurricanes-endangered-animals.html

Rather than setting rates for each energy provider based on its production costs plus a reasonable return on investment — as FERC’s top-down regulation used to do — the agency has moved steadily to let the market set prices.

As renewable energy has come online, FERC has also worked to level the playing field, allowing wind and solar power to compete too, along with strategies that manage demand, like agreements with customers to reduce consumption when prices spike. These policies have benefited consumers by controlling costs, fostering innovation and helping to advance lower-polluting energy.

Mr. Perry’s proposal would override this pro-market trajectory to benefit the Trump administration’s handpicked energy sources.

A policy reversal this momentous would normally require a strong justification, grounded in a theory of market failure, with sound evidence to back it up. Yet Mr. Perry’s proposal is so bare-bones that it failed even to define “resiliency,” an ambiguous term that evokes the grid’s ability to bounce back from unusual and unforeseen disruptions.

Selectively subsidizing coal and nuclear power is not the most obvious or best way to bolster the grid against sudden events. Nuclear plants already run nearly full-time, and coal plants are relatively slow to ramp up and down, making neither especially helpful if the grid suddenly needs more energy.

At the same time, wind power and strategies that reduce demand, like contracts with heavy electricity users to cut consumption when the system is stressed, helped grid operators manage the 2014 polar vortex, when bitterly cold temperatures struck parts of the East Coast. Why not pay these electricity providers for their contributions to resiliency?

To implement his policy, Mr. Perry must depend on FERC. The 1977 law that created the Department of Energy allows the energy secretary to propose but not to finalize rules for electricity markets.

Arbitrarily singling out coal and nuclear plants for special payments seems to violate the Federal Power Act’s requirement that FERC ensure no “undue discrimination” in electricity markets. So far, there is no evidence that would warrant intervening in the otherwise competitive markets the agency has so carefully nurtured.

Indeed, in response to Mr. Perry’s proposal, Robert Powelson, one of the three current FERC commissioners, and a Trump appointee, pledged not to “destroy” the electricity markets. “Markets have worked well and markets need to continue to work well,” he said this month. Another commissioner, Cheryl LaFleur, also expressed serious reservations.

Eight former FERC commissioners, from both parties, recently sent a letter to the agency opposing Mr. Perry’s plan after the agency requested comments. “Subsidizing resources so they do not retire would fundamentally distort the markets,” they warned. “The subsidized resources would inevitably drive out the unsubsidized resources, and the subsidies would inevitably raise prices to customers. Investor confidence would evaporate and markets would tend to collapse. This loss of faith in markets would thereby undermine reliability.”

Mr. Perry’s proposal to FERC also seeks to dramatically compress the normal timeline for approving such a complicated rule, shrinking a process that typically takes many months to a matter of weeks. This procedural anomaly prompted an outcry from nearly all of the affected stakeholders, from utilities to grid managers, who protested that there is no reason to rush.

Just this summer, the head of the North American Electric Reliability Council told Congress that “the state of reliability in North America remains strong, and the trend line shows continuing improvement year over year.”

Nevertheless, FERC has moved forward, putting the proposal out for public comment and creating uncertainty for the industry.

This process could still end well. FERC might ultimately reject Mr. Perry’s proposal because it runs contrary to decades of agency policy. Or, if FERC genuinely wants to bolster the resilience of the electricity system, it could scrap Mr. Perry’s plan and start fresh.

A good-faith proposal would start by offering a detailed definition of “resilience” that reflects the modern electricity system. It would explore the broad range of options our highly integrated and networked regional grids make available to strengthen the system’s performance — including natural gas, wind and solar power, strategies to reduce demand, and technology-based approaches that make grids operate more flexibly. Any provider that demonstrably enhances the grid’s capacity to withstand disruptions through any of these means should be eligible for additional revenue. This approach would harness market competition to incentivize innovation.

And if Congress wants to help nuclear energy, which is struggling to compete economically, it could adopt a carbon tax, which would favor nuclear power since it produces carbon-free electricity.

As so many emotional journeys do, this one began with me expressing disgust on Twitter. In this instance, I was angry about the proliferation of lifestyle-touting subscription clothing services. I’d recently seen ads for Bombfell on the subway (“If shopping isn’t your bag, you’re going to love our box”) and hit a personal tipping point.

Clothing delivery services seem somehow dystopian, and although I was freaked out by them, I didn’t fully understand why. Twitter people rushed to fill me in, as I’d hoped they would.

Clothing subscriptions provide a utilitarian uniform for cubicle-bound automatons, people said. They enforce a kind of fascistic conformity, like Mao suits but more cheaply made and less chic. They infantilize us in the same way that meal kit delivery services do: by replacing labor done by someone who might care how we’re fed or what we’re wearing (say, a loving parent) with labor done by workers at the bottom rung of a start-up, or even maybe by an algorithm designed to take key words and turn them into outfits.

It sounded so much worse than I’d even imagined, and of course this made me want to find out more. So Rumaan Alam and I decided to make ourselves his ’n’ hers guinea pigs in a harrowing experiment: Together, we would try out the experience of several of the most popular subscription services. We would take notes on our experiences and compare them. In doing so, we would learn a truth. Are clothing subscriptions the Soylent of fashion — or are they maybe just a fun and convenient new way to shop?

If you have someone at home all day or your UPS driver knows where to hide boxes behind your garage, the promise is convenience. If you live far from any stores or simply don’t have time to shop, the promise is access. If you feel overwhelmed by shopping, the promise is attention. If you feel underwhelmed by shopping, the promise is novelty. If you don’t care about fashion, they’ll care for you; if you do care about fashion, they’ll be your clothes buddy.

Like so many entities that pledge to disrupt, the subscription service model exchanges one set of hassles for another, more modern, set of hassles. Spend time with the computer instead of a sales clerk. Visit the post office instead of your local shop.

My first subscription was to Bombfell, the ubiquitous Instagram advertiser that sounds like a Roger Moore-era Bond film. The enrollment process emphasizes the user over the clothing; you describe your body type, your general style, and indicate anything you know you have no interest in, like boot-cut jeans or graphic tees. (Check, and check.)

I am someone who is interested in fashion, which doesn’t put me outside Bombfell’s target demographic, because what the company sells is something I’m interested in too: ease. I appreciate that the delivery was fast and the customer service attentive. The pricing was not an issue because you pay only if you keep the clothes Bombfell sends you and I returned everything.

In my enrollment, I told Bombfell that I was simply too busy to shop, that I had a modern sense of style. They sent me a long sleeve tee, a chambray shirt, a pair of brown pants and a pair of faded black jeans, all perfectly serviceable. This was more like the clothing a mother might choose for an adult son, rather than what I expect from a stylist, even if that’s just a term of art for a customer service representative.

Especially galling, I thought, was the long sleeve tee, which Bombfell assured me was a design that was theirs alone. Exclusivity is meant to be alluring, but it’s hard not to reason that per some arrangement, every customer, no matter his style or needs, is going to be sent this particular garment. Part of this site’s appeal is, I think, its prices, but I refuse to pretend that $68 is a fair price for a cotton tee.

The deal: Rent as many “totes” as you like and return when you’re done — or use their purchase service .

EMILY:

I started with Le Tote because I get served its Instagram ads most often, and because one Twitter dissenter had mentioned finding it useful when starting a new job. It also seemed to be the cheapest and most flexible of all the services; you can wear the clothes for as long as you want and then send them back, which spurs the shipment of a new box, purportedly styled just for you.

All the options it showed for outfits you would potentially wear seemed irretrievably wack to me, but Le Tote does allow you to choose what’s in your shipment from a set of options, to which it adds a few “fun” extras. My first Tote contained a striped shirt, a faux suede moto jacket, a pair of leggings with Nike written up the side, and (fun!) a vending-machine-quality ring and a floral scarf. The whole thing cost $147, if I wanted to buy it all, which I did not; $147 seemed expensive, considering the plastic fast-fashion quality of the clothes in it.

I did end up keeping the leggings with Nike written up the side because they seemed as if they wouldn’t fall off my butt during yoga if I ever go to yoga again. You win this one, Le Tote. But not any other ones, because I canceled after that shipment.

I was left with one burning question. Is Le Tote a play on words? A “litotes” is a figure of speech that uses deliberately exaggerated understatement to make a point, like “not bad” or “it’s not my first rodeo.” Like “Le Tote clothes aren’t the best I’ve ever worn.” I’m guessing it’s not a play on words, actually.

The deal: You’re sent five things, you try them, return what you don’t like. Bonus fun: You get 25 percent off if you buy all five.

RUMAAN:

Stitch Fix is in the business of style more than convenience. You can hear it in the very name, the notion that your wardrobe is something that can be fixed, and that will in turn fix your life. The style questionnaire is more rigorous than Bombfell’s, more granular, and I could imagine my fellow consumers answering those queries mindful of what the right articles of clothing might do for them. That’s part of fashion’s promise, that a girlfriend or boyfriend or a promotion are just one tie or sweater or pair of shoes away.

Bombfell emphasizes its personal touch, showing you a head shot of the stylist who’s assisting you. Stitch Fix doesn’t work quite the same way; you’re welcome to send a note to your stylist, but to me it felt like sending a note to an algorithm. Anyway, I requested some blazers. I was sent two, both perfectly serviceable if not quite what I want in a blazer.

The trade-off for the convenience of trying something on at home is that you don’t have access to much variety. Presumably, over time, your stylist (or the algorithm) will learn to anticipate your tastes, the way we’re told online advertising works. Of course, when I’m online, I find I see mostly advertisements for things I’ve already bought.

I can see how the subscription model would appeal to the entrepreneurs who adapted it in this manner . Being sent a box feels like receiving a present, and while paying for what’s inside may not be top of mind, of course, the company has your credit card on file. It’s easy enough to return what you don’t want, but it’s easier still to keep what you don’t want.

My husband tried on one of the blazers and declared that he wanted it. It was only when I pointed out that it was $200 that he noticed that the shoulder didn’t fit quite right, that the cut was not altogether flattering.

The deal: You approve your trunk preview, and after it arrives you have five days to return or buy the six to 10 items in a trunk.

EMILY:

I next tried Trunk Club Women, also based on Twitter recommendation — this one from a woman who swore that the app’s stylist had heeded her very specific requests and that she’d ended up buying several of the items from her first trunk. Unlike Le Tote, Trunk Club is expensive. You also get to have a chat with a person who is definitely not a bot about your style preferences. I actually loved this process so much.

Doubters (like Rumaan!) told me, “Well, you could have that experience at any department store, especially at Nordstrom, which owns Trunk Club.” But the illusory intimacy of digital interaction made me so much more honest with Sophie, the stylist, than I would have ever been with a stranger IRL. Very quickly, she learned about me that I teach undergrad creative writing, that I almost never wear florals or bright colors, that I usually wear boots or sneakers and jeans and a button-front shirt, and that I still have a postpartum gut even though my son is 2½.

I admitted that I was unlikely to ever wear anything bodycon and described my ideal aspirational aesthetic as “rich L.A. lesbian.” The results were so shockingly on point that there were two items in my first Trunk preview that I had to delete, not because I didn’t like them, but because I already owned them.

The experience of trying all these clothes on at home instead of in a Nordstrom dressing room, however, was not actually that luxurious. I found the box big and daunting, and it sat around unopened for days while I waited to have enough time set aside to do a little in-home fashion show for myself. But five days is all you get with Trunk Club, and once its emails started to take on a slightly chiding tone, I worried that the company would charge my credit card for thousands of dollars worth of clothes. So late one afternoon, I opened the box.

I made yes, no and maybe piles, and there was a very cozy cashmere/wool blend long sleeve Vince sweater dress in the maybe pile that seemed like the kind of thing that might be worth its $400 price tag. I was in the process of trying it on a second time when disaster struck. I had been standing on my coffee table to look in my apartment’s only mirror, and without warning the table collapsed underneath me!

My first concern, as I assessed the damage, after I determined that I hadn’t sustained anything worse than a big, rapidly purpling butt bruise, was that the scrape on my hand had maybe gotten some blood on the dress. It hadn’t, but the dress seemed somehow tainted anyway. I ended up sending it back.

I also sent back a denim pencil skirt, a Bond-villainess scuba dress and a white silk top that had looked a little bit frumpy even on the lissome teenager who modeled it on the website. I kept a soft cropped sweater and a black velvet Eileen Fisher T-shirt that I wore later that week to a dinner to celebrate my 36th birthday, which seemed appropriate.

The deal: For a $60 flat fee, you’re sent a couple of new items each month.

RUMAAN:

Stitch Fix and Bombfell use technology and language to reinvent the low-end and midrange department store experience. FiveFour Club is more like a web version of a boutique with a subscription model thrown in for good measure. Instead of appealing to customers with the siren song of a personal stylist, FiveFour charges a price of admission in exchange for regular deliveries of its own branded clothing. (There is also a web store, membership not required.)

The aesthetic here is minimal, sporty and young, so fashion-aware that it’s hard to envision who the consumer is. While it’s true we don’t all live in ZIP codes with street wear boutiques, the same person who logs onto FiveFour can log on to eBay. In exchange for my $60 membership fee, I was sent a windbreaker and a tee, both in lackluster shades of brown. On a lanky 19-year-old, they’d look stylish. On anyone else, they look like two garments that cost $30 each.

Wouldn’t I like to be a lanky 19-year-old? Of course. Fashion is about fantasy. Here in reality, FiveFour got my $60 and I’ve got these clothes I’ll never wear. Those few of us who never read Marie Kondo still have those fashionable mistakes lurking in our closets. I’m sort of fond of them, those past selves that never came to be. I’ve spent many hours of my life browsing in stores.

At 21, I admired clothes I couldn’t afford. At 30, I bought them. At 40, I sometimes go simply for the pleasure, of seeing what is new, of learning what counts as beautiful now.

So what, if anything, have we learned? One old lesson, at least. Shopping for clothes is time consuming, it’s tiring, and it can feel like a waste of an autumn afternoon. So you can subscribe to a service that makes your life simpler, although it may come at the expense of expressing who you are. You can also subscribe to the notion that there’s still pleasure in some of life’s chores. In the flesh, you can touch a wool jacket or a cashmere sweater as you imagine who you might be if each belonged to you.

The answer could help green card holders become United States citizens. To become a naturalized citizen, a person has to be a green card holder, submit a 20-page application, be fingerprinted and pass an oral exam that requires deep knowledge of American history. The process can take six months or longer and costs about $700. So when Karen Moore — a nanny from Jamaica who became a permanent resident in 2010 — applied for citizenship in January, she knew she needed help. “I didn’t know anything about New York history. I had been on the Circle Line, but that’s about all I knew,” she said with a laugh referring to the city’s sightseeing cruises. At the suggestion of her employer, Ms. Moore became the first person to sign up for the Citizenship Project, a free class at the New-York Historical Society that helps green card holders prepare for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services naturalization test.

The historical society’s leadership decided to take an active role in helping permanent residents become citizens after President Trump in January called for travel restrictions on Muslims entering the United States. The classes started in July, and the historical society has a goal of helping 750 to 1,000 people prepare for the citizenship exam. The project is a 32-hour interactive program that uses artifacts, documents and art from the museum’s permanent collection and covers all the questions used in the test. “For many of them English is not their first language and so they’re really eager to get any assistance they can to make this test easier,” said Jennifer Schantz, the historical society’s executive vice president and chief operating officer. The historical society’s teaching methods are enhanced by using physical objects. The program is so unique that citizenship and immigration services has invited the museum to host a seminar showing other museums across the country how to establish similar programs. Students spend time at the historical society both in a classroom and also walking through the gallery, observing and discussing the paintings and objects as they pertain to American history.

“We can easily spend 10 or even 20 minutes just looking at one painting,” said Samantha Rijkers, the manager of the Citizenship Project who developed the program’s curriculum and oversees six part-time instructors. So, to prepare for test questions about the Declaration of Independence and Independence Day, students observed the painting “Pulling Down the Statue of King George III, New York City,” by Johannes Adam Simon Ortel. “Some people might say I see a statue, others might make connections to protests that are going on today where people are taking down statues of Confederate soldiers,” Ms. Rijkers said. “What I think is great about our approach is that everyone can figure out the story by themselves just by looking at the painting and talking.” Ms. Rijkers, who is from the Netherlands and moved to New York to get her master’s degree, also is a green card holder who is in the process of gaining citizenship. “My students always make fun of me that I don’t have it yet,” she said. Preparing for the test in a class setting is one thing, but taking it in a personal interview is another. Applicants are asked up to 10 out of a possible 100 questions and must answer six correctly. While the majority of green card holders pass the test, a study in 2012 by the Center for the Study of the American Dream at Xavier University showed that one in three citizens born in the United States fail it. “What we hear a lot is many people have family members who are American citizens and they tell us, ‘Oh, I went home and we talked about this and they had no idea,’ ” Ms. Rijkers said. “We don’t shy away from the difficult chapters in American history.” The classes so far have included people from six different continents and 28 different countries. “The way we learn about history here, we internalize it because you’re able to touch something or you’re able to look at something so it’s not just random information that you force yourself to remember,” said Ya Yun Teng, a digital collections coordinator at the Museum of Chinese in America who is from Taiwan and just completed the class and is waiting to take the citizenship exam. “I’m not too worried about memorizing or studying the test all the time, because all the stories or clues that I experienced during the courses will help me to remember the answers for the test.”",An Artistic Approach to Becoming a U.S. Citizen,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/25/arts/ny-historical-society-citizenship-program.html

Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, I express myself with images.”

To encourage pedestrian traffic, construction began earlier this month on installing additional sidewalks connecting the shopping centers, with completion expected by the end of 2017. “People will be able to park their cars and walk to all the shops in town,” said Susan Chapman, New Fairfield’s First Selectman.

What You’ll Find

The lake communities hug the western edge of Candlewood Lake. One of the oldest, Candlewood Isle, was developed in the 1930s, its narrow streets lined with quaint cottages. Homes and lots are larger in Sail Harbour, built in the 1980s and 1990s farther north on the lake. The most densely populated area is in the town’s southwestern corner, near Ball Pond.

Richard Seman, New Fairfield’s assessor, said the town’s 6,360 residential properties are primarily single-family houses — ranches, split levels, colonials and capes – along with two small 55-plus townhouse complexes. There are no cooperative or rental buildings.

What You’ll Pay

Mr. Neumann cited the price range as indicative of the town’s socioeconomic diversity. “It’s not like Greenwich, where you can’t find anything under $1 million: $300,000 to $500,000 — that’s our sweet spot,” he said. “Those homes get into bidding wars.”

Pricier properties are also selling. “For houses in the $600,000s,” Ms. Finley said, “the beginning of the year was stale, but now people are snapping them up. And the waterfront market has been incredibly strong.” Recent waterfront sales have been between $1 million and $3 million.

Ms. Finley said that on Oct. 13, there were 76 single-family homes on the market, from a two-bedroom, 597-square-foot ranch priced at $115,000 to a six-bedroom, 9,684-square-foot waterfront contemporary listed at $6.9 million. The median sales price for a single-family home during the 12-month period ending Oct. 13 was $330,000, up from $326,250 the previous 12 months.

The Vibe

In addition to Candlewood Lake and Ball Pond, New Fairfield is home to Margerie Lake Reservoir and Squantz Pond State Park, making it a haven for water lovers. There are private beaches and marinas in some of the lake communities, a town beach and marina for residents and a state boat launch.

Those seeking land-based activities can explore Pootatuck State Forest, the 825-acre Great Hollow Nature Preserve and Ecological Research Center and Hidden Valley Nature Center, part of the 516 acres protected by the Candlewood Valley Regional Land Trust.

On 2015-2016 fourth-grade state assessments, 70.7 percent met English Language Arts standards, compared with 55.5 percent statewide; 67.7 percent met mathematics standards, compared with 47.9 percent statewide. Mean SAT scores for the graduating class of 2016 were 531 in critical reading, 527 in mathematics and 526 in writing; statewide equivalents were 500, 500 and 497.

The Commute

New Fairfield residents who drive to work have easy access to Interstate 84. Commuters to Manhattan, 65 miles southwest, can drive about 12 miles into New York to catch Metro-North Railroad’s Harlem line at Southeast, where metered parking is available. Or they can park at one of two park-and-ride lots in New Fairfield and take a HARTransit shuttle to and from Southeast. Rush-hour trains between Southeast and Grand Central Terminal take 80 to 95 minutes; monthly fare is $422.

The History

Two white clapboard houses tucked behind the New Fairfield Senior Center embody bits of the town’s past. Facing demolition, they were moved there in 2007 in an undertaking led by the newly established, volunteer-based Preserve New Fairfield.

One, called the Parsonage, was built as a home in the mid-19th century. In 1903, it was sold to the Congregational Church of New Fairfield and served as the parson’s residence for more than half a century. It was restored and opened to the public earlier this month to commemorate the church’s 275th anniversary.

The Greek Revival Hubbell House, now a museum of early New Fairfield history, dates to the mid-1700s when the Hubbell family lived there, said Linda Decker, a founder of Preserve New Fairfield.","New Fairfield, Conn.: Good Schools and a Lakeside Setting",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/realestate/living-in-new-fairfield-conn.html

We got to his home after lunch and I met his domestic staff and his young children. He took me on a brief tour of the house before he rounded us all up in the screening room to watch the film. He had just produced a similar film of his own, but everyone was raving about this rival version.

I settled in for the film, but about 15 minutes in, Harvey came for me, saying he wanted to show me something. I protested that I wanted to finish the film first, but he insisted I go with him, laying down the law as though I too was one of his children. I did not want another back-and-forth in front of his kids, so I complied and left the room with him. I explained that I really wanted to see the film. He said we’d go back shortly.

Harvey led me into a bedroom — his bedroom — and announced that he wanted to give me a massage. I thought he was joking at first. He was not. For the first time since I met him, I felt unsafe. I panicked a little and thought quickly to offer to give him one instead: It would allow me to be in control physically, to know exactly where his hands were at all times.

Part of our drama school curriculum at Yale included body work, using massage techniques on one another to understand the connection between body, mind and emotion, and so I felt I could rationalize giving him one and keep a semblance of professionalism in spite of the bizarre circumstance. He agreed to this and lay on the bed. I began to massage his back to buy myself time to figure out how to extricate myself from this undesirable situation. Before long he said he wanted to take off his pants. I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable. He got up anyway to do so and I headed for the door, saying that I was not at all comfortable with that. “If we’re not going to watch the film, I really should head back to school,” I said.

I opened the door and stood by the frame. He put his shirt on and again mentioned how stubborn I was. I agreed with an easy laugh, trying to get myself out of the situation safely. I was after all on his premises, and the members of his household, the potential witnesses, were all (strategically, it seems to me now) in a soundproof room.

Earlier Harvey had sent the driver to the store to buy a boxed collection of “The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency,” an HBO show that he had produced. This was the project he thought I would be right for, he said. (I later found out that the show had not been on the air for some time.) As I prepared to leave his home, he presented it to me. He wanted me to check it out and let him know what I thought. He would be in touch about it. I left for New Haven with his driver.

I didn’t quite know how to process the massage incident. I reasoned that it had been inappropriate and uncalled-for, but not overtly sexual. I was entering into a business where the intimate is often professional and so the lines are blurred. I was in an educational program where I was giving massages to my classmates and colleagues every day. Though the incident with Harvey had made me uncomfortable, I was able to explain and justify it to myself, and shelve it as an awkward moment. His offer to me to be a part of the HBO show was a very attractive one and I was excited about it, especially as I would be graduating in another year. I didn’t know how to proceed without jeopardizing my future. But I knew I would not be accepting any more visits to private spaces with Harvey Weinstein.

I decided to invite Harvey to come to a production I was in at school. Perhaps that way he would really see what I had to offer, and he would see my colleagues, too. He accepted the invitation, but the night of the production, he sent a message saying he had been caught up in New York and would be unable to attend. He would make it up to me. So when I received an official invitation to a staged reading of his new Broadway show, “Finding Neverland,” I was not surprised. I was still debating whether I should accept his invitation, and so I responded saying I was not certain that I could make it because of my school schedule. He responded with exactly the words I needed to hear: Come with whomever you want to come with. And so I invited two of my trusted male friends.

We attended the reading, and afterward Harvey invited us all to a restaurant for dinner with his comrades and collaborators. He sat me next to him, and another actress sat across from me. He had my friends sit at a different table. The talk was shop the whole time and Harvey held court with ease. He was charming and funny once more, and I felt confused about the discomfort I had previously experienced. I looked at the actress who I was informed had just worked with him on a project, searching her face for any sort of indication that she too had been made to feel uncomfortable by this powerful man, but of course I saw nothing. We did not stay very long because we had to catch a train back to New Haven. My friends had been equally charmed by Harvey. He knew when to turn it on if he wanted something. He was definitely a bully, but he could be really charming, which was disarming and confusing. I left feeling that perhaps he had learned my boundaries and was going to respect them.

A couple of months later, I received an email from Harvey, inviting me again to New York for a screening of “W.E.” After the screening, we would have drinks in TriBeCa. I then received a phone call from one of his male assistants to arrange my transportation. Feeling more confident about the new sense of boundaries that we had established in our last meeting, I attended the screening on my own this time. Afterward, as planned, his male assistant arranged for me to get to the Tribeca Grill, where Harvey would be joining us. I met a female assistant when I arrived there. I was expecting that it would be a group of us, as it had been for the reading, but she informed me it would just be Mr. Weinstein. She would sit with me until he arrived. She seemed on edge, but I could only imagine how stressful it was to work for a man who had so much going on.

Harvey arrived and the assistant immediately disappeared. We ordered drinks and starters. Again he was offended by my nonalcoholic beverage choice but he didn’t fight me on it as hard. Before the starters arrived, he announced: “Let’s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal.” I was stunned. I told him I preferred to eat in the restaurant. He told me not to be so naïve. If I wanted to be an actress, then I had to be willing to do this sort of thing. He said he had dated Famous Actress X and Y and look where that had gotten them.

I was silent for a while before I mustered up the courage to politely decline his offer. “You have no idea what you are passing up,” he said. “With all due respect, I would not be able to sleep at night if I did what you are asking, so I must pass,” I replied.

His whole demeanor changed at that point. “Then I guess we are two ships passing in the night.” I had never heard that saying before, so I remember asking him what it meant. “It means just that,” he said. “We are two ships going in two different directions.”

“Yes, I guess we are.”

“So we are done here,” he said. “You can leave.”

We got up, having not eaten anything, and he led me out of the restaurant. My heart was beating very fast. A cab was hailed for me. I said I would take the subway (I could not afford a cab at the time), but he handed me some money and told me not to be silly, take the cab. Before I got in, I needed to make sure that I had not awakened a beast that would go on to ruin my name and destroy my chances in the business even before I got there.

The Weinstein Investigation

“I just want to know that we are good,” I said.

“I don’t know about your career, but you’ll be fine,” he said. It felt like both a threat and a reassurance at the same time; of what, I couldn’t be sure.

I did not see Harvey again until September 2013 when I was in Toronto for the premiere of “12 Years a Slave,” the first feature film I was in. At an after-party, he found me and evicted whoever was sitting next to me to sit beside me. He said he couldn’t believe how fast I had gotten to where I was, and that he had treated me so badly in the past. He was ashamed of his actions and he promised to respect me moving forward. I said thank you and left it at that. But I made a quiet promise to myself to never ever work with Harvey Weinstein.

Not long after I won the Academy Award in 2014, I received an offer to play a role in one of the Weinstein Company’s forthcoming films. I knew I would not do it simply because it was the Weinstein Company, but I did not feel comfortable telling this to anybody. I turned down the role, but Harvey would not take no for an answer. While at Cannes, he insisted on meeting with me in person. I agreed to do it only because my agent would be present. In the meeting, he was honest about intending to persuade me to do his movie. I told him I simply did not feel it was a role I needed to play. He said he was open to making it bigger, more significant, maybe they could add a love scene. He said if I did this one for him, he would do another one for me — basically guaranteeing backing a star-vehicle film for me. I ran out of ways of politely saying no and so did my agent. I was so exasperated by the end that I just kept quiet. Harvey finally accepted my position and expressed that he still wanted to work with me at some point. “Thank you, I hope so,” I lied.

And that was the last of my personal encounters with Harvey Weinstein. I share all of this now because I know now what I did not know then. I was part of a growing community of women who were secretly dealing with harassment by Harvey Weinstein. But I also did not know that there was a world in which anybody would care about my experience with him. You see, I was entering into a community that Harvey Weinstein had been in, and even shaped, long before I got there. He was one of the first people I met in the industry, and he told me, “This is the way it is.” And wherever I looked, everyone seemed to be bracing themselves and dealing with him, unchallenged. I did not know that things could change. I did not know that anybody wanted things to change. So my survival plan was to avoid Harvey and men like him at all costs, and I did not know that I had allies in this.

Fortunately for me, I have not dealt with any such incidents in the business since. And I think it is because all the projects I have been a part of have had women in positions of power, along with men who are feminists in their own right who have not abused their power. What I am most interested in now is combating the shame we go through that keeps us isolated and allows for harm to continue to be done. I wish I had known that there were women in the business I could have talked to. I wish I had known that there were ears to hear me. That justice could be served. There is clearly power in numbers. I thank the women who have spoken up and given me the strength to revisit this unfortunate moment in my past.

Our business is complicated because intimacy is part and parcel of our profession; as actors we are paid to do very intimate things in public. That’s why someone can have the audacity to invite you to their home or hotel and you show up. Precisely because of this we must stay vigilant and ensure that the professional intimacy is not abused. I hope we are in a pivotal moment where a sisterhood — and brotherhood of allies — is being formed in our industry. I hope we can form a community where a woman can speak up about abuse and not suffer another abuse by not being believed and instead being ridiculed. That’s why we don’t speak up — for fear of suffering twice, and for fear of being labeled and characterized by our moment of powerlessness. Though we may have endured powerlessness at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, by speaking up, speaking out and speaking together, we regain that power. And we hopefully ensure that this kind of rampant predatory behavior as an accepted feature of our industry dies here and now.

Now that we are speaking, let us never shut up about this kind of thing. I speak up to make certain that this is not the kind of misconduct that deserves a second chance.

So he has some human feelings after all.

They’re human beings — human beings that took an ugly path, but still human beings.

The question I think a lot of people have is: Is ISIS finished? Are we seeing the end of them?

I think, in some ways, yes. The ISIS prisoners we talked to said they had been ordered by their leaders to surrender themselves and to escape. They were also very bitter and their morale was at a real low point. They felt that they had been betrayed by ISIS leadership, that their leaders were just saving themselves and that the whole organization was finished. And it’s true that they have basically lost all their important territory.

But, they started out as an underground organization, and there’s every reason to believe that they’ll continue in that capacity. They still have a lot of ability to wreak havoc in that form.

Why are there so few news organizations in Iraq and Syria? Did you see reporters from other organizations there?

It was a fairly large media presence. But it’s expensive to cover wars — especially to do it in a conscientious way, in which you take a lot of precautions. A freelancer who, for instance, went to Kurdistan would find himself facing fixer/translator fees of $500 a day typically. A driver would cost maybe $200 a day. And if you’re going for anybody on assignment they should be providing you with some sort of security. And that’s very expensive. That can be as much as $1,000 a day from some companies.

Do you travel with armed guards?

We don’t usually. In general, the principle that most journalists follow is that the lower your profile, the safer you are. In Afghanistan, where I work a lot, there are typically embassies and international organizations that move around in armored car convoys. We never do that because when you move like that, you’re making yourself a target. You can protect yourself against gunshots, but gunshots are not what we’re worried about these days. It’s bombs. Roadside bombs. And no amount of armor is going to protect you much against those.

When you’re in a place like Iraq, in a war zone for weeks at a time, is there stuff that you miss?

Nowadays we can pretty much get everything everywhere. Like in Kurdistan, one night a couple of us were sitting around and said “Let’s go to the movies.” So we went to the mall with a multiplex with 15 screens and we watched a movie. “The Hitman’s Bodyguard.”",A Times Correspondent Describes Meeting ISIS Militants in Iraq,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/reader-center/a-times-correspondent-describes-meeting-isis-militants-in-iraq.html

More than anything, Mr. Morris’s concept highlights the ecstatic and improvisatory style of the music.","Hajibeyli’s opera, the basis of Mr. Morris’s staging, is considered the first opera of the Middle Eastern world, and is a product of the internationalism of its time. “Hajibeyli had this mega-project in mind, to integrate his nation into the rest of the world while keeping its heritage,” Aida Huseynova, a musicologist involved in the Silk Road adaptation of the work, explained via Skype.

You could see it as an early example of multiculturalism. It was composed in Baku — the capital of Azerbaijan, then under Russian control — in 1908, a time of prosperity and foreign influence, the result of an oil rush. And it quickly became a classic — to this day it is performed yearly at the Baku opera house.

The composition is a highly original hybrid of the usual operatic elements (orchestral passages, choruses and recitatives) with a native Azerbaijani style of sung storytelling, known as mugham, characterized by long passages of structured improvisation and ornamentation. The orchestration uses Western instruments alongside local ones like the tar (a plucked stringed instrument) and the kamancheh (a bowed one). For his staging, Mr. Morris drew upon a 2007 adaptation of the work created for the Silk Road Ensemble, which reduced the opera to less than an hour from three, distilling the story to its essence and shrinking the musical ensemble from several dozen to 10.

In Mr. Morris’s version, which had its premiere at Cal Performances in Berkeley, Calif., last fall, the two singers sit on cushions on a platform at the center of the stage while the musicians surround them in a semicircle. “This is how court poetry was performed in the 12th century,” explained Fatemeh Shams, a University of Pennsylvania professor and specialist in Persian poetry, “with minstrels and poets performing together.”

The singers don’t move or act, they just sing — but their voices are at the heart of the performance. Alim Qasimov, who interprets Majnun, is a silver-voiced powerhouse and a riveting performer. “He’s a giant star!” exclaimed Mr. Morris. “People at the airport in Baku push Yo-Yo Ma out of the way to get to him.” Layla is sung by the equally distinguished Fargana Qasimova, his daughter.

While they sing, the dancers interpret the story through movement. Four pairs represent the lovers at different stages. (This choice further depersonalizes their love. They represent Layla and Majnun and all lovers — and beyond that, love itself.) Behind them rises a striking backdrop of red and green brush strokes, an enlarged version of a painting by Howard Hodgkin entitled “Love and Death.” They dance, in red and blue Azerbajani-inspired costumes, on the floor in front of the singers and along platforms lining three sides of the stage.

“I did it that way because it reflects the style of performance from that region of the world,” Mr. Morris said. (Mugham was traditionally performed in small gatherings at court or in upper-class homes.) “And I wanted it to be a group of people doing something together.”

Because the singers are improvising (within limits), the dancers have learned to follow the Azerbaijani text and inflections of the voice so that they can adapt to the length of each mugham “aria” on any particular night; the singers and dancers take cues from each other.

Some of the dancing is more abstract, others clearly gestural, meant to evoke specific situations (and even small details like a description of a flickering flame). Mr. Morris incorporated elements of Azerbaijani dance into his personal dance vocabulary, things like strong, rhythmic footwork and a very specific way of holding the hands, different for men and women. But the dancing also reflects more general Middle Eastern motifs like Sufi whirling.

More than anything, Mr. Morris’s concept highlights the ecstatic and improvisatory style of the music. “That kind of singing is about what’s being spun out at that moment,” he said, “and with people who are great at that, like South Indian musicians and great jazz players and these great mugham singers, there’s nothing like it.”","Love, Ecstasy, Infinity: Mark Morris’s ‘Layla and Majnun’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/arts/dance/mark-morris-layla-and-majnun.html

Even as it faced new scrutiny in Europe, Volkswagen moved a step closer to putting the emissions scandal behind it in the United States, as the automaker received approval from federal and California regulators for its proposed repairs to reduce harmful emissions from 38,000 diesel-powered sport utility vehicles.

The approval, issued jointly on Friday by the Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board and disclosed Monday, will spare Volkswagen from the expense of buying back the affected models.

Volkswagen is awaiting approval for proposed repairs to passenger cars with the same engine. Last year, it reached a separate settlement requiring it to buy back 475,000 vehicles with 2.0-liter engines that emit unsafe levels of pollutants.

That settlement was part of about $25 billion in fines and other costs that Volkswagen has agreed to pay to address claims brought by consumers, regulators and states in connection with the company’s scheme to evade federal emissions rules with so-called defeat devices in diesel vehicles.

Parents sometimes worry that talking about their past use, or talking about illegal substances at all, might be taken as granting permission to experiment with drugs. If this is a concern, it can be addressed head on: “I did try pot, but I don’t want you to hear that as me saying that it’s O.K. for you. I want you to be smarter about it than I was.”

Other adults might welcome the opportunity to articulate the conditions under which they would give their blessing. For instance, the mother of a teenager in my practice said that she wouldn’t mind if her son tried marijuana, but only once he was in college, and only by smoking the supply of an uncle who grows his own. For parents who have no objections to cannabis use, questions about the past can open the door to discussions of what has changed in recent years, such as the growing availability of edible and concentrated forms of marijuana, and what hasn’t: recreational use of it is still illegal for minors in the United States.

Research consistently shows that adolescents take their parents’ guidance to heart even if they don’t always indicate as much. Regardless of the parent’s stance on marijuana use, it might be worth adding, “I’m asking you to be careful because I don’t want you to get hurt or find yourself on a path that you don’t mean to be on.”

The results of the same recent study on direct conversations about drugs suggest that personal or vicarious accounts of the downsides of substance use are especially compelling for teenagers. A parent who has a lot of stories to share might say, “Your grandparents were not paying attention when I was growing up and I got myself into situations that I should have never been in. When I became a parent I knew I wanted to do it differently. Let’s keep talking about this because I did enough learning for both of us.”

Some teenagers who ask about their parents’ past use are actually seeking the opposite of permission to try marijuana. They’re looking for reassurance that it’s O.K. not to. As one of my adolescent clients put it, “You can worry that you’re missing out on something — that it’s part of the ‘high school experience’ that a teenager is supposed to have.”

Mr. Hice addressed this concern by encouraging his son to see if he could have fun without using drugs and to “think about the pitfalls, your health, getting caught, getting expelled.” He also told his son that he watched his fraternity brothers closely both when they were high and also on the next day. From there Mr. Hice explained that, “it just didn’t look like the benefits outweighed the risks.”

Parents won’t always know what’s behind their teenager’s sudden interest in their personal choices and responding with either a detailed confessional or an abrupt, “That’s none of your business,” will probably make it harder to find out.

And adults who aren’t prepared to answer the opening question can still keep the lines of communication open, so long as “I’m not sure I’m ready to have this conversation” gently gives way to “but how come you’re asking?”","When Your Teenager Asks, ‘Did You Smoke Weed?’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/well/family/when-your-teenager-asks-did-you-smoke-weed.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

• In Washington, President Trump continued his attacks on Jeff Flake and Bob Corker, two of his harshest Republican critics, who have said they will not run for re-election to the Senate.

With divisions roiling the Republicans, the prospect of a once-in-a-generation bill to cut taxes increasingly appears to be the last, best hope for the party to find some common ground.

But they are unifying in condemnation after revelations that Hillary Clinton’s campaign helped finance a dossier of salacious claims about Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia.

“Do I look like a gangster? I’m a businessman!”

Such is life in the world of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, an installment in the long-running video game series that was originally released 13 years ago today.

The Grand Theft Auto games, an action-adventure series in which players pursue a life of crime, has stretched over 20 years and more than a dozen titles.

With $250 million in sales, it’s one of the most successful franchises in video game history, falling behind only famous names like Mario and Pokémon.

The games are known for their nonlinear, open-world style, which allows players to cause random mayhem in fictionalized versions of U.S. cities.

As such, the series has long been accused of glamorizing violence. (In 2009, Guinness World Records labeled it the most controversial video game series ever, citing more than 4,000 news articles.)

Even so, the series has been a critical success — several titles are among the most well-reviewed games of all time — and celebrated for its soundtracks, voice acting and the sly sense of humor it applies to American culture.

As one character notes, guns blazing, “Ain’t the American dream grand!”

At the time that Democrats began paying for the research, Mr. Trump was in the process of clinching the Republican presidential nomination, and Ms. Clinton’s allies were scrambling to figure out how to run against a candidate who had already weathered attacks from Republican rivals about his shifting policy positions, his character and his business record.

Fusion GPS hired Christopher Steele, a respected former British spy with extensive experience in Russia, to conduct research into any possible connections between Mr. Trump, his businesses, campaign team and Russia.

Mr. Steele produced a series of memos that alleged a broad conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the 2016 election on behalf of Mr. Trump. The memos also contained unsubstantiated accounts of encounters between Mr. Trump and Russian prostitutes, and real estate deals that were intended as bribes.

The contents of the memos circulated in Washington in late 2016, and were briefed to Mr. Trump by senior American intelligence officials during the presidential transition. The memos, which became known as the “Steele Dossier,” were made public by Buzzfeed — sparking an ongoing debate about their accuracy and about who funded the research.

Fusion GPS was started by three former Wall Street Journal employees. The firm worked directly with Perkins Coie and its lead election lawyer, Marc Elias, according to the law firm spokesperson, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information about confidential business relationships. The law firm’s payments to Fusion GPS for the Russia research ended just before Election Day, the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said that neither the Clinton campaign, nor the D.N.C., was aware that Fusion GPS had been hired to conduct the research.

Earlier this year, Mr. Elias had denied that he had possessed the dossier before the election.

Anita Dunn, a veteran Democratic operative working with Perkins Coie, said on Tuesday that Mr. Elias “was certainly familiar with some of, but not all, of the information” in the dossier. But, she said “he didn’t have and hadn’t seen the full document, nor was he involved in pitching it to reporters.” And Mr. Elias “was not at liberty to confirm Perkins Coie as the client at that point,” Ms. Dunn said.

Brian Fallon, who served as a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, on Tuesday wrote on Twitter that he did not know that Mr. Steele had been working on behalf of the Clinton campaign before the election.

“If I had, I would have volunteered to go to Europe and try to help him,” Mr. Fallon wrote.

A lawyer and spokeswoman for Fusion GPS did not respond to requests for comment.

A spokeswoman for the D.N.C. sought to distance the national party from the work, noting that the party’s chairman, Tom Perez, was elected only after last year’s election. He and his leadership team “were not involved in any decision-making regarding Fusion GPS, nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization,” said Xochitl Hinojosa, the D.N.C. spokeswoman.

The work by Fusion GPS on the dossier has come under scrutiny from congressional investigators, who have questioned one of its founders and subpoenaed its banking records to try to determine who funded the research.

Fusion GPS is fighting the subpoena in federal court, and Mr. Gehringer’s letter was produced in connection with that legal case.

In the letter, Mr. Gehringer praised Fusion GPS for its “efforts to fulfill your obligation to maintain client confidentiality. In the circumstances, however, we believe it is appropriate to release Fusion GPS from this obligation as it relates to the identity of Perkins Coie.”

Mr. Gehringer added that, “given the interest in this issue, we believe it would be appropriate for all parties who hired Fusion GPS in connection with the 2016 presidential campaign to release Fusion GPS from this obligation as well.”",Clinton Campaign and Democratic Party Helped Pay for Russia Trump Dossier,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/clinton-dnc-russia-dossier.html

Mr. Flake’s private polling had steadily become worse this year as he intensified his criticism of Mr. Trump.
To many conservatives who support Mr. Trump, Mr. Flake was an especially desirable target.
Mr. Trump himself encouraged a primary challenge to Mr. Flake, calling him “a non-factor” and “WEAK on borders,” while lauding Ms. Ward on Twitter.","“It is often said that children are watching,” he said. “Well, they are. And what are we going to do about that? When the next generation asks us, ‘Why didn’t you do something? Why didn’t you speak up?’ What are we going to say?”

Without mentioning Mr. Trump by name, Mr. Flake, 54, took direct aim at the president’s policies, notably his isolationist tendencies, but also his behavior and that of his aides. In his time in Washington, Mr. Flake embodied an old-line conservatism. He avidly pitched smaller government, spending cuts and an end to home-district pork-barrel projects, but also supported free trade, engagement with the world and an openness to immigration.

Those positions stood in marked contrast to Mr. Trump’s inward-looking, anti-immigration nationalism. The senator had already touched on such themes in a book he published in August, “Conscience of a Conservative,” that was highly critical of the president. In his speech, he was at turns somber and passionate.

“We must stop pretending that the degradation of our politics and the conduct of some in our executive branch are normal,” Mr. Flake said. “They are not normal. Reckless, outrageous and undignified behavior has become excused and countenanced as telling it like it is when it is actually just reckless, outrageous and undignified. And when such behavior emanates from the top of our government, it is something else. It is dangerous to a democracy.”

As he spoke, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, Mr. McCain and Mr. Corker sat listening on the Senate floor. Mr. Corker had jousted with the president only hours before.

“Isn’t it sad that lightweight Senator Bob Corker, who couldn’t get re-elected in the Great State of Tennessee, will now fight Tax Cuts plus!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning, fearing that Mr. Corker’s vow to oppose any tax plan that increases the federal debt could imperil his tax push.

Mr. Corker snapped back, “Same untruths from an utterly untruthful president.”

“I don’t know why he lowers himself to such a low, low standard and is debasing our country,” Mr. Corker said in a CNN interview, suggesting that he would soon convene hearings to examine the ways Mr. Trump “purposely has been breaking down relationships around the world.”

“It’s unfortunate that our nation finds itself in this place,” he added.

After the speech, Mr. McConnell praised Mr. Flake and said he regretted the senator’s decision to leave. “We have just witnessed a speech from a very fine man, a man who clearly brings high principles to the office every day,” the leader said.

But privately, some Republicans were growing angry at the displays of disunity from Senators Flake and Corker as the party was trying to come together to pass a major overhaul of the tax code. Only minutes before Mr. Flake’s address, the president had been in the Capitol for lunch with Senate Republicans and a discussion about tax reform.

Read Jeff Flake’s Speech

The announcement did please Republican officials in Arizona and Washington, who believe that they now have a better chance at retaining the seat.

Mr. Flake’s private polling had steadily become worse this year as he intensified his criticism of Mr. Trump. His firm stand against the president had alienated Republican voters, but his long, conservative track record dissuaded Democratic voters in the state from coming to his side. One poll showed he had just an 18 percent approval rating among Arizona residents, and a survey that the senator conducted last month led some of his own allies to conclude that he could not win a Republican primary, according to multiple officials directly familiar with the situation in the weeks leading up to Tuesday’s speech.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said that she had not spoken with Mr. Trump about the senator’s decision but that she was not lamenting the announcement.

“Based on previous statements and certainly based on the lack of support that he has from the people of Arizona, it’s probably a good move,” she said.

She said history would remember Mr. Trump for his achievements and the strong economy that he was presiding over, “not some petty comments from Senator Corker and Senator Flake.”

At home in Arizona, Mr. Flake was facing threats from both the right and the left. His main primary challenger, Kelli Ward, an osteopathic physician and a former state senator who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. McCain last year, kicked off her campaign last week with two conservative luminaries — Laura Ingraham, the radio host, and Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist — at her side.

“Steve Bannon adds another scalp to his collection,” said Andy Surabian, a senior adviser to the Great America Alliance, a Bannon-aligned group that has endorsed Ms. Ward. “This is a direct result of the political pressure put on Jeff Flake over the last several months.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

On Tuesday, Breitbart News, the website that Mr. Bannon oversees, reported his reaction to Mr. Flake’s announcement as defiant: “Our movement will defeat you in primaries or force you to retire.”

Now, a race that had been expected to fall along familiar establishment-versus-insurgent lines, with Mr. Flake pitted against Ms. Ward, has been blown wide open. Mainstream Republicans believe that Ms. Ward will be overwhelmed by a flood of other candidates. Representative Paul Gosar, a conservative firebrand, and former Gov. Jan Brewer, for example, could enter the race.

But there is considerable uncertainty among establishment Republicans, too. Most party leaders suggest Representative Martha McSally, a former Air Force pilot, would be their most formidable contender to take on Representative Kyrsten Sinema, the likely Democratic nominee. But some Republicans privately say the safer course is for Ms. McSally to wait for the ailing Mr. McCain to vacate the seat and eventually ascend to the Senate via appointment.

To many conservatives who support Mr. Trump, Mr. Flake was an especially desirable target. Few in the Senate had spoken more candidly about their misgivings with Mr. Trump, first as a candidate and then as president. He had particularly elicited conservatives’ ire with his book, in which he equated Republicans’ acceptance of Mr. Trump as their nominee to a Faustian bargain.

Mr. Trump himself encouraged a primary challenge to Mr. Flake, calling him “a non-factor” and “WEAK on borders,” while lauding Ms. Ward on Twitter.

What Mr. Flake’s retirement made clear, though, was something potentially much more significant than an individual senator’s standing in the angry and restless conservative movement. It suggested that under Mr. Trump, the Republican Party has little room for voices that dissent from the president’s crass style of politics and his polarizing agenda.

Mr. Flake’s decision to step down was, in a sense, a tacit admission that crossing the president had put him in political peril. But in an interview in Phoenix this month, he said he had no regrets and always knew that crossing the president would be dangerous politically. He reiterated that sentiment on the Senate floor on Tuesday.

“We’re not here to simply mark time,” the senator said. “Sustained incumbency is certainly not the point of seeking office, and there are times when we must risk our careers in favor of our principles. Now is such a time.”","Jeff Flake, a Fierce Trump Critic, Will Not Seek Re-election for Senate",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/jeff-flake-arizona.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

In reality, the biggest enemy of modern batteries is temperature. The cooler you can keep your battery, either while charging it or while it’s in use, the more you can prolong its life.

Myth 3: More megapixels mean better cameras

When small, portable point-and-shoot cameras took off and larger, digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras became more affordable, there was a brief rush among manufacturers to push out models with greater numbers of “megapixels,” the unit of capacity used to define how much information a digital camera’s sensor can capture. Unfortunately, because those numbers dazzled spec-hungry consumers and could be used to market cameras, shoppers began to assume that more megapixels meant you were buying a better camera. And you can’t really blame them — marketers latched on to the idea, and even now, in modern smartphones, the first spec anyone mentions about the built-in camera is the megapixels.

All of this led to the “megapixel myth,” which has persisted for almost a decade. While most budding photographers understand that more isn’t always better in a camera, shoppers looking for a good smartphone camera, and the phone manufacturers themselves, haven’t seemed to learn the lesson.

Megapixels still count — they do tell you how powerful a camera’s sensor is, which is important for professionals or anyone who needs to print out physical photographs (when translated to paper more pixels per inch can mean more detailed prints), but it doesn’t necessarily tell you how good the photos taken by that camera will be.

To find that out, look past the specs (again!) and to reviews. Even better, look for examples of photos taken with a certain phone or camera and compare them to those from other popular models — or even the one you already have. Look for reviews that mention a camera’s lowlight performance and, perhaps most important, get familiar with your camera’s options. The best photos come from someone who knows how to tweak the settings for the perfect shot.

Myth 4: “Planned obsolescence” is why your phone slows down right before a new model comes out

It happens every year or so: Just before the latest and greatest phone comes out, your phone suddenly starts running slowly. Maybe it starts freezing, or the apps you use get sluggish. Either way, if you can relate, you can probably also understand the common feeling that this is all a plan by tech companies to force you into upgrading — a trick called “planned obsolescence.” While that’s a real problem in some specific cases, assuming it’s the reason everyone’s old phones get slow before new ones are announced is, well, a bit of an oversimplification.

In reality, it’s not a conspiracy, and it’s not some corporate trick to force you into the newest tech, or trap you on the consumerist treadmill. It’s just a side effect of an ever-evolving and ever-improving industry. As those new phones are released, they come with more memory, better screens, faster processors and other specs that, in general, you shouldn’t care about — unless developers start building their apps around them. When they do, they optimize their apps for the newer devices, leaving your older ones in the dust.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

So as apps are updated to make use of all of the features on those new devices, they seem to slow down on older phones. And unless the developers care enough to make sure your older phones are properly supported, the problem only gets worse over time. The annoying end result may be the same, but you can at least rest comfortably knowing there’s no massive conspiracy (here, anyway) to make you keep spending money.

Myth 5: Extended warranty plans are worth your money

It’s tough to buy anything at this point without being offered an extended warranty. Whether you’re shopping online or in a brick-and-mortar store, retailers often dangle third-party “protection programs” and “service plans” in front of you, promising that, for a few extra bucks, they’ll replace or repair your purchase if damaged over the next few years. The problem with these offers is that they’re almost always unnecessary — or worse than what you could get otherwise with a little savvy shopping.

In many cases, the pricey extended warranty runs right alongside the existing manufacturer’s warranty, which means you may be paying twice for coverage the phone’s maker already provides. So be sure to research the warranty that comes with your device. Similarly, if you use a credit card, you may even have extended warranty protection through the card’s issuer — check with that company before you add the pricey phone to your cart.

Finally, consider how much the extended warranty costs versus the actual total of the gadget you’re buying. You may be better off taking the money you would have used on the warranty plan and stashing it in a savings account as a “rainy day fund.” Then, if you do need to pay for a repair or replacement, you can use your own cash instead of having to jump through the hoops of getting service from the company managing the protection program.",Five Tech Myths People Still Believe,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/smarter-living/five-tech-myths-people-still-believe.html

It was a jarring transition in a day of political shocks.

Mr. Flake, who has been a persistent Trump foe since 2016, never mentioned Mr. Trump by name in his remarks. But there was no doubt who he was talking about when he pointed to the “indecency of our discourse” and the “coarseness of our leadership,” and suggested his beloved Republican Party was being complicit in an “alarming and dangerous state of affairs.”

“We must never regard as normal the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals, we must never meekly accept the daily sundering of our country,” Mr. Flake said.

But Mr. Corker, Mr. Flake and Mr. McCain remain the outliers. Mr. Corker’s exceedingly harsh assessment of Mr. Trump — delivered in a series of morning TV interviews in a reasonable, studied tone — and Mr. Flake’s announcement and damning speech bookended what was to be the initial centerpiece of a day on Capitol Hill intended to get lawmakers and the president on the same page with a difficult tax debate looming.

Mr. McConnell left his lunch with Mr. Trump and members of the caucus to emphasize the issues that bind congressional Republicans to Mr. Trump and play down the divisions underscored by Mr. Flake and Mr. Corker.

“There’s a lot of noise out there,” said Mr. McConnell, who made clear what the interests of the party are. “Tax reform is what we are about.”

Photo

That statement defined the reluctance of other congressional Republicans to challenge Mr. Trump too directly. They have been willing to look past some actions and pronouncements by Mr. Trump that they consider beneath a president in hopes of pushing into law some of their long-sought goals, the most important of which are tax cuts. And with no substantial legislative achievements so far, the party is all in on a tax overhaul, recognizing that failure to deliver one will be a political disaster. That necessity ties them tightly to Mr. Trump, at least for now.

To be sure, there are Republicans in both the Senate and the House who are fully committed to the president and reject the views expressed by Mr. Flake or Mr. Bush, who recently expressed remorse about political “discourse degraded by casual cruelty” — an obvious reference to the Trump era in Washington.

But many others see Mr. Trump more as a means to an end, a way to enact their agenda since the president, as Mr. McConnell is fond of saying, is the only American who can sign a bill into law.

Mr. Flake’s remarks were a warning against that kind of thinking, the idea that some accomplishments — if they ever come — could compensate for the continuing upheaval and discord emanating from Washington and somehow reset the nation’s course.

“With respect and humility,” he said, “I must say that we have fooled ourselves for long enough that a pivot to governing is right around the corner, a return to civility and stability right behind it.”

Mr. Flake and Mr. Corker, along with Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain, represent significant cracks in the Republican wall of support and deference to the president despite widespread misgivings within the party. But they have nothing to lose politically. What is uncertain at this stage is whether Republicans with more at stake are going to join them in tearing down that wall.","Another Republican Call to Arms, but Who Will Answer?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/republican-party-flake-mccain-corker-bush-trump.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Mr. Larison addresses Ross Douthat’s column in The New York Times urging Mr. Trump’s critics to stand and fight. The problem with this argument, according to Mr. Larison, is that most of the president’s critics want to stand and fight for “the same bankrupt Bush-era agenda that did so much to bring them to their current position.” Writing for the noninterventionist American Conservative, Mr. Larison condemns a Republican party divided between “hawks and ultra-hawks.” “This is not a party that is interested in rethinking assumptions or learning from catastrophic errors,” he concludes.

Jonah Goldberg in National Review:

“Flake and Corker — flawed as they may be — have simply been responding to the drama machine in the Oval Office. That is where all the drama is coming from.”

Hugh Hewitt, a conservative radio host who has largely been supportive of the president, responded to the criticisms from Senators Bob Corker and Jeff Flake by emphasizing that they would not have gotten re-elected in this political climate. He then calls on everyone to stop the “drama.”

That’s at least how Mr. Goldberg summarizes Mr. Hewitt’s position. Mr. Goldberg takes issue with this argument, writing that “to excoriate Flake and Corker for their drama while remaining silent about Trump’s is the very definition of enabling.”

Mr. Hewitt, in turn, replied to Mr. Goldberg on Twitter, writing that Mr. Flake is fundamentally “out of step” with Arizona politics. But he is confident that there are mainstream conservatives in that state who will run and can win. Read more »

While it may be tempting for progressives to view the Republican intraparty fighting “with a sense of amusement, if not outright glee,” Ms. Stan warns that any celebrations from the left are premature.

Finally, From the Center

Laurie Roberts in The Arizona Republic:



“Two people who couldn’t have been happy with Flake’s announcement: Republican Kelli Ward and Democrat Kyrsten Sinema.”

How will Mr. Flake’s decision not to seek another term affect the race in Arizona? According to Ms. Roberts, not having Mr. Flake as a primary opponent is bad news for the Bannon-backed candidate, Kelli Ward, whose “entire campaign was ‘I’m not Sanctuary Senator Jeff Flake.’” Now, Ms. Ward will probably be challenged by an establishment Republican with a better shot to win than Mr. Flake did. It is also bad news for the Democratic candidate, Kyrsten Sinema, who was hoping to run against Ms. Ward in the general election. The only thing for certain, writes Ms. Roberts, is that Joe Arpaio, the former Maricopa County sheriff, will tease that he is considering a run but won’t ultimately pull the trigger. Read more »

Leonid Bershidsky in Bloomberg:



“In Europe, politicians who feel their party has been hijacked generally go further, sometimes as far as setting up a splinter party.”

News of Mr. Flake’s speech made it into the international news cycle, explains Mr. Bershidsky, where Europeans were left “scratching their heads at what amounted to a rancorous admission of defeat where his rhetoric would have suggested he should fight on.” Sometimes, argues Mr. Bershidsky, a two-party system merely “suppresses representation and makes people cling to increasingly meaningless political brands.” There is nothing wrong with a little “political innovation” when it becomes clear that the traditional dualism isn’t working anymore. However, he is skeptical that Mr. Flake is the type of “responsible leader” to form a new, strong party. Read more »

For Mr. Wittes, “the salient fact is that neither Flake nor Corker felt able to be true to themselves without taking the step of not having to face Republican voters again.” He admires these men who have “manufacture” the conditions in which they could speak the truth.

The Australian Defense Force said through a spokesman that it had asked Facebook to take the page down, and that it was investigating whether any service members had engaged in unlawful or inappropriate use of social media.

The episode was the latest embarrassment for the military, one of Australia’s most culturally conservative institutions, over what critics say is a persistent culture of misogyny, despite a public campaign by its leadership aimed at changing attitudes toward women.

Ben Wadham, an associate professor in sociology at Flinders University in Adelaide and an army veteran, said that as distressing as the content of the page was, he was not surprised that it was followed by Australian service members.

“This is what these boys are about,” said Professor Wadham, who has studied misogyny in militaries globally. “There’s nothing extraordinary about this stuff.”

Like other major militaries in recent years, the Australian Defense Force has seen numerous scandals over the mistreatment of women in its ranks. In 2011, an Australian Defense Force Academy member secretly filmed himself having sex with a female cadet, sending live video of the act to another male soldier over Skype.

Top commanders have repeatedly pledged to root out sexism in the military. In 2013, Gen. David Morrison, then the head of the army, posted a widely viewed video online in which he bluntly told soldiers who did not respect women to “get out” and “find something else to do with your life.”

But Professor Wadham said that despite such efforts at the top, he had seen little determination to change misogynist attitudes in the lower ranks. “If the A.D.F. wants to be serious about protecting and upholding the principles of a liberal democracy, then it has to go to the core of the source of its own violence,” he said.

Professor Wadham said he had come out of the army “with a lot of questions about military culture.”

“Despite the scandals that occurred quite regularly over the past 40 years, showing the misogyny and racism and queerphobia,” he said, “at the base of the Australian military, and I daresay most militaries, is a violent and oppressive core.”

Professor Wadham was previously involved in exposing another Facebook group, called RAR Buddies, which posted sexist and racist content. He said that throughout his years of research into military culture in Australia, he has received hostile anonymous phone calls and death threats, and his home has been broken into.

Asked whether he expected a stronger response to this episode, given that sexual harassment and abuse have been in the public eye since the Harvey Weinstein scandal in Hollywood, Professor Wadham was pessimistic.

“Not any more than usual,” he said. “I feel like in the A.D.F., there’s been a massive backlash against the gains that were made between 2011 and 2015, during its short experiment with gender equity.

Feeling anxious, Ms. Ramirez started smoking up to two packs a day. “I used to wake up smoking cigarettes,” she recalled. “Smoking made me calm.”

Ms. Ramirez had also experienced a long bout of grief. In one year, she had buried several close relatives who had contracted HIV from infected needles.“There were so many funerals,” she said. She lost five of her siblings in the space of a few years.

Ms. Ramirez was also a marijuana smoker, but she began increasingly using the drug by herself, multiple times a day. “I used to have to do it just to move around, cook, clean, to do whatever it was I wanted to do,” she said.

It took doctors two years to find a prescription that eased her schizophrenia symptoms without drastic side effects. During this time, she gained about 100 pounds, doubling her weight.

For about a decade, Ms. Ramirez has received mental health and wellness services through Brooklyn Community Services and its predecessor. When she started coming to the agency, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, she often slept sprawled on a covered radiator by the window in the common area and did not socialize.

Outside the agency, she continued smoking marijuana. But Ms. Ramirez said she hated how people would look at her and comment on her red eyes and the stench of her clothes.

In 2010, she began an integrated dual disorder treatment program to combat her mental illness and her drug use.

“It was like coming out of a cloud,” Ms. Ramirez said of quitting marijuana. Over the years, she regained her senses of taste and smell, which had been dulled by smoking. “It was like I was waking up,” she added.

Within a few months of kicking her drug habit, she joined a weekly smoking-cessation group through Brooklyn Community Services. “I quit cold turkey,” she said. Most in the group used nicotine patches to transition, but not Ms. Ramirez. “I didn’t want to leave one addiction for another,” she said, adding: “I wanted to make that change. I was ready to make that change.”

Art therapy, offered by the organization, helped her through the withdrawal symptoms, she said. Ms. Ramirez, who had drawn since she was a teenager, took to the method quickly. And in 2012, the organization featured Ms. Ramirez’s pencil and ink drawings at its annual art show. Her series of bodiless faces in pinks, blues and grays depicted long lashes blooming from almond eyes, hairstyles of tight circles, the faces surrounded by hearts and cubes.

Her mother, Carmen Rivera, came to the show. “She said, ‘Thank you for giving me my daughter back,’” Ms. Gwinnell, the recovery specialist, recalled.

Ms. Ramirez is grateful, too. “Thank you for getting me back,” she told Ms. Gwinnell recently.

In May, Ms. Ramirez, a mother of three adult children, moved into a one-bedroom apartment on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn, the first home she has had to herself since her diagnosis about 25 years ago. Ms. Ramirez receives monthly $735 in Social Security Income and $150 in food stamps and pays $162 in subsidized rent. In July, Brooklyn Community Services used $300 from the Neediest Cases Funds to buy her, among other household items, two sets of window curtains, a lamp and a shower curtain.

After living with family for so long, Ms. Ramirez said she particularly enjoyed having full rein over the kitchen. No longer the shadow on the radiator, she likes socializing and sharing favorite Puerto Rican dishes like fritters and flan with others at the organization.

Ms. Ramirez, who dropped out of school in 10th grade when she was pregnant with her first child, said she would like to earn her high school equivalency diploma. Having previously worked in fast food and other industries, she wants to pursue a career as a chef. She might also try to display her artwork in a neighborhood gallery.

But for now, she is focused on her health. About a year ago, she became depressed and withdrawn and sought help again through Brooklyn Community Services. She has not been hospitalized for over 10 years. In addition to drawing, she meditates frequently.

“You have to put your part in,” she said of remaining drug-free. “A miracle doesn’t just walk in the door.

The tallest dunes in North America are at Great Sand Dunes National Park, with the highest rising 750 feet. Because it’s so arduous to walk up the soft sand, it takes five hours to hike the six miles to the top and back, according to the National Park Service.

By midmorning during my visit, I was already finding the sand hot through my socks and sandals, so I stayed on the lower dunes, knowing I was unlikely to keep my $20 rental board the full day. Although the breeze kept the air temperature comfortable, I’d been warned that the sand can reach 150 degrees Fahrenheit in the afternoon sun.

Still, even on the lower dunes, the views were stunning. The dune field stretches for 30 square miles, and to the north and east rise the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, capped with snow during my visit.

I thought of asking someone to try their board, but people were spread out a considerable distance on the dunes. Whether I was a wimp or wise by sticking to a sled depends upon whom you’re talking to.

“With a sled you can just go and have fun,” said Chelsea Ammerman, 33, the manager of the family-run Great Sand Dunes Oasis in Mosca, Colo., which started renting equipment three years ago. ”There’s no learning curve.”

The sandboards, though, require core and leg strength, and healthy knees.

Still, Mr. Beale, 60, thinks it is the superior sport.

Regardless of which sport, there are some tips:

-While you can wear shoes on the sleds, the bindings on the sandboards are designed for socks or surf bootees.

-Sand dunes are formed by wind, so there’s a chance you’ll be peppered by blowing sand. Full-length lightweight clothing will help keep you more comfortable, and cut down on the areas that need sunscreen. Some also recommend goggles to keep sand out of the eyes.

-On steeper slopes, the sand cascades beneath your feet with every step, meaning you don’t cover much distance for the energy expended. It’s easier to approach the dune from the low side, then walk along the ridge to the slope you want to go down.

-Plastic sleds, saucers, and cardboard don’t slide on dry sand. (The children I saw trying to slide on garbage bags gave up and just rolled down the hill.) Similarly, snowboards aren’t a good choice for dunes, according to Mr. Beale, who manufactures the wooden sleds and boards rented at the Oasis and elsewhere.

-Sand sleds have no steering, so Mrs. Ammerman recommends people use their hands in the sand as rudders, assuming it’s not too hot to do so.

-Despite their name, sandboards are ridden more like surf board than snowboards.

“Everything is on your back foot,” Mr. Beale said. “You keep your weight back, you keep your tip up, you maneuver on your back foot.”

Lessons in sandboarding are available at Sand Master Park, which opened in 2000 and gets about 20,000 visitors each year.

A naturally occurring 40-acre dune field, the sand at the park is sculpted with earth moving equipment and ramps, rails and jumps are set up.

“We have everybody from 4-year-olds to 80-year-olds,” said Mrs. Ammerman, who didn’t have a count for the number of rentals last season.

The Athletic, he said, promised not to start a Pittsburgh site.

According to skeptical media executives and investors interviewed for this article, something similar is most likely the best-case scenario for The Athletic.","These reporters are skilled experts feeling the strains of a crippled industry, and many are looking for a way out. Mather knows it.

Mather, 37, founded The Athletic with Adam Hansmann, 29. They worked together at Strava, an app and website for weekend warriors and elite competitors that calls itself the social network for athletes.

That experience, along with their frustration at the difficulty of finding high-quality sportswriting that wasn’t bogged down by pop-up ads, informed their big bet. They believe there are hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions, of enthusiastic sports fans willing to pay $60 annually — less with frequently offered discounts — for good reporting and writing, a clean app and no ads.

They have raised almost $8 million in venture capital funding and have recurring subscription revenue, ensuring the site won’t shutter soon. But the question everybody in sports media is asking is, What happens in three, five, seven years? Will The Athletic’s business model allow it to survive that long?

Newspapers are a classic example of a bundle. Subscribers might read just one section, but their subscription gets them the entire paper. Mather and Hansmann believe that sports is an undervalued part of that bundle, and that there are tens of thousands of sports fans in each city who don’t care about the other sections, and would rather jettison their subscription and pay for The Athletic instead.

“I think the sports page has carried local papers for a while, and they don’t treat it well,” Mather said.

After waiting nine months to debut its second local site, Toronto, and another five months for its third, Cleveland, the company planned to grow the number of local sites slowly, before tackling national ones. But that timeline was drastically altered after layoffs at ESPN, Sports Illustrated, Yahoo Sports, Fox Sports, Bleacher Report, Vice Sports and Vocativ this spring and summer put dozens of talented, well-connected journalists on the market.

“I’d say it’s probably the largest talent displacement in sports media ever,” Hansmann said.

The Athletic raised $5.6 million in venture capital financing in July to take advantage of the moment, adding to the $2.3 million seed round it raised in January.

“It was really hard to see everything that was happening in terms of the layoffs,” said Deepen Parikh, an executive at Courtside Ventures, one of The Athletic’s largest investors, “and knowing we really, genuinely had an opportunity to capitalize on it and not take it.”

The Athletic did not need to raise any financing, its executives said. Only one of the local sites, Toronto, breaks even — Chicago and the Bay Area and “a few smaller markets” are on track to do so by the end of the year, executives said — but most subscribers pay upfront for an annual subscription, so The Athletic had cash in hand to continue operations.

The company has wasted no time spending the new money. It started sites in Detroit, Philadelphia, the Bay Area and Minnesota, brought on the former Fox Sports writer Stewart Mandel to lead a national college football site and hired the former Sports Illustrated writer Seth Davis to head up another for national college basketball.

Paul Fichtenbaum, a former top Sports Illustrated editor who had been working for The Athletic as a consultant, was hired to oversee the national sites and start a longform vertical, called Ink. “Building a company is exciting,” he said, but the “bigger opportunity to change an industry is really something that we all aspire to.”

Now the plan is to raise even more money soon, and to gain a foothold in every American and Canadian professional sports market within two years. “If there is a hockey, basketball, baseball or football team” in a city, Hansmann said, “that’s the starting point.”

It is that kind of ambition, in an industry that has sustained a decade of retrenchment, that has most of the sports media industry rooting for The Athletic’s success. Every writer knows he or she could be the next victim of a naïve pivot to video.

But Mather and Hansmann have displayed sharp elbows, and not everybody is happy with them. Newspaper sports editors have been left smarting after losing reporters to The Athletic — four writers for The Athletic Bay Area worked at the Bay Area Newspaper Group a few months ago. And then there is Dejan Kovacevic, a longtime Pittsburgh sportswriter who started DK Pittsburgh Sports, a subscription-based local sports site that in some ways is a model for The Athletic, three years ago.

In an email, Kovacevic said that Mather and Hansmann had approached him to be an adviser but that they couldn’t agree on compensation. The Athletic, he said, promised not to start a Pittsburgh site. Instead, The Athletic Pittsburgh hired a second writer away from DK Pittsburgh Sports recently. Kovacevic also said that Mather and Hansmann were unhappy when he sold a copy of his publishing platform to Greg Bedard, who launched a subscription sports site in Boston this summer, because they said it raised their cost of doing business.

Mather said that when The Athletic’s executives spoke with Kovacevic, they had no intention of expanding into Pittsburgh in the near term, and that he and Hansmann “only make ‘promises’ to our customers, employees, investors and partners.”

“We are doing great work,” Mather said. “We treat our writers really well, we pay them well, and we are doing amazing journalism. If someone has a problem with that, that’s on them.”

Mather and Hansmann also don’t hew to traditional — they would say antiquated — norms about the separation of business and advertising efforts, and are already cozier with the teams they cover than many outlets. They have an agreement with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, for instance, whereby Argonauts season-ticket holders can receive a trial subscription to The Athletic, paid for by the Argonauts.

Hansmann said The Athletic pulled no punches in its reporting on the Argonauts, while Mather suggested The Athletic could partner with teams on insider video or events in which subscribers go to the stadium early for exclusive access. Fichtenbaum said his understanding was that the Argonauts partnership was a one-off.

Similarly, many of The Athletic’s representatives sang the virtues of its digital presentation, which shuns banner ads. But Parikh, the investor, said, “Advertising has a very real opportunity down the road with The Athletic,” before adding that it would have to be “customer centric.”

Mather and Hansmann declined to disclose subscription numbers, but they have said Toronto, their most successful local site, has more than 15,000 subscribers. The national sites figure to boost local subscription numbers.

As The Athletic’s costs rise — it will soon need a bigger office, and the company is beginning to hire nonrevenue-generating support staff like accountants and human resources personnel — the company will seemingly need to attract casual sports fans. But Mather and Hansmann are not convinced.

“In a city like Chicago, there are 100,000 die-hard fans,” Mather said. “That is a very lucrative subscription business. There are over 100,000 die-hard fans of Chicago teams outside of Chicago,” he added, and he says they aren’t served well. “Bleacher Report is empty calories. SB Nation is empty calories. The newspapers are doing nothing.”

More journalists and investors will pay attention if The Athletic can get to the point that it can rely only on its own revenue, rather than having to turn to venture capital. Successful online media subscription products usually either cost hundreds or thousands of dollars annually and appeal to information-starved professionals — like The Information and Politico Pro — or have relatively inexpensive subscriptions that support relatively few writers — like DK Pittsburgh Sports and Stratechery.

While The Athletic aspires to be the Spotify or Netflix of sports media, the only media companies that have achieved scale with a relatively low price point (and the help of ads) are the very same newspapers The Athletic is intent on destroying.

Bleacher Report was the big sports media winner of the era when scale and online advertising revenue seemed like the future of media. It was rarely profitable and raised $40 million in venture capital funding before being bought by Turner in 2012 for about $175 million. According to skeptical media executives and investors interviewed for this article, something similar is most likely the best-case scenario for The Athletic.

Mather and Hansmann insist that they, and their investors, are in it for the long haul, and that the time is finally right for a subscription media product to go big. “The advertising business model does not align with quality,” Mather said. “It’s hot takes instead of objective analysis, it’s short-term instead of long-term, it’s serving sponsors instead of users, it’s thinking big instead of great.”

A tour of the Washington Heights and Harlem neighborhoods with the aid of an Audubon map amounts to a new sort of bird-watching.

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

So as the aging Tim and the explosive Sergei struggle toward match point, their thoughts roam into the long, dark corridors of their pasts and presents. We learn of the agonizing attempts of Tim and his wife, Mallory (Zoë Winters), a retired player, to conceive a child; and of the combustible courtship of Galina (Natalia Payne), an occasional actress of immense vicarious ambition, by Sergei.

When the memories are especially hurtful, or the introspection too self-defeating, one of the players drops a set. Ms. Ziegler knows that self-consciousness is rarely an athlete’s friend, and there are moments when Tim or Sergei finds himself in the zone of a natural rhythm, when you almost palpably feel the satisfaction of instinctive performance.

More often, though, “The Last Match” evokes those literal-minded cinematic flashbacks, when a certain word makes a character’s eyes — and the camera’s focus — go hazy, and the story shifts woozily into a significant chapter in the past. The substance of such recollected moments here isn’t all that different from the thumbnail making-of-a-champion profiles that regularly punctuate Olympics broadcasts.

The performances rarely transcend the expected formula of such back stories. And the women’s roles are strictly supporting in all senses. But the well-cast Mr. Bethel endows Tim with a smooth Teflon surface just starting to show scratches, and Mr. Mickiewicz has an infectiously good time as the angry, bad-behaving underdog with a thick Slavic accent.

As always, Ms. Ziegler — whose work includes the biographical plays “Photograph 51,” about the scientist Rosalind Franklin (played in London by Nicole Kidman), and “Boy” — has not only done her research, but clearly thought hard about the implications of what she’s learned. There is the stuff of an elegant (if less than original) essay in “The Last Match” on how we invest in athletes as symbols and reflections of our own mortality.

Ms. Ziegler is also fast becoming a master of swelling choral dialogue, in which urgent but lyrical phrases are intoned in a counterpoint that seems to echo down the halls of history. (The splendid British playwright Michael Frayn, the author of “Copenhagen” and “Democracy,” is this style’s most accomplished practitioner.)

She delivers just such a sequence as “The Last Match” draws to its end. If you may have felt like changing to the Golf Channel before, you are sure to refocus your attention — and perhaps even go a little misty — as this production concludes.

The routine back-and-forth of a hard-fought match finally approaches the ineffable radiance of one of those moments that tennis fans live for.

(After a reporter’s inquiry, the campaign replaced the photograph with one clearly of the city’s skyline.)

James, who ruled against him during his earlier effort to change his party membership to the Democrats. Both women are black.

At the debate, Mr. de Blasio pounced on the comment. “You’re no better than Donald Trump,” the mayor replied forcefully. “That is un-American. We do not accept that in New York City.”

But when researchers put an Elmo sticker on the apple, more than a third chose it. That’s a significant result, and from a cheap, easily replicated intervention.

While the intervention seems simple, any study like this is anything but. For many reasons, doing research in nutrition is very, very hard.

First, the researchers have to fund their work, which can take years. Then the work has to be vetted and approved by an Institutional Review Board, which safeguards subjects from potential harm. I.R.B.s are especially vigilant when studies involve children, a vulnerable group. Even if the research is of minimal risk, this process can take months.

Then there’s getting permission from schools to do the work. As you can imagine, many are resistant to allowing research on their premises. Often, protocols and rules require getting permission from parents to allow their children to be part of studies. If parents (understandably) refuse, figuring out how to do the work without involving some children can be tricky.

Finally, many methodological decisions come into play. Let’s imagine that we want to do a simple test of cookies versus apples, plus or minus stickers — as this study did. It’s possible that children eat different things on different days, so we need to make sure that we test them on multiple days of the week. It’s possible that they might change their behavior once, but then go back to their old ways, so we need to test responses over time.

It’s possible that handing out the cookie or apple personally might change behavior more than just leaving the choices out for display. If that’s the case, we need to stay hidden and observe unobtrusively. This matters because in the real world it’s probably not feasible to have someone handing out these foods in schools, and we need the methods to mirror what will most likely happen later. It’s also possible that the choices might differ based on whether children can take both the apple and the cookie (in which case they could get the sticker and the treat) or whether they had to choose one.

I point out all these things to reinforce that this type of research isn’t as simple as many might initially think. Without addressing these questions, and more, the work may be flawed or not easily generalized.

These difficulties are some of the reasons so much research on food and nutrition is done with animals, like mice. We don’t need to worry as much about I.R.B.s or getting a school on board. We don’t have to worry about mice noticing who’s recording data. And we can control what they’re offered to eat, every meal of every day. But the same things that make animal studies so much easier to perform also make them much less meaningful. Human eating and nutrition are typically more complex than anything a mouse would encounter.

Overcoming these problems and proving spectacular results in preteens are some of the reasons this study on cookies and apples, and others like it, are so compelling. The authors have transformed this work into popular appearances, books and publicity for the Food and Brand Lab.

But cracks began to appear in Mr. Wansink’s and the Food and Brand Lab’s work not long ago, when other researchers noted discrepancies in some of his studies. The numbers didn’t add up; odd things appeared in the data, including the study on apples and cookies. The issues were significant enough that JAMA Pediatrics retracted the original article, and the researchers posted a replacement.

The problems didn’t end there. As Stephanie Lee at BuzzFeed recently reported, it appears that the study wasn’t conducted on 8-to-11-year-olds as published. It was done on 3-to-5-year-olds.

Just as mice can’t be easily extrapolated to humans, research done on 3-to-5-year-olds doesn’t necessarily generalize to 8-to-11-year-olds. Putting an Elmo sticker on an apple for a small child might matter, but that doesn’t mean it will for a fifth grader. On Friday, the study was fully retracted.

Making things worse, this may have happened in other publications. Ms. Lee has also reported on a study published in Preventive Medicine in 2012 that claimed that children are more likely to eat vegetables if you give them a “cool” name, like “X-ray Vision Carrots.” That study, too, may be retracted or corrected, along with a host of others.

As a researcher, and one who works with children, I find it hard to understand how you could do a study of 3-to-5-year-olds, analyze the data, write it up and then somehow forget and imagine it happened with 8-to-11-year-olds. The grant application would have required detail on the study subjects, as well as justification for the age ranges. The I.R.B. would require researchers to be specific about the ages of the children studied.

I reached out to the authors of the study to ask how this could have happened, and Mr. Wansink replied: “The explanation for mislabeling of the age groups in the study is both simple and embarrassing. I was not present for the 2008 data collection, and when I later wrote the paper I wrongly inferred that these children must have been the typical age range of elementary students we usually study. Instead, I discovered that while the data was indeed collected in elementary schools, it was actually collected at Head Start day cares that happened to meet in those elementary schools.”

This is a level of disconnect that many scientists would find inconceivable, and I do not mean to suggest that this is the norm for nutrition research. It does, however, illustrate how an inattention to detail can derail what might be promising work. The difficulties of research in this area are already significant. Distrust makes things worse. The social sciences are already suffering from a replication problem; when work that makes a big splash fails to hold up, it hurts science in general.

We want to believe there are easy fixes to the obesity epidemic and nutrition in general. We want to believe there are simple actions we can take, like putting labels on menus, or stickers on food, or jazzing up the names of vegetables. Sadly, all of that may not work, regardless of what advocates say.

Realizing she was not alone, Ms. Seefeld helped found FACE, the advocacy group for accused students.","And some of the most potent advocates for those men have been a group of women: their own mothers.

Some of the mothers met with Ms. DeVos in July to tell their stories, and Ms. DeVos alluded to them in a speech she gave last month. An advocacy group founded in 2013 by several mothers, Families Advocating for Campus Equality, or FACE, has grown to hundreds of families, who have exchanged tens of thousands of messages through their email list, said Cynthia Garrett, co-president of the group.

The mothers lobby Congress, testify on proposed legislation and policy, and track lawsuits filed by men who say they have been wrongly accused. A bill in the California Legislature that they testified against, which would have enshrined the Obama-era regulations into state law, passed both houses but was vetoed this month by Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, who said it was “time to pause” on the issue.

The group holds twice-yearly meetings, where parents and sons share personal experiences and listen to advice from psychologists and lawyers.

Away from the public eye, families have spent tens of thousands of dollars and dipped into retirement savings to hire lawyers and therapists for their sons. Some have pressured colleges to reconsider punishment or expunge disciplinary notations from transcripts, so that other colleges and employers cannot see them.

Ms. Seefeld said she hired a lawyer and even a public relations firm, and used her political connections as a teachers’ union leader, to try to get the University of North Dakota to reverse her son’s three-year banishment after a woman accused him of nonconsensual sex.

“I was willing to do everything and anything,” Ms. Seefeld said. Her son Caleb Warner was ultimately cleared after the college took a second look at the case.

The mothers’ resolve comes from their raw maternal instinct to protect their children. But several who agreed to interviews also said they did not doubt that their sons’ accusers had felt hurt.

Their sons may not have been falsely accused, the mothers said, but they had been wrongly accused. They made a distinction.

One mother, Judith, said her son had been expelled after having sex with a student who said she had been too intoxicated to give consent.

“In my generation, what these girls are going through was never considered assault,” Judith said. “It was considered, ‘I was stupid and I got embarrassed.’”

Ms. DeVos issued temporary guidance for colleges last month and will invite public comment while developing permanent regulations. Most significantly so far, she has lifted the requirement that colleges use the lowest standard of proof, “preponderance of the evidence,” in deciding whether to uphold a charge of sexual misconduct. Colleges are now free to demand more convincing evidence, a move that the mothers and other advocates for the accused had called for, saying that students should not be punished in cases where there is some doubt about the accusation.

The most active mothers said they stepped forward because they often had more time than their husbands, and because they made a strategic decision that they could be effective on the issue of sexual assault precisely because they are women and, as some described themselves, feminists. “We recognized that power,” Ms. Seefeld said.

Many women, however, feel exactly the opposite way.

A number of women’s groups and victims’ advocates have argued that a tougher standard of proof will discourage women from coming forward. They have not been shy about expressing their view of the mothers as “rape deniers” and misogynists who blame women for inviting male violence against them.

Jessica Davidson, a victim of campus sexual assault and the managing director of End Rape on Campus, said it appeared that the mothers had a strong emotional impact on Ms. DeVos, who separately met with victims, including Ms. Davidson.

“It is of course an immensely difficult thing to believe somebody you love could rape or harm another person,” Ms. Davidson said.

But, she said of the mothers, “I think it’s the wrong thing for them to do to try and push back an entire movement.”

Of a dozen mothers who were interviewed, almost all asked to be identified by their first names only. They said they wanted to protect their sons from being publicly revealed as having been disciplined, or even accused, in a sexual assault case. The mothers obsessively type their sons’ names into Google, and are relieved when their cases do not come up.

Some of the mothers remember the moment they learned their sons had been accused as vividly as other people remember hearing that planes had struck the World Trade Center.

Alison was pushing her cart down the aisle at a supermarket, looking at Tide detergent, when she got the call from her younger son. He had left home for college for the first time about seven weeks before.

“I think I have a problem,” her son said. “It’s bad.”

She felt a flash of irritation.

“How many times have I told you, you need to keep it zippered,” she said she told him.

Then the gravity of the situation sank in. “I need to hire a lawyer,” she thought.

A female student had told the university police that she had been sexually assaulted at an apartment near campus.

As Alison tells it, the woman had propositioned her son and consented to sex. She learned more about her 19-year-old son’s intimate behavior than any mother would want to know, and found herself talking about it “as if it were the grocery list,” she recalled.

Officials at the university declined to comment on the case, citing student confidentiality rules.

According to university documents provided by Alison, her son was cleared. Additionally, a grand jury declined to indict him, she said. But, Alison contends, the investigation should never even have gotten that far, and the damage was already done.

Her son had become a pariah, dropped by his friends and called a rapist by women on campus. The semester after he was cleared he called home, sobbing, to say he could no longer take it and was dropping out, she said.

Five years later, at 24, he has not received a diploma and is trying to ease back into college life by taking courses online.

Alison and her son were among the delegation that met with Ms. DeVos in July. “It was very solemn,” Alison said. “It was as if we all, everyone in the room, had attended the same funeral together.”

Judith, whose son was expelled, said that at first her son did not tell her about the complaint against him, thinking he could handle it alone. She found out when he was taken to a hospital, suicidal.

She described herself as a lifelong Democrat and feminist who went to college in the 1970s at the height of the sexual revolution and women’s liberation movements. Her husband and their two sons were “super respectful” of women, she said.

“We don’t really need to teach our sons not to rape,” she said.

Four years after being kicked out of school, she said, her son is leading a “double life,” unable to confide in colleagues at work, and avoiding college classmates and his hometown.

Gloria Davidson, whose daughter, Jessica, runs End Rape on Campus, said that as the mother of a 21-year-old son, she could empathize with the mothers of accused students — to a point.

“Any mother is watching out for the children, that’s what mothers do,” Ms. Davidson said. “But I think all mothers should get the facts and open their eyes to what could have happened or not.”

Few mothers have been as public and assertive as Ms. Seefeld. In 2010 her son, Mr. Warner, learned he had been accused of sexual assault by a fellow student at the University of North Dakota. Mr. Warner contended that the sex was consensual, but he was suspended and banned from campus for three years.

His mother leveraged the connections she had developed over years as a high school psychology and sociology teacher in Fargo, and as a union leader. She contacted the State Board of Higher Education and visited state legislators.

Hearing that the university was about to start a fund-raising drive, and thus would not want bad publicity, Ms. Seefeld said, she emailed its president about 9 p.m. one night. She wrote that she had hired a lawyer to look into suing the university, and a public relations firm to help her publicize her son’s case, she said. “Within 30 minutes I heard from the president,” she said, and he told her the case would be reviewed.

A spokesman for the university declined to comment. But university documents provided by Ms. Seefeld show that the school did review the verdict, and nullified it because of a new development: The police said that they had found inconsistencies in the accuser’s account and that some witnesses had contradicted it. They issued a warrant for her arrest on a charge of filing a false police report. (The woman left the state and has not been arrested. She did not respond to telephone messages.)

《华盛顿邮报》(The Washington Post)专栏作家安妮·阿普尔鲍姆长期以来一直住在东欧，撰写关于那里的文章，她最著名的作品是获得普利策奖的《古拉格：一部历史》(Gulag: A History)。但我最喜欢的是她1994年出版的《东西之间：跨越欧洲边界》(Between East and West: Across the Borderlands of Europe)，这本书怪异而新颖，讲述她从波罗的海旅行至黑海的经历，她所经过的地区和城市在20世纪里曾先后属于好几个不同的国家。例如，今天的乌克兰西部城市利沃夫(Lviv)曾是苏联的Lvov；之前在两次世界大战之间曾是波兰的Lwow；1914年之前，它又是奥匈帝国的莱姆堡(Lemberg)。这还不包括它曾在一战期间被沙皇俄国占领，在二战期间被纳粹德国占领，1918年被一个短命的乌克兰民族主义组织占领的经历。

这种冲突的民族主义幽灵也贯穿在阿普尔鲍姆的新书《红色饥荒：斯大林对乌克兰的战争》之中，该书详细讲述了于1933年达到顶峰的大饥荒，据估计，它导致500多万苏联人死亡，其中390多万为乌克兰人。斯大林从之前几年开始，无情地强迫数百万独立的小农进入新的集体农场，他确信这样能够提高生产力，养活苏联的城市。那些农民当然拒绝放弃自己的土地，纷纷屠杀和吃掉被要求跟他们一起带走的家畜，他们被带去集体农场后——有时是被枪逼着去的——几乎毫无劳动积极性。

Who’s ready for a very “Stranger Things” Halloween? That wildly popular sci-fi/horror series is returning to Netflix just in time for that spookiest of holidays. Set around October 1984, roughly a year after the events of Season 1, the second season will rejoin the citizens of Hawkins, Ind., as they battle an otherworldly “shadow monster” that promises to make the rampaging Demogorgon of Season 1 look like a middle schooler in a homemade Halloween costume.

Will and the Demogorgon

The center of the “Stranger Things” universe is the Byers family: the geeky 12-year-old Will (Noah Schnapp), who disappears on his way home from a Dungeons & Dragons game; his older brother, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), a teenage outcast who loves punk music; and their fragile but fiercely devoted single mom, Joyce (Winona Ryder).

0

As we find out, Will was spirited away to a creepy parallel dimension known as the Upside Down, by a monster whose head resembles a Venus fly trap. Will’s friends start calling the creature Demogorgon, after a demon from Dungeons and Dragons.

In the Season 1 finale, Jonathan; his friend Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer); and her boyfriend, Steve (Joe Keery), booby-trap the Byers house and lure the Demogorgon there in hopes of killing it. The teens put up a valiant fight, but as soon as they manage to set the monster on fire, it escapes. Thankfully, they’ve distracted it just long enough to allow Joyce to sneak into the Upside Down in hopes of saving Will.

In the final scene of the season, Will, Joyce and Jonathan celebrate Christmas together at home. It’s a happy ending — until Will starts to feel sick, coughs up a sluglike creature in the bathroom and is transported, for a moment, back to the Upside Down. You can take the kid out of the nightmare realm, but it seems that you can’t quite take the nightmare realm out of the kid.

A scene from “Stranger Things.” Netflix

The Lab and the Upside Down

Although the show spends plenty of time in the Upside Down, it’s still not entirely clear what this parallel reality actually is. We do know that a portal opened between the two realms when scientists at the Hawkins National Laboratory, a secretive government facility, used a telekinetic girl called simply “11” (Millie Bobby Brown) to make contact with the monster.

The Upside Down looks the way Hawkins might if its buildings and trees were all decaying, the sun never shined and everything were covered in vines made out of mucous. The air is supposedly toxic. (Uproxx has a great list of questions about the Upside Down that “Stranger Things” hasn’t answered yet.)

In the real Hawkins, the lab’s staff is desperate to find Eleven, who was the prisoner of its leader, Dr. Martin Brenner (Matthew Modine), a research scientist who abducted the girl and raised her to consider him her father. As Brenner hunts for her, Will’s friends and family uncover the connection between the laboratory and the boy’s disappearance. A final showdown between the kids, the Demogorgon and Brenner’s minions leaves many of those minions dead. Going into Season 2, it’s not clear whether the scientist lived through the battle.

Eleven

Eleven isn’t just any psychokinetic tween. The show implies that she’s also the missing daughter of Terry Ives (Aimee Mullins), a local woman who accidentally got pregnant while participating in one of Brenner’s deeply unethical experiments. She is certain that her daughter, Jane, who was born with telekinesis and E.S.P., was abducted as a baby. But the lab’s cover-up has led her relatives to believe that Terry, who’s been catatonic for years, miscarried in her third trimester and became delusional after suffering that loss.

Because she’s spent her entire life in the lab undergoing Brenner’s experiments, Eleven is silent, scared and largely ignorant about the outside world by the time she meets Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin). It’s with those three boys that she learns about the small pleasures of middle-school life, from frozen waffles to role-playing games.

Eleven’s story appears to end in the season finale’s climactic middle-school showdown, when she uses her powers to vanquish the Demogorgon and save her new buddies. Both she and the monster disappear. It’s a heartbreaking sacrifice, but it’s pretty clear she’ll be back for Season 2.

The Boys

While searching for Will, his friends meet an escaped Eleven and hide her in Mike’s basement. In hopes of making contact with Will, Dustin builds a sensory deprivation tank in the middle-school gym in order to recreate the setting where Eleven first glimpsed the Upside Down. And Lucas, who’s initially more suspicious of Eleven than the other boys are, goes on a solo spy mission at the laboratory. His reconnaissance helps her evade the feds — for a while.

Love, Hawkins Style

Just before Eleven battles the Demogorgon, Mike musters the courage to ask her to the school’s Snow Ball, and they kiss. His infatuation with her was palpable for most of the season, so their separation soon after is painful to see.

Theirs isn’t the only relationship thrown into chaos by the Upside Down. After Nancy’s best friend, Barb Holland (Shannon Purser), vanishes in much the same way Will did, Nancy and Jonathan investigate the disappearances together. Steve believes they’re hooking up behind his back and paints graffiti all over Hawkins, calling her a slut. But Steve redeems himself when he tells off his nasty friends and joins Nancy and Jonathan in battling the Demogorgon. Sadly for Jonathan, who’s obviously in love with her, Nancy and Steve are back together by the end of the season.

Chief Jim Hopper

And then there’s the most obvious love interest for Joyce: the local police chief, Jim Hopper (David Harbour). Initially a cynical, private and somewhat debauched presence in Hawkins, he becomes her greatest adult ally in the search for Will, and the two of them wind up trudging through the Upside Down together to find him. Still, years after his young daughter’s death and the divorce it catalyzed, Hopper remains a haunted man. As he struggles to resuscitate Joyce’s son, he flashes back to his little girl’s final days in the hospital, as doctors tried and failed to do the same. With Will, however, the efforts to revive him are successful, and Hopper and Joyce soon carry the boy to safety.

For all his heroism, we’re stuck with the uncomfortable fact that he gave up Eleven’s location to Brenner — and that his relationship with the feds may not have ended there. In a subsequent, unexplained scene, Hopper reluctantly gets into a car with people who appear to be government agents. Along with Will’s momentary descent into the Upside Down and Eleven’s whereabouts, this meeting is one of the finale’s most captivating cliffhangers.

What About Barb?

There’s one final loose end, and it’s #JusticeForBarb. Barb was last seen in the Upside Down, looking very still and white and lifeless, with a slug crawling out of her mouth. The show’s creators, Ross and Matt Duffer, have confirmed her death. But in an interview, Matt promised that while the internet’s favorite character won’t return, her story isn’t entirely over. “We’ll make sure there’s some justice for Barb,” he said.

But Mr. Dorsey’s eye for simple solutions has not been enough to turn around Twitter since he returned in 2015 to lead the company he helped found in 2006. He has failed to rein in the use and abuse of the service by trolls and political actors, and he has not found a convincing way to make money despite its ardent user base.

At Square, Mr. Dorsey has led one of Silicon Valley’s more understated success stories, built from the little plastic white square that allowed small businesses to accept credit card payments via their iPhones. Square has grown into a much broader financial services company, despite some hiccups, like a much-heralded partnership with Starbucks that flamed out.

Although Twitter’s overall revenue shrank 5 percent in the second quarter from the year before, expanding the company’s losses, at Square, revenue grew 26 percent, moving the company closer to profitability.

The divergent fate of Mr. Dorsey’s two companies can be understood simply as a matter of timing and control. When he began his second stint as Twitter’s chief executive in 2015, the company was already struggling and had a series of internal problems that were hard to change, including executive turnover and competing strategic visions.

At Square, on the other hand, Mr. Dorsey was able to build the whole company from the ground up, with knowledge from Twitter of how things can go wrong.

“Square wasn’t Jack’s first rodeo,” said Randy Reddig, who was on the founding team at Square in 2009. “It was obvious early on at the company that he took lessons learned from his time at Twitter and applied them at Square.”

Mr. Reddig said that Mr. Dorsey’s education from Twitter’s fractious early years was particularly apparent in the control that Mr. Dorsey kept over hiring and compensation decisions at Square, with a focus on creating a loyal team.

Through Twitter and Square, Mr. Dorsey declined to comment for this story.

Mr. Dorsey’s success at Square and his trouble at Twitter also tell a broader story about Silicon Valley, where the boring, back-end businesses often end up generating more money than the flashy social networks and consumer services that capture the public’s eye.

Mr. Dorsey trained Square’s sights on a mostly invisible business — electronic payments — that has momentum as more and more commerce moves online.

Capgemini recently estimated that electronic payments should grow 10.9 percent a year between 2015 and 2020. It is no coincidence that the most successful American financial start-up of the last decade, aside from Square, is Stripe, which helps online businesses take payments.

Beyond just payments, though, Square has taken aim at the much larger goal of providing a tech-savvy alternative to the big banks, expanding out from payments to lending and online deposits.

This summer, Square applied for a bank charter in Utah, one of just three so-called fintech firms to take such a bold step (the others are Social Finance and Varo).

Square is most visibly positioned to use a bank license with its business customers, but the company has also been building more banklike services for consumers, most notably with its app Square Cash.

Square Cash is often described as a competitor and imitator of Venmo, the popular app owned by PayPal that makes it possible for friends to send one another payments by smartphone.

In recent months, though, Square Cash has quietly bypassed Venmo to become the most frequently downloaded financial app of any kind on both Apple and Android phones, according to Apptopia. At various points over the past week, Square Cash was ahead of Venmo and Twitter on the charts of the most downloaded iPhone apps.

The big banks had aimed to challenge Venmo with their own service, Zelle, but that has not posed a credible challenge to either Venmo or Square Cash so far, the rankings show.

Mr. Dorsey and his team made several early design choices with Square Cash that helped make it different from Venmo. As would be expected from Mr. Dorsey, Square’s app has a clean, green interface, compared with Venmo’s busy blue dashboard.

Square also made an apparently boring technical decision, to use the debit card networks rather than bank transfers, to move money around. That has made it easier for Square Cash to put money instantly into the bank accounts of its users, and to collect a fee for the service.

These differences appear to have made Square Cash more popular with lower-income customers who more often need instant access to their money and who don’t have as wide a variety of credit cards and other financial options.

“We are reaching an audience that may not have a bank account or may not have a full suite of services from a bank,” Mr. Dorsey told analysts last quarter.

The shift in people using Square Cash as something more like a bank account has been an important one for Square’s bottom line. While Square and PayPal generally don’t make money when customers send money to one another, they can take a cut when customers start using the service to make payments at stores.

This all looks like a similar playbook to the one Square used with its original credit card dongle, starting with a simple service for an underserved audience and then building from there.

Keith Rabois, who was the chief operating officer at Square until 2013, said that the Cash app reflects Mr. Dorsey’s ability to make deceptively simple products that answer a complicated need.

Even though the revenue from Cash is small compared with the money that Square pulls in from businesses, Mr. Rabois said that “it may be the most important thing Square is working on.”

During Mr. Rabois’s tenure at Square, the future did not always look so bright. The company’s first attempt at a consumer application, Square Wallet, never took off and was discontinued, bringing down the Starbucks partnership with it.

Many analysts also expected that Square would have to reduce the price it charged businesses to process credit card transactions as it began working with larger businesses that had more options.

Over time, though, Square has been able to keep its prices stable by offering its business customers other services, such as payroll and scheduling.

A KeyBanc analyst recently polled 20 businesses that use Square and found that most of them had been offered lower card transaction fees by other companies but passed them up because of the add-ons that Square offers.

One of the most profitable such services is Square Capital, which offers small loans to businesses. The revenue from these loans has been increasing faster than the overall growth of the company and has Square looking more like a bank every day.

These days, one of the biggest concerns that analysts voice about Square is the time that Mr. Dorsey has to spend on Twitter, with all its problems.

During a talk at Silicon Valley’s Computer History Museum in August, Mr. Dorsey said he thought he had proved that he didn’t need to make a choice between the two.

“They both have different needs and are in different phases,” he said. “Focusing on one thing doesn’t mean you completely lose sight of something else.”","Square, the Twitter Boss’s Other Company, Could Pass It in Value",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/technology/jack-dorsey-twitter-square.html

They might say that they would have made a different choice had they known what we know now about the vulnerability of the teenage brain to cannabis. In the same vein, they could take the opportunity to note how very lucky they were that nothing went wrong, or to explain what did.

Parents sometimes worry that talking about their past use, or talking about illegal substances at all, might be taken as granting permission to experiment with drugs. If this is a concern, it can be addressed head on: “I did try pot, but I don’t want you to hear that as me saying that it’s O.K. for you. I want you to be smarter about it than I was.”

Other adults might welcome the opportunity to articulate the conditions under which they would give their blessing. For instance, the mother of a teenager in my practice said that she wouldn’t mind if her son tried marijuana, but only once he was in college, and only by smoking the supply of an uncle who grows his own. For parents who have no objections to cannabis use, questions about the past can open the door to discussions of what has changed in recent years, such as the growing availability of edible and concentrated forms of marijuana, and what hasn’t: recreational use of it is still illegal for minors in the United States.

Research consistently shows that adolescents take their parents’ guidance to heart even if they don’t always indicate as much. Regardless of the parent’s stance on marijuana use, it might be worth adding, “I’m asking you to be careful because I don’t want you to get hurt or find yourself on a path that you don’t mean to be on.”

The results of the same recent study on direct conversations about drugs suggest that personal or vicarious accounts of the downsides of substance use are especially compelling for teenagers. A parent who has a lot of stories to share might say, “Your grandparents were not paying attention when I was growing up and I got myself into situations that I should have never been in. When I became a parent I knew I wanted to do it differently. Let’s keep talking about this because I did enough learning for both of us.”

Some teenagers who ask about their parents’ past use are actually seeking the opposite of permission to try marijuana. They’re looking for reassurance that it’s O.K. not to. As one of my adolescent clients put it, “You can worry that you’re missing out on something — that it’s part of the ‘high school experience’ that a teenager is supposed to have.”

Mr. Hice addressed this concern by encouraging his son to see if he could have fun without using drugs and to “think about the pitfalls, your health, getting caught, getting expelled.” He also told his son that he watched his fraternity brothers closely both when they were high and also on the next day. From there Mr. Hice explained that, “it just didn’t look like the benefits outweighed the risks.”

Parents won’t always know what’s behind their teenager’s sudden interest in their personal choices and responding with either a detailed confessional or an abrupt, “That’s none of your business,” will probably make it harder to find out.

And adults who aren’t prepared to answer the opening question can still keep the lines of communication open, so long as “I’m not sure I’m ready to have this conversation” gently gives way to “but how come you’re asking?”","When Your Teenager Asks, ‘Did You Smoke Weed?’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/well/family/when-your-teenager-asks-did-you-smoke-weed.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

I’ve lived in Paris part time for 20 years, but it took a while before I realized that I’d never heard a French friend say “dinner party.” When an invitation is offered, it goes something like: “Venez dîner à la maison.” And when my friends repeat it in English, they say, “Come home for dinner.” The warmth in these words struck me when I first heard them and set me at ease, dispelling whatever ideas I had about French dinners being stuffy — and I had been sure they would be. The phrase called to mind — of course, even the mundane can sound dramatic in French — lots of laughter, good wine, an evening that unfolds at a leisurely pace and ends late. It was what I wanted my own Parisian dinners at home to be.

Home has always been Saint-Germain-des-Prés, but I’m in a new apartment. We moved earlier this year, and while I’m still feeling my way around it, I already know it’s a wonderful place for entertaining friends. The living and dining areas are one slant-ceilinged space with three small balconies, each with geraniums, that double as wine coolers when the weather is right. In real estate speak, the kitchen is “charming”; in practical terms it’s small and demands neatness. It’s a narrow galley that ends in double doors to another balcony, this one with herbs I can snip.

Over the years, I’ve taken to making dinners on Mondays, the night most French hosts prefer to avoid, because all the outdoor markets and most of the best small food shops are closed that day — it’s impossible to get a morsel of fine cheese on Mondays. But because many restaurants are also closed, it’s a good night to feed the people who often cook for me, my friends who work in food.

I create a menu that can be prepared entirely ahead of time — usually the main course will need to be reheated, and everything will need to be plated, but nothing will keep me in the kitchen long. And while I don’t love the constraint, I love the three or four hours I spend the day before gathering provisions at my neighborhood markets. I know I could buy everything at a supermarket, but there would be no pleasure in it, no chance to chat with Twiggy, the cheesemonger, and catch up on the neighborhood news, and no opportunity to discuss with Serge, the butcher, how I was going to cook my osso buco. Each ingredient has its own story by the time I get it home.

A month or so ago, I made a Monday-night dinner for food-world friends, delighting in discovering that, while they knew of one another, not all of them had met. In addition to my husband, Michael, and me, there were two restaurateurs, Bertrand Auboyneau and Juan Sanchez; one cooking-school owner, Jane Bertch; and one baker, Apollonia Poilâne, who brought loaves of dark bread.

People in the food business are easy to feed: They’re grateful to have someone else in the kitchen and forgiving if things aren’t just so. But even if they’re quick to ignore whatever faux pas I, an American, might make, it’s because I’m an American in their country that I want to get it right. With the exception of the cheese plate, which slips in between the main course and dessert in France (and for which I early on bought a book to teach myself how to cut cheeses into their proper shapes), dinner runs pretty much the same way in both countries. Yet it can be like those cognates you learn in a foreign language — the words sound similar to those we know, but they turn out to have different meanings.

There was the time I served fried chicken and couldn’t get anyone to pick it up with their hands — for the most part, the French are not finger-lickers. The time all the cheese I served with drinks was left uneaten — cheese is for the cheese course, not for a nibble. The time I put everything out on the table at once, calling it an indoor picnic, and my guests, although urged to mix and match, reorganized my mishmash into a well-ordered traditional French meal and ate one dish at a time, leaving the salad for last, as is done.

Although I now know what’s accepted and acceptable, I occasionally veer off course and always stray at the beginning of the evening. On this Monday, friends began arriving at about 8, late-ish by American standards and just a bit on the early side by French ones. Dinner always starts in the living room and usually at least a quarter-hour after the time you’ve asked people to come (it’s considered impolite to arrive on time, as it’s assumed that the host always needs a few more minutes). I had everything for l’heure de l’apéro, or cocktail hour, set out on the small table in front of the sofa, and I opened the first bottle of white wine as people got settled. Bertrand took off his jacket — dinner at our home is never dressy — Jane found an armchair and was talking bread with Michael, a home baker, and Juan began pouring. Apollonia arrived a little later, and I put her rye bread next to the gravlax and dill yogurt I had made a few days before. The evening had begun and, within minutes, I heard my favorite sound: the chime of glasses touching in a toast.

Custom would have had me serving the wine with insubstantial tidbits — usually nuts, olives, salty crackers and, inexplicably, cherry tomatoes in any season. But because dinner starts late, and this introductory moment lasts one hour — you can set your clock by it — I’d made the gravlax, passing the first round and then encouraging everyone to help themselves.

We eventually drifted to the table, set with wine- and water glasses, carafes, colorful pottery plates Michael and I carried back from a vacation in the South of France and odd dishes and silver we found at flea markets. I had flowers and candles, but no tablecloth or bread plates — I love the way the French put their bread directly on the table, the inevitable crumbs forming hieroglyphs of collective celebration.

The appearance of the roasted peppers, brushed with oil and sherry vinegar and sitting on ricotta mixed with lemon and herbs, sparked a conversation about gardens. Bertrand had planted a vegetable garden, a potager, in Normandy to supply his Paris restaurants, and Juan had plans to plant one in Champagne. Once the dish was finished, Bertrand briefly turned on his phone (sheepishly asking permission first), and pictures of tomatoes and peppers and chard, leeks, potatoes, eggplants and small zucchini with beautiful oversize yellow blossoms were passed around.

Then came the osso buco, which I arranged in shallow bowls in the kitchen, placing each round of meat over a squash purée and putting only the gremolata on the table (to ensure that I wouldn’t have a repeat of the picnic experience). For a few moments there was silence punctuated by mmmms, the best compliment in any language. Then there were questions about how long I cooked the meat (about 90 minutes), comments about the addition of orange in the sauce (noticeable, but not overly so) and praise for the unusual addition of olives (and the fact that they were oil-cured). The cheese plate, always appreciated but not usually talked about (praise is reserved only for things homemade), followed and was talked about, as the Lou Poutou, a soft cow’s-milk cheese from southwestern France, was new to Jane and Bertrand. As I was clearing the dishes, Michael noticed that it was 11 o’clock, and so we refilled our wineglasses and went onto the balcony to see the Eiffel Tower sparkle — an interlude that might just become a ritual.

Table Talk Asking questions can get a guest to reveal something fascinating about herself. But a quick way to prevent that is to give her possible answers. “Why did you quit law school — was it too boring?” Leave out the guess. A short question is more likely to provoke details.

These dinners at home are not really about the food. They’re about friendship and the conversation that goes on around the table, often late into the night. Yet so much of the talk is about food — the food we’re sharing, the meals we remember, the ones we’ll soon eat, the food we’ve cooked and what we want to cook. New restaurants. New chefs. Has anyone tried the Italian stall at the market? Is bread getting better or worse in the city? Of course, there’s also talk of politics: Will Paris’s mayor really ban cars? What will Macron do? And Trump? “Oh, let’s talk about dessert,” someone says, and we do.

I had made wine-poached pears spiced with cinnamon, cloves and star anise and a cookie with Italian roots, called a torta sbrisolona. The cookie, an eight-inch square, is a communal offering — each person reaches in and breaks off a piece. It was past midnight when I noticed that the candles had burned to stubs. I didn’t turn up the lights — the coziness was too nice. We all had our elbows on the table amid the scattering of crumbs. We bent in, listening closely, and poured one another more wine.

Puerto Rico used to glow in satellite photos, but it won’t have electricity for months. That’s how long it will take to replace the thousands of utility poles and miles of power lines that crisscrossed this precariously modern island. The gasoline lines are shorter, but one month after Hurricane Maria, one-quarter of Puerto Rico still doesn’t have clean drinking water, including many who haven’t had it since Hurricane Irma.

Supermarket food shelves are still unevenly stocked, especially outside the San Juan metro area. A complex distribution snafu persists, on account of low pre-existing inventories, FEMA operations, and difficulties in communications and transportation. There are many communities in the highlands that have been isolated by fallen bridges, impassable roads and landslides. Above all, they are the ones that need food and water.

The island government initially portrayed its response as organized, but it has been overwhelmed by the tasks of post-hurricane recovery. Information is opaque, slow to emerge and often contradictory. Key officials such as the head of emergency management, the police superintendent and the adjutant general of the National Guard are virtually missing in action; for weeks, the health secretary was so elusive it became a running joke on the radio.

FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers, despite major funding and overall good will, seem somewhat detached from the island’s reality. And the nearly $5 billion loan requested for the island is generous but will essentially only salvage the government’s liquidity until January or so.

And so it goes. Even with growing access to news coverage, we remain in the dark.

At home, we are getting by, so to speak. Days after Hurricane Maria, my wife woke up thinking this is perhaps a nightmare. I try to assume our new reality with a kind of mindless optimism — a self-reliant Puerto Rico is being born! Or not. Perhaps an unplugged Puerto Rico for months on end may really be a nightmare.

Puerto Rico was hit by natural disaster on top of fiscal disaster on top of our secular disaster of being neither fish nor fowl: voteless United States citizens, most of whom pay no federal income tax; political and fiscal oddities. Second-class citizens with a second-class disaster. At best, we’re seen as American citizens but not as Americans. Which, truth be told, doesn’t make me lose any sleep; what I am is Puerto Rican. In any case, as a territory, and for better or for worse, the Constitution places Puerto Rico under the responsibility of Congress. Maybe invading us in 1898 wasn’t such a great idea.

We’re facing months of daily inconveniences and nightly darkness. But we’re dealing with it, with whatever outside help we can muster. Once again we have to come to terms with being one of the Caribbean peoples on the hurricane highway, who, through slavery, colonialism and hurricanes, invented resilience.","In Puerto Rico, We Invented Resilience",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/opinion/puerto-rico-hurricane-resilience.html

Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Photo

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

Photo

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

While it may not necessarily be my magnum opus, this is my favorite puzzle I’ve ever created. That’s because the puzzle is me*. I’ll shamelessly admit that I’ve listened to “TRAP QUEEN” at least 1,738 times. I’m equally obsessed with Pink Floyd, and “US AND THEM” is a classic. I graduated from U.V.A.’s engineering school this past May, though I was an ECON MAJOR as well. CHOCO TACO as a crossword entry feels animated yet quirky, and that about sums me up. LEFT BRAIN? My right brain doesn’t exist. LOGARITHM? I’m a numbers guy. ATTIC DOOR? Eh, I’m weird and have my flaws, I suppose. I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed making this thing, but like talking about myself, it just feels awkward. I guess it’s worth noting that on top of everything else, this is my first true crossword publication since I became the Times’ new assistant puzzles editor! Thanks to Will for letting me edit this with him, to Joel for checking this out over a text conversation two years ago, to you solvers for dealing with me in grid form ... and to just everybody in general for giving me a shot. *With the exception of EGOMANIAC, I hope!

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

LOS ANGELES — A sassy church lady, a group of elite firefighters, an alcoholic detective, some do-gooder Texans and a renegade scientific genius walked into multiplexes on Friday.

Only one grabbed the attention of ticket buyers.

“Tyler Perry’s Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,” with Mr. Perry reprising his gun-toting, moralizing granny, took in about $21.7 million at North American theaters over the weekend. That total gave Mr. Perry his sixth No. 1 opening, bolstering his status as one of the most reliable crowd pullers in moviedom. Even so, initial ticket sales for “Boo 2” (Lionsgate) fell 24 percent behind those for “Boo! A Madea Halloween” last year. “Boo 2” cost roughly $24 million to make.

Ticket sales were terrible for the other newcomers — “Geostorm,” “Only the Brave,” “The Snowman” and “Same Kind of Different as Me” — adding to worries that moviegoing is falling out of fashion, as Americans curl up at home with their Netflix accounts. On the other hand, all of those films but one, “Only the Brave,” a dramatization of a wildfire that killed 19 responders, received abysmal reviews.

“Geostorm” (Warner Bros.) was second for the weekend, taking in an estimated $13.3 million, a failing total for a film that cost roughly $130 million to make, not including tens of millions of dollars in marketing costs, and was released in 3,246 theaters. “Geostorm,” starring Gerard Butler as a scientist racing to save the planet from environmental destruction, likely suffered from a sense of been-there, done-that, coming across as another “The Day After Tomorrow.”

“Geostorm” was cofinanced by Skydance Media, a company founded by the Oracle heir David Ellison.

Next among the newcomers was “Only the Brave,” which collected about $6 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Black Label Media, a company co-founded by the FedEx heiress Molly Smith, spent about $38 million to make this firefighter drama, which was distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment. (It has been a bad month for the FedEx family at the movies: Alcon, backed by Ms. Smith’s father, Fred Smith, had a major box office misfire with “Blade Runner 2049.”)

Scarce inventory in Santa Rosa, with a population of about 175,000 people, had already been helping to drive yearly increases of home prices in the 10 percent range, said Ruben Gonzalez, an economist with Keller Williams.

“So this further reduction in supply is just likely to exacerbate that trend,” he said.

Jennielynn Holmes, director of shelter and housing at Catholic Charities’ Santa Rosa office, said she was bracing for a growing wave people of forced into destitution by the housing sqeeze.

“My biggest fear,” she said, “is that we will lose the amazing community that we have because people can’t afford to live here.”

Santa Rosa’s leaders have been huddling over potential emergency measures aimed at creating more temporary dwellings.

Among the ideas are relaxed rules for granny units and an ordinance that lets people to live in RVs at the sites of their destroyed homes.

They are also looking to target landlords.

California law already makes it illegal to raise rents by more than 10 percent after a disaster.

Mr. Coursey, the mayor, said Santa Rosa officials would discuss making the rule even more stringent. It’s a tricky proposition, he acknowledged.

“There’s a market rate and the market has obviously changed,” Mr. Coursey said. “But if I was king — and I’m not — I wouldn’t raise anybody’s rent right now.”

Jonathan Gold, the celebrated chronicler of Los Angeles food culture, has released his yearly ranking of the area’s best 101 restaurants.

For this edition, a newcomer edged its way into the top spot.

Vespertine opened in Culver City in July with a pledge to “disrupt the course of the modern restaurant.”

Mr. Gold acknowledged that the restaurant’s throbbing music, abstract food and princely cost might be off-putting for some diners.

But according to Mr. Gold, “Vespertine is in its way perfect.”

The restaurant also caught the attention of Pete Wells, the New York Times food critic. Vespertine, he wrote this week, “gets inside your head.”

Check out Mr. Gold’s the full ranking. You need a subscription to access it, or you can see just his top 10 for free here.

Mr. Gold fielded a few questions via email:

Q. How many restaurants do you visit a year? Is it exhausting?

A. I eat out about 10-12 times a week. There’s obviously overlap — I tend to visit restaurants I’m reviewing 4-5 times, but I’d guess it ends up being about 300 each year. I’ve never complained about my job, and I’m not about to here.

A pair of food writers suggested that you wanted to reward Vespertine’s ambition. Any truth in that?

Vespertine is perfect in what it is trying to do: a seamless integration between architecture, flavor and sound. In my review, I called it a gesamtkunstwerk, a term associated with Richard Wagner that means more or less “total work of art.”

Is [Vespertine’s chef] Jordan Kahn perhaps more concerned with unsettling his customers than delighting them? Perhaps. But I think both his ambition and his execution deserve to be rewarded.

How would you rank L.A.’s food culture against the world right now?

I still maintain that Los Angeles is the best place to eat in the world — for its splendid produce, for its informality, and for its unimaginable diversity.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Once again, we have a lesson in paying attention and reading clues or any notes associated with the puzzle carefully. There’s got to be a reason the Across clues are so ... terse.

You did see the note, right? It says “The one-word Across clues all have an unusual relationship with their answers.” No kidding. That unusual relationship is for you to deduce, and when you do, prepare for a fun “Aha!” moment.

Today’s puzzle isn’t all that difficult once you get the hang of the theme, and the crossings are relatively gentle. If you’ve been looking forward to training your brain to think of alternate meanings in clues, this one by Alex Eaton-Salners might be just the Thursday puzzle for you.

Today’s Theme

It took me a while to get the hang of this one, but once I did, the rest of the puzzle fell quickly.

The Across clues in Mr. Eaton-Salners’s puzzle are all homophones, one of two or more words pronounced alike but different in meaning or derivation or spelling. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out which homophone of the Across clue (if there is more than one) is really the clue to be solved, and then you solve it.

Royer half-joked that someone could probably leave laced meatballs on the course and dogs might scoop them up.
— there probably is no way to know for sure what happened to Seavey’s dogs.","It was a familiar response in the sports world. When confronted with allegations of doping, deny. When pressed, raise a possible explanation, no matter how outlandish it sounds. The sprinter Justin Gatlin and the baseball slugger Barry Bonds tried to pin accusations on a rubbed-in ointment. The middle-distance runner Dieter Baumann blamed spiked toothpaste. The cyclist Tyler Hamilton forwarded the vanishing-twin theory, suggesting that the blood in his body that wasn’t his own could be explained by a twin he had that died in utero.

Like most excuses, they were mocked at the time and later deemed invalid.

One thing that makes this case different — besides the athletes in question being dogs, not humans — is that many of Seavey’s competitors believe his excuse. Several top mushers defended him and echoed his theory that something unknown and untoward was at play in the backwoods of Alaska.

“I don’t believe for a second he did it — not for one second,” said Jessie Royer, who finished fifth at the Iditarod. “He’s not that way. He’s an honest, hardworking person, and he sure as hell isn’t dumb enough to give dogs Tramadol hours before a drug test.”

Photo

But if Seavey did not give his dogs the banned substance, who did? Was it a jealous competitor? An anti-dogsledding activist looking to undermine the sport’s top race and top racer?

Those questions percolated across the mushing community on Tuesday, leaving many perplexed. Aliy Zirkle, who finished eighth this year and has raced against Seavey for a decade, called him “an honest and upstanding Iditarod competitor,” not the type to break rules.

“I do not think that he gave those drugs to his dogs,” Zirkle said in an email. “Obviously his dogs were given drugs — but by whom or why? I don’t know.”

The thought that another musher would taint Seavey’s dogs sounded unlikely to his competitors. The sport is a tight and insular one, in constant need of sponsors and promotion, and setting off a doping scandal would hurt the sport as much as it would damage Seavey. And Tramadol would be a strange drug choice; it is not commonly used in the world of dogsledding. Royer said she had never heard of it.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

That reasoning led some to speculate that outsiders who protest the Iditarod and similar events might be involved.

“There are people in the world who truly believe that dog mushing is cruel and should be banned,” Zirkle said. “Of course, this is far from the truth, but lies can be told about any subject and some people believe them. I guess the question is: Are there really people radical enough to actually give drugs to his dogs in order to undermine an honest, hardworking good man? Crazy speculation, I know! But that seems to be all we are left with now.”

Unless, of course, Seavey did it. The Iditarod Trail Committee, which stages the event, does not seem convinced. It did not discipline Seavey, nor ask him to return the $59,637 he won in prize money, because it could not prove intent, as was required by race rules. After the positive tests emerged, the first ones since the race began drug testing the dogs in 1994, the group examined rules in other sports and realized it was virtually alone in not placing the burden of proof on the athlete — in this case, the musher, not the dogs. It changed the rule earlier this month and, in announcing those changes, brought Seavey’s drug-test results to light.

“If you look at the intent, why would a musher want to do something like that so close to the finish line?” an Iditarod spokesman, Chas St. George, said. “That musher knows that he or she is going to be subject to a test. It’s speculative, it’s not evidentiary, but you have to ask that question.”

The closest parallel to the Iditarod case may be an episode at the 1968 Kentucky Derby, won by Dancer’s Image, who tested positive for the painkiller Phenylbutazone. The horse’s owner, Peter D. Fuller, futilely suggested that someone had sneaked into the horse’s stall and administered the drug. Dancer’s Image remains the only winning horse to be disqualified from the Derby.

These days, top horse races have guidelines about security and surveillance of the horses, sometimes with 24-hour cameras in the stalls.

The Iditarod is different. When it comes to drug testing and consistent monitoring of the dogs, the event is rife with logistical challenges that may be unique in sports — a 1,000-mile race through the wilderness that lasted more than eight days for this year’s top teams, each of which started with 16 dogs (usually Alaskan huskies).

Typically, officials conduct urine tests at the ceremonial start in Anchorage, at the finish line in Nome, and randomly at the roughly three-dozen checkpoints along the way.

At the start and finish, and in larger towns along the way, fans often get close to the dogs.

“We invite spectators to pet our dogs, we share intimate stories about mushing and we hope that people celebrate dog mushing and our huskies like we do,” Zirkle said. “It is for this reason it would not be difficult to have walked up to any one of Dallas’s dogs after the race or even during the event and given them a drugged biscuit or treat. His dogs, like mine, are incredibly friendly and are used to kind gestures and treats.”

Mushers are usually nearby, as are veterinarians and volunteer race officials, but not always. At checkpoints, mushers usually feed the dogs, massage them, try to get them to rest, and restock the sled with supplies. Sometimes they will leave the dogs alone while they go into a tent to nap or eat.

“You have to remember how remote this race is,” Royer said. “If someone really wanted to do something, I guess they could. Usually that’s not a concern, at least not in the past.”

A major area of concern, at least now, are the food drops that teams have shipped to places along the course. The Iditarod drops up to 90 tons of the shipments, usually a few weeks before the race begins. Seavey said they could easily be sabotaged. St. George said the Iditarod was looking into ways to ensure the food drops would not be tampered with, perhaps through more security and surveillance.

Creating foolproof security around dozens of checkpoints, hundreds of dogs and a thousand miles of a remote course is a daunting task. Royer half-joked that someone could probably leave laced meatballs on the course and dogs might scoop them up.

One other thing makes the Iditarod case different than others in sports: It is likely to go unsolved. Without a full investigation — where to start, and who will do it? — there probably is no way to know for sure what happened to Seavey’s dogs.

“That’s the tough part, actually,” St. George said. “Having closure on something like this would be the most preferred outcome. But we don’t.”",Iditarod Doping Mystery: Who Slipped Tramadol to the Dogs?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/sports/iditarod-doping-dallas-seavey.html

Cynthia Harvey, 60

Artistic director, Ballet Theater’s Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School; former principal dancer, American Ballet Theater

When Lermontov asks Vicky why she wants to dance, there’s a closeup on Moira Shearer’s gorgeous face, and she says, “Why do you want to live?” Those were absolutely the right words to describe what I was thinking at the ripe old age of 12.

Connor Holloway, 23

Corps de ballet, American Ballet Theater

It’s amazing how nothing has changed, but also everything has changed. Before a premiere [in the film], the overture’s playing, and they’ve put this whole lavish production together in three weeks. They’ve composed it and choreographed it from scratch, and they’re backstage still screwing the doors together. People are like, “I don’t know my entrance choreography!” “I don’t know my music!” And it just reminded me so much of A.B.T. and how we have this miracle of pulling things together in, literally, the last second.

Julie Kent, 48

Artistic director, Washington Ballet; former principal dancer, American Ballet Theater

The storyline is like a ballet of a ballet. So I sort of went along with: this isn’t real, obviously. I wasn’t expecting a wrapped-up ending, a legit ending. I was all ready for the “Swan Lake” ending: Jump off the cliff and who knows what happens? It was a dramatic, theatrical experience. I thought it was beautiful.

Megan Fairchild, 33

Principal dancer, New York City Ballet

When I was young and watching it for the first time, it already looked so dated. It’s like, oh my God, the technique has evolved. Ballet has changed so much, more than any other art form.

Courtney Shealy, 19

Corps de ballet, American Ballet Theater

I saw bits and pieces of “The Red Shoes” on YouTube. I grew up with “Center Stage.” When Ethan Stiefel and Julie Kent [Ballet Theater stars who are in “Center Stage”] started teaching me or I saw them, I was like, oh my gosh — what is happening? The A.B.T. film of “Swan Lake” was my classic go-to ballerina movie growing up.

Marcelo Gomes, 38

Principal dancer, American Ballet Theater; Julian Craster in “The Red Shoes”

My first dance film was “A Chorus Line.” I had more of a love for musical theater than for ballet. When I first watched “The Red Shoes,” I knew I was watching something important, but I thought it spoke more to a ballerina. And I was too young to understand the whole premise: Do you sacrifice your profession for love? Is there room for both of those things? It’s amazing that it’s a subject that dancers have dealt with their whole lives.

Christine Redpath, 66

Ballet master, New York City Ballet; former soloist with City Ballet

As a young person loving ballet, I thought, “Oh, that doesn’t happen in real life, but how beautiful.” I loved the dresses and the romance of it. Mr. B [George Balanchine, who ran City Ballet] was not at all like Lermontov. But there was some of that — the girls that he liked had to leave their boyfriends down the block. [laughs]

I feel the dancers nowadays are more open to the world outside. I was more of the nun type. I was totally devoted. Yes, I had a boyfriend, but my purpose in life was to dance. I do feel that I was more like Vicky than I ever thought I would be when I first looked at the film as a little girl. Or I became more like that when I actually was performing. The love and the passion grew exponentially.

Gillian Murphy, 38

Principal dancer, American Ballet Theater

It was my favorite film when I was a kid — I just loved Moira Shearer. It’s a classic tale about choosing your path in life, but luckily in this day and age, you can have a healthy life outside of dance and be completely dedicated and devoted and driven to dance. It’s not supposed to be depicting our everyday experience and it’s definitely melodramatic in parts, but at least it speaks to the seriousness of the profession and of the pursuit and the passion to dance. That is real.

Sara Mearns, 31

“Swan Lake” was more what I was watching as a child. Doing this project is what really got me into paying attention to the film. I couldn’t believe the amount of dancing Moira Shearer was doing. Even now, I don’t see anybody move that fast. Her footwork is crazy.

Also, what really got me was how detailed she was with her acting — she didn’t have to do a lot with her face. It was very subtle. She had a very wide-open face, so you saw everything that she was thinking. She wasn’t somebody trying to be a dancer — she was a legit, professional, big ballerina. The movie itself is over the top, but she didn’t play it that way. She did it honestly.

Allegra Kent, 80

Former principal dancer, New York City Ballet

I watched it before I came to New York City, and I had no idea how a company ran. I was sort of skeptical about the story in the beginning, about the cruelty of the artistic director [Lermontov]. But Moira Shearer: Her dancing, how exquisite! And also in that first time Lermontov sees her doing the “Swan Lake” variation — the way she used her head, the way she spotted, was so spectacular.

Robert Latzman, an associate professor at Georgia State University, who was not involved in the study, said his research with chimpanzees in zoos has always left open the question of whether animals in the wild are somehow different.

“What’s exciting about these data is there’s some suggestion that wild apes look very similar to what we would expect in terms of basic dispositional traits and continuity of those traits — and I don’t mean just to captive chimpanzees, but to humans,” he said. “The work in the wild underscores how similar these animals truly are to humans.”

Alexander Weiss, who led the new study, said he was particularly interested in examining the personality traits of animals in the wild. His findings were in line with previous research he’s done on chimpanzees in captivity.

“The fact that we’re showing this consistency in the wild is nice, because it allows us to draw more general conclusions,” said Dr. Weiss, a senior lecturer at the University of Edinburgh. “It’s not just being in a zoo that’s causing these individual traits to be stable.”

The study’s underlying data will be made publicly available so other scientists can use them in their own research, he said.

Although most of the animals tested in 1973 had died by the time the recent analysis was conducted, the study also concluded that an animal’s personality traits were generally consistent over time.

Dr. Goodall said that fits what she’s seen, too. She only visits Gombe twice a year now, and only two animals are still alive from the days when she knew them as individuals. One, a mother of twins named Gremlin, has changed a bit, Dr. Goodall said.

“I think the main difference in her personality is she’s become more confident as she gets older, just like people do,” she said.

Dr. Goodall added that she’s pleased that researchers are still finding so much of interest at Gombe, and tapping into the expertise of Tanzanian field workers.

And, of course, she’s happy that the academic perspective has shifted from the time when she was told only humans had personalities, minds and emotions.

“Today you can get your Ph.D. studying animal personality. I think we’ve come around full-cycle,” she said. “It absolutely vindicates all that I’ve ever believed.”",Wild and Captive Chimpanzees Share Personality Traits With Humans,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/science/chimpanzees-goodall.html

A young man seeks firsthand memories from black veterans of World War II. The story follows standard conventions: The crotchety vets are reluctant to share, yet the youngster persists and discovers a story both heartbreaking and inspiring. Obviously, the men have suffered irreparable emotional wounds from a “skirmish” the researcher discovers, in which 70 soldiers went into battle but only 17 returned. We learn this early on, yet the details unspool in a way that is hypnotic and deeply affecting; McBride is like a magician who reveals the mechanics of the trick yet still manages to amaze.

Nearly all of the stories hum with sweet nostalgia, and some even dispatch the kind of moral one would expect from a fable or a fairy tale. When this works, it feels as if McBride has happened upon a new genre. In “The Moaning Bench,” a boxer must fight the devil’s gatekeeper for his soul, like a fiddle player at the Georgia crossroads. The hero, Rachman Babatunde, is “father of four, man of one, son of the seventh son of the seventh son.” He speaks in the braggadocio of immortal prizefighters. Like Muhammad Ali he peppers his opponent with stinging barbs: “You ugly enough to keep ants out of a picnic. … I bet the back of your neck looks like a pack of hot dogs.” Like Mr. T, he claims to “pity the fool” who would challenge him. Babatunde is “pretty” and “the greatest,” but he defeats the devil not with his fists but with wits and integrity. Though thoroughly modern, the story nods to the old-time religion — that is, literature — in which good guys were good and bad guys were bad, and virtue triumphs over evil.

Though the thread that binds the collection is masculinity, twined in its fibers is the question of freedom. In the opening story, a wily toy broker seeks out the one-of-a-kind model train that Robert E. Lee gave to his son, Graham, just before the child died. Emancipated from Lee’s home by a black woman as she emancipated herself, the priceless artifact is now in the hands of a storefront preacher in Queens. The broker, who happens to be Jewish, wants to purchase it from the preacher, who happens to be black — and, more importantly, who has no interest in antiques or money. The train (called the “Under Graham Railroad”) becomes a metaphor for the enduring legacy of slavery. Can cash ever even the score? The subject is heavy indeed, but the banter between the broker, the preacher and his Amazonian wife provoke full-throated chuckles.

Nor is freedom solely the territory of human men. The book closes with a five-chapter novella from the point of view of a nominal king of the jungle, known as Hal to humans although his subjects in the animal world use his “mother-called name,” Get Along, Go Along. Born in the Serengeti, he now presides over a modern-day zoo and mulls over the nature of confinement.

The zoo is home to a pride of colorful characters: a sensitive whale hurt when the other creatures challenge the story of Jonah, a flirtatious gorilla who knows the secrets of life and death, sassy rats who are the only free creatures to walk on four legs. The animals use “thought speak,” a form of communication sincerer than the clumsy “tongue” speak employed by humans (a.k.a. “the Smelly Ones”).

The narrative is a real charmer. In an author’s note, McBride reveals that he wrote it to soothe nephews traumatized by their first visit to the zoo, which explains the work’s generosity and accessibility. But despite its origins as a tale for young people, McBride never condescends. As in all of the other stories, big questions are elegantly posed and daringly addressed.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

They take the modest cash value, if there is any; if it’s a term life policy, there is no cash value.

The industry calls this “reverse underwriting.” When you buy life insurance, companies offer a better deal if you’re young and healthy.
Life settlement still looks somewhat tricky to navigate, but it’s an option to keep in mind.","If a life-settlement company likes its odds of turning a profit, it will buy the policy, paying out more than the policy’s cash value — the amount received if the policy were canceled — but less than the face value, or death benefit.

The firm acquires the policy and continues paying the premiums. Then the company (or a big investor who buys bundles of policies) collects when the seller dies. It’s something like a reverse mortgage, but on your life instead of your house.

“There are so many seniors sitting on these assets, and they’re throwing them away,” said Chris Orestis, executive vice president of GWG Life, who points out that most Americans simply let policies lapse.

For now, life settlement remains a seldom-used option. About 1,650 Americans received settlements for their policies last year, according to statistics compiled annually by journalist Donna Horowitz for The Deal, a financial publication.

But the industry, which previously targeted the very affluent, has begun courting middle-class people who own policies with face values of $100,000 to $500,000. Moreover, in a business once heavily reliant on brokers as intermediaries, several companies now market directly to consumers — like Coventry, the largest life-settlement provider, which runs national TV ads.

GWG Life works with nursing homes and assisted living chains to reach people contemplating the daunting costs of long-term care. The policyholder can set up an irrevocable bank account to funnel the proceeds of the sale directly to a care provider.

The company’s strategy, as articulated by Mr. Orestis: “When a family walks into a community and says, ‘Jeez, we can’t afford this,’ everyone in the long-term care industry should say, ‘Do you have a life insurance policy?’”

Odds are, then, that you’ll be hearing more about this possibility. A business that began with so-called viatical settlements at the height of the AIDS epidemic is now coming after older adults.

Sometimes, selling makes sense. Older people may no longer need life insurance bought to protect a spouse who has since died or children who have reached financial independence. Perhaps rising premiums have become a financial struggle or other needs have grown more pressing.

At that point, most policyholders just stop paying premiums. They take the modest cash value, if there is any; if it’s a term life policy, there is no cash value. In any event, the insurer never pays a death benefit, an advantage the insurance industry has come to rely on.

“Insurance companies make money when people give up their policies,” said Kent Smetters, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, who has written about life settlement. “Now the life-settlement guys are coming in and offering better deals.”

Why sell a policy for a fraction of what it would bring your heirs? One Texan who sold his policy to Abacus took his family on an around-the-world cruise, Mr. Jackson said. But most use life settlements not for luxuries or fantasies, but for medical treatment or living expenses.

How much a policy will fetch depends on its face value and premiums (settlement companies buy whole life, universal life, term insurance or hybrids), as well as on your life expectancy. That explains Mr. Jackson’s questions about my health.

The industry calls this “reverse underwriting.” When you buy life insurance, companies offer a better deal if you’re young and healthy. To get an attractive price when you want to unload that policy years later, it helps to be old and sick.

Life-settlement companies and their investors don’t want to hold onto your policy, paying the premiums, for more than seven to 10 years. “The longer your life expectancy, the lower your offer,” Ms. Horowitz said.

But if your policy looks profitable, a life settlement typically amounts to 20 to 30 percent of its death benefit. That may represent a better deal than simply surrendering a policy, but it isn’t necessarily smarter than keeping it in force.

If you need money immediately and have a policy with cash value, you can borrow against it. If high premiums have become problematic, your beneficiaries might want to take over the payments to receive the face value upon your death.

Moreover, while a death benefit flows to your beneficiaries tax-free, life-settlement proceeds are taxable, to the extent they exceed what you have paid in premiums. And owning or selling the policy could stall or complicate the process of qualifying for Medicaid.

Then there’s the question of how much a broker, who submits your information to several life-settlement companies, will take in commission — generally 20 to 30 percent of the price a company offers.

You could avoid that by approaching several settlement companies directly, going through interviews, supplying documentation and then comparing offers. But some policyholders will appreciate having someone shepherd them through the process, especially given the industry’s somewhat dodgy past.

Sellers found it hard to ascertain whether they were receiving a fair price, for instance, and how much of it a broker was pocketing, the federal Government Accountability Office reported in 2010.

In response, 43 states have adopted life-settlement regulations, usually requiring that companies be licensed and make consumer disclosures. “The industry cleaned itself up a lot,” Dr. Smetters said. “But caution is appropriate.”

State regulations differ, and it still requires legwork and fine-print reading to know how much you’ll walk away with and to determine what’s in your interest.

“You have to really understand the contract you’re signing,” Dr. Smetters said. “If I were doing this, I’d try to find out who the major companies are and call myself. But I’d also sit down with a fee-only financial adviser experienced in this area and do the analytics. Is this a good deal?”

So, caution advised. But simply walking away, surrendering a policy you’ve already paid a lot for, rarely represents the best option.

“If my policy is worth $100,000 the day I die, is it worth nothing the day before?” said Darwin Bayston, chief executive of the Life Insurance Settlement Association, a trade group. “The answer is no.”

After Mr. Jackson and I finished the interview, he cheerfully informed me, “There’s almost no probability we’d buy your policy.” My life expectancy, according to Abacus models, is another 280 months, or 23-plus years.

No life-settlement provider or investor wants to hold onto a policy and pay premiums for that long before seeing a payoff.

The premiums on my whole-life policy are low and won’t increase. So I’ll keep writing semiannual checks for now, hoping my family will pocket the death benefit.

Still, scary news from an oncologist or simply the passage of time could upend that plan.

Always helpful to his readers, Grisham lays out the basics simply, including this list: “(1) FBLS was a subpar law school that (2) made too many promises, and (3) charged too much money, and (4) encouraged too much debt while (5) admitting a lot of mediocre students who really had no business in law school, and (6) were either not properly prepared for the bar exam or (7) too dumb to pass it.”

For an Endangered Animal, a Fire or Hurricane Can Mean the End When a wildfire swept through Arizona, all but 35 rare red squirrels disappeared. After California’s fires and Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma, so did other near-extinct animals.

When lighting struck the Pinaleño Mountains in southeast Arizona at around 2:45 p.m. on June 7, igniting a 48,000 acre fire that reduced an ancient forest to blackened poles and stumps, a scurry of rare squirrels — 217 of the 252 left in existence — disappeared.

Some were fitted with radio transmitters that burned to ash; conservationists deduced their fates. They hoped others had managed to escape.

But for those 35 survivors — biological remnants from the last ice age — Jeff Humphrey, a spokesman with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, was deeply concerned.

“Most of them have lost the cones they’ve stored for their winter nourishment,” Mr. Humphrey said. “How do we get them through this winter?”

The Mount Graham red squirrel is among more than a dozen rare or threatened species that either perished or suffered habitat loss during recent hurricanes and wildfires across the United States.

Southwest Fires

The red squirrel was not the only creature affected during the Arizona wildfires, intensified by heat waves in the state’s south. After the fire, biologists and wildlife officers rescued Gila and Apache trout from forest streams before the water became clogged with ash, which happens when normal forest ground cover isn’t there to filter the runoff.

The Mexican spotted owl, which lives in wooded and canyon areas throughout New Mexico and southern Utah, was also vulnerable. “Its primary threat is wildfires, but it’s far more abundant,” Mr. Humphrey said.

California Wildfires

In Southern California, the mountain yellow-legged frog, of which there were about 400 living in remote, drying streams in the San Gabriel, San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountains, could face a hard winter after fires destroyed their habitat . Dr. Bruce Stein, a conservation scientist at the National Wildlife Federation, said he also worried for the California red-legged frog in wine country, as well as for endangered salmon and steelhead living in the Russian River (as in Arizona, sediment flowing into the water could harm the fish).

One of North America’s rarest species, the Amargosa vole, also lost part of its remaining habitat in a September fire in the Mojave National Preserve. About 50 of the few hundred remaining mammals perished, said Janet Foley, a professor at the U.C. Davis Veterinary Medicine protection program. “It killed off all the vegetation,” she said, “and they need to live in that.”

Hurricane Harvey

Just five of the 29 rare prairie chickens being tracked at the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge near Houston survived Hurricane Harvey. The bird — known for its funky mating dance — was already critically endangered. During the last century, its prairie grassland habitat in Texas and Louisiana was plowed to create space for farmlands and cities.

“It was a devastating impact,” said Mike Morrow, the refuge’s lead biologist. “The good news is we have an established captive breeding program,” he said. “Had it not been for that captive flock, it could have resulted in near-extinction.”

Whooping cranes “dodged a bullet” Dr. Stein said, when Harvey made landfall at their winter spot in Aransas County. At that time, the bird was breeding in Canada, but had it been in Texas, the species could have been wiped out, said Dr. Stein. “The concern is what effect the hurricane may have had on the habitat,” he added. Ocelots (a small Texan cat) and Kemp’s ridley sea turtles, which conservationists feared would be affected, also managed to survive the storm.

Hurricane Irma

Irma hit a number of species hard, including the Barbuda warbler and the Everglade snail kite. In Florida’s Keys — which Dr. Stein referred to as a “biological hot spot” — the storm was bad news for butterflies like the Miami blue, Schaus swallowtail and Bartram’s hairstreak; as well as green and loggerhead sea turtles and Key deer.

The Key deer is “a really charismatic animal,” said Brian Hires, a spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Fewer than 1,000 Key deer are left in existence. All but 33 survived the storm, but may face challenges with restricted access to fresh drinking water. The Miami blue butterfly (there are fewer than 100 left) are only “hanging on in a couple of Keys,” Dr. Stein said.

Hurricane Irma also cut off power to a Florida grasshopper sparrow aviary where the species, teetering on the edge of extinction, was successfully bred in captivity for the first time last year. Hours away from their backup generator shutting down, a service truck delivered 100 gallons of fuel to the facility. The grasshopper sparrow chicks survived. The fate of the Bahama oriole, found only in North Andros, South Andros, and Mangrove Cay, is still unknown.

Hurricane Maria

In 1989, Hurricane Hugo killed almost half the wild population of Puerto Rico’s native parrots — the only remaining bird of its type in the United States. The animal — with white-ringed eyes and a red stripe above its beak — had, by this year, recovered to about 500 wild and captive individuals. While most of those at the Iguaca Aviary in Puerto Rico’s rain forest survived, the fate of those wild birds in the Rio Abajo and El Yunque forests is unknown.

An earlier version also referred incorrectly to the range and conservation status of another bird.

A young man seeks firsthand memories from black veterans of World War II. The story follows standard conventions: The crotchety vets are reluctant to share, yet the youngster persists and discovers a story both heartbreaking and inspiring. Obviously, the men have suffered irreparable emotional wounds from a “skirmish” the researcher discovers, in which 70 soldiers went into battle but only 17 returned. We learn this early on, yet the details unspool in a way that is hypnotic and deeply affecting; McBride is like a magician who reveals the mechanics of the trick yet still manages to amaze.

Nearly all of the stories hum with sweet nostalgia, and some even dispatch the kind of moral one would expect from a fable or a fairy tale. When this works, it feels as if McBride has happened upon a new genre. In “The Moaning Bench,” a boxer must fight the devil’s gatekeeper for his soul, like a fiddle player at the Georgia crossroads. The hero, Rachman Babatunde, is “father of four, man of one, son of the seventh son of the seventh son.” He speaks in the braggadocio of immortal prizefighters. Like Muhammad Ali he peppers his opponent with stinging barbs: “You ugly enough to keep ants out of a picnic. … I bet the back of your neck looks like a pack of hot dogs.” Like Mr. T, he claims to “pity the fool” who would challenge him. Babatunde is “pretty” and “the greatest,” but he defeats the devil not with his fists but with wits and integrity. Though thoroughly modern, the story nods to the old-time religion — that is, literature — in which good guys were good and bad guys were bad, and virtue triumphs over evil.

Though the thread that binds the collection is masculinity, twined in its fibers is the question of freedom. In the opening story, a wily toy broker seeks out the one-of-a-kind model train that Robert E. Lee gave to his son, Graham, just before the child died. Emancipated from Lee’s home by a black woman as she emancipated herself, the priceless artifact is now in the hands of a storefront preacher in Queens. The broker, who happens to be Jewish, wants to purchase it from the preacher, who happens to be black — and, more importantly, who has no interest in antiques or money. The train (called the “Under Graham Railroad”) becomes a metaphor for the enduring legacy of slavery. Can cash ever even the score? The subject is heavy indeed, but the banter between the broker, the preacher and his Amazonian wife provoke full-throated chuckles.

Nor is freedom solely the territory of human men. The book closes with a five-chapter novella from the point of view of a nominal king of the jungle, known as Hal to humans although his subjects in the animal world use his “mother-called name,” Get Along, Go Along. Born in the Serengeti, he now presides over a modern-day zoo and mulls over the nature of confinement.

The zoo is home to a pride of colorful characters: a sensitive whale hurt when the other creatures challenge the story of Jonah, a flirtatious gorilla who knows the secrets of life and death, sassy rats who are the only free creatures to walk on four legs. The animals use “thought speak,” a form of communication sincerer than the clumsy “tongue” speak employed by humans (a.k.a. “the Smelly Ones”).

The narrative is a real charmer. In an author’s note, McBride reveals that he wrote it to soothe nephews traumatized by their first visit to the zoo, which explains the work’s generosity and accessibility. But despite its origins as a tale for young people, McBride never condescends. As in all of the other stories, big questions are elegantly posed and daringly addressed.

MONDAY PUZZLE — The crossword editor Will Shortz has called this period of time the “golden age of puzzles,” which makes it especially funny to me that a crossword puzzle then goes ahead and declares six of its own ages. It’s very meta, to use a colloquialism, and a decent start to our solving week.

Today’s Theme

Timothy Polin offers us a theme set of six words that all end in -AGE, and separates the suffix from the base word to make a new AGE, as it were. Mr. Polin manages to pack a lot of theme material comfortably within his grid.

For example, at 39A, the word BONDAGE is split into BOND AGE and clued as “Period known for its 007 movies?” Similarly, at 50A, the word COVERAGE is split into COVER AGE and clued as “Period when tribute bands thrived?” because tribute bands play covers of songs.

I liked this set, although the top entry, 17A’s ANCHORAGE, stood out to me as a place name in a set of nonplace name words. And we have OWIE crossing BOBO, which in itself is not an issue, but they are not great entries. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, I enjoyed seeing the debut of SAFE SPACE and am glad that it was not clued derogatorily. I also enjoyed the moment of thought I had to give to the cleverly written 10D, when I realized that CLOCKS are not seen in casinos purposely, so that gamblers will lose track of time and bet more.

But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

Kent is exiled, Wilson is fired, or, as we like to say, let go.

And yes, language is here justly set aside; we are right to be indifferent to the sublime. Dunbar’s tone, pedestrian even in anger, is of our time; it is ours, it is us. “Dunbar,” not unlike the play itself, turns out to be a thriller: a crime thriller, a corporate mega-mogul thriller and even, at least in one horrific scene, a sadistic thriller. Betrayals are betrayed, boardroom machinations proliferate, monstrous conspiracies beget more monstrousness.

Still, a cutting-edge cutthroat novel cannot be merely an acquiescent doppelgänger. For the sake of narrative speed and cinematic concision, it is compelled to jettison superfluous characters and an entire parallel story line: that of Gloucester, yet another father of wicked and favorable offspring. We can anyhow recognize who is derived from whom, plucked from one thread of Lear’s predicament to serve another of Dunbar’s. Dr. Bob, for instance, Abigail and Megan’s willing confederate and the slavelike sexual partner of both sisters, stands in for Edmund, Gloucester’s scheming bastard son; like Edmund, the doctor is secretly plotting usurpation. And among the most recognizable spinoffs is Peter, Dunbar’s soused and mercurial sidekick, a feeble echo of Lear’s Fool. Having engineered their escape from the drugs and rigors of Nurse Roberts, cowardly Peter abandons his muddled friend in wintry Cumbria, the isolated lake district of northwestern England — Lear’s wild and storm-ridden heath.

And now Dunbar, alone and lost and on the loose, must be pursued and again imprisoned, lest he somehow blunder his way toward undermining the crucial meeting that will determine the Dunbar empire’s ultimate disposition. A takeover by a rival media conglomerate is an alarming possibility. To forestall so catastrophic an outcome, the miscreant sisters, already stymied by a tangle of treacheries, must prevent their distraught and remorseful father’s meddling. But first, to learn of Dunbar’s whereabouts, they will lure and torture Peter. Abigail will try to burn him alive, even as Dr. Bob looks on.

So much for the thriller’s bursts of action, shock, suspense, unmitigated evil, blood-soaked reversals and the inevitable chase. Story! But in reconceiving Shakespeare, it isn’t story that counts; the meaning of story is all. And it is through the Fool that it comes clear why plot, however resourcefully reconstituted, is, after all, the least of it.

Peter is an antic fellow, a drunken callow clown with a knack for celebrity impersonation — a buffoon who becomes an easy victim. Though comic buffoons and yokels are scattered through a number of Shakespeare’s tragedies, Lear’s universe is relentlessly bleak, and the Fool, despite his jingling, is neither oaf nor jester. He is sometimes compared to a Greek chorus, that droning moan of dooming fatalism; but he is larger than this. His crooked prophetic cry is nearer at heart to the majestic voice of Job’s God: he knows what he knows, and if fear, lust, rage, greed, deceit, domination, revulsion, hurt — all the dire passions — are portioned among the play’s dramatis personae, only the Fool can weigh these all at once and put them in their puny place. Only the Fool can see the pity of it, and see it whole. And what is the meaning of this chronicle of a power-stripped maddened old king and the brutes who humble him, if not pity?

With one exception, “Dunbar” — like the genre novel it mostly resembles — keeps the story and loses the meaning. The exception is the long central passage where, as Dunbar wanders half-hallucinating in the Cumbrian wilderness, the only dialogue is between the mind and itself. A heartbreaking scrim of the broken and unspoken, image upon image, flames up:

“The broken layer of brown and purple cloud scattered in the yellowing sky reminded him of his mother’s tortoiseshell comb when he used to close one eye and hold it up to the lamplight and stare at it for ages, until its mottled pattern of light and dark patches filled the whole visual field.… The hills, drenched by the storm, were gleaming and dripping in the afternoon light. How tactless of him to have insisted on bringing his lumbering body to this lovely, liquid scene, to dump it like a sack of cement, split open and hardened by rain, on this otherwise uncontaminated hillside.… The next thing that happened was that he forgot the last thing that happened.”

Here we can feel the writer feeling, and with Lawrentian clarity: a distillation of harrowed human pity. Retelling becomes reliving, a fleeting wisp of Shakespeare’s elusive breath. All the rest, in the usual way of thriller fiction, is puppetry and plot.",King Lear Is Reborn as a 21st-Century Media Mogul,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/books/review/edward-st-aubyn-dunbar-king-lear.html

Mr. Odinga challenged the 2013 election results, but they were upheld by the Supreme Court. In August, Mr. Kenyatta won re-election with 54 percent of the vote in another contest against Mr. Odinga, who again challenged the results.

Mr. Odinga said the vote had been marred by procedural irregularities and widespread vote-rigging. This time, the Supreme Court nullified the result, citing irregularities in the vote, and called for new presidential elections to be held by the end of October — a historic rebuke of a sitting head of state.

How tense is the second campaign?

The rhetoric has been heated, and rights groups say roughly 70 people have been killed across the country since the original vote.

Protesters gathered in the western port city of Kisumu and in Nairobi’s Uhuru Park on Wednesday to demonstrate against the looming ballot.

On Twitter, the main opposition group, the National Super Alliance, warned, “The primary responsibility, if the worst occurs, lies squarely with Kenyatta.”

Earlier this month, Mr. Odinga announced his withdrawal from the race, saying that he believed the second election would be “worse than the previous one” because the electoral commission had not made changes to its operation or its staffing.

But Mr. Odinga did not file the paperwork that would have formally removed him from the race, so his name appears on the ballot, according to election commissioners.

Last week, a senior official, Roselyn Akombe, resigned from Kenya’s election commission and fled the country. In a statement issued from New York, she said the election staff members feared for their safety, and she warned that the poll results would not be credible.

Hours later, Kenya’s top election official, Wafula Chebukati, seemed to agree. He warned that he could not “truly be confident of the possibility of having a credible presidential election” unless the political parties agreed to dialogue.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — There are two kinds of people: Those who like their crosswords knotty and difficult, and those who pray for mercy just so they can make some headway.

The brother of the renowned Broadway producer Rocco Landesman, who once served as the head of the National Endowment for the Arts, he started at Artforum in the 1980s and until Wednesday had run the magazine with his three co-publishers, Anthony Korner, Charles Guarino and Danielle McConnell.

The lawsuit that preceded his departure was filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan and included accusations that he had harassed nine women, groping them, attempting to kiss them, sending them vulgar messages and, on occasion, retaliating against them when they spurned his advances. The accounts were from both former employees at the magazine and women Mr. Landesman met at art events, all of whom said he took advantage of them at “the start of their careers” when they were “economically and professionally vulnerable.” The suit also accused the owners of Artforum, one of the art world’s premier publications, of being aware of his behavior but doing little to stop it.

The only named plaintiff in the suit is Amanda Schmitt, a New York curator who started working at Artforum in 2009 when she was 21. Shortly after Ms. Schmitt took the job, the suit contended, Mr. Landesman “singled her out for unwelcome sexual attention,” subjecting her to questions about her sex life while “touching her, uninvited, on her hips, shoulders, buttocks, hands and neck.”

Ms. Schmitt left Artforum in August 2012, but two weeks later, after she had started a new job in sales, Mr. Landesman sent her an email, reviewed by The Times, in which he praised “brown nosing” as a sales technique before veering off into a different — and sexually explicit — description of the practice. Not long after, Mr. Landesman invited Ms. Schmitt to tea, ostensibly to discuss her career, and grabbed her by the shoulders, trying to kiss her, the suit said. It also cited another incident in which Mr. Landesman is said to have told Ms. Schmitt that she needed to be “more open to physical contact to succeed” and demonstrated by running his finger down her body.

In December 2012, while both were attending Art Basel Miami, Mr. Landesman barraged Ms. Schmitt with text messages asking that she meet him alone and kiss him for “three seconds,” the suit claimed. When Ms. Schmitt refused, Mr. Landesman sent an email saying: “Give yourself to me! ALL of you = to all of me.”

Although Ms. Schmitt tried to cut off contact, Mr. Landesman continued sending notes, asking if she was making herself “climax” and was “ready to make it a bit physical.” Over the next two years, when he saw Ms. Schmitt at art events, the suit said, he would often whisper to her about masturbation and spanking, and touch her without consent.

In May 2016, Ms. Schmitt met with Mr. Landesman, pleading with him to stop. But according to the suit, he responded by reaching his shoeless foot out to caress her. The following month, Ms. Schmitt sent him a text message saying: “You have been sexually harassing me since 2012 and continue to do so. I want it to stop.” Mr. Landesman wrote back promising “professionalism in the future,” but then asked if they could “get on the same page,” adding, “I’d like to be an ally.”

On June 15, 2016, Ms. Schmitt met with two of Artforum’s other publishers, Ms. McConnell and Mr. Guarino, showing them some of the messages Mr. Landesman had sent. That same day, Mr. Guarino sent Ms. Schmitt an email promising “he was taking action to insure that whatever may have transpired never happens again.” But according to the suit, Mr. Landesman continued sending messages, and Artforum stopped inviting Ms. Schmitt to its events.

Then in May, the suit said, Mr. Landesman accosted Ms. Schmitt at a restaurant while she was eating with her romantic partner and an art critic. Sitting at the table uninvited, Mr. Landesman claimed that Ms. Schmitt had “unfairly accused” him of harassment and demanded she discuss it with him in front of her guests, the suit contended. Ms. Schmitt walked off, but then returned and “listed for Landesman his many acts of harassment.”

Three months ago, Ms. Schmitt’s lawyer, Emily Reisbaum, sent Artforum a letter detailing those acts as well as the accounts of other women who claim Mr. Landesman harassed them. The letter demanded that the harassment stop and that Artforum pay Ms. Schmitt’s legal and therapy bills. Negotiations broke down last week, Ms. Reisbaum said, partly because Artforum demanded that Ms. Schmitt not speak to the media.

Her lawsuit includes the other women’s accounts, although none of them joined it as plaintiffs. While their stories suggest a pattern of harassment, it remains unclear if they can be considered as corroborating evidence since some of the accusers never worked for Mr. Landesman.

One of them, Elisabeth McAvoy, did work at Artforum — on and off from 2010 to 2013 — and described how Mr. Landesman often subjected her to “unwanted touching.” Ms. McAvoy, who was in her 20s then and shared a bedroom with her sister, said that Mr. Landesman once encouraged her to get her own apartment so that her sister could masturbate herself to sleep.

Jordana Zeldin, a former Manhattan gallery owner, met Mr. Landesman at an art opening in 2012 and said that when he saw her boyfriend giving her a back rub, he began to pressure her for back rubs in a series of emails over the next several weeks. When Ms. Zeldin finally put her foot down, Mr. Landesman sent her an email saying she should ask for forgiveness. “How about a small apology,” the email said. “‘Knight I feel a little guilty that somehow I may have lead you on into thinking I’d give you a great backrub.”

Valerie Werder, who worked in a gallery, said that Mr. Landesman groped her after introducing her to one of her favorite art writers at an industry gala last year. Another gallery worker, Alissa McKendrick, said he did the same to her at the Whitney Biennial in 2012.

In an interview this week, Ms. Schmitt said that she never wanted to sue, but that she did so not just to protect herself, but also “the countless young men and women starting out in the art world.”

These so-called shallow discharges mean you don’t use a full charge cycle every time you top off your phone after carrying it for a few hours or plug in your laptop after working on the couch for the afternoon. In reality, the biggest enemy of modern batteries is temperature. The cooler you can keep your battery, either while charging it or while it’s in use, the more you can prolong its life.

Myth 3: More megapixels mean better cameras

When small, portable point-and-shoot cameras took off and larger, digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras became more affordable, there was a brief rush among manufacturers to push out models with greater numbers of “megapixels,” the unit of capacity used to define how much information a digital camera’s sensor can capture. Unfortunately, because those numbers dazzled spec-hungry consumers and could be used to market cameras, shoppers began to assume that more megapixels meant you were buying a better camera. And you can’t really blame them — marketers latched on to the idea, and even now, in modern smartphones, the first spec anyone mentions about the built-in camera is the megapixels.

All of this led to the “megapixel myth,” which has persisted for almost a decade. While most budding photographers understand that more isn’t always better in a camera, shoppers looking for a good smartphone camera, and the phone manufacturers themselves, haven’t seemed to learn the lesson.

Megapixels still count — they do tell you how powerful a camera’s sensor is, which is important for professionals or anyone who needs to print out physical photographs (when translated to paper more pixels per inch can mean more detailed prints), but it doesn’t necessarily tell you how good the photos taken by that camera will be.

To find that out, look past the specs (again!) and to reviews. Even better, look for examples of photos taken with a certain phone or camera and compare them to those from other popular models — or even the one you already have. Look for reviews that mention a camera’s lowlight performance and, perhaps most important, get familiar with your camera’s options. The best photos come from someone who knows how to tweak the settings for the perfect shot.

Myth 4: “Planned obsolescence” is why your phone slows down right before a new model comes out

It happens every year or so: Just before the latest and greatest phone comes out, your phone suddenly starts running slowly. Maybe it starts freezing, or the apps you use get sluggish. Either way, if you can relate, you can probably also understand the common feeling that this is all a plan by tech companies to force you into upgrading — a trick called “planned obsolescence.” While that’s a real problem in some specific cases, assuming it’s the reason everyone’s old phones get slow before new ones are announced is, well, a bit of an oversimplification.

In reality, it’s not a conspiracy, and it’s not some corporate trick to force you into the newest tech, or trap you on the consumerist treadmill. It’s just a side effect of an ever-evolving and ever-improving industry. As those new phones are released, they come with more memory, better screens, faster processors and other specs that, in general, you shouldn’t care about — unless developers start building their apps around them. When they do, they optimize their apps for the newer devices, leaving your older ones in the dust.

So as apps are updated to make use of all of the features on those new devices, they seem to slow down on older phones. And unless the developers care enough to make sure your older phones are properly supported, the problem only gets worse over time. The annoying end result may be the same, but you can at least rest comfortably knowing there’s no massive conspiracy (here, anyway) to make you keep spending money.

Myth 5: Extended warranty plans are worth your money

It’s tough to buy anything at this point without being offered an extended warranty. Whether you’re shopping online or in a brick-and-mortar store, retailers often dangle third-party “protection programs” and “service plans” in front of you, promising that, for a few extra bucks, they’ll replace or repair your purchase if damaged over the next few years. The problem with these offers is that they’re almost always unnecessary — or worse than what you could get otherwise with a little savvy shopping.

In many cases, the pricey extended warranty runs right alongside the existing manufacturer’s warranty, which means you may be paying twice for coverage the phone’s maker already provides. So be sure to research the warranty that comes with your device. Similarly, if you use a credit card, you may even have extended warranty protection through the card’s issuer — check with that company before you add the pricey phone to your cart.

Finally, consider how much the extended warranty costs versus the actual total of the gadget you’re buying. You may be better off taking the money you would have used on the warranty plan and stashing it in a savings account as a “rainy day fund.” Then, if you do need to pay for a repair or replacement, you can use your own cash instead of having to jump through the hoops of getting service from the company managing the protection program.",Five Tech Myths People Still Believe,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/smarter-living/five-tech-myths-people-still-believe.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

He’s got a book full of his own detailed drawings — a cross between Leonardo and Rube Goldberg — of instruments he wants made. In our conversation he mentioned spina bifida surgery, and I wanted to see it. Permission was not immediate: Doctors, patients and hospital officials had to consent. Once they agreed, a public relations person was assigned to accompany me and a photographer in the operating room.

Before the operation started, one of the surgeons who would assist, Dr. Oluyinka O. Olutoye, shared a sobering thought about the potential risks of performing surgery on two patients at once. “Fetal surgery,” he said, “is one of the few operations with a 200 percent risk of mortality.”

Operating rooms are usually kept cool, almost chilly. But not for fetal surgery. If the temperature is too low, the fetus’s heartbeat can slow down too much, so this operating room was pretty hot. When the photographer, Béatrice de Géa, and I were changing into scrubs in the women’s locker room, a nurse warned, “It’s going to be like a sauna in there.”

It was crowded, too. Besides Dr. Belfort and a pediatric neurosurgeon, Dr. William Whitehead, there were two anesthesiologists, a pediatric cardiologist and two doctors who would steady the uterus and help to gently hold the fetus in position, as well as several nurses.

For reporters in the operating room, the job is to see what’s going on, stay out of the way and not touch — or even get near — anything draped in blue, which is the sterile stuff. It’s O.K. to look over the surgeons’ shoulders as long as you don’t brush their gowns. And the reporter has to stay out of the photographs, too.

In this case there were amazing views of the surgery, on three flat screens that showed images from the camera inside the uterus. Because the doctors were operating through the tiny slits, they needed those images to see what they were doing.

People often ask if I’ve ever felt sick or faint in an operating room. So far, no: What’s going on is invariably so interesting, and I’m so caught up in trying to understand it, that squeamishness just doesn’t happen. I don’t like the smell: Surgeons seem to cauterize everything they cut, and burning flesh has an acrid odor, but either it doesn’t last or my nose gets used to it.

At 9:28 that Tuesday morning, the soft Pandora music had moved on from Eric Church to Neil Young’s “Harvest Moon,” and he was singing, “I want to see you dance again,” as Mrs. Royer’s son came into view. He seemed to be kneeling inside her womb; we could see his bottom and the soles of his feet, impossibly small.

The operation was an endurance test for the surgeons. They stood shoulder to shoulder for hours, hands and arms in the air as they worked through the slits, painstakingly snipping tissue, stretching it over the open spine and stitching it shut to make a watertight seal. The spinal defect was so big that there seemed barely enough skin to cover it, and it was painful to watch it being tugged into place.

The room was so hot that I took off a gown I’d been given to put over my scrubs, and I found a chair to sit in periodically, to give my legs a break. There were no breaks for the surgeons.

Israel Kamakawiwoʻole was singing “Over the Rainbow” as the last stitch went into the fetus. By noon, the surgeons were done.

“I sweat like hell,” Dr. Belfort said, peeling his gloves off pale waterlogged hands that looked as if they’d spent too long in the bath.

Mrs. Royer’s husband, Joshuwa, his mother and Mrs. Royer’s parents were waiting anxiously, and crowded into a small room when Dr. Belfort arrived.

“Everything went very well, so you can relax,” he said, showing them pictures of the fetus’s back, before and after. “So far, so good. Now we have to hope and pray she doesn’t go into preterm labor.”

Mr. Royer was stoic, but the parents, the reporter and the photographer all burst into tears and hugged one another.

Later, Mrs. Royer’s mother, Raquel Bourgeois, said the family understood that the operation was not a cure, and that her grandson would almost certainly have some degree of disability.

“But we’re strong believers in God, and we’re at peace,” Mrs. Bourgeois said. “This baby is going to be so loved. We just don’t care.”

She went on: “Lexi and Josh are very strong together. This is not going to break them. They are the best possible parents for this child in this situation.”

They said they wanted to protect their sons from being publicly revealed as having been disciplined, or even accused, in a sexual assault case.
In 2010 her son, Mr. Warner, learned he had been accused of sexual assault by a fellow student at the University of North Dakota.
Realizing she was not alone, Ms. Seefeld helped found FACE, the advocacy group for accused students.","And some of the most potent advocates for those men have been a group of women: their own mothers.

Some of the mothers met with Ms. DeVos in July to tell their stories, and Ms. DeVos alluded to them in a speech she gave last month. An advocacy group founded in 2013 by several mothers, Families Advocating for Campus Equality, or FACE, has grown to hundreds of families, who have exchanged tens of thousands of messages through their email list, said Cynthia Garrett, co-president of the group.

The mothers lobby Congress, testify on proposed legislation and policy, and track lawsuits filed by men who say they have been wrongly accused. A bill in the California Legislature that they testified against, which would have enshrined the Obama-era regulations into state law, passed both houses but was vetoed this month by Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, who said it was “time to pause” on the issue.

The group holds twice-yearly meetings, where parents and sons share personal experiences and listen to advice from psychologists and lawyers.

Away from the public eye, families have spent tens of thousands of dollars and dipped into retirement savings to hire lawyers and therapists for their sons. Some have pressured colleges to reconsider punishment or expunge disciplinary notations from transcripts, so that other colleges and employers cannot see them.

Ms. Seefeld said she hired a lawyer and even a public relations firm, and used her political connections as a teachers’ union leader, to try to get the University of North Dakota to reverse her son’s three-year banishment after a woman accused him of nonconsensual sex.

“I was willing to do everything and anything,” Ms. Seefeld said. Her son Caleb Warner was ultimately cleared after the college took a second look at the case.

The mothers’ resolve comes from their raw maternal instinct to protect their children. But several who agreed to interviews also said they did not doubt that their sons’ accusers had felt hurt.

Their sons may not have been falsely accused, the mothers said, but they had been wrongly accused. They made a distinction.

One mother, Judith, said her son had been expelled after having sex with a student who said she had been too intoxicated to give consent.

“In my generation, what these girls are going through was never considered assault,” Judith said. “It was considered, ‘I was stupid and I got embarrassed.’”

Ms. DeVos issued temporary guidance for colleges last month and will invite public comment while developing permanent regulations. Most significantly so far, she has lifted the requirement that colleges use the lowest standard of proof, “preponderance of the evidence,” in deciding whether to uphold a charge of sexual misconduct. Colleges are now free to demand more convincing evidence, a move that the mothers and other advocates for the accused had called for, saying that students should not be punished in cases where there is some doubt about the accusation.

The most active mothers said they stepped forward because they often had more time than their husbands, and because they made a strategic decision that they could be effective on the issue of sexual assault precisely because they are women and, as some described themselves, feminists. “We recognized that power,” Ms. Seefeld said.

Many women, however, feel exactly the opposite way.

A number of women’s groups and victims’ advocates have argued that a tougher standard of proof will discourage women from coming forward. They have not been shy about expressing their view of the mothers as “rape deniers” and misogynists who blame women for inviting male violence against them.

Jessica Davidson, a victim of campus sexual assault and the managing director of End Rape on Campus, said it appeared that the mothers had a strong emotional impact on Ms. DeVos, who separately met with victims, including Ms. Davidson.

“It is of course an immensely difficult thing to believe somebody you love could rape or harm another person,” Ms. Davidson said.

But, she said of the mothers, “I think it’s the wrong thing for them to do to try and push back an entire movement.”

Of a dozen mothers who were interviewed, almost all asked to be identified by their first names only. They said they wanted to protect their sons from being publicly revealed as having been disciplined, or even accused, in a sexual assault case. The mothers obsessively type their sons’ names into Google, and are relieved when their cases do not come up.

Some of the mothers remember the moment they learned their sons had been accused as vividly as other people remember hearing that planes had struck the World Trade Center.

Alison was pushing her cart down the aisle at a supermarket, looking at Tide detergent, when she got the call from her younger son. He had left home for college for the first time about seven weeks before.

“I think I have a problem,” her son said. “It’s bad.”

She felt a flash of irritation.

“How many times have I told you, you need to keep it zippered,” she said she told him.

Then the gravity of the situation sank in. “I need to hire a lawyer,” she thought.

A female student had told the university police that she had been sexually assaulted at an apartment near campus.

As Alison tells it, the woman had propositioned her son and consented to sex. She learned more about her 19-year-old son’s intimate behavior than any mother would want to know, and found herself talking about it “as if it were the grocery list,” she recalled.

Officials at the university declined to comment on the case, citing student confidentiality rules.

According to university documents provided by Alison, her son was cleared. Additionally, a grand jury declined to indict him, she said. But, Alison contends, the investigation should never even have gotten that far, and the damage was already done.

Her son had become a pariah, dropped by his friends and called a rapist by women on campus. The semester after he was cleared he called home, sobbing, to say he could no longer take it and was dropping out, she said.

Five years later, at 24, he has not received a diploma and is trying to ease back into college life by taking courses online.

Alison and her son were among the delegation that met with Ms. DeVos in July. “It was very solemn,” Alison said. “It was as if we all, everyone in the room, had attended the same funeral together.”

Judith, whose son was expelled, said that at first her son did not tell her about the complaint against him, thinking he could handle it alone. She found out when he was taken to a hospital, suicidal.

She described herself as a lifelong Democrat and feminist who went to college in the 1970s at the height of the sexual revolution and women’s liberation movements. Her husband and their two sons were “super respectful” of women, she said.

“We don’t really need to teach our sons not to rape,” she said.

Four years after being kicked out of school, she said, her son is leading a “double life,” unable to confide in colleagues at work, and avoiding college classmates and his hometown.

Gloria Davidson, whose daughter, Jessica, runs End Rape on Campus, said that as the mother of a 21-year-old son, she could empathize with the mothers of accused students — to a point.

“Any mother is watching out for the children, that’s what mothers do,” Ms. Davidson said. “But I think all mothers should get the facts and open their eyes to what could have happened or not.”

Few mothers have been as public and assertive as Ms. Seefeld. In 2010 her son, Mr. Warner, learned he had been accused of sexual assault by a fellow student at the University of North Dakota. Mr. Warner contended that the sex was consensual, but he was suspended and banned from campus for three years.

His mother leveraged the connections she had developed over years as a high school psychology and sociology teacher in Fargo, and as a union leader. She contacted the State Board of Higher Education and visited state legislators.

Hearing that the university was about to start a fund-raising drive, and thus would not want bad publicity, Ms. Seefeld said, she emailed its president about 9 p.m. one night. She wrote that she had hired a lawyer to look into suing the university, and a public relations firm to help her publicize her son’s case, she said. “Within 30 minutes I heard from the president,” she said, and he told her the case would be reviewed.

A spokesman for the university declined to comment. But university documents provided by Ms. Seefeld show that the school did review the verdict, and nullified it because of a new development: The police said that they had found inconsistencies in the accuser’s account and that some witnesses had contradicted it. They issued a warrant for her arrest on a charge of filing a false police report. (The woman left the state and has not been arrested. She did not respond to telephone messages.)

Realizing she was not alone, Ms. Seefeld helped found FACE, the advocacy group for accused students. She said the group does not want to attack women. But if the mothers do not defend their sons, she said, who will?

“I just thought it was so wrong, and I thought how could anybody let this stand,” she said of her son’s punishment. “And pretty much the most significant weapon I had was the weapon of public opinion, so that was the weapon I was wielding the hardest.”","‘Willing to Do Everything,’ Mothers Defend Sons Accused of Sexual Assault",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/us/campus-sex-assault-mothers.html

On Tuesday, its final day, the congress elevated Mr. Xi, 64, to the same exalted status as the nation’s founder, Mao Zedong, by enshrining “Xi Jinping Thought” into the party’s constitution.

“If Xi goes for broke and breaks precedent by not preparing for an orderly and peaceful succession, he is putting a target on his back and risking a backlash from other ambitious politicians,” said Susan L. Shirk, the chairwoman of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego.

“By taking such a risk, he shows himself to be more like Mao than we originally thought — he demonstrates his power by overturning institutions,” she added.

Mr. Xi’s authoritarian approach was meant to bring faster policymaking after years of stagnation under his predecessor, Hu Jintao. Instead, critics say, the concentration of power in one man’s hands has created its own bottlenecks, with officials unsure how to execute policies or afraid to deviate from top-down demands.

Such problems could worsen. “Mr. Xi’s accrual of power heralds a more determined push around his favored economic policy initiatives and efforts to reassert the party’s role within public life,” said Tom Rafferty, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit. “However, aggressive centralization will also bring risks.”

The lack of a potential successor could be seen as a sign that Mr. Xi intends to dominate beyond this next five-year term, which ends in 2023, either by staying in office or behind the scenes. Mr. Xi may also want more time to test possible successors, while avoiding lame duck status with an heir waiting in the wings.

In a possible nod to concerns about Mr. Xi amassing too much power, most of the five new Standing Committee members were not longtime associates of his, though all have worked with him in some capacity. Premier Li Keqiang, the only holdover from the outgoing committee besides Mr. Xi, was once seen as a possible rival to lead the country.

“Xi has seemingly chosen magnanimity with the list,” said Christopher K. Johnson, an expert on Chinese elite politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Of course, that’s easy to do when you’ve achieved your two core objectives — making yourself the party’s untenured ideological arbiter and refraining from signaling the succession.”

Mr. Xi’s victory at the congress means he will welcome President Trump to China next month more confident than ever in his hold on power and the party’s support for his more assertive foreign policy.

His signature initiatives to extend China’s influence overseas, such as the global infrastructure program known as “One Belt, One Road” and a drive to build artificial islands in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, are now likely to stay unchallenged.

Some China watchers have said they also expect Mr. Xi to place more emphasis on overhauling the economy and cleaning up finances, after spending the past five years stamping out dissent and tightening his control over the party and the military, China’s other political power center.

One sign was the promotion of Liu He, his closest economic adviser and a longtime advocate of curbing debt and financial hazards. As a new member of the Politburo, a broader 25-member council that is less powerful than its Standing Committee, Mr. Liu appears likely to wield greater influence on policy.

In his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Xi noted that next year would mark 40 years since Deng opened up China to market forces and vowed to “firmly and unwaveringly deepen reform in every aspect.”

“He wants a team around him that will implement his vision,” said Evan S. Medeiros, the senior director for Asian affairs in the National Security Council in the Obama administration. “On economic issues, one could tentatively say that this Politburo Standing Committee is more reform-minded than the current lineup.”

This week’s congress, the party’s 19th since its establishment by Marxist revolutionaries in 1921, has portrayed Mr. Xi as a transformational leader guiding the nation into a “new era” of Chinese socialism. Mao unified China after nearly a century of civil war and foreign invasions, Deng brought it prosperity and Mr. Xi is said to be restoring the nation to global strength and leadership.

The congress blessed Mr. Xi’s agenda by writing his name and ideas into the party’s constitution, in effect declaring any effort to challenge him to be an act of ideological heresy.

Under Mao and then Deng, the party struggled with succession arrangements that ended in purges and division. Then, in steps from the 1990s onward, the party established a pattern of installing likely successors on the Standing Committee well in advance, with party leaders serving no more than two terms.

Mr. Xi himself joined the committee in 2007, before taking power in 2012. Before him, Mr. Hu served on the committee for a decade before succeeding Jiang Zemin.

The party has promoted a phalanx of officials loyal to Mr. Xi into the broader Politburo. About two-thirds of the 15 new members joining the body once worked under Mr. Xi or have other longstanding ties to him, including some younger leaders seen as potential successors.

They included Chen Min’er, 57, who worked as a propaganda functionary with Mr. Xi when they were both officials in the eastern province of Zhejiang in the early 2000s. Some experts had speculated that Mr. Xi might attempt to catapult Mr. Chen into the current Standing Committee.

Instead, Mr. Chen is one of four Politburo members under the age of 60 who could be considered a candidate to lead the country in five years — but only if Mr. Xi relinquishes control.",Xi Jinping Unveils China’s New Leaders but No Clear Successor,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/world/asia/xi-jinping-china.html

Houston’s only run came on a fourth-inning home run by third baseman Alex Bregman, which soared into the left-field seats.

When Kershaw was done, Brandon Morrow retired the Astros in order in the eighth inning, and closer Kenley Jansen did the same in the ninth as the Dodgers seized a one-game-to-none lead in the Series. The record temperatures are not expected to abate for Game 2 on Wednesday, when the Dodgers left-hander Rich Hill will face the Astros right-hander Justin Verlander.

If pitchers were forced to work in sauna-like conditions that were far different than the typically frigid World Series games played in the Midwest and Northeast, hitters did not mind.

“We treated it like a summer game in Cincinnati,” Dodgers first baseman Cody Bellinger said. “When it’s hot, the ball flies and we like that.”

The blistering heat, which shattered the previous World Series first-pitch record of 94 degrees set in 2001 in Phoenix when the Yankees played the Arizona Diamondbacks, did not dim the enthusiasm of the crowd, which relished the Dodgers’ first World Series appearance in 29 years.

The visitors from Houston were relative newcomers to this stage, too. The Astros had been here only once before, in 2005, and they had the worst record in baseball as recently as 2013.

To get to this Series, both franchises leaned heavily on analytics. The heads of baseball operations for each team — the Dodgers’ Andrew Friedman and the Astros’ Jeff Luhnow — had worked in the business world and arrived from other organizations where they had success through extensive use of data. Friedman constructed a perennial contender that reached the World Series as the general manager of the Tampa Bay Rays despite having one of baseball’s smallest payrolls, while Luhnow helped feed talent to World Series teams as the St. Louis Cardinals’ head of scouting and player development.

Photo

After Luhnow was hired by the Astros after the 2011 season, the team endured several losing seasons to secure high draft picks to complement some of the young talent in the system, and it continued to make shrewd trades and free-agent signings. Friedman, who was hired after the 2014 season, took over a team that had won back-to-back division titles but had bigger ambitions under the Guggenheim Group, which had purchased the team for a record $2 billion two years earlier.

While Friedman set about drastically turning over the roster, the Dodgers continued to win. Only five players — Turner, Kershaw, Jansen, and outfielders Yasiel Puig and Andre Ethier — were on the major-league roster when Friedman arrived. The Dodgers now boast what is arguably the most versatile roster in baseball, allowing them to pick favorable matchups at their will.

One of Friedman’s most valuable finds has been Taylor, the utility player he plucked from the Seattle Mariners, who has reconfigured his swing and become a vital spark for the Dodgers’ offense, hitting 21 home runs in the regular season while playing center field and shortstop.

Taylor’s home run, his third of the postseason, was the fourth leadoff homer in a World Series, the most recent one being Alcides Escobar’s inside-the-park home run for the Kansas City Royals two years ago against the Mets.

“I didn’t overthink it,” said Taylor, who modestly flipped his bat after he made contact. “I was just going up there trying to get the barrel to the ball, thinking about being aggressive, and be ready to hit the first one.”

Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts hoped the weather would help his hitters if they could get the ball up in the air against Keuchel. But he conceded before the game it would be a difficult chore against a pitcher whose late movement and pinpoint control had allowed him to have the highest ground-ball-to-fly-ball rate (2.12) among starting American League pitchers.

Photo

“It just comes down to discipline, trying to get a ball up, out, over — use the big part of the field like everyone talks about,” Roberts said. “Light air today — it’s going to be hot — so I think for us to try to get underneath it and try to put the ball in the air. With him obviously, it’s a tall task.”

If Keuchel, who had not allowed a leadoff home run in more than five years, was stunned by Taylor’s thunderbolt, he did not come unglued. He allowed only four more hits — two singles to Corey Seager and one each to Enrique Hernandez and Austin Barnes — and all but one were erased by a double play.

But Keuchel did appear to be spooked by Taylor, who lined into a double play in his second at-bat and walked on five pitches with two out in the sixth. That brought up Turner, whose bushy, unkempt red beard, matches Keuchel’s distinctive facial hair that runs to the collar of his jersey.

Keuchel worked the count to 1-2 and came inside with a cut fastball that was belt high. Turner pulled his hands in and lifted a high, fly ball to left field. Astros outfielder Marwin Gonzalez drifted back on the ball as if he had a play on it, but after he reached the warning track and then the wall, he looked up helplessly as it landed in the pavilion.

“I didn’t think it was going out by any means,” Keuchel said. “It wasn’t an easy pitch to hit. I was trying to get in on him and I thought it did. He didn’t square it up by any means.”

Turner acknowledged that he had gotten a helping hand from the weather.

“If it’s 10 degrees cooler, that’s probably a routine fly ball,” Turner said.

Photo

The home run upped Turner’s career postseason R.B.I. total to 26, tying the franchise record set by Duke Snider. Fourteen of those have come this season for Turner, the former Mets castoff.

The two home runs were enough for Kershaw, who has won three Cy Young Awards but has had a spotty October résumé. He had been good but not dominant since his return in early September from a five-week stint on the disabled list with a sore back.

On Tuesday, though, he was at his best, complementing his two best pitches — a fastball and a knee-buckling curve — with a sharp slider.

His fellow Dodgers pitcher Brandon McCarthy said Kershaw had been “close but not all the way there.”

“Tonight,” McCarthy added, “that looked like that was the genuine article.”

Kershaw allowed only three hits — the homer to Bregman, a third-inning single to Josh Reddick and a seventh-inning single to Jose Altuve. And besides the hits, Kershaw allowed just three balls to be hit out of the infield.

On a night when the air was as thin as it was hot, that proved to be the difference.","Dodgers Overcome Heat, and Astros, in World Series Game 1",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/sports/baseball/dodgers-world-series-game-1.html

Since 2008 more and more of the loans intended to prop up Old China have been going to risky investments like stocks and real estate and wasteful public construction projects. While it took one dollar of debt to fuel a dollar of growth before 2008, lately it has taken four dollars of debt.

Much has been said about all the money the United States, Europe and Japan have printed to stimulate the post-crisis recovery, but China has printed more than twice as much as those three combined, expanding its money supply by $16 trillion. A lot of this money has been diverted from industry into stock and real estate bubbles, rattling Chinese investors. By 2015 Chinese investors were sending billions of dollars’ worth of renminbi abroad every month. To prevent a capital flight crisis, Beijing had to slap on new controls.

There is now a great pool of money trapped in China, itching to escape. Foreigners don’t have faith in a currency they can’t move freely, any more than locals do, and today the renminbi accounts for less than 1 percent of the world’s foreign-exchange reserves, compared with over 60 percent for the United States dollar. Beijing had hoped to establish the renminbi as a reserve currency and make China a financial superpower, but it has made no progress.

To create trust in its currency and financial system, China has to quit pumping out debt to hit its unrealistic annual growth target of 6.5 percent. That target reflects the pace required to meet a goal set at the 2012 Party Congress, which was to double the size of the economy by 2020. Every time growth slips below 6.5 percent, the authorities roll out more debt, fearful that slower growth will undermine their geopolitical goals. Continuing on this path, China may double G.D.P. by 2020, but debt (excluding the financial sector) will rise from a precarious 235 percent of G.D.P. today to a potentially destabilizing 280 percent.

The most important step Mr. Xi could take is to scrap the habit of setting growth targets. To stabilize debt at the current level, China would need to accept growth of no more than 5 percent — about the pace of previous “miracle” economies like Japan and South Korea at a similar stage of development. To aim higher is to push China toward a debt crisis that could derail growth for years.

China has been able to keep the debt flowing longer than many people expected because in many cases the state owns both lender and borrower, and can keep shifting the debt from one hand to the other, like a three-card-monte player. Optimists think Beijing can play this game indefinitely, because the debt is domestically held, but eventually the banks will run short of money, in the form of deposits.

For the first time in China’s modern history, total loans in the banking system now exceed deposits and are growing at a rate that will probably push loans to above 120 percent of deposits by 2020. At that point in a debt binge, history shows, a financial crisis of some kind usually breaks out, even in countries like China, where the debt is funded internally and not by foreigners.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Any crisis in Old China is likely to spill over into the vibrant private sectors, which are relatively debt-free. The private sector now accounts for 70 percent of economic output but only 30 percent of corporate debt. The only way to prevent a ripple-effect crisis in the New China is to slow the flow of debt, which means dropping growth targets grounded in political ambition rather than economic logic.

Mr. Xi seems to understand the perils of debt, which has undermined many past empires, including dynasties in China. He recently questioned the official obsession with G.D.P. growth — saying development is “not a numbers game” and that most Chinese care more about quality-of-life issues like pollution. Significantly, in his speech last week at the Party Congress, Mr. Xi did not refer to the 2020 growth target, implying flexibility on the need to achieve it.

But until Mr. Xi outright scraps the growth target, all the players in the Old China are going to put a priority on hitting it, no matter how much debt it takes. Fitful government attempts to tighten credit regulations have merely shifted the flow of debt to new targets, most recently mortgage loans. The International Monetary Fund argues that China is much more likely to “become a rich country in the long run” if it puts more emphasis on slower debt growth and less on hitting high growth targets.

If China’s economy is allowed to slow further — as previous miracle economies did at a similar stage of development — it will take longer for the economy to match the size of the United States economy, certainly much longer than China’s leaders had hoped. Better, though, to be remembered for putting China on the long path to real superpower status than the shorter path to crisis.","To Grow Stronger, China Has to Grow More Slowly",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/opinion/china-economy-slow-growth.html

MEXICO CITY — Ernesto Che Guevara died 50 years ago in the wilds of Bolivia, near Vallegrande. He was captured in Quebrada del Yuro, a barren ravine close to the town of La Higuera, where he spent his last night in a small schoolhouse, which is still there. The following morning, he was executed, on the orders of the Bolivian president and the Central Intelligence Agency officer present during his interrogation. His body was flown to Vallegrande, where it was exhibited to the press. That was when the iconic photograph of a Christ-like Guevara was taken and made famous, along with the photo Alberto Korda shot in Havana in 1960, of Guevara with his starred beret. It appears today on millions of T-shirts and posters all over the world — a world he would not recognize.

Half a century since his death, Guevara’s legacy and relevance is practically nil, in terms of his aspirations and achievements. Paradoxically, though, he became a symbol of historical changes that he did not identify with, that he did not fight for and that only came of age after his death. He is remembered far more for the momentous events that took place less than a year after he perished, when in 1968 hundreds of thousands of young people took to the streets in dozens of capitals and universities across the globe and changed the way they, their children and today their grandchildren live.

Guevara, an Argentine doctor, stood for various ideas and causes during his lifetime. All failed or were discarded. Although initially he was a passionate advocate of the young Cuban Revolution’s alliance with the Soviet Union, by the mid-1960s he became a critic of the crucial role Moscow was playing in Cuba. That mattered little. By July of 1967, when Premier Alexei Kosygin visited Havana, Fidel Castro had aligned his regime unconditionally with the U.S.S.R. In August 1968, Castro supported the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, and the end of the Prague Spring. Similarly, Guevara opposed Cuba’s former dependence on sugar cane. But by 1970, Castro had committed his country to producing 10 million tons of sugar for the Soviet Union, disrupting the island economy, yet nonetheless failing to achieve his goal.

Guevara also fought for the creation of a “new man” under socialism in Cuba, and against the vices of the former regime, centered on tourism, prostitution and gambling. Little did he know that not only would there be no new man in Cuba but also, nearly 60 years after the revolution, one of Cuba’s main sources of income continues to be tourism. Widespread prostitution has endured for half a century, at levels not dissimilar to those during the Batista era, and thousands of Cubans attempt to leave the island nearly every day, any way they can.

Photo

Guevara was known for seeking to spread the Cuban Revolution. He sought to do so as an insightful but ultimately mistaken observer and participant in what actually occurred in the Sierra Maestra: revolution through the barrel of a gun. He preached the armed struggle to hundreds, if not thousands, of young enthusiasts across Latin America and in Africa; he gave his life for it, and they lost theirs. Until 1979 in Nicaragua, not one of the fires he or Castro tried to light throughout the region survived, let alone burst into flames. The results were not glorious snapshots of the barbudos entering Havana in January of 1959 but rather military coups, torture, disappearances and thousands of student lives lost in vain.",What Is Che Guevara’s Legacy 50 Years After His Death?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/opinion/che-guevara-legacy-50-years.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Photo

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

Photo

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

About a year ago, she became depressed and withdrawn and sought help again through Brooklyn Community Services.","She had been living in her own apartment in Queens, but after the diagnosis she moved back into her childhood home in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, sharing the space with her mother and other relatives.

Feeling anxious, Ms. Ramirez started smoking up to two packs a day. “I used to wake up smoking cigarettes,” she recalled. “Smoking made me calm.”

Ms. Ramirez had also experienced a long bout of grief. In one year, she had buried several close relatives who had contracted HIV from infected needles.“There were so many funerals,” she said. She lost five of her siblings in the space of a few years.

Ms. Ramirez was also a marijuana smoker, but she began increasingly using the drug by herself, multiple times a day. “I used to have to do it just to move around, cook, clean, to do whatever it was I wanted to do,” she said.

It took doctors two years to find a prescription that eased her schizophrenia symptoms without drastic side effects. During this time, she gained about 100 pounds, doubling her weight.

For about a decade, Ms. Ramirez has received mental health and wellness services through Brooklyn Community Services and its predecessor. When she started coming to the agency, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, she often slept sprawled on a covered radiator by the window in the common area and did not socialize.

Outside the agency, she continued smoking marijuana. But Ms. Ramirez said she hated how people would look at her and comment on her red eyes and the stench of her clothes.

In 2010, she began an integrated dual disorder treatment program to combat her mental illness and her drug use.

“It was like coming out of a cloud,” Ms. Ramirez said of quitting marijuana. Over the years, she regained her senses of taste and smell, which had been dulled by smoking. “It was like I was waking up,” she added.

Within a few months of kicking her drug habit, she joined a weekly smoking-cessation group through Brooklyn Community Services. “I quit cold turkey,” she said. Most in the group used nicotine patches to transition, but not Ms. Ramirez. “I didn’t want to leave one addiction for another,” she said, adding: “I wanted to make that change. I was ready to make that change.”

Art therapy, offered by the organization, helped her through the withdrawal symptoms, she said. Ms. Ramirez, who had drawn since she was a teenager, took to the method quickly. And in 2012, the organization featured Ms. Ramirez’s pencil and ink drawings at its annual art show. Her series of bodiless faces in pinks, blues and grays depicted long lashes blooming from almond eyes, hairstyles of tight circles, the faces surrounded by hearts and cubes.

Her mother, Carmen Rivera, came to the show. “She said, ‘Thank you for giving me my daughter back,’” Ms. Gwinnell, the recovery specialist, recalled.

Ms. Ramirez is grateful, too. “Thank you for getting me back,” she told Ms. Gwinnell recently.

In May, Ms. Ramirez, a mother of three adult children, moved into a one-bedroom apartment on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn, the first home she has had to herself since her diagnosis about 25 years ago. Ms. Ramirez receives monthly $735 in Social Security Income and $150 in food stamps and pays $162 in subsidized rent. In July, Brooklyn Community Services used $300 from the Neediest Cases Funds to buy her, among other household items, two sets of window curtains, a lamp and a shower curtain.

After living with family for so long, Ms. Ramirez said she particularly enjoyed having full rein over the kitchen. No longer the shadow on the radiator, she likes socializing and sharing favorite Puerto Rican dishes like fritters and flan with others at the organization.

Ms. Ramirez, who dropped out of school in 10th grade when she was pregnant with her first child, said she would like to earn her high school equivalency diploma. Having previously worked in fast food and other industries, she wants to pursue a career as a chef. She might also try to display her artwork in a neighborhood gallery.

But for now, she is focused on her health. About a year ago, she became depressed and withdrawn and sought help again through Brooklyn Community Services. She has not been hospitalized for over 10 years. In addition to drawing, she meditates frequently.

“You have to put your part in,” she said of remaining drug-free. “A miracle doesn’t just walk in the door. If you want to quit, you have to be understanding and compassionate with yourself.” Ms. Ramirez smiled. “Today,” she added, “I walked in with my health.”",‘Coming Out of a Cloud’ After Drug Abuse and Mental Illness,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/nyregion/coming-out-of-a-cloud-after-drug-abuse-and-mental-illness.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Sex addiction has never even been officially recognized by the American psychiatric community. “I remain unconvinced that it’s a pathology in its own right,” Paul Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, told me. He cautioned that “it is so easy to assume that people who behave badly in one way or another can’t help themselves when it may only be the case that they don’t want to help themselves.”

Besides, sex isn’t the whole story, and it’s probably not the main one. Weiner thrilled to being watched, and what he did with his smartphone and crotch fell on a continuum that included his fevered monologues on the House floor and his star turns on MSNBC.

Weinstein thrived on his ability to toy with and torture people, and his hotel-room horror shows had as much to do with humiliation as with lust. His were “problems of power and status,” wrote The Atlantic’s James Hamblin, a physician. “So it feels especially jarring to hear that same person professing a lack of agency.” Especially convenient, too.

Our turn toward psychiatry as a Rosetta Stone for wretchedness is on vivid display in discussions about Donald Trump. Aghast critics chalk up his self-obsession to narcissistic personality disorder and his fictions to pathological lying. But while they mean to condemn him, their language does the opposite: A head case has significantly less to be ashamed of and to apologize for than a garden-variety jerk does.

Their language also distorts the relationship between malady and conduct. “The underlying assumption is that if you have a psychiatric diagnosis, you’re unfit to serve,” Maria Oquendo, the chairwoman of the psychiatry department at the University of Pennsylvania’s medical school, told me. But, she added, there are people with narcissistic personality disorder and an array of other clinical designations who “are functioning brilliantly.” Mettle and morals, along with the management of these conditions, come into play.

Marc Lewis, a neuroscientist who wrote the 2015 book “The Biology of Desire: Why Addiction Is Not a Disease,” has no problem with the idea that someone can be addicted to sex, shopping or the like. He does have a problem with regarding that addiction as an actual, agency-depriving illness.

“Then it becomes a little fortress that people can hide behind,” Lewis told me. “As soon as you go into that territory, all of our mechanisms for living together go out the window.” Free will is removed. Responsibility is expunged. Guilt is assuaged. There are no bad characters, just bad conditions.

Let me be clear: If Baghdad cannot guarantee the Kurdish people in Iraq the security, freedom and opportunities they desire, and if the United States is forced to choose between Iranian-backed militias and our longstanding Kurdish partners, I choose the Kurds.

The clashes in Kirkuk are symptomatic of a deeper problem that the United States has failed to address for many years: Both within countries and between them, the regional order in the Middle East is rapidly collapsing. American power and influence is diminishing there, largely because over the past eight years the United States has withdrawn from the region. The resulting vacuum is being filled by anti-American forces.

While the current administration, like its predecessor, remains singularly focused on defeating the Islamic State — which is, of course, essential — our adversaries are taking advantage of us everywhere else.

In Iraq, the United States seems to still be basking in the feeling of victory after the liberation of Mosul this summer. Meanwhile, Iranian forces are working to sow discord inside Iraq, as we saw in Kirkuk; maneuver Iraqi politics against the United States; and turn next year’s election into a strategic setback that drives American influence out of the country.

Across the border in Syria, the Assad regime, backed by Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and an array of militias, has retaken most of the country, including many eastern areas that the United States has identified as strategically important. The future of Syria is being determined by force on the ground with little American initiative.

A web of Iranian proxies and allies is spreading from the Levant to the Arabian Peninsula, threatening stability, freedom of navigation and the territory of our partners and allies, including with advanced conventional weapons. Iran itself continues to test ballistic missiles, menace its neighbors and use its sanctions relief windfall to harmful ends.

Our Arab allies are absorbed in a diplomatic dispute with Qatar in the face of far more pressing threats. And behind all this is the shadow of Vladimir Putin’s Russia, which is re-establishing itself as a regional power broker actively hostile to American interests — and wholly unconcerned about human rights or civilian life.

This is a complicated and confusing set of problems, to be sure. But Americans need to understand the greater challenge: The Middle East is vitally important to the future of international security and the global economy, both of which benefit the American people. And right now, a network of anti-American groups — at times working together, at times on their own — is trying to drive American influence out of the Middle East and to remake the region in ways that are contrary to our interests and values. They are doing so by supporting terrorists and militias, subverting and intimidating our friends, displacing us diplomatically, and deploying and distributing military technology that makes it harder and more dangerous for the United States to maintain its presence.

If we keep sleepwalking on our current trajectory, we could wake up in the near future and find that American influence has been pushed out of one of the most important parts of the world. That is why Americans need to care about what is going on in the Middle East right now. That is why we need to stick with our true friends, like the Kurds. And that is why, now more than ever, we need a strategy that lifts our sights above the tactical level and separates the urgent from the truly important.",John McCain: We Need a Strategy for the Middle East,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/opinion/john-mccain-kurds-iraq.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

After making $8.6 million across his first three years with the Dodgers, he signed a four-year, $64 million contract in free agency last winter.","The Dodgers want it all. That was the point of hiring Andrew Friedman to run their baseball operations three years ago, with Zaidi as his top lieutenant and a deep stable of analysts and former general managers behind them.

Friedman had turned around the thrifty Tampa Bay Rays, and Zaidi had helped oversee winning teams on a tight budget in Oakland. They have continued to seek undervalued talent while also maintaining a payroll that topped $240 million on opening day.

That creates a vast inventory of options for Manager Dave Roberts, with players regularly shuttling to and from the minors and onto and off the disabled list. Taylor started the season in Class AAA, as did the veteran reliever Brandon Morrow, who is now the top setup man for closer Kenley Jansen.

Morrow fired a 1-2-3 eighth inning on Tuesday and has a 0.96 earned run average in the postseason. Taylor and Turner shared the Most Valuable Player Award in the National League Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs and have a combined postseason average of .329, with seven homers.

Clayton Kershaw, who overpowered the Astros for seven innings in Game 1, said he knew Turner could hit since they faced each other a decade ago in Class A; Kershaw was a Great Lakes Loon, Turner a Dayton Dragon. Turner revamped his swing at the end of his Mets tenure, in 2013, but Kershaw said there was more to his revival.

“You can’t teach what he’s doing,” Kershaw said. “No mechanics or anything can teach the mind-set and the competitiveness, the clutchness, whatever that is. It seems like every single night he’s in the right position to come up with a big hit.”

Turner homered to win Game 2 of the N.L.C.S., 29 years to the day after Gibson’s famous blast to end the opener of the 1988 World Series. And in the Dodgers’ previous World Series, in 1981, a third baseman gave them a needed jolt in their first home game. Coming off two Dodger losses at Yankee Stadium, Cey bashed a three-run homer in the first inning of Game 3 and went on to share the M.V.P. Award for the series.

The Dodgers signed Turner before Friedman arrived, after the Mets had foolishly failed to recognize the swing changes he was implementing in September 2013, when he went 15 for 42 (.357) with five extra-base hits. But other teams quit on him, too.

Turner’s original organization, the Cincinnati Reds, dumped him in a minor trade before he had reached Class AAA, and the Baltimore Orioles waived him after 17 games in the majors. The Mets let him go after a little more than three seasons, and life on the bench seemed to be his fate.

“I don’t think anybody grows up dreaming to be a utility guy in the big leagues,” Turner said. “But I certainly wasn’t angry.”

With help from a Mets teammate, Marlon Byrd, and a hitting instructor named Doug Latta, Turner learned to hit more fly balls, helping start a trend around the game that Taylor also capitalized on last off-season with a different instructor, Robert Van Scoyoc.

When the Dodgers got Taylor — from Seattle in a deal for the minor league pitcher Zach Lee — they liked his versatility, athleticism and plate discipline. But mainly he was just another version of Turner with the Mets.

“Everybody knew he was a great utility player; he was going to help us out in that role,” Kershaw said of Taylor. “But as far as being an everyday whatever-you-want-to-put-him-at — shortstop, center fielder, leadoff hitter — with that type of pop, that type of at-bat quality, I would never have guessed it until he started doing it. He’s one of the elite players in the game.”

Taylor hit .288 with 21 homers, 17 steals and an .850 on-base plus slugging percentage this season, while making close to the minimum salary. He did not know he could be this good — “I never could have predicted this,” Taylor conceded after Game 1 — but he has proved his value in several ways.

Taylor drew a nine-pitch walk to lead off the clincher of the N.L.C.S., a series in which he started not just in center, but also at shortstop for Corey Seager, who missed that round with a back injury. After his homer on Tuesday, Taylor showed bunt in his second plate appearance and walked in his third, setting up Turner’s go-ahead homer off Dallas Keuchel.

“It just goes to show you how complete of a player he is, and how lucky we are to have him in our lineup,” Turner said. “He’s been so much fun to hit behind.”

Turner is no longer a bargain like Taylor. After making $8.6 million across his first three years with the Dodgers, he signed a four-year, $64 million contract in free agency last winter. Turner responded with his best season, hitting .322 with 21 homers and a .945 O.P.S., and the other two free agents the Dodgers retained — Jansen and the Game 2 starter Rich Hill — also lived up to their new deals. Jansen got five years and $80 million, Hill three years and $48 million.

“We brought back the core of our team from last year that got to the N.L.C.S., and we felt really good about that team,” Zaidi said. “But having Chris Taylor take his game to the next level, having Brandon Morrow come in and what he’s done in the bullpen — when you get those unexpected contributions from guys, it can really take your team even beyond your expectations.”

The Dodgers did expect to contend for a championship. They just never knew it would happen quite this way.","The Dodgers Are Rich, Smart and Lucky. And Now They’re Ahead in the Series.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/sports/la-dodgers-world-series.html

All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted.

“These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty.","Silent clues to a violent past are buried among the scores of mass graves that dot Chungui district in the mountainous Ayacucho region of Peru. There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

Photo

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

Photo

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

“ ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ offers us a window into a possible future when women’s rights are eroded. ‘Alias Grace’ offers a look at what it was like before women had any rights,” said Ms. Polley. “To look back and forward is very important at this moment when women’s rights are incredibly precarious and fragile.”

Over breakfast in a restaurant near her home in Toronto last summer, Ms. Polley described how over the last two decades the character Grace never ceased burrowing in her imagination. Her 2012 autobiographical meta-documentary “Stories We Tell” opens with a quote from “Alias Grace,” read by Ms. Polley’s father. (“When you are in the middle of a story, it isn’t a story at all, but only a confusion,” it began.) That film, about Ms. Polley’s discovery of a family secret, confronted the unknowable, floating nature of family lore. Grace, in Ms. Atwood’s novel, is a shape-shifter, too, her guilt or innocence unfixed.

“To be a woman in that time, or any time, there are parts of your personality and responses to things that you’re expected to suppress,” said Ms. Polley. “So what happens to all that energy and all that anger? What do you do with powerlessness? The idea of having more than one identity, the face you show to the world and the face that’s deep within, captivated me.”

When the screen rights came up for grabs in 2012, Ms. Polley pounced. She took a six-hour meeting with Ms. Atwood. “She understood that the ambiguity mattered most, but ambiguity is tricky on film,” said Ms. Atwood. “Grace was convicted as an accessory because she didn’t tell. We never knew, and she never told. She acted as one of those blank screens onto which everybody commenting projected.” Ms. Atwood approved of the filmmaker’s ambiguity skills, and Ms. Polley paid out of pocket for the rights.

But the delays continued: Ms. Polley had a baby — and then another one. She wrote while her daughters napped, but was forced to shelve the pages when a fire extinguisher fell on her head at a community center, giving her a concussion. “My brain goes slower now, so maybe what I’m coming up with as a writer is richer,” said Ms. Polley. “Or maybe not. But I can’t multitask anymore, thank God.”

At first she tried to adapt it as a feature film, but not wanting to lose the book’s density she decided on a mini-series. And coming from the D.I.Y. trenches of independent film, Ms. Polley didn’t realize that for TV, she could have enlisted other writers to help with the scripts. Instead, she wrote all six episodes by herself and while doing so, decided not to direct. “I just couldn’t see it in my head,” she said. “There are scenes I wrote that I have no idea how to shoot. I love this book, and I was not going to see it screwed up, and I thought I might screw it up.”

Ms. Polley approached a director she admired, Mary Harron, who was working in TV (“Graceland,” “Constantine”). In film, Ms. Harron is known for period pieces, but not the corset kind, having directed blood-spattered cult favorites like “I Shot Andy Warhol” and “American Psycho.”

“No one else would’ve asked me to do this but Sarah Polley,” said Ms. Harron. “Both Sarah and I are interested in what is true and what is not true. I think she liked that a lot of my films have characters crossed with madness. And she knew I wouldn’t try to make ‘Downton Abbey.’ I didn’t want to prettify but to really show a brutal, ruthless, class-driven society.”

The CBC, Canada’s public broadcaster, came on board immediately, but a partner was needed to hit the $25 million (U.S.) budget. Netflix, the fast-growing streaming service that is increasingly looking at co-productions to fuel its insatiable appetite for original content, signed on quickly.

“They came in with a really clear vision and a lot of passion, and 500 pages written,” said Elizabeth Bradley, vice president of content at Netflix.

Last fall, “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “Alias Grace” were being shot simultaneously in and around the city. In November, at the industrial Toronto waterfront that’s cluttered with film studios, Ms. Gadon and Edward Holcroft, who plays the young doctor trying to unearth Grace’s memories, were seated in the drawing room of a Victorian manor, their “session” bordering on flirtation. Rain began to slam the studio roof, interfering with sound recording. “We’re also under flight paths,” Ms. Polley sighed, sitting near the monitor.

Ms. Polley’s first feature, “Away from Her,” was an adaptation of a short story by Alice Munro, perhaps the only Canadian author more famous than Ms. Atwood. But Ms. Polley never met the reclusive Ms. Munro. In contrast, Ms. Atwood weighed in on scripts and casting for “Alias Grace,” and spent hours touring the detailed sets with the production designer. She especially liked the “botulistic preserves” in Mason jars in the basement cellar where the bodies were found.

As “Alias Grace” was shot through the election of President Trump, certain of the show’s themes gained new resonance, particularly abortion (the reality of illegal procurement is bluntly depicted) and immigration (Ms. Polley wrote Grace’s harsh crossing from Ireland with recent migrant crises in mind). When I spoke to Ms. Atwood this month, the House of Representatives had just passed a bill banning late-term abortions, and the Trump administration had moved to expand the rights of employers to deny women insurance coverage for contraception.

“We are at a moment in history when some parts of North America are trying to turn the clock back, and if they want to turn it back, what do they want to turn it back to?” Ms. Atwood said. “There’s a reason the women’s movement really started in the 19th century. If they do go back, they’ll end up with [a woman] dying on a bloody mattress.”

Viewers in Canada, where “Alias Grace” began airing in late September, have responded. The ratings for the first episode were the strongest fall debut for a CBC drama in the past five years.

Ms. Atwood said she has “at least two more” books in development for TV. (“We will not talk about them until they’re real.”) The flip side of celebrity is increased scrutiny, and even the most woke star is sometimes considered not woke enough. Ms. Atwood was recently criticized in the Toronto news media for Nimby-ism after joining her neighbors in petitioning city officials to revise plans for an eight-story condo development that, Ms. Atwood wrote in a letter, might affect privacy and trees shared along the lot line. She was not surprised. “I’ve said to people over the years, ‘You’ve just had big success, get ready for three nasty vicious personal attacks.’ ”

Ms. Polley, too, has felt the sting of backlash. She hasn’t directed in five years or appeared in a film since 2010, choosing to spend time with her children and work selectively. But with so few female directors in the marketplace, she’s conscious that some view her stepping back as an act of betrayal. At a party, Ms. Polley mentioned to a female critic that she was parenting, not directing, and the woman made a vomiting noise at her. “The choice I made freely is, I would like to be with my children as much as possible. I think it’s a victory of feminism not a failure,” she said.

The hunger for Ms. Polley’s return now, fair or not, may also stem from her engagement in the past with prickly social issues that remain unresolved. She’s spoken out about rampant sexism on film sets, and against child acting (“We’ve eliminated child labor everywhere in society except film. Kids shouldn’t be in any environment that’s for profit”). In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault allegations, she wrote an op-ed in this paper. In it, Ms. Polley recollected that at age 19, as a young actress, Mr. Weinstein offered her what he described as a “very close relationship,” noting how such relationships had benefited other actresses. Ms. Polley walked away.

“I got off totally easy,” she said. “There wasn’t a moment before this one where anyone would have cared about what those women had to say, where those women wouldn’t have been ridiculed for coming forward, where they wouldn’t have been thought of as whiners or strident or angry.”.

Then she returned to Ms. Atwood’s words about a denigrated Victorian housemaid, maybe framed for murder, or maybe pushed to it. “There’s a line where Dr. Jordan says something like: ‘I wonder how much sublimated rage she must have carried with her, this child harassed on every corner.’ And I wonder, too. I don’t just wonder about a domestic servant in the 1800s. I wonder about women in every single field, every single day.”","‘Alias Grace’: 20 Years in the Making, but on TV at the Right Time",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/arts/television/alias-grace-margaret-atwood-sarah-polley.html

Maybe they can put you into an exam room right away or have you come at the very beginning or the very end of the day.
“If you have a child who is at risk for serious complications of certain infections, like flu, you don’t want them waiting in the waiting room,” Dr. Jackson said.

The policy also provides guidelines for cleaning exam rooms in between patients, disinfecting equipment (including wiping stethoscopes with alcohol), cleaning up after any spills involving body fluids, and general housekeeping. (Certain infections require more than just cleaning, of course; if a child has measles or chickenpox, we have to track down everyone who was exposed and offer specific protections to those who aren’t fully immunized, and measles is so infectious that cleaning the room isn’t enough — we actually have to leave it empty for a while to get rid of the risk.)

Parents might want to ask about infection control when they are choosing a pediatrician, Dr. Jackson said. Look to see that surfaces and toys look easy to clean, that tissues and a place to dispose of tissues are provided, that hand sanitizer is easily accessible.

You might also want to ask how the practice handles children who are not adequately immunized, and whether they are kept out of the waiting room when they’re sick.

Ask, “How do you triage? What does your waiting room look like? Are your health care workers immunized against influenza? Do you have a policy for infection control?” she said.

No matter where we start, we always come back to good hand-washing or the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer. “Hand hygiene at all levels” is critical, said Dr. Mobeen H. Rathore, the lead author on the policy statement, who is a professor of pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Jacksonville, and the chief of pediatric infectious disease at Wolfson Children’s Hospital. Parents should be vigilant, he said, “teaching their children hand hygiene, practicing their own hand hygiene, insisting health care providers practice hand hygiene — it’s O.K. to ask.”

And then there is what we now refer to as “cough etiquette,” that is, covering a cough, coughing into your elbow rather than your hand, and, yes, again, practicing hand hygiene after wiping your nose or dealing with a cough.

But while infection control in the waiting room and the exam room are important, the best ways to protect your child actually go back well before that trip to the doctor. First and foremost, make sure your child is fully immunized, including getting the annual influenza vaccine as soon as it’s available. Yes, I know, that means going to the doctor’s office, but it’s still the most crucial thing you can do, and if you get the flu shot early in the season, your child will have had time to generate a full immune response before there’s a lot of flu going around.

And if the bad thing happens, in spite of everyone’s best efforts, and there’s that dreaded waiting room exposure for a very contagious disease like measles or chickenpox, you at least want to be one of the people who was there with a fully immunized child. “There’s nothing better than giving your child vaccines to prevent infections,” Dr. Rathore said.

More immediately, for any given visit to the doctor, good infection control precautions start before you actually come in, and they involve both the parent and the pediatric office staff. The people you talk to on the phone should have the training they need to ask you if there are concerning symptoms — a funny rash, a fever, a bad cough — which suggest that your child should not spend any time in the waiting room.

If you have a sick child, make sure to explain the symptoms when you make the appointment, and tell the staff if there are additional details that might raise the odds that it’s something contagious (recent return from exotic travel, exposure to someone with a known infection, child not properly immunized). Maybe they can put you into an exam room right away or have you come at the very beginning or the very end of the day.

“We had a case very recently, a parent who called us, said the child may have chickenpox,” Dr. Rathore said. “We asked them not to bring the child in to the clinic. We looked at the child outside.”

If you have a child who is particularly vulnerable to infections, you might ask whether there is a way to minimize time in the waiting room, especially during the winter months. Some practices try to batch the well child checkups, or the newborn and young-infant checkups, for example, so that there are certain hours or days when the waiting room and exam rooms are dedicated to infants, too young to be fully immunized (we don’t start giving flu shots till 6 months, and babies born premature are especially vulnerable to respiratory infections).

Unfortunately, Jeff Flake is only the latest example of a Republican whose willingness to speak out against his party’s current standard-bearer has cost him politically.

The president has spent weeks impugning Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for pointing out that the Mr. Trump is “debasing” the nation. Mr. Trump, as a candidate and as president, has also repeatedly and viciously attacked Senator John McCain, a war hero who has sacrificed more for the United States than most of us can even imagine.

Republican leaders have offered occasional defenses of their colleagues from these attacks: Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, called Mr. Flake “a very fine man” of “high principles” on Tuesday. But they have largely remained on the sidelines as Mr. Trump and his allies have attacked those few Republicans who have dared to call for civility and compromise.

The consequences of this could be grave.

If the Republican Party under Donald Trump has no room for independent-minded conservatives, and if, in the coming years, senators like Jeff Flake and Bob Corker are replaced by fringe conservatives handpicked because of their blind loyalty to this president, it will be too late for responsible conservatives to salvage the party they’ve built over generations.

As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I’m particularly worried by the prospect of Mr. Trump’s narrow, nationalist “America First” foreign policy replacing the vision of lawmakers like Mr. McCain, Mr. Corker and Mr. Flake who have pushed for strong American global leadership based on human rights, the rule of law and strong international agreements. I sincerely hope that Republican leaders recognize this before it’s too late.

As for Democrats, there should be no sense of satisfaction in what is happening to the Republican Party. The balance of two functioning political parties has been essential to our country’s success. In fact, we should take this moment to look at ourselves in the mirror and ask: How much do our own party’s internal battles resemble the fight happening within the Republican Party? As Democrats call for independence and pragmatism from Republicans, we should be asking ourselves how tolerant we are of dissent within our own party and how much we are really willing to reach across the aisle.

Senator Flake finished his remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday by quoting Abraham Lincoln, who reminded Americans on the eve of the Civil War that “we are not enemies, but friends” and “though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.” Mr. Flake wisely warned Republicans and Democrats that our bonds are dangerously strained. Now is the time to ensure they don’t break.

He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly.
He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.
“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

Photo

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

Photo

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

Sex addiction has never even been officially recognized by the American psychiatric community. “I remain unconvinced that it’s a pathology in its own right,” Paul Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, told me. He cautioned that “it is so easy to assume that people who behave badly in one way or another can’t help themselves when it may only be the case that they don’t want to help themselves.”

Besides, sex isn’t the whole story, and it’s probably not the main one. Weiner thrilled to being watched, and what he did with his smartphone and crotch fell on a continuum that included his fevered monologues on the House floor and his star turns on MSNBC.

Weinstein thrived on his ability to toy with and torture people, and his hotel-room horror shows had as much to do with humiliation as with lust. His were “problems of power and status,” wrote The Atlantic’s James Hamblin, a physician. “So it feels especially jarring to hear that same person professing a lack of agency.” Especially convenient, too.

Our turn toward psychiatry as a Rosetta Stone for wretchedness is on vivid display in discussions about Donald Trump. Aghast critics chalk up his self-obsession to narcissistic personality disorder and his fictions to pathological lying. But while they mean to condemn him, their language does the opposite: A head case has significantly less to be ashamed of and to apologize for than a garden-variety jerk does.

Their language also distorts the relationship between malady and conduct. “The underlying assumption is that if you have a psychiatric diagnosis, you’re unfit to serve,” Maria Oquendo, the chairwoman of the psychiatry department at the University of Pennsylvania’s medical school, told me. But, she added, there are people with narcissistic personality disorder and an array of other clinical designations who “are functioning brilliantly.” Mettle and morals, along with the management of these conditions, come into play.

Marc Lewis, a neuroscientist who wrote the 2015 book “The Biology of Desire: Why Addiction Is Not a Disease,” has no problem with the idea that someone can be addicted to sex, shopping or the like. He does have a problem with regarding that addiction as an actual, agency-depriving illness.

“Then it becomes a little fortress that people can hide behind,” Lewis told me. “As soon as you go into that territory, all of our mechanisms for living together go out the window.” Free will is removed. Responsibility is expunged. Guilt is assuaged. There are no bad characters, just bad conditions.

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

In an age where you can order just about anything on the internet, including wine, consumers deserve safe access to great retailers over state borders.","But now, states — urged on by wine and spirits wholesalers who oppose any sort of interstate alcohol commerce that bypasses them — have stepped up enforcement efforts. Retailers say that the carriers began sending out letters to them a year ago saying they would no longer handle their shipments.

For consumers who live in states stocked with fine-wine retailers, like New York, the restrictions are an inconvenience. For consumers in states with few retail options, they are disastrous. It’s hard enough outside major metropolitan areas to find wines from small producers. The crackdown makes it that much harder.

Before the internet, the bigger wine shops sometimes printed periodic catalogs for their customers, particularly around the holidays. If those catalogs found their way into hands in other states and enticed a few far-flung sales, it was no big deal one way or the other.

Broadband changed everything. No longer did retailers have to identify and attract potential customers. With a few clicks of the mouse, eager consumers could seek out wine shops all over the country, scour their inventories and order the bottles they wanted.

“That’s one of the happy miracles of the age,” said Jamie Wolff, an owner of Chambers Street Wines in New York.

Like other retailers I spoke with, Mr. Wolff was not willing to offer precise sales figures, but he said a significant amount of Chambers Street’s business had been from out of state.

“It seems a shame to tell consumers anywhere that they can’t freely purchase something they want,” he said.

Until 2005, many retailers quietly engaged in interstate business without much fuss. But that year, which roughly coincided with the widespread access to high-speed internet, the Supreme Court ruling in Granholm v. Heald effectively lifted many state bans on buying directly from out-of-state wineries.

Though the ruling applied to wineries, not to retailers, Granholm had a liberating effect on consumers who suddenly found it much easier to find the wines they wanted online. The decision also allows the direct shipment of wines purchased by tourists at wineries to all states.

The efforts to curtail interstate shipping, many retailers believe, are a result of heavy lobbying by wine and spirits wholesalers, supported by generous campaign contributions to state legislators and other elected officials. In New York State, for example, wholesalers have given $2.7 million to candidates for office, compared with $678,000 donated by retailers, according to the Nation Institute on Money in State Politics.

“Wholesalers have been looking at this issue for quite some time,” said Daniel Posner, owner of Grapes the Wine Company, a retailer in White Plains. “They went to state liquor authorities and said, ‘People aren’t following the laws.’ Now it’s all coming to a brutal end.”

Mr. Posner, who also is president of the National Association of Wine Retailers, an advocacy group, said about half of Grapes’ business was with out-of-state clients, primarily in New Jersey and Connecticut. He said the potential ramifications for his small business, with its 12 employees, were huge.

“As in anything in business, this is pure greed,” he said. “There are very few industries that are so regulated. We have an authority that looks over us, that makes sure we pay our bills on time. We have a very rigid system in place, state by state. These wholesalers, they hold all the cards.”

The wholesalers, for their part, insist that their interest is solely to protect consumers from fraud, threats to health and underage drinking.

In a phone conversation, Craig Wolf, president and chief executive of the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, a trade group, posed a nightmarish scenario of teenagers in New York ordering Thunderbird — the cheap, flavored fortified wine of skid rows and song — from retailers in Nevada.

“New York can’t hold Nevada accountable,” he said. “Multiply that out by tens of thousands. There’s no jurisdiction for retailers at the federal level.”

I suggested that the example was far-fetched, but Mr. Wolf pivoted, pointing to several cases in Europe where people had died from drinking counterfeit spirits. The states, which have the power to license retailers, he asserted, keep them honest. Allowing retailers to sell out of state, he suggested, created a scenario for an unregulated system to run amok.

“With everybody licensed, the supply chain is guaranteed top to bottom,” he said.

Wholesalers have argued for years that such tight regulation, which happens to be to their commercial advantage, is all that protects the wine and spirits business from descending into chaos. The Supreme Court did not buy the argument in 2005, and to me, their economic interest seems a far more likely motivation than public health.

For years, wholesalers around the country have been consolidating into bigger and bigger entities. The American wine market was worth around $62 billion in 2016, and according to Forbes magazine, revenues at the top three wholesalers accounted for almost half of that value. The more fragmented the wholesalers can keep the market, the better they insure their place in it.

Retailers will adapt to the restrictions on interstate sales, though it will not be easy. Devin Warner, president of the Chicago Wine Company, a retailer, said 50 percent of its sales go out of Illinois.

“We’ve felt the pinch of states closing down,” he said. “We’re just going to have to look for other ways to replace that business.”

At the same time, retailers are lobbying for bills that would loosen restrictions on web purchases. A bill in New York that would permit out-of-state retailers to ship to New York died in committee last year, Mr. Posner said. He is hoping the bill will be reintroduced in January.

“The internet has allowed many industries to go forward, but this is sending us backward,” he said.

Independent retailers also face the threat of consolidation. Costco is now the biggest wine retailer in the country, and Amazon is now getting into selling wine, a move that has been given brick-and-mortar significance by its recent acquisition of Whole Foods Market, which has many outlets with retail wine licenses.

This does not affect New York retailers so much as New York law restricts retailers to one license, and therefore one store, in the state. But around the country it means fewer choices for consumers. Curtailing out-of-state shipping only makes it worse.

Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants’ vast powers might be harmful.
For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable — so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.
Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government.
A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today’s tech giants.","Now, that attitude is beginning to change. I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants’ power through government — and, if so, how.

There are growing efforts in Washington to do something about big tech. The recognition that networks like Facebook, Google and YouTube played a great and mainly hidden role in last year’s presidential election has spurred an urgent effort to regulate political ads online.

On the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five — Amazon, Facebook and Google. Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Steve Bannon wing of the right. Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech. And, as my colleague Cecilia Kang notes, media, telecom and other industries are pushing these arguments on both sides.

But there is little to suggest we’ll see drastic action anytime soon. Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants’ vast powers might be harmful. The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague. The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout.

“Individuals, lawmakers, we’re all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies,” said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power. For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable — so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.

Mr. Lynn thinks that view is shifting. In June, Open Markets was forced from its previous home, the New America Foundation, reportedly because of pressure from Google, a huge New America funder. (Google and New America have denied that claim.)

“Our firing has transformed the discussions among people about the power of these companies,” Mr. Lynn said. “Folks in this town saw this, noticed it, and I’d bet a lot of money a year from now we’ll see real huge shifts in feelings around here.”

Part of what has hampered governmental action against the Five is the unusual nature of their power. Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what we’ve ever expected from corporations. In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships. They’re being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.

They’re creating machines that could one day approximate and surpass human intelligence — a technological achievement that may come with as many complications as the advent of nuclear weapons. And all of them figure into economic inequality in the United States, since their digital wares provide vast riches to a relative few employees and investors in liberal West Coast enclaves, while passing over much of the rest of the world.

But in other ways, the Five do not cleanly fit traditional notions of what constitutes dangerous corporate power. Only a couple of them enjoy monopolies or duopolies in their markets — Google and Facebook in digital ads, for example.

Apple’s iPhone is the world’s most profitable product, its App Store the most important digital marketplace, and yet two out of three smartphones sold in the United States are not iPhones.

Amazon is considered ground zero in the vast transformation of American retail, and is implicated in the unfolding story of how our jobs and our lunches will be gobbled up by machines. But only in the last year did Amazon’s annual revenue surpass that of Costco. It does not yet enjoy a majority share of online commerce in America, has a single-digit share of American retail and is still a minor satellite compared with Walmart’s sun.

Then there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants. We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street. The Five’s power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices. We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them. For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.

“We’ve all become a bit cyborg,” writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in “World Without Mind,” one of several new books examining the giants. “What we need to always remember is that we’re not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.”

The complicated nature of the Five’s power has sparked novel ideas about how to regulate them. In January, Lina M. Khan, a fellow at Open Markets, published an article in The Yale Law Journal arguing for a complete reconception of antitrust laws to deal with the rise of Amazon. Ms. Khan argued that the modern view of antitrust laws, which were conceived under the Reagan administration, overemphasized low prices as a test for whether a company is gaining too much market power.

Because Amazon manages to keep lowering prices, the antitrust authorities have overlooked other harms caused by Amazon’s growth, she said, including the way it has created platforms for shipping and cloud storage that give it deep hooks into much of the rest of the economy. Open Markets has offered a similar critique of Google and Facebook.

Yet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because it’s politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices. Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didn’t need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement.

That, too, seems to be lacking. Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government. European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review. During last year’s presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasn’t done much in office to carry that out. Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods, for example, sailed through regulatory review.

Put all this together and you get a story of apathy and indecision in the face of colossal corporate power.

“We are looking at a set of circumstances where the monopolies have become so much more pervasive and intrusive,” said Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who took on Microsoft at its peak two decades ago, prompting the historic trial against the company.

Mr. Reback, who is now working against Google, argued that the government’s antitrust prosecution of Microsoft had altered the company’s culture — which in turn created room in the market for entrants like Google and Facebook.

A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today’s tech giants. But that’s a big if.

“The big hurdle is, are we going to decide to address these problems as a society?” Mr. Reback said. “Had we been more diligent, we wouldn’t have nearly the problems we have today.”",Can Washington Stop Big Tech Companies?

The brother of the renowned Broadway producer Rocco Landesman, who once served as the head of the National Endowment for the Arts, he started at Artforum in the 1980s and until Wednesday had run the magazine with his three co-publishers, Anthony Korner, Charles Guarino and Danielle McConnell.

The lawsuit that preceded his departure was filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan and included accusations that he had harassed nine women, groping them, attempting to kiss them, sending them vulgar messages and, on occasion, retaliating against them when they spurned his advances. The accounts were from both former employees at the magazine and women Mr. Landesman met at art events, all of whom said he took advantage of them at “the start of their careers” when they were “economically and professionally vulnerable.” The suit also accused the owners of Artforum, one of the art world’s premier publications, of being aware of his behavior but doing little to stop it.

The only named plaintiff in the suit is Amanda Schmitt, a New York curator who started working at Artforum in 2009 when she was 21. Shortly after Ms. Schmitt took the job, the suit contended, Mr. Landesman “singled her out for unwelcome sexual attention,” subjecting her to questions about her sex life while “touching her, uninvited, on her hips, shoulders, buttocks, hands and neck.”

Ms. Schmitt left Artforum in August 2012, but two weeks later, after she had started a new job in sales, Mr. Landesman sent her an email, reviewed by The Times, in which he praised “brown nosing” as a sales technique before veering off into a different — and sexually explicit — description of the practice. Not long after, Mr. Landesman invited Ms. Schmitt to tea, ostensibly to discuss her career, and grabbed her by the shoulders, trying to kiss her, the suit said. It also cited another incident in which Mr. Landesman is said to have told Ms. Schmitt that she needed to be “more open to physical contact to succeed” and demonstrated by running his finger down her body.

In December 2012, while both were attending Art Basel Miami, Mr. Landesman barraged Ms. Schmitt with text messages asking that she meet him alone and kiss him for “three seconds,” the suit claimed. When Ms. Schmitt refused, Mr. Landesman sent an email saying: “Give yourself to me! ALL of you = to all of me.”

Although Ms. Schmitt tried to cut off contact, Mr. Landesman continued sending notes, asking if she was making herself “climax” and was “ready to make it a bit physical.” Over the next two years, when he saw Ms. Schmitt at art events, the suit said, he would often whisper to her about masturbation and spanking, and touch her without consent.

In May 2016, Ms. Schmitt met with Mr. Landesman, pleading with him to stop. But according to the suit, he responded by reaching his shoeless foot out to caress her. The following month, Ms. Schmitt sent him a text message saying: “You have been sexually harassing me since 2012 and continue to do so. I want it to stop.” Mr. Landesman wrote back promising “professionalism in the future,” but then asked if they could “get on the same page,” adding, “I’d like to be an ally.”

On June 15, 2016, Ms. Schmitt met with two of Artforum’s other publishers, Ms. McConnell and Mr. Guarino, showing them some of the messages Mr. Landesman had sent. That same day, Mr. Guarino sent Ms. Schmitt an email promising “he was taking action to insure that whatever may have transpired never happens again.” But according to the suit, Mr. Landesman continued sending messages, and Artforum stopped inviting Ms. Schmitt to its events.

Then in May, the suit said, Mr. Landesman accosted Ms. Schmitt at a restaurant while she was eating with her romantic partner and an art critic. Sitting at the table uninvited, Mr. Landesman claimed that Ms. Schmitt had “unfairly accused” him of harassment and demanded she discuss it with him in front of her guests, the suit contended. Ms. Schmitt walked off, but then returned and “listed for Landesman his many acts of harassment.”

Three months ago, Ms. Schmitt’s lawyer, Emily Reisbaum, sent Artforum a letter detailing those acts as well as the accounts of other women who claim Mr. Landesman harassed them. The letter demanded that the harassment stop and that Artforum pay Ms. Schmitt’s legal and therapy bills. Negotiations broke down last week, Ms. Reisbaum said, partly because Artforum demanded that Ms. Schmitt not speak to the media.

Her lawsuit includes the other women’s accounts, although none of them joined it as plaintiffs. While their stories suggest a pattern of harassment, it remains unclear if they can be considered as corroborating evidence since some of the accusers never worked for Mr. Landesman.

One of them, Elisabeth McAvoy, did work at Artforum — on and off from 2010 to 2013 — and described how Mr. Landesman often subjected her to “unwanted touching.” Ms. McAvoy, who was in her 20s then and shared a bedroom with her sister, said that Mr. Landesman once encouraged her to get her own apartment so that her sister could masturbate herself to sleep.

Jordana Zeldin, a former Manhattan gallery owner, met Mr. Landesman at an art opening in 2012 and said that when he saw her boyfriend giving her a back rub, he began to pressure her for back rubs in a series of emails over the next several weeks. When Ms. Zeldin finally put her foot down, Mr. Landesman sent her an email saying she should ask for forgiveness. “How about a small apology,” the email said. “‘Knight I feel a little guilty that somehow I may have lead you on into thinking I’d give you a great backrub.”

Valerie Werder, who worked in a gallery, said that Mr. Landesman groped her after introducing her to one of her favorite art writers at an industry gala last year. Another gallery worker, Alissa McKendrick, said he did the same to her at the Whitney Biennial in 2012.

In an interview this week, Ms. Schmitt said that she never wanted to sue, but that she did so not just to protect herself, but also “the countless young men and women starting out in the art world.”

Cisco and Google executives vowed to offer something different. They said companies have been struggling with the fact that they need separate tools to manage software on their own premises and those running in the cloud, a situation that sometimes causes security problems. By combining Google programming technology and Cisco networking and security software, they said, tech managers can create and manage software that can run securely in or outside their companies’ data centers.

The idea, said Urs Hölzle, Google’s senior vice president for technical infrastructure, is to close those “security gaps.”

Cloud computing has been roiling the strategies of older tech companies for much of the past decade. The concept, besides letting customers sidestep the costs of buying hardware and software, can let companies deploy computing resources more quickly and flexibly.

Amazon Web Services pioneered the concept. Synergy Research Group, a market research firm, said in July that A.W.S. accounted for 34 percent of the roughly $11 billion spent on such cloud services in the second quarter, compared with 11 percent for Microsoft, 8 percent for IBM and 5 percent for Google. Amazon and Microsoft are expected to highlight progress in their cloud businesses when they report quarterly earnings on Thursday.

Google has moved aggressively to catch up. In late 2015, the company gave the job of running its cloud business to Diane Greene, a widely respected Silicon Valley entrepreneur who helped make VMware’s technology a mainstay at many corporations.

She made a series of organizational changes, recruited new talent and introduced new technology features. In one important move, Google in September 2016 purchased the start-up Apigee Corporation for $625 million, adding capabilities to help customers connect their operations with online services operated by others.

More mature technology companies have taken different tacks to try to hold on to customers. Some, like IBM and Oracle, offer their own cloud services. Others, like Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell Technologies, have shied away from engaging in a spending war in data centers against deep-pocketed internet giants.

So has Cisco. The company, based in San Jose, Calif., promoted a concept called “intercloud” that amounted to coordinating a federation of cloud services operated by partners.

But Cisco dropped that approach last year, choosing instead to help customers manage “hybrid” cloud arrangements — industry parlance for using a blend of operations in a company’s own data centers and those operated by a growing number of cloud services.

“We think we are one of the few companies that can navigate this multi-cloud world,” said David Goeckeler, executive vice president and general manager of Cisco’s networking and security business.

The company has broadly signaled plans to rely more on software and services than on sales of networking hardware, aided frequently by acquisitions. On Monday, for example, Cisco said it would pay $1.9 billion for BroadSoft, which sells online communications services.

Other companies also have embraced the hybrid cloud concept. Microsoft, for example, has longtime ties with corporate software buyers and has come up with ways to run new cloud applications in its data centers or on customers’ premises, said Al Gillen, an analyst at the research firm IDC.

“We see other vendors doing things to compete since what we have is so strong and so unique,” said Julia White, a corporate vice president with Microsoft’s Azure cloud business.

VMware, a subsidiary of Dell, was first known for software technology called virtualization that allows more efficient use of servers but now competes with Cisco with networking software. Russ Currie, a vice president of enterprise strategy at the network monitoring specialist NetScout Systems, said VMware was effectively using its cloud alliance with A.W.S. to court customers. Pat Gelsinger, VMware’s chief executive, called the announcement from Google and Cisco a “validation” of his own company’s vision.

Cisco also cooperates in various ways with A.W.S. and Microsoft in cloud computing. But Mr. Goeckeler said that the Google relationship was particularly potent because of the technological specialties of each company.

“We are both users of each other’s products,” said Mr. Hölzle of Google.

How well do air purifiers work?

In Mr. Heffernan’s in-depth test and review of HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Arrestance) air purifiers for Wirecutter, he found that on the whole, they are extremely effective at reducing the particle pollution in your home. Air purifiers capture small particles in the air that are generally not visible to the naked eye by trapping them in a dense mat of fine fibers.

To put it simply, they draw in polluted air, trap the particles, then blow out clean air.

In order to be HEPA certified, air filters have to remove 99.97 percent of particles that are exactly 0.3 microns in diameter — a size that’s especially difficult to filter mechanically. The models Wirecutter has tested were able to remove virtually all particles as small as 0.01 micron, one-thirtieth the HEPA standard.

Again, while the long-term effects of short-term smoke exposure may be low, any kind of particle pollution can still affect our health, and that pollution is more concentrated indoors — meaning nearly all of us can benefit from cleaner air.

“Most of us spend a lot of time indoors,” Mr. Heffernan said. “And indoor air is more polluted than outdoor air. It kind of comes down to what we have in our homes: pets, rugs, furniture that traps dust. And many homes are not terribly well ventilated.”

Especially if you’re older or have asthma or other respiratory conditions, you may want to consider an air purifier. All of the HEPA-certified models Mr. Heffernan tested with his colleague John Holecek were effective at removing particulate pollution.

For homes in smoke-prone areas, including those near wildfire-affected areas, Heffernan suggested running the purifier on high for an hour, then turning it down to medium or low, which should keep the amount of smoke in your home to a minimum.

How to choose an air purifier

When choosing an air purifier, it’s important to ensure first that the purifier is indeed HEPA certified; it’ll usually be listed as “true HEPA.” You’ll also want a model with a tight seal around the filter. “If it’s not well sealed, air is going to flow around the edges,” Mr. Heffernan said. “If it’s letting dirty air around the edges, you’re not getting the full effect.”

Some models may list a CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) rating. This measures the volume of air that will pass through the unit, telling you how efficiently the model will work depending on the size of the room. Mr. Heffernan suggested looking for a CADR rating of at least 200, which means the unit effectively delivers the equivalent of 200 cubic feet of pure air per minute.

These models are often recommended for smaller rooms of about 300 square feet, and they will cycle the air four to five times per hour in a room that size, ensuring that pollutants are filtered quickly. This isn’t to say a model with a 200 CADR rating won’t work in a larger room, but it will work more slowly.

If you’re looking for a more cost-effective solution, you can also upgrade your existing HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system to improve air quality.

HVAC systems come with basic filters that trap larger particles, like pet hair. You can upgrade your filter to one that traps smaller particles, as noted by the filter’s MERV rating, or Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value. This metric indicates how efficiently the filter will reduce particulates that pass through it.

The higher the number, the better the rating. According to the E.P.A., “Filters with a MERV between 7 and 13 are likely to be nearly as effective as true HEPA filters at controlling most airborne indoor particles.” There are also “whole house” purifiers that provide true HEPA filtration in HVAC systems, but these are expensive and may require upgrading your home’s air handler.

As effective as HEPA-certified air purifiers are, some come with dubious additional features. Many of them claim to produce ozone to destroy pathogens, which sounds impressive, but the California Air Resources Board warns against them. Ozone, or O3, is a respiratory system irritant that can cause health problems.

A 2008 ARB report said the “introduction of any amount of ozone into indoor spaces may result in increased levels of formaldehyde, ultrafine particles, and other pollutants.” In fact, if you are indeed in California, you may not even be able to order these types of units on Amazon.

Many purifiers claim to reduce VOCs, or volatile organic compounds, using an activated charcoal filter. “Very few of them actually do,” Mr. Heffernan added. “It comes down to the mass of the activated charcoal filter.” In order to be effective, the activated charcoal filter would have to be a minimum of five pounds to have any statistically significant effect, he said. Most contain a tiny fraction of that.

How to care for your air purifier

Maintenance of your air purifier should be minimal. Most HEPA filters are designed to run continuously for a year, though many manufacturers recommend checking them every six months. If there’s a fair amount of buildup on your filter, or you just want peace of mind, simply replace it.

Beyond purifying your air, there are additional precautions to take if you live in a smoke-adjacent area or you’re concerned about pollutants.

Many of these tips are common sense: Keep your windows closed, and avoid spending too much time outdoors to keep from bringing particulates into your home.

“I would also recommend simple tasks, like washing your sheets and pillowcases. You don’t want to spend eight to 10 hours on sheets filled with smoke,” Mr. Heffernan said. And if you’re planning to vacuum, remember that vacuuming can also kick up dust and smoke that has settled, so mopping may be a better approach.

Finally, if you’re using a paper face mask instead, or want one so you can go outside in a smoke-adjacent area, keep in mind that most of them have limited utility, as the E.P.A. points out in its guide. In order to offer adequate protection from smoke particles, you would need a mask that’s rated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as N95 or P100. These ratings indicate that the mask or respirator blocks out 95 to 99.9 percent of particles 0.3 microns or larger.

“So if you’re going to be outside and you want a mask, you need one of these certified masks,” Mr. Heffernan said. “A paper one won’t do any harm, but it shouldn’t give you a false sense of security.”",What to Know Before Buying an Air Purifier to Clear Wildfire Smoke,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/smarter-living/what-to-know-before-buying-an-air-purifier.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Fear can hold people back in many facets of their lives, but it’s especially true when it comes to learning to solve puzzles. For some reason, many people have surprisingly little faith in their abilities, and I wish I could convince them that they know so much more than they think they do and can do so much more than they believe they can.

Aisha Tyler, actress and co-host of CBS’s “The Talk,” demonstrates this by regaling readers of her book, “Self-Inflicted Wounds: Heartwarming Tales of Epic Humiliation,” with tales of mistakes she has made and decisions she has deeply regretted. All of these are told to let us in on the wisdom she has learned along the way, and might serve to make people feel a lot better about themselves. Nothing binds us like our shared human foibles.

“We hear from subway riders all day long, and their opinion is unanimous: Mayor, fund the subway repair plan and get the sleeping homeless off the trains,” he said. “It’s the mayor’s job.”

The bickering over the subway — and the police — comes in the wake of a summertime skirmish over responsibility for the beleaguered system, and who should pay for its repairs. It also marks another low water mark in the relationship between the mayor and the governor, a pair of Democrats who apparently cannot get along for any extended period of time.

Over the last week, the mayor and governor also tussled over the concept of congestion pricing for city traffic (Mr. Cuomo likes, Mr. de Blasio does not), and the notion of testing self-driving cars on city streets (same).

And as is often the way, the vitriol flowed downhill, as aides sniped on behalf of their bosses, including Eric Phillips, the mayor’s spokesman, who on Monday shot down an invitation from Mr. Cuomo to join a panel on traffic congestion in the city by saying, “We have more important things to do than be involved in that charade.”

The comments from Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Lhota provoked a rare response from the Police Department itself, which noted that the subways remain “among the safest places in the safest city in America.”

“The chance of being a victim of a major crime is roughly one in a million,” said Stephen P. Davis, a police spokesman. “Any other characterization denigrates the hard work of the men and women of the N.Y.P.D.”

Mr. Davis also noted that “quality-of-life enforcement in transit remains a priority,” with more than “10,000 contacts in 2017 with homeless people to offer services and shelter.” But most of those people refused services, he said.

Meanwhile, Patrick J. Lynch, the president of New York City Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, said on Tuesday that he supported the governor’s statement that “nobody should be sleeping on the subway and New York City police officers play a role in preventing that from happening.” Mr. Lynch — whose organization has feted the governor and clashed with the mayor — added: “We wish the rest of our elected leaders would support us in that effort.”

For his part, Mr. de Blasio offered some conciliatory talk, though he said he wondered about the governor’s motives, noting that he, too, had said on Sunday that he thought the homeless man sleeping under the bench was inappropriate. But the mayor also said that he and the police took responsibility for the homeless issue, while suggesting that there had been some confusion from Mr. Cuomo’s camp about his comments.

“I don’t know why he would criticize the N.Y.P.D., which is doing an outstanding job,” the mayor said, at an event in Brooklyn on Tuesday. “But I also think there were some mixed signals in what was presented to him.”

The governor’s office stressed that Mr. Cuomo’s statements were not meant as an attack on the police, and late Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Lhota issued another statement, saying that “the mayor’s words acknowledging his responsibility speak for themselves.”

”No one is criticizing the N.Y.P.D.; they should be praised for their work in reducing crime,” Mr. Lhota said. “The issue is mayoral policy applied to the N.Y.P.D.”

And despite another round with the governor, Mr. de Blasio seemed almost amused when asked on Tuesday about whether his relationship with Mr. Cuomo had deteriorated.

“No,” he said, drawing a laugh from reporters. “It’s pretty much consistent.”",Spat Over a Sleeping Man Draws Police Into Cuomo and de Blasio’s Feud,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/nyregion/cuomo-de-blasio-nypd-subway-homeless.html

Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, I express myself with images.”

Its contact book was unrivaled, with the company once having retained former President George Bush and the former British prime minister John Major as advisers.

Though Carlyle was once best known for deals with defense businesses — it once owned companies like United Defense Industries and the military communications arm of Magnavox — it has since become a major investor in a wide range of sectors.

Current prominent stakes include holdings in Getty Images and in the health supplements maker Nature’s Bounty, while past deals have included investments in Dunkin’ Brands and Beats Electronics. Founded in 1987, Carlyle employs more than 1,500 people in 31 offices around the world.

According to Wednesday’s announcement, Kewsong Lee and Glenn A. Youngkin will become the private equity firm’s co-chief executives, and Peter J. Clare was named the firm’s co-chief investment officer. All three men are also joining the board of directors. They will take on their new roles on Jan. 1.

“These promotions ensure continuity in our leadership and maintain the investment processes that have driven our success for 30 years,” Carlyle’s co-founders, William E. Conway Jr., Daniel A. D’Aniello and Mr. Rubenstein, said in a news release. “Kewsong and Glenn are proven leaders who have strong records of accomplishment at Carlyle,” they added.

After the promotions, Mr. D’Aniello, who is currently Carlyle’s chairman, will become chairman emeritus. He will continue to serve on the firm’s board. Mr. Conway and Mr. Rubenstein, who currently serve as co-chief executives, will become co-executive chairmen of the company.

“As founders, we are passionate about Carlyle,” the statement said. “We will continue to be actively engaged at Carlyle. We are fully committed to and confident in the firm’s future and will continue to be substantial investors in Carlyle funds for years to come.”

Carlyle is the latest private equity firm to undergo a generational transfer of power.

Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, another industry behemoth, said in July its septuagenarian co-founders would hand over the reins to a pair of 40-somethings. Elsewhere, Jonathan D. Gray has long been the heir apparent to take over from Stephen A. Schwarzman at the Blackstone Group. TPG Capital and Warburg Pincus have also either picked their next chiefs, or transitioned to a new set of leaders.

Still, such shifts remain rare in the world of private equity, where many of the industry’s icons — from Mr. Schwarzman to Mr. Rubenstein — continue to drum up deals and raise money from investors.

In the case of Carlyle, Mr. Youngkin, 50, is currently the firm’s president and chief operating officer and has been with the firm for 23 years. He has served in a variety of leadership and investment roles at the company, including interim chief financial officer and global head of the industrial sector investment team.

He was still under contract to Ballet Theater, as were six of the eight members who joined his new troupe.
But Ballet Theater demanded that Mr. Wayne disband his new company or leave.
In high school, Mr. Wayne pulled pranks and could be obstreperous, Mr. Walker said.
“People can go to rock concerts and get stoned,” Mr. Wayne told The Clarion-Ledger of Jackson, Miss., in 1979.","Mr. Wayne, whose display of virtuosic talent that night occurred about midway through a career spent performing with elite ballet companies and leading his own, died on Oct. 18 in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 72.

The cause was respiratory failure, his nephew Richard Wendelken said.

Brash and charismatic, Mr. Wayne had matinee idol looks that made teenage girls scream and a rebellious streak that earned him the nickname the Bad Lad of Ballet. Starting in the 1960s, he danced with the Harkness Ballet, then became a principal dancer with the Joffrey Ballet and American Ballet Theater.

He preferred contemporary ballet, and modern dance, to classical ballet.

“He wanted to get away from princes and being the male support for a ballerina; he wanted equal time, if not more time,” Norman Walker, a longtime mentor who taught Mr. Wayne modern dance at the High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan, said in a telephone interview. “He didn’t have beautiful feet, so he didn’t have the best lines for strictly classical ballet works.”

When Mr. Wayne danced the lead in Eugene Loring’s “Billy the Kid” for Ballet Theater in 1975, he portrayed him as the boy next door as well as a pathological gangster. Reviewing his performance in The New York Times, Clive Barnes wrote that Mr. Wayne was “perfectly cast” and that he was a “very strong dancer but also a very fine actor who always moves with intent.”

Mr. Wayne, who did not especially like working for others, formed Dancers in late 1975. He was still under contract to Ballet Theater, as were six of the eight members who joined his new troupe. He said he wanted to provide dancers with work when they were idle. But Ballet Theater demanded that Mr. Wayne disband his new company or leave.

He relented and stayed with Ballet Theater until the next year, when he reformed Dancers, with substantial financial support from Joanne Woodward, the actress and balletomane. They had been friends since Mr. Wayne, while still dancing with the Joffrey, had a small role in the film “Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams” (1973), which starred Ms. Woodward. It was his only movie credit.

Ms. Woodward, with whom he had one scene, encouraged his desire to form Dancers (originally called Dennis Wayne’s Dancers). She invested at least $400,000 to start the company and keep it going, and served on its board.

In 1980, after Dancers had completed a successful two-week season in Paris — Le Monde declared that Mr. Wayne’s dancing was the equal of Rudolf Nureyev’s and Mikhail Baryshnikov’s — he was traveling from Paris to Basel, Switzerland, when his limousine braked suddenly, flipped over three times and rolled down a nine-foot embankment.

With serious injuries to his back and a hip, he was told that he would never dance again. During his recovery, he turned to choreography. And in 1986, with his injuries healed, he danced in one of his ballets, “Moments Passing … ” He also teamed up with Helene Roux, a French dancer and his wife at the time, in “Fantasy of a Wayfarer,” a piece by Mr. Walker.

“The two danced the piece’s central duet with a fluid, sculptural grace made even more arresting by the genuine delight each appeared to have in the other,” Carolyn Jack wrote in The Palm Beach Post. “Though in his 40s, Wayne still possessed a control and expressive strength younger dancers might well envy.”

Dennis Wayne Wendelken was born on July 19, 1945, in St. Petersburg, Fla., and moved to Brooklyn with his family as an infant. Shortly after, he won a crawling contest in Palisades Park, N.J., defeating 29 other babies over a 100-foot course.

His parents, Walter and Barbara, were dancers who formed an acrobatic act, Taffy ’n’ Terry and Trio, with Dennis and his older siblings, Sandra and Roger. As The Brooklyn Daily Eagle described their routine in 1952, the elder Wendelkens lifted each other in the air and did contortions. Roger did handstands on his father’s upraised feet, Sandra stood erect on his father’s outstretched hand, and Dennis, then 7 years old, did exercises while his father held him on his hands, feet or back.

Mr. Wayne, who lived in West Palm Beach, is survived by his brother and sister.

In high school, Mr. Wayne pulled pranks and could be obstreperous, Mr. Walker said. He recalled once telling Mr. Wayne that he would kick him out of the dance class if he did not give it his full attention.

“He was boiling mad,” Mr. Walker said. “He was clenching his fist and wanted to hit me. Tensely, he said, ‘Mr. Walker, may I be excused for a moment?’ The boys’ dressing room was in the studio, and the entire class got hysterical listening to him punching the lockers, kicking and cursing and yelling at himself while we all waited.”

When the door opened, Mr. Wayne walked out, his anger dissipated, and the class continued.

“At rehearsals and performances,” Mr. Walker added, “he was a hard worker and brilliant partner. He was totally committed to dance.”

When Mr. Wayne joined the Harkness Ballet in 1964, Lawrence Rhodes was already there.

“He was always aggressive and ready to pay the price,” Mr. Rhodes, the artistic director emeritus of the dance division at the Juilliard School, said in an interview. “He had a huge amount of passion and a very intense engagement in all that he did.”

That passion led him to wonder why ballet was not as popular as rock music.

Moore was also removed from the Alabama Supreme Court for violating judicial ethics. He has said that Muslims should not be allowed in Congress and suggested that 9/11 was the result of this country’s godlessness. (If you want to read the full comments yourself, you can do so via CNN, Time and The Hill.)

So far, only one Republican senator has spoken out against Moore, according to Politico. His name is Jeff Flake. “When we disagree with something so fundamental,” he said last month, “we ought to stand up and say, ‘That’s not right, that’s not our party, that is not us.’”

I leave you with a longer excerpt from Flake’s prepared remarks yesterday than you’re likely to find in most news stories:

“Acting on conscience and principle is the manner in which we express our moral selves, and as such, loyalty to conscience and principle should supersede loyalty to any man or party. We can all be forgiven for failing in that measure from time to time. I certainly put myself at the top of the list of those who fall short in that regard. I am holier-than-none.

“But too often, we rush not to salvage principle but to forgive and excuse our failures so that we might accommodate them and go right on failing — until the accommodation itself becomes our principle.

“In that way and over time, we can justify almost any behavior and sacrifice almost any principle. I’m afraid that this is where we now find ourselves.”

How It Played in Trumpworld. “Not one critical word by Flake of the Dems’ obstructionism, biased press. Speech could have been delivered by Obama or Pelosi,” charged Laura Ingraham, the right-wing commentator. “Had Hillary won, he’d be happy today,” she tweeted.

On his show, Sean Hannity decried the “snowflake, whiny” Flake as part of the “pathetic, weak, gutless, spineless, never-Trumper establishment Republican forces, all lashing out against the president.” G.O.P. senators who have criticized or broken with Trump are “standing in the way of enacting an agenda to help move the country forward, what the people voted for last November, and they’re trying to be martyrs in the process,” Hannity said.

Breitbart’s home page blared a three-word, flashing headline yesterday: “Winning: Flake Out.” Charlie Spiering, Breitbart’s White House correspondent, tweeted, “McConnell’s team now 0-3 #LosersGoHome,” referring to the demise of Flake and two other establishment Republican senators, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Luther Strange of Alabama. Strange lost a primary to none other than Roy Moore.","Jeff Flake Out, Roy Moore In",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/opinion/jeff-flake-roy-moore.html

At the time, Twitter said it had discovered about 200 accounts linked to Russian efforts to influence the election.
The researchers tracked 600 Twitter accounts — both human and suspected automated “bots” — that they linked to Russian attempts to influence the election.
Many of those automated accounts, along with Twitter users with suspected ties to the Russian government, bombarded the platform without buying advertising.","The announcement is part of a major shift in the industry to lift the veil over how its secretive advertising businesses — its cash centers — work, as lawmakers put more pressure on social media companies about the role their sites played in Russia’s attempt to influence the election. Twitter, Facebook and Google are scheduled to appear for hearings before the Senate and House Intelligence Committees on Nov. 1.

Lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the leading Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, have expressed frustration about Twitter. In late September, he said Twitter’s response was “inadequate” when it was asked to provide evidence of Russian-linked advertising and accounts that spread misinformation or were used to favor a presidential candidate.

At the time, Twitter said it had discovered about 200 accounts linked to Russian efforts to influence the election. But that figure was significantly less than the number uncovered a month earlier by researchers from the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, the public policy research group in Washington. The researchers tracked 600 Twitter accounts — both human and suspected automated “bots” — that they linked to Russian attempts to influence the election.

Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said that the company’s announcement did not go far enough and that online companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google needed rules that the government could enforce.

Last week, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Warner and Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, introduced a bill that would require digital platforms to report who bought political ads on their sites in the same way that TV broadcast stations must maintain databases with those disclosures. The bill was a response to concern that fake accounts linked to Russia on Facebook and other sites were able to fly past monitors on the sites and easily buy thousands of ads promoting racial and other hot-button issues to sow chaos before the election and to influence the result.

“I welcome this transparency,” Ms. Klobuchar said, “but we need a law in place for two major reasons: Not every company will do this, and you need rules for the road.” She added that the companies should not be left to police themselves.

The announcement from Twitter followed a public relations blitz this month by Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, to announce similar voluntary efforts to tighten standards for ad buyers. Lawmakers are still skeptical, saying there are many unanswered questions about whether the social media sites can prevent the mistakes of the 2016 election on their own.

The changes also raise new issues for politicians. For one, advertising agencies often consider their digital strategy part of their “secret sauce” when trying to sell their services to politicians and campaign strategists. Shining a light on the types of ads, the amount spent on them and how often they change could give valuable information to competing candidates.

It is also unclear whether Twitter will be able to keep up with campaigns’ ever-changing digital targeting, budgets and goals, and the company did not mention how it plans to tackle large-scale misinformation spread by bots.

Many of those automated accounts, along with Twitter users with suspected ties to the Russian government, bombarded the platform without buying advertising. Researchers at the cybersecurity firm FireEye discovered that hundreds or thousands of fake accounts regularly sent out messages criticizing Hillary Clinton — sometimes with identical tweets dispatched seconds apart.

Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said transparency in advertising alone “is not a solution to the deployment of bots that amplify fake or misleading content or to the successful efforts of online trolls to promote divisive messages.”

Twitter said it would try to tighten standards for issues-based ads that wouldn’t fall under its new electioneering rules, such as an environmental group’s push for clean-air policies or an energy company’s promotion of environmental deregulation. But the company admitted that the industry had not agreed on definitions for issues ads.

“We will work with our peer companies, other industry leaders, policymakers and ad partners to clearly define them quickly and integrate them into the new approach mentioned above,” Twitter said in its blog post.",Twitter Plans to Open Ad Data to Users,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/technology/twitter-political-ad-data.html

But the beachwear and fat arms hand-typed letter stood out. I googled the return address and found a satellite street image of an ugly red pickup truck parked in a nondescript yard, which told me, well, nothing actually.

Apparently I was damned if I did and damned if I didn’t.

How had Mr. or Mrs. Red Pickup Truck deduced that? After parading the letter around the office in a futile search for reassurance from my guffawing colleagues — do men get such missives? — I took to social media where my Facebook friends were bound to do a better job of buoying me up.

Over the past months, looking for people (other than myself for eating too many bowls of Jollof rice) to blame for the letter, I’ve settled on the city of Washington D.C., where I live and work.

The city is too conservative for my haphazard style. Go to Capitol Hill and it’s a sea of Ann Taylor low-heeled pumps and Talbot’s suits.

In recent years, Washington has played host to two First Ladies — Michelle Obama and now Melania Trump — who have pushed the envelope of what women wear here. But remember the stir when Mrs. Obama bared her arms in her first official photo as First Lady? Or the recent social media storm when Mrs. Trump wore stilettos to a hurricane?

Clearly, I’ve decided, Washington can’t handle too much fashion forwardness. A couple of years ago, I tried on a pair of gorgeous deep red laced-up ankle boots in Paris, and the guy at the cash register stopped me as I was handing him my credit card.

“You live in Washington? You will wear these there?” he said, causing me to pause.

I sighed. “Okay, give me the black pair.” I feel bitter about it every time I put on those black boots.

A few years ago, a friend who is a CNN correspondent gave me a pair of sedate post earrings for Christmas. I had just told her about some blog post that had me in high dudgeon, in which evil bloggers had critiqued the earrings I wore one night on the PBS show “Washington Week.” “There were three tiers to those earrings,” they snarked. “Exactly who costumed Helene? And if this passes for professional dress at The Times these days, color us shocked.”

My friend and I laughed about it, although I was secretly mad, and she sent me a pair of earrings that didn’t dangle to wear next time I went on TV. I promised her I would wear them.

But of course I didn’t.

After the speech, Mr. McConnell praised Mr. Flake and said he regretted the senator’s decision to leave.
Mr. Flake’s private polling had steadily become worse this year as he intensified his criticism of Mr. Trump.
To many conservatives who support Mr. Trump, Mr. Flake was an especially desirable target.
Mr. Trump himself encouraged a primary challenge to Mr. Flake, calling him “a non-factor” and “WEAK on borders,” while lauding Ms. Ward on Twitter.","“It is often said that children are watching,” he said. “Well, they are. And what are we going to do about that? When the next generation asks us, ‘Why didn’t you do something? Why didn’t you speak up?’ What are we going to say?”

Without mentioning Mr. Trump by name, Mr. Flake, 54, took direct aim at the president’s policies, notably his isolationist tendencies, but also his behavior and that of his aides. In his time in Washington, Mr. Flake embodied an old-line conservatism. He avidly pitched smaller government, spending cuts and an end to home-district pork-barrel projects, but also supported free trade, engagement with the world and an openness to immigration.

Those positions stood in marked contrast to Mr. Trump’s inward-looking, anti-immigration nationalism. The senator had already touched on such themes in a book he published in August, “Conscience of a Conservative,” that was highly critical of the president. In his speech, he was at turns somber and passionate.

“We must stop pretending that the degradation of our politics and the conduct of some in our executive branch are normal,” Mr. Flake said. “They are not normal. Reckless, outrageous and undignified behavior has become excused and countenanced as telling it like it is when it is actually just reckless, outrageous and undignified. And when such behavior emanates from the top of our government, it is something else. It is dangerous to a democracy.”

As he spoke, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, Mr. McCain and Mr. Corker sat listening on the Senate floor. Mr. Corker had jousted with the president only hours before.

“Isn’t it sad that lightweight Senator Bob Corker, who couldn’t get re-elected in the Great State of Tennessee, will now fight Tax Cuts plus!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning, fearing that Mr. Corker’s vow to oppose any tax plan that increases the federal debt could imperil his tax push.

Mr. Corker snapped back, “Same untruths from an utterly untruthful president.”

“I don’t know why he lowers himself to such a low, low standard and is debasing our country,” Mr. Corker said in a CNN interview, suggesting that he would soon convene hearings to examine the ways Mr. Trump “purposely has been breaking down relationships around the world.”

“It’s unfortunate that our nation finds itself in this place,” he added.

After the speech, Mr. McConnell praised Mr. Flake and said he regretted the senator’s decision to leave. “We have just witnessed a speech from a very fine man, a man who clearly brings high principles to the office every day,” the leader said.

But privately, some Republicans were growing angry at the displays of disunity from Senators Flake and Corker as the party was trying to come together to pass a major overhaul of the tax code. Only minutes before Mr. Flake’s address, the president had been in the Capitol for lunch with Senate Republicans and a discussion about tax reform.

The announcement did please Republican officials in Arizona and Washington, who believe that they now have a better chance at retaining the seat.

Mr. Flake’s private polling had steadily become worse this year as he intensified his criticism of Mr. Trump. His firm stand against the president had alienated Republican voters, but his long, conservative track record dissuaded Democratic voters in the state from coming to his side. One poll showed he had just an 18 percent approval rating among Arizona residents, and a survey that the senator conducted last month led some of his own allies to conclude that he could not win a Republican primary, according to multiple officials directly familiar with the situation in the weeks leading up to Tuesday’s speech.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said that she had not spoken with Mr. Trump about the senator’s decision but that she was not lamenting the announcement.

“Based on previous statements and certainly based on the lack of support that he has from the people of Arizona, it’s probably a good move,” she said.

She said history would remember Mr. Trump for his achievements and the strong economy that he was presiding over, “not some petty comments from Senator Corker and Senator Flake.”

At home in Arizona, Mr. Flake was facing threats from both the right and the left. His main primary challenger, Kelli Ward, an osteopathic physician and a former state senator who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. McCain last year, kicked off her campaign last week with two conservative luminaries — Laura Ingraham, the radio host, and Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist — at her side.

“Steve Bannon adds another scalp to his collection,” said Andy Surabian, a senior adviser to the Great America Alliance, a Bannon-aligned group that has endorsed Ms. Ward. “This is a direct result of the political pressure put on Jeff Flake over the last several months.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

On Tuesday, Breitbart News, the website that Mr. Bannon oversees, reported his reaction to Mr. Flake’s announcement as defiant: “Our movement will defeat you in primaries or force you to retire.”

Now, a race that had been expected to fall along familiar establishment-versus-insurgent lines, with Mr. Flake pitted against Ms. Ward, has been blown wide open. Mainstream Republicans believe that Ms. Ward will be overwhelmed by a flood of other candidates. Representative Paul Gosar, a conservative firebrand, and former Gov. Jan Brewer, for example, could enter the race.

But there is considerable uncertainty among establishment Republicans, too. Most party leaders suggest Representative Martha McSally, a former Air Force pilot, would be their most formidable contender to take on Representative Kyrsten Sinema, the likely Democratic nominee. But some Republicans privately say the safer course is for Ms. McSally to wait for the ailing Mr. McCain to vacate the seat and eventually ascend to the Senate via appointment.

To many conservatives who support Mr. Trump, Mr. Flake was an especially desirable target. Few in the Senate had spoken more candidly about their misgivings with Mr. Trump, first as a candidate and then as president. He had particularly elicited conservatives’ ire with his book, in which he equated Republicans’ acceptance of Mr. Trump as their nominee to a Faustian bargain.

Mr. Trump himself encouraged a primary challenge to Mr. Flake, calling him “a non-factor” and “WEAK on borders,” while lauding Ms. Ward on Twitter.

What Mr. Flake’s retirement made clear, though, was something potentially much more significant than an individual senator’s standing in the angry and restless conservative movement. It suggested that under Mr. Trump, the Republican Party has little room for voices that dissent from the president’s crass style of politics and his polarizing agenda.

Mr. Flake’s decision to step down was, in a sense, a tacit admission that crossing the president had put him in political peril. But in an interview in Phoenix this month, he said he had no regrets and always knew that crossing the president would be dangerous politically. He reiterated that sentiment on the Senate floor on Tuesday.

“We’re not here to simply mark time,” the senator said. “Sustained incumbency is certainly not the point of seeking office, and there are times when we must risk our careers in favor of our principles. Now is such a time.”","Jeff Flake, a Fierce Trump Critic, Will Not Seek Re-election for Senate",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/jeff-flake-arizona.html

“I can’t make sure that everyone in the business doesn’t behave badly at times, right?” he said. “What I can make sure is if we know something, we can react to that information. We can be decisive about it.”

Mr. Murdoch pointed to how the company dealt with Roger Ailes, the founding chairman of Fox News who was ousted after a sexual harassment lawsuit exposed a culture at the network where women said they were harassed and feared reporting complaints. As for Mr. O’Reilly, who was pushed out in April after the public exposure of a series of settlements involving him, Mr. Murdoch said, “there was a harassment complaint, and we ended his employment there.”

Mr. Murdoch did not address how at the time that the company renewed Mr. O’Reilly’s contract it was aware of other settlements involving Mr. O’Reilly.

“It is easy, I think, from the outside, to look at it and say, ‘Well, didn’t you know that?’” he said. “We made a decision that is clear, and I hope sends a really strong signal to all of my colleagues, to everyone in the industry, etc., that actually there are behaviors that are not to be tolerated, and we will continue to strive to live up to that.”

By setting himself up as the strongest ruler since Deng, Mr. Xi has pushed the world’s newest superpower into new and potentially dangerous political territory. On Tuesday, its final day, the congress elevated Mr. Xi, 64, to the same exalted status as the nation’s founder, Mao Zedong, by enshrining “Xi Jinping Thought” into the party’s constitution.

“If Xi goes for broke and breaks precedent by not preparing for an orderly and peaceful succession, he is putting a target on his back and risking a backlash from other ambitious politicians,” said Susan L. Shirk, the chairwoman of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego.

“By taking such a risk, he shows himself to be more like Mao than we originally thought — he demonstrates his power by overturning institutions,” she added.

Mr. Xi’s authoritarian approach was meant to bring faster policymaking after years of stagnation under his predecessor, Hu Jintao. Instead, critics say, the concentration of power in one man’s hands has created its own bottlenecks, with officials unsure how to execute policies or afraid to deviate from top-down demands.

Such problems could worsen. “Mr. Xi’s accrual of power heralds a more determined push around his favored economic policy initiatives and efforts to reassert the party’s role within public life,” said Tom Rafferty, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit. “However, aggressive centralization will also bring risks.”

The lack of a potential successor could be seen as a sign that Mr. Xi intends to dominate beyond this next five-year term, which ends in 2023, either by staying in office or behind the scenes. Mr. Xi may also want more time to test possible successors, while avoiding lame duck status with an heir waiting in the wings.

In a possible nod to concerns about Mr. Xi amassing too much power, most of the five new Standing Committee members were not longtime associates of his, though all have worked with him in some capacity. Premier Li Keqiang, the only holdover from the outgoing committee besides Mr. Xi, was once seen as a possible rival to lead the country.

“Xi has seemingly chosen magnanimity with the list,” said Christopher K. Johnson, an expert on Chinese elite politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Of course, that’s easy to do when you’ve achieved your two core objectives — making yourself the party’s untenured ideological arbiter and refraining from signaling the succession.”

Mr. Xi’s victory at the congress means he will welcome President Trump to China next month more confident than ever in his hold on power and the party’s support for his more assertive foreign policy.

His signature initiatives to extend China’s influence overseas, such as the global infrastructure program known as “One Belt, One Road” and a drive to build artificial islands in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, are now likely to stay unchallenged.

Some China watchers have said they also expect Mr. Xi to place more emphasis on overhauling the economy and cleaning up finances, after spending the past five years stamping out dissent and tightening his control over the party and the military, China’s other political power center.

One sign was the promotion of Liu He, his closest economic adviser and a longtime advocate of curbing debt and financial hazards. As a new member of the Politburo, a broader 25-member council that is less powerful than its Standing Committee, Mr. Liu appears likely to wield greater influence on policy.

In his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Xi noted that next year would mark 40 years since Deng opened up China to market forces and vowed to “firmly and unwaveringly deepen reform in every aspect.”

“He wants a team around him that will implement his vision,” said Evan S. Medeiros, the senior director for Asian affairs in the National Security Council in the Obama administration. “On economic issues, one could tentatively say that this Politburo Standing Committee is more reform-minded than the current lineup.”

This week’s congress, the party’s 19th since its establishment by Marxist revolutionaries in 1921, has portrayed Mr. Xi as a transformational leader guiding the nation into a “new era” of Chinese socialism. Mao unified China after nearly a century of civil war and foreign invasions, Deng brought it prosperity and Mr. Xi is said to be restoring the nation to global strength and leadership.

The congress blessed Mr. Xi’s agenda by writing his name and ideas into the party’s constitution, in effect declaring any effort to challenge him to be an act of ideological heresy.

Under Mao and then Deng, the party struggled with succession arrangements that ended in purges and division. Then, in steps from the 1990s onward, the party established a pattern of installing likely successors on the Standing Committee well in advance, with party leaders serving no more than two terms.

Mr. Xi himself joined the committee in 2007, before taking power in 2012. Before him, Mr. Hu served on the committee for a decade before succeeding Jiang Zemin.

The party has promoted a phalanx of officials loyal to Mr. Xi into the broader Politburo. About two-thirds of the 15 new members joining the body once worked under Mr. Xi or have other longstanding ties to him, including some younger leaders seen as potential successors.

They included Chen Min’er, 57, who worked as a propaganda functionary with Mr. Xi when they were both officials in the eastern province of Zhejiang in the early 2000s. Some experts had speculated that Mr. Xi might attempt to catapult Mr. Chen into the current Standing Committee.

But as a thinker, she’s essentially a synthesizer — albeit a talented and confident one. “The State of Affairs” is a patchwork of (mostly attributed) common references. The concept she’s most associated with — that we are torn between our desires for adventure and security — comes from the work of the psychoanalyst Stephen A. Mitchell and others. The tone — wry, worldly, aphoristic — owes much to Alain de Botton and Adam Phillips’s amused laments on coupling and its discontents. But the biggest debt she owes might be to herself; she trots out some favorite jokes and epigrams from “Mating in Captivity.” On occasion, she dusts off and repurposes whole chunks of text with minor tweaks.

Perel writes: “Mine is not an evidenced-based scientific survey, nor is it a sociological study based on data collected by the various websites for people seeking affairs. Rather, my approach is akin to that of an anthropologist and an explorer. I talk to people, and I listen.”

This is true, but I’ve always found the pleasure of reading Perel or listening to her (when she’s not repeating herself) lies in how literary her approach is. In case studies, she gives us each partner’s account — and then unravels them, pulling on this strand and that, investigating the stories we tell about ourselves, where these stories come from and who they serve. On the podcast, we can hear her practicing a supple kind of literary criticism, on the fly, in front of the authors.

Her ambitions for clients and readers are literary, too — she wants them to develop more plots in their lives, more possibilities. She wants them to live without easy, limiting certainties: “Reconciling the erotic and the domestic is not a problem to solve; it is a paradox to manage.” And the script we have inherited when it comes to infidelity is pitifully narrow, its language cribbed from addiction and criminalization: “Clinicians often label the faithful spouse as the ‘injured party’ and the unfaithful one as the ‘perpetrator.’”

Perel takes a broader, global view. “An entire cultural framework shapes the way we give meaning to our heartbreak,” she writes. In her work in India, Argentina and across Europe, she’s seen a variety of responses to infidelity — indifference, outrage, tacit acceptance, vocal acceptance.

She has also seen a variety of reasons that people stray: “One person may cross the border for a simple fling, while another is looking to emigrate. Some infidelities are petty rebellions, sparked by a sense of ennui, a desire for novelty, or the need to know one still has pulling power.”

Like other writers on sex — Emily Witt and Dan Savage come to mind — Perel is inspired by communities of queer and polyamorous people; “monogamy’s dissidents,” she calls them, who are rethinking the boundaries of the couple. It’s an idea that’s easy to dismiss as outré but, Perel reminds us, so was premarital sex not so long ago.

This is the kind of maneuver that makes Perel so bracing to read, this quick pivot to remind us how culturally specific our traditions are and, in some cases, how new. She doesn’t peddle in bromides or offer a shoulder to cry on — she’s too busy trying to shake you to your senses, insisting on your agency, your vitality and your complicity in what happens in your marriage. She’s a tonic, and sometimes a tough one to swallow.

As Alexandre Dumas wrote, “The bonds of wedlock are so heavy that it takes two to carry them, sometimes three.” We’re lucky to have Perel help bear the burden — but also to challenge us, to ask us why we accept it as natural in the first place.",‘The State of Affairs’ Examines Our Cheating Hearts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/books/review-state-of-affairs-rethinking-infidelity-esther-perel.html

She bought the riad — a wreck — in 1996, after first visiting the city five years earlier, when it was far less tourist-friendly.
“I developed a crush on this place, which was so wild compared to where I had grown up,” she says.
Together, they created a dramatic yet inviting whitewashed oasis that Barkowski outfitted sparely with sculptural furniture in black metal and cedar, paired with her own charcoal linens.

She begins with the techniques themselves, whether stitching or motifs or fabrics. “To my mind, this only works if you live in the place,” she says. “Otherwise it shows in what you make.” Her cotton bedsheets, for example, are trimmed with tiny pompoms secured with a sewing technique from northern Morocco that ensures they don’t fall off.

WHEN BARKOWSKI IS in Marrakesh, she spends most of her time at Dar Kawa, built in the early 1700s. She bought the riad — a wreck — in 1996, after first visiting the city five years earlier, when it was far less tourist-friendly. “I developed a crush on this place, which was so wild compared to where I had grown up,” she says.

To restore the 1,950-square-foot courtyard home, she hired the modernist Belgian architect Quentin Wilbaux, who has won acclaim for his reimaginings of Moroccan riads and his meticulous cataloging of the city’s houses. Together, they created a dramatic yet inviting whitewashed oasis that Barkowski outfitted sparely with sculptural furniture in black metal and cedar, paired with her own charcoal linens.

For much of the previous decade, she lived in this riad. The artists’ residency she ran, Sarhat, meant the house was often full of painters, photographers and sculptors who stayed for 2-month-long stints in a nearby house and at her desert camp near the Algerian border; in exchange, they were asked only to leave behind a piece of work.

In 2008, she converted the riad into a four-bedroom hotel. Though it’s not rentable through the usual online booking sites, it has become particularly popular among like-minded Scandinavian, Swiss and Japanese travelers who want a minimal take on Marrakesh’s maximal charm. (“There’s a tribe who finds out about it through word of mouth,” she says.)

Barkowski and her husband now live in a modest, simply renovated home near the Palmeraie, a desert oasis about a 30-minute drive from the medina. Like Scottsdale, Ariz., the area is carved from a once-glorious landscape — thousands of date palms were planted during the 11th century — but has since become a showplace for fortresslike mansions and private golf clubs.

But Barkowski’s house is “from an older time,” she says of the 1,900-square foot, ’30s-era French colonial bungalow. When the couple moved in, she brought some raw wood packing pallets to use as bed-frames, a stopgap until she bought real furniture. But she has instead kept them, adding flea-market finds, including tables made from old doors, and textiles in a subdued pale-earth palette, flecked with red accents.

What sold her on the place was the tree: a 50-foot Pistacia atlantica is the property’s dominant feature, planted about 300 years ago. With deep roots that ferret out water, such trees were once common in North Africa, but most have been lost to deforestation. From its darkly fissured boughs, Barkowski has hung simplified versions of typical Moroccan tin lanterns. Below them is a seating area and a table draped in No-Mad fabrics, where she serves guests dishes like aubergine salad with pomegranate seeds and yogurt.

Otherwise, the property’s main features are sunlight and space: a luxury in busy Marrakesh — or anywhere. “The city is a madness of color and shape, and my mind never stops with ideas,” Barkowski says. “When I come here, I want a void.” Her goal was to create a home so balanced that, with little more than a mattress on the floor — covered in good linens, of course — there would be a sense of arid beauty and timeless serenity. “In Europe it’s cold and you are surrounded by elaborate elegance,” she says. “Here, how much do you really need?”","A Textile Designer’s Calming, Sunlit Life",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/t-magazine/design/valerie-barkowski-textiles-marrakesh.html

Muscles potentially provided another route to survival during our species’ early days. With sufficient brawn, animals, including people, could physically overpower prey and sprint from danger.

But muscles are also very calorically needy and, like brain tissue, use blood sugar as their primary fuel. So scientists have wondered whether and how early humans’ bodies balanced the fueling needs of their brains and their brawn. Did one take precedence over the other? If so, that choice could tell us something about the underpinnings of human development and also how best, even now, to manage thinking and moving.

Since experiments on cavepeople are, however, not practicable, researchers at Cambridge University in England decided instead to focus on the bodily machinations of 62 elite, collegiate rowers for their new study, which was published this month in Scientific Reports.

The scientists hoped to suss out what happens when both muscles and minds are stressed, and if one of those operations gets preferential treatment from the body.

To find out, they asked the rowers, who were all young, male and fit, to visit a university lab on three separate occasions.

During one visit, the men sat quietly while dozens of words were displayed on a large screen in front of them. The men had three minutes to memorize the words and then, immediately afterward (when the screen went dark) write down as many as they could remember. This was their mental task.

On another day, they rowed on a rowing machine as intensely as they could for three minutes while the researchers tracked their power output, testing muscular prowess.

Finally, on the last visit, they rowed for three minutes while simultaneously viewing a list of new words and then, immediately afterward, writing down as many as they could recall.

Then the researchers simply compared their performance on each task. Almost uniformly, the men had been able to produce fewer watts and recall fewer words when they performed the muscular and mental tasks together.

But the falloff in physical functioning was much steeper than the mental slump. The rowers lost almost 13 percent of their power output, a decline that was about 30 percent greater than their loss in word recall after the combined session.

“Our proposed explanation for this finding is that they were both competing for the same resource,” which in this case was blood sugar for fuel, says Danny Longman, a postdoctoral research fellow at Cambridge who led the study.

And the brain won.

The implication of this victory is that thinking probably provided more advantage for us during evolution than brawniness, Dr. Longman says, and on those occasions that both systems needed to be fed, the brain got its portion first.

Of course, this study was very short-term and viewed the tug-of-war between brains and muscles only indirectly. The researchers did not track actual changes in blood sugar uptake by any tissues. They also looked only at quite-intense exercise and used memory recall as their sole marker for thinking.

But even with these limitations, the study to some extent advances our understanding of how we became the species that we are, Dr. Longman says.

“For me, the main message of this study is a bit philosophical,” he says. “An enlarged and highly functioning brain is one of the key factors that make us human. This study demonstrated, in a very simple way, this defining characteristic of our species.”

MONDAY PUZZLES — If you make odd connections between things as I do, the crossword might bring out different things for you. Jennifer Nutt, who wrote today’s lovely Monday crossword, probably did not have this in mind when she created it, but her puzzle brought this up for me, so I’m going to tell you a story.

The first time I visited Cape Town, I took the ferry to Robben Island to see the prison — now a museum — where former South African president Nelson Mandela and many others who resisted the National Party during the apartheid era were held. It’s the kind of thing that is expected of first-time visitors (“Oh, you must go!”) and I’m a student of history, so I climbed aboard the boat and off I went.

Cape Town is a very windy city because of its location between the mountains and the sea, and on that day, the wind was working against the ferry as it made its way across the water. With no warning, a pod of humpback whales appeared in the water at the front of the boat, and skimmed over the water toward the island, almost as if to lead us in. When we slowed down, they would loop back and continue to guide us. It was a very touching sight, almost as if they were saying, “Follow us. There are secrets to be told here.” Once we were close to the shore, they dispersed and made their way back out to sea.

The tour, which is more a heartbreaking example of man’s inhumanity to man than a tourist trap curiosity, lasted about an hour and included talks by both former prisoners and the Afrikaaner guards who had held them captive. They had returned to educate mostly foreign visitors about a relatively recent period in history (1948 — 1994) where a nationalist government had succeeded in discriminating despicably against black Africans and criminalizing interaction between the races. There were also a surprising number of white South Africans in our group.

“They said to me, ‘Are you going to sleep with us, or do you want to go on a mission?’” Aisha, 15 “I didn’t want a situation where I’m the reason anyone dies.” Fatima M., 16 “I really didn’t expect to survive. I thought I had only minutes to live.” Maryam, 16 “They brought out a belt and tied it to my waist and showed me a button to press.” Nana, 13

The New York Times interviewed 18 girls who were captured by militants in Nigeria and sent into crowds to blow themselves up. Here are their stories.

The girls didn’t want to kill anyone. They walked in silence for a while, the weight of the explosives around their waists pulling down on them as they fingered the detonators and tried to think of a way out.

“I don’t know how to get this thing off me,” Hadiza, 16, recalled saying as she headed out on her mission.

“What are you going to do with yours?” she asked the 12-year-old girl next to her, who was also wearing a bomb.

“I’m going to go off by myself and blow myself up,” the girl responded hopelessly.

It was all happening so fast. After being kidnapped by Boko Haram this year, Hadiza was confronted by a fighter in the camp where she was being held hostage. He wanted to “marry” her. She rejected him.

“You’ll regret this,” the fighter told her.

A few days later, she was brought before a Boko Haram leader. He told her she would be going to the happiest place she could imagine. Hadiza thought she was going home. He was talking about heaven.

They came for her at night, she said, grabbing a suicide belt and attaching it to her waist. The fighters then sent her and the 12-year-old girl out on foot, alone, telling them to detonate the bombs at a camp for Nigerian civilians who have fled the violence Boko Haram has inflicted on the region.

“I knew I would die and kill other people, too,” Hadiza recalled. “I didn’t want that.”

Northeastern Nigeria, now in its eighth year of war with Boko Haram, has become a place afraid of its own girls.

So far this year, militants have carried out more than twice as many suicide bombings than they did in all of 2016, and the attacks keep coming.

According to Unicef, more than 110 children have been used as suicide bombers since the start of the year – at least 76 of them girls. Most were under 15 years old. One girl blew herself up along with a baby strapped to her back.

Bombers here at the center of the battle against Boko Haram have struck mosques, marketplaces, checkpoints, camps for displaced civilians and anywhere else people gather, including a single polo field attacked multiple times. Trenches have been dug around the University of Maiduguri, a frequent bombing target, in hopes of slowing down attackers.

“I knew very well that bomb would kill me.” Maimuma, 14

The deployment of children has become so frighteningly common that officials in the areas where Boko Haram operates are warning citizens to be on the lookout for girl bombers. A huge billboard here in Maiduguri – the Nigerian city where Boko Haram was born – proclaims “Stop Terrorism” with the image of a scowling, wild-eyed girl with explosives on her chest, clutching a detonator.

Officials are publicly urging parents not to hand over their children to Boko Haram for use as bombers, while the military is circulating a video telling bombers they can surrender. It features an 11-year-old girl.

“Do not allow them to tie explosives on you,” says the girl in the video. “It is dangerous.”

The public service ad paints bombers and their families as Boko Haram collaborators who either support the militants’ campaign of terror, or were brainwashed or drugged into doing so.

But The New York Times tracked down and interviewed 18 girls in Nigeria who were sent on suicide missions by Boko Haram. Their accounts shatter the narrative often perpetuated by officials.

Far from having been willing participants, the girls described being kidnapped and held hostage, with family members killed during their capture.

All of the girls recounted how armed militants forcibly tied suicide belts to their waists, or thrust bombs into their hands, before pushing them toward crowds of people. Most were told that their religion compelled them to carry out the orders. And all of them resisted, preventing the attacks by begging ordinary citizens or the authorities to help them.

Aisha, 15, fled her home with her father and 10-year-old brother, but Boko Haram caught them. The fighters killed her father and, soon after, she watched them strap a bomb to her brother, squeeze him between two militants on a motorbike and speed away.

The two militants returned without him, cheering. Her little brother had blown up soldiers at a barracks, she learned. The militants told her not to cry for him. “He killed wicked people,” they told her.

Later, they tied a bomb on her, too, instructing her to head toward the same barracks.

Like some of the other girls, Aisha said she had considered walking off to an isolated spot and pressing the detonator, far from other people, to avoid hurting anyone else. Instead, she approached the soldiers and persuaded them to remove the explosives from her body, delicately.

“I told them, ‘My brother was here and killed some of your men,’” she said. “My brother wasn’t sensible enough to know he didn’t have to do it. He was only a small child.”

Other girls, whose full names are also being withheld out of concern for their security, had similar stories of terror and defiance.

Fall on your tummy, face down, the militants told Fatima A., 17. But when she approached soldiers, she put up her hands and yelled at the top of her voice: “Look! I’m innocent! I’m not part of them! They forced me!”

“They told me that by the grace of God I’ll succeed.” Maimuma, 14 “I was so afraid it would explode on its own.” Falmata B., 15 “They told me to go to the big mosque and sit among the worshippers.” Fati, 14 “I can’t kill people, especially innocent people.” Falmata S., 16

Amina, 16, was told to blow up worshipers at a mosque. But as she drew near the crowd, she spotted her uncle, who helped her to safety.

Wait until you find a big crowd of civilians, fighters told Hajja, 17. But if you spot just one or two soldiers first, press the button, they instructed her. Instead, when she came upon a soldier, she showed him her bomb. He guided her to an open field, where he gently removed it.

Fati, 14, was deployed along with nine other girls, each sent in different directions to hit separate targets. She walked into a police station to ask for help, holding the bag containing the bomb that militants had given her. The officers screamed and ran out, she said. But eventually they returned, telling her to leave the bag in a nearby field and walk away.

Maryam, 16, said she got help from an old man resting under a tree. The two hollered to one another from a safe distance, so that he could question her first and get some assurances that she didn’t plan to blow him up.

For these girls and others, even approaching the authorities to ask for help was exceedingly dangerous. Soldiers and civilians at checkpoints are on high alert for anyone suspicious – and usually that means any woman or girl, most of whom wear long head scarves and garments that could cover an explosive belt. In just the last three months of 2016, the United Nations says, 13 children from 11 to 17 years old were killed after they were wrongly thought to be suicide bombers.

Most of the girls interviewed said, like Hadiza, that they had been deployed as bombers after refusing to be married off to a fighter. For years Boko Haram fighters have forced girls into “marriage,” a euphemism for rape, sometimes impregnating them.

Many of the girls echoed Hadiza’s account, saying the militants had promised them paradise in exchange for pushing a red detonator button. The girls, nearly all involved in planned attacks within the past year, were dropped off along empty roads as gun-toting fighters stayed back at a distance to watch them walk toward their targets.

Maimuma, 14, whom militants told to bomb a group of soldiers, said she didn’t want to become like the dozens of other girls who have blown themselves up, taking bystanders with them. She knows that many people suspect she is a Boko Haram collaborator. But she argues that she and other girls like her should be praised for defying the militants.

“Some people see me as part of Boko Haram,” she said. “Some people see me as a hero.”

“I get afraid when I see women.” Hassan, a member of a local civilian militia

In recent months, Nigeria’s gains in beating back Boko Haram – retaking territory and capturing militant hide-outs – have begun to recede. The group’s fighters have launched not only more suicide bombings but more tactical strikes against security forces as well.

In June, they attacked a convoy of soldiers and police officers, kidnapping several female police officers. The following month, militants fired on a military-escorted convoy of oil workers, killing more than 25 people and kidnapping geologists from the University of Maiduguri.

Western intelligence officials say the militants have been recapturing land that the Nigerian military took from them. The United States is preparing to sell half a billion dollars’ worth of attack planes and other material to Nigeria to aid the fight.

The humanitarian situation in the region is dire, with nearly two million people across four countries displaced by war and some living in famine-like conditions. Maiduguri is overwhelmed by families that have fled rural farms and fisheries with no means of making a living. Many live in decaying buildings and thatched huts, or along the banks of the shallow Ngadda River, where one small group survives on roasted scraps of cow hide discarded by local tanneries.

Now, aid groups are fighting an outbreak of thousands of cases of cholera, according to humanitarian workers.

The relentless string of bombings in recent months, mostly around Maiduguri and across the border in Cameroon, has cast a frightening shadow over life here. On Sunday alone, more than a dozen people were killed when bombers struck.

In the past six years, women have accounted for the majority of suicide bombings by Boko Haram in northeast Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad, according to a report released in August by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point.

In fact, the report said, the group has deployed more female bombers than any other terrorist group in history.

And as Boko Haram increasingly turns to children to carry out its suicide attacks, it is four times more likely to deploy girl bombers than boys, the report found.

“There is an uneasiness – people often mention their fear of women and girls at checkpoints, in crowded areas, at the camps, at the university,” said Harriet Dwyer, a spokeswoman for Unicef in Maiduguri. “As we see these incidences happening with more frequency, the stigma and the suspicion become a very difficult thing to reconcile.”

The bombings are taking a psychological toll on Maiduguri, a city that by some estimates has doubled in population as families flee Boko Haram in the countryside.

Bombers strike repeatedly at busy marketplaces and camps for the displaced. Residents suspect that the university has been a frequent target because of Boko Haram’s hatred of Western education, one of its founding principles. At least eight attacks on the university have occurred since the start of the year.

The suicide bombers usually operate in the early morning hours, predictably enough that many residents start their days later or avoid certain areas altogether. Worried about being shot by mistake, many women and girls squat before approaching checkpoints, hoping to convince nervous soldiers and civilian militia members that they aren’t wearing explosive belts or vests.

To avoid suspicion, some women say that they are careful to bathe and wash their clothes frequently. Most of the girls used in bombings have lived in harsh conditions in the bush and appear dirty and “haggard,” a word many residents use to describe them.

One Maiduguri resident, Fatima Seidu, 45, said that whenever she saw girls on the street, she crossed to avoid them.

“I get afraid of bombs, and afraid someone will see me and get afraid of me,” said Ms. Seidu, whose husband was killed by Boko Haram. “But hopefully they’ll look at my age and they’ll also see I’m wearing clean clothes.”

Hassan, a member of a local civilian militia, said that when women and girls approach his checkpoint, he tells them to drop what they’re carrying. Several months ago, he said, a woman refused to stop when he shouted at her. He watched as she raised her hand and pressed a detonator, setting off a bomb.

“I get afraid when I see women,” he said.

“They told me to be sure I was ready for heaven.” Amina, 16 “I pitied the women and the children at my target.” Balaraba, 20 “It’s tied on my body. I’m afraid to touch it.” Hadiza B., 13 “They told me to blow up a hospital, to go in the mix of patients and workers and detonate a bomb.” Maimuna, 16

Hassan’s wife, Fatima G., 19, said she had been abducted by Boko Haram, held for about six months, and forced to marry a fighter. One day, militants gathered a group of women hostages and told them to parade before them as they barked orders. It seemed to be some kind of test for obedience, she said.

Not long after, she said, a fighter put her on the back of a motorbike and sped toward Maiduguri. On the way, he told her she was going on a suicide mission. But they came upon a firefight between militants and soldiers instead. In the chaos, she escaped.

Now, in her daily life in Maiduguri, she is fearful of women. “It’s not like anyone is wearing identification,” she said. “There’s no way to know who is who.”

The girls who were sent on suicide missions now try to blend into teenage life in Maiduguri. Most had painted nails, tiny rhinestone studs in their noses and curls of henna on their feet. Their long headscarves covered patterned or sparkly dresses and braided hair.

Nearly all had their schooling interrupted by the war. They are eager to return. They dream of becoming teachers, doctors or lawyers.

They value their religion and say they were unconvinced by Boko Haram’s insistence that Islam supports suicide bombings. Some worry that God would have punished them had they accidentally set off the bombs attached to them.

In most cases, the girls told no one about their missions, other than the security forces who helped them. Some girls did not even tell their parents, frightened of being rejected. Those who did were told not to repeat their stories, for fear they would be labeled Boko Haram sympathizers.

The militants sometimes tried to trick the girls, hoping to convince them they would not be harmed in the attacks. Maimuma was told that the moment she hit the detonator, the bomb would leap from her body and land in the crowd. She didn’t believe it, especially after militants prepared her hair in a traditional burial style.

“I knew very well that bomb would kill me,” she said.

But there was little she could do. They tied an explosive belt around her waist and dropped her along a road. Follow it to where the soldiers are, they told her. Act like a woman, they said. Look attractive. Wait until you’re very close to them. Then press the button.

She tried to keep her composure until she was out of sight. The explosives were heavy and the detonator – a device that looked like a small radio – was hot against her waist, she recalled. She wanted to remove the belt, but was terrified of accidentally setting it off.

She began to cry. Some passers-by spotted her sobbing on the road and approached. She told them Boko Haram had tied a bomb under her gown. They sprinted away. Others approached, but they too fled when she told them her problem.

“They came one after another,” she said, almost laughing at the grim absurdity of the scene. “I tried to run after them and they told me they would kill me if I kept coming.”

After a few minutes, a group of soldiers arrived, telling her to keep her distance and put her hands in the air. A soldier came over to gingerly remove the device. It seemed to take forever. Her arms grew tired as she held them overhead. Finally, the belt was off.

Initially, Maimuma hid the episode from her family and friends, and she worried about being jailed if people found out. “Then I thought to myself, ‘Why should I be arrested for being forced to carry a bomb?’” she said. “I decided I was going tell everyone.”

When Maimuma hears about girls who set off bombs she is frustrated. There’s no question in her mind that they had no loyalty to Boko Haram. She thinks they were naïve, terrified and ultimately foolish for not realizing they had the option of surrendering to security officials, she said.

But that is risky, too. When Hadiza and the 12-year-old girl approached a checkpoint, she was scared of what the soldiers might do. Hadiza told the younger girl to wait by a tree in the distance while she explained their predicament to the soldiers. She knew the girl would raise suspicion because she was too young to be walking in the bush without a parent.

“She was such a small girl,” Hadiza said.

She still doesn’t know where her mother is, or if she is even alive. But her father showed up at the camp a few weeks after she did. When she told him what happened, he cried, both horrified and relieved.

“He would never reject me,” she said. “He was so happy I survived.”",Boko Haram strapped suicide bombs to them. Somehow these teenage girls survived.,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/25/world/africa/nigeria-boko-haram-suicide-bomb.html
