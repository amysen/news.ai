Haley, who’s in the middle of a three-country visit in Africa, left the camp as several hundred protesters opposing President Salva Kiir approached, a spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the U.N. told Fox News. The protesters “became upset that [Haley] was not able to meet with them, due to time constraint,” the U.N. told The Associated Press.

Shortly after Haley left the camp, which is meant for homeless and displaced residents, U.N. security guards fired tear gas into the crowd of more than 100 people who looted and destroyed a charity office operating there, an aid worked at the camp said.

Frustration has been growing both inside and outside of South Sudan over the conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people, and created African’s largest displacement of civilians since the Rwanda genocide in 1994.

“We are disappointed by what we are seeing. This is not what we thought we were investing it,” Haley said in remarks released later by the U.N. “What we thought we were investing in was a free, fair society where people could be safe and South Sudan is the opposite of that.”

Just before Haley left the camp, residents attempted to hand the ambassador a letter with their position on the “current crisis.” The U.N. said a “petition” was delivered before Haley had left.

Haley is the highest-level U.S. government official to visit South Sudan since President Donald Trump took office in January. The ambassador is in Africa to see the involvement of both the U.S. and the U.N. in Ethiopia, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where she arrived late Wednesday.

President Kiir appealed for the Trump administration to remain engaged with the country during his meeting with Haley.

The United States is South Sudan's largest donor and was instrumental in the country's creation. Since the country gained independence in 2011, the U.S. has given more than $5 billion for humanitarian and development initiatives, according to the U.S. Embassy.

South Sudan plunged into civil war in late 2013, and the country faces mass displacement, starvation and allegations of government corruption and war crimes. More than 2 million people have fled the country.

October is an exciting month for the family. Even if you or your kids aren’t into the haunted part of Halloween, you can still embrace the festivities of fall, warmth and togetherness. Encourage your kids to exercise their imagination and creativity with these Halloween-themed crafts that everyone can participate in.

1. Family Portrait Pumpkins

Skip the mess of carving pumpkins this year by investing in some good old fashioned chalk. Simply paint a circle on each pumpkin with chalkboard paint. You’ll probably have to apply at least three coats of paint. Then, draw a self-portrait using a piece of chalk. Voila!

2. Colorful Garland

Before kids jump in the pile of leaves this weekend, encourage them to collect a few especially vibrant ones. Press the leaves in a book for a couple of hours while the kids continue to play outside. Once they’ve been flattened, show your children how to clip the leaves to a string with miniature clothespins and find spots to hang them throughout the house together.

3. Harvest Vignettes

Look to nature’s bounty for easy decor ideas. Arrange apples, pears, pumpkins, squash and gourds in baskets throughout your kitchen and dining areas. Having easy access to fruits will also promote healthy eating for your family this season.

4. Candy Laboratory

First, gather vases, jars and dishes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Then fill each container with colorful treats, like candy corn, marshmallows and of course candy eyeballs. Challenge your family members to come up with a creative new name for each candy. Crows bones, zombie zingers and pumpkin teeth are excellent examples. Arrange the jars neatly on a tray or turn a bar cart into a wonderful candy buffet.

5. Candy Corn Checkerboards

A checkerboard made from a placemat can be quickly rolled up and easily tucked away. Cut a 1½-inch square from cardstock paper to make a stencil. Start at one edge of the square and paint every other square. Precise placement and straight lines aren’t necessary in this project, which makes it great for kids. Small imperfections can even give the game a rustic or quirky look. You can use candy corn or small plastic spiders as game pieces.

6. Gothic Deskscape

Fall break is the perfect time to take a break from work and transform your home office into a spooky showcase. Open a dictionary and lay a magnifying glass on the definition of “Halloween”. Stack a pile of literature to display your favorite fall titles, like The Tell-Tale Heart or Harry Potter. Swap out a desk lamp’s lightbulb for one with an orange glow or purple hue, and don’t forget an inkwell and quill pen!

7. Mantel Accessories

Fireplace mantels are the go-to spot for any holiday decor. Find wooden display letters at your local craft store to spell out “boo” or another ghastly term above the hearth. Place a mini pumpkin or two and add some candles. A stack of books and a vase of bare branches are also great ideas.

8. Stylish Spider Webs

Tulle is great for wrapping accessories, draping over doorways and even dressing up the bushes. Don’t overlook the nooks and crannies though. This fabric is even more effective in small corners of a room since that’s where spiders hang out most anyway. You might even have to dust off a few real webs before making your own.

9. Window Decals

Shadows and silhouettes can be extra spooky this time of year. Use your interior lighting and the long dark nights to your advantage by decorating windows with DIY decals. Sketch large outlines of your favorite Halloween characters on fade-resistant paper. Then cut out your witches, skeletons, bats, cats or ghosts and tape them to the inside of your home’s windows.

10. Dip-Dyed Baskets

Prepare for trick-or-treaters this year by sprucing up a traditional candy basket. Fill a plastic container (larger than your basket) with semigloss paint. Place the basket in the paint and push down until all sides are covered to your desired height. Let the basket sit overnight on an elevated rack you don’t mind getting dirty, like an old cookie sheet. Reuse this basket all year long as stylish storage!",10 DIY Halloween decorations for all ages,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/10-diy-halloween-decorations-for-all-ages.html

Several listeners of the Todd Starnes Radio Show alerted us to the massive public display of patriotism. They pointed out the significant difference between how high school football players treat the flag and how professional football players treat the flag.

“The kids have been frustrated with what's going on across the country with players taking a knee,” head coach Todd Mather told the Todd Starnes Show. “I told the kids that politics don't have a place in high school sports. I told them we stand for the national anthem. That's what you do as an American in this country.""

And that's exactly what they did at Friday night's homecoming game -- bringing the audience to tears.

""There wasn't a dry eye in the stands - including myself,"" the coach said.

At the conclusion of the song, the game announcer told the crowd they were living in the “best country on the face of this Earth.”

“At Burroughs football game – we are standing,” he declared. “We are standing for the national anthem.”

Parent Tina Haugen filmed the incredible moment.

""It was absolutely amazing,"" she said. ""Our community is unbelievably patriotic. Everybody was clapping and cheering.""

The young men on the football team and the good citizens of Ridgecrest should be commended for their public display of patriotism.

They reminded the nation that there are plenty of folks across the fruited plain who are proud to be Americans.

The hagfish is more than 300 million years old and it lives out of sight in the deepest depths of the ocean. Without a jaw, this spineless ancient creature scavenges the ocean floor for food.

It feasts on dying animals from the inside out and although it is snakelike, hagfish do not have scales. To defend itself, the hagfish unleashes slime (similar to slime featured in ""Ghostbusters"") - and it is this slime that has military scientists excited.

WILL COMBAT VEHICLES USE URINE FOR FUEL?

Spider silk has long been pursued as an option to building ultralight weight and ultra-strong body armor. Hagfish slime threads are almost as strong and light as spider silk, but could prove far easier to harvest in the necessary large volumes to be practical.

Made of mucus and threadlike fibers, the clear slime’s fibers are ultra-strong and flexible.

Will synthetic slime become the basis of new body armor for the military? Bottled into a spray to protect Navy divers? Scientists are unlocking these and more potential from this unique fish.

Hagfish slime and its unique capabilities are being studied and pioneered by scientists like the Navy team at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division in Florida.

Slime defense

Hagfish defend themselves by oozing slime on their threats, some of which risk slime suffocation.

When combined with seawater, the slime rapidly expands and creates huge volumes. One mere foot-long hagfish can possess hundreds of miles of slime thread inside and can expand 10,000 times in volume in milliseconds.

Even a shark attempting to eat a hagfish will find it hard to succeed and will battle a face and gills full of slime – risking slime suffocation.

To clean off their slime, hagfish tie themselves in knots.

How could it be used for body armor?

The slime is simple, but incredibly strong with very interesting properties with great defense potential.

When the wet fibers are stretched and dried out, the fibers become a sort of soft thread that could be woven to create a range of apparel materials.

Scientists believe that this hagfish slime, and its ultra-strong stretchy thread, could be the key to next-level bullet-proof vests.

Just how strong is hagfish slime? Hagfish may not be pretty, but they’ve got staying power and this is in large part down to its ability to defend itself and survive. The hagfish have been around for centuries during extinction after extinction - even outlasting the dinosaurs.

In fact, dinosaurs became extinct 60 million years ago, but hagfish date back 330 million years.

How will they farm slime?

Any team working to crack slime applications will need to figure out how to reproduce the slime and at high volumes.

Natural hagfish reproduction still remains a mystery. Hagfish breeding in captivity has not yielded success, therefore hagfish farms are an unlikely solution. Artificial reproduction in a lab is more probable.

Spider silk has been similarly pursued for its strength and posed similar practical problems in terms of replicating at a mass level. Hagfish slime proteins are smaller and so could prove easier to replicate.

Remarkably, the Navy team has already replicated the material and can now focus on applying the synthetic slime to provide military advantages.

Potential applications

Replicated slime could replace petroleum based-products like Kevlar. Similar to spider silk, there is potential it could eventually provide enhanced strength at a lighter weight than current bulletproof armor.

Beyond bulletproof vests, there are other interesting military applications.

For example, special operations could find creative tactical uses for a material that can instantly change, massively expand and ensnare or “clog.”

Different delivery systems are being explored. Just as the slime protects the fish, the synthetic slime could potentially be developed into a spray to protect divers against sharks.

An artificial slime also means that it can be tinkered with and modified. Scientists are working on enhancing the synthetic slime’s stickiness- its ability to attach to various surfaces. Enhancing the slime’s stability in different environments is another potential objective that would expand its potential utility for the military.

Another application could be applying the slime as a ship coating to prevent barnacles and algae from attaching.

On the homeland, there’s lots of other potential such as using the slime to protect firefighters.

What’s next?

Eventually, some products derived from the hagfish slime could work their way into uses outside of the military.

Scientists in the commercial space have been looking at using the slime to replace Lycra, spandex and nylon in regularly worn clothing and fabrics.",Slime of 300-million-year-old creature may be used for body armor,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/24/slime-300-million-year-old-creature-may-be-used-for-body-armor.html

Flake says our kids are going to ask what we did to stop what is happening and Flake’s honest answer will be he quit. And he is quitting.

I’m sorry Trump haters, but Jeff Flake is no martyr who spoke truth to power and met defeat for doing so. I’m sorry Trump humpers, but Steve Bannon did not defeat Jeff Flake in a game of 13 dimensional chess. The truth is Jeff Flake defeated himself.

Jeff Flake had a 100 percent lifetime Club for Growth record in the United States House of Representatives. He was a conservative’s conservative and stood up to the House GOP leadership. He used that reputation to catapult himself into the Senate with the backing of most every major conservative group. He towed a tough line on the budget, ObamaCare, immigration, etc.

Then he got to the Senate and promptly caved on it all. Friends of his tell me that he had no support system in the Senate. In the House, at least, there were other Club for Growth candidates. The smaller Senate with even fewer conservatives unleashed Jeff Flake’s need to be liked. He went from being a reliable Club for Growth members to a reliable Mitch McConnell member.

Jeff Flake defeated himself with a series of poor decisions over six years that alienated him from his base, alienated Republican donors who he heavily pursued in 2012, and then alienated Trump fans.

Voters in Arizona felt betrayed.

Democrats had no use for Flake because he spent years campaigning as a hard core conservative. Republicans had no use for him because he lied his way into the Senate, promptly doing the opposite of many of his core campaign promises. Flake failed to build a new coalition of support while heaping scorn on his existing coalition.

Flake could have been opposed to President Trump and even been outspoken about it. But he could not sell out his conservatism and then become an outspoken Trump critic. That is, however, what he chose to do.

So yesterday he gave a fancy speech giving all the anti-Trump forces their rhetorical viagra. The media fell over in a rapturous applause. And no one bothered to remember all politics is local. Jeff Flake defeated himself with a series of poor decisions over six years that alienated him from his base, alienated Republican donors who he heavily pursued in 2012, and then alienated Trump fans.

Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Washington Times.

How do you know when the liberal media meltdown is approaching an apex? Just look for apples, bananas and a strong smell of smug.

Reaching deep in their drawer of smug, CNN unleashed a “Facts First” initiative, starting with an ad featuring an apple, with a voice-over warning viewers that some awful, yet unnamed, person or network is trying to convince you the apple is a banana. While a juvenile attempt to discredit President Trump’s complaints about the network’s shoddy news coverage, they manage only to remind us of why they’re in this fix in the first place.

What CNN reveals with this abject sanctimony is their contempt for the viewers themselves. “This is an apple. Some people might try to tell you that it’s a banana. They might scream banana, banana, banana, over and over and over again. They might put BANANA in all caps. You might even start to believe that this is a banana. But it’s not.

I asked my adult daughter and oldest granddaughter if they had ever encountered sexual harassment.
Even more shocking was the response I received from my granddaughter, who is a nurse at a hospital in San Antonio, Texas.
All the jobs I have ever had, there has been sexual harassment.
i.e., sexual harassment.","While trying not to indulge in schadenfreude over those hypocritical Hollywood elites who’ve claimed to stand for “women’s rights,” only to be accused of sexually harassing them, I noticed “#MeToo” trending on Twitter. At #MeToo, women who have been sexually harassed are invited to post their experiences and many have done so, including four female U.S. senators.

I asked my adult daughter and oldest granddaughter if they had ever encountered sexual harassment. My daughter said at a previous job her boss “invited” her to sit on his lap. She refused and no longer works there.

Even more shocking was the response I received from my granddaughter, who is a nurse at a hospital in San Antonio, Texas. I reprint her account (with her permission) because it contains a lesson, not only for men, but for the male-dominated culture.

I will not use her last name to protect her from more bad experiences. Crystal writes:

“It’s a tough subject to speak on. Personally, I have been sexually harassed many times in my workplace and generally speaking. All the jobs I have ever had, there has been sexual harassment. I am a nurse and have had doctors make inappropriate comments. I’ve felt very uncomfortable and have tried to ignore or ‘laugh off’ the remarks for fear of retaliation. These are doctors I have needed orders from for my patients. The last thing I need is for them to be mad at me. So, when I see the ones who have made inappropriate remarks, I smile and say hello. I’m sure if I ever went to report (them) it would somehow be turned on me like I did something wrong. So I just ‘laugh it off’ and move on, because, just like Harvey (Weinstein), doctors are the ones bringing in the big bucks and are granted immunity for certain things ... i.e., sexual harassment.

“As a mother … I think it’s important to teach our children to stick up for themselves always, and it’s never OK for someone to harass them in any way. It’s equally important for boys and girls to learn this. It’s important to teach right and wrong and promote what is right ALWAYS.”

“Generally speaking when instances occur outside of work I have stood up for myself, and am then treated as if I am wrong for doing so.”

Commenting on pictures of Hollywood actresses hugging Weinstein, Crystal continues: “I understand why these women are all smiles with this man. He is powerful in their community. He has power over their career. And I’m sure he is the reason they are famous. Like me, and so many others, these women were afraid to speak up and to stand up to this man fearing their livelihood would be negatively affected.

“Females deal with this BS constantly ... it’s never comfortable, especially when you have to continue seeing or working with the person/people. It’s always an awkward situation to be in, especially when the person has a higher position of power.

“As a mother … I think it’s important to teach our children to stick up for themselves always, and it’s never OK for someone to harass them in any way. It’s equally important for boys and girls to learn this. It’s important to teach right and wrong and promote what is right ALWAYS.”

Powerful stuff, but in an age when the lines between right and wrong, good and bad are blurred, if not eliminated, and with culture and opinion polls defining moral standards which are constantly in flux, sexual harassment is only one of many consequences when “societal norms” are obliterated.

Perhaps the best way to address this is to put more women in charge — the right kind of women, like Crystal.","Cal Thomas: #MeToo: My daughter and granddaughter, too",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/24/cal-thomas-metoo-my-daughter-and-granddaughter-too.html

The Dursleys don’t like Harry asking questions; in fact, they don’t seem to like anything about him, especially the very odd things that keep happening around him (which Harry himself can’t explain).

“The Dursleys’ greatest fear is that Harry will discover the truth about himself, so when letters start arriving for him near his eleventh birthday, he isn’t allowed to read them. However, the Dursleys aren’t dealing with an ordinary postman, and at midnight on Harry’s birthday the gigantic Rubeus Hagrid breaks down the door to make sure Harry gets to read his post at last.

“Ignoring the horrified Dursleys, Hagrid informs Harry that he is a wizard, and the letter he gives Harry explains that he is expected at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in a month’s time.

“To the Dursleys’ fury, Hagrid also reveals the truth about Harry’s past. Harry did not receive the scar on his forehead in a car-crash; it is really the mark of the great dark sorcerer Voldemort, who killed Harry’s mother and father but mysteriously couldn’t kill him, even though he was a baby at the time. Harry is famous among the witches and wizards who live in secret all over the country because Harry’s miraculous survival marked Voldemort’s downfall.

“So Harry, who has never had friends or family worth the name, sets off for a new life in the wizarding world. He takes a trip to London with Hagrid to buy his Hogwarts equipment (robes, wand, cauldron, beginners’ draft and potion kit) and shortly afterwards, sets off for Hogwarts from Kings Cross Station (platform nine and three-quarters) to follow in his parents’ footsteps.

“Harry makes friends with Ronald Weasley (sixth in his family to go to Hogwarts and tired of having to use second-hand spellbooks) and Hermione Granger (cleverest girl in the year and the only person in the class to know all the uses of dragon’s blood).”

Of course, this note passed through many, many hands before it was finally accepted by a publisher.

A few years ago, Rowling even told a fan on Twitter that “loads” of people had rejected it before it became a success.

A Kansas bus driver makes it her highest priority to boost the morale of the students she picks up and drops off every day.

Jan Dumcum, of Goddard, Kan., has been driving the bus in the school district for five years, KAKE reported. Dumcum’s bus, similar to many other yellow school buses on the outside, has a totally different atmosphere once you step inside.

“Everything that is up here has a purpose. I want them (the students) to feel good about themselves. I want them to feel like they can do anything,” Dumcum told KAKE.

Dumcum also keeps a bell by the door that the students ring to remind her they were going to have a “good day.”

""I decided they would announce they were going to have a good day by ringing the bell and in the evening when they rang the bell, they had a good day,"" the bus driver said.

Dumcum said the safety of the children was her main priority but was cautious of the drivers who fail to stop behind the bus.

""There are people on that street that can't give me three minutes to get my kids safely and that's very frustrating,"" the driver said.

The bus, which is currently decorated for Halloween, will also be adorned for Christmas. KAKE said the bus would be embellished with lights to help students get into the holiday spirit.

Ambassador Haley will visit South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, part of the deadliest region in the world since the Second World War.

The number of deaths resulting from violent conflict during the past three decades alone in South Sudan and Congo approaches eight million. Both are semi-authoritarian states, marked by well-developed kleptocracies in which the ruling cliques have hijacked their governing institutions and repurposed them for private financial gain. While billions of humanitarian and peacekeeping aid dollars flow in every year, billions have flown out into the hidden accounts of the countries’ leaders and their commercial collaborators, both domestic and international.

These are not poor countries. They have immense natural resource wealth in the form of gold, oil, diamonds, cobalt, copper, tin, other important minerals, and ivory from elephants. These extraordinary national assets are lining the pockets of the countries’ leaders rather than spearheading economic development and prosperity.

In both countries, wars have raged in large part because their rulers allow no peaceful way to share wealth and power. Absent democratic processes or basic freedoms, some marginalized populations rise in armed revolt. In some countries in Africa and around the world, wars have produced effective peace processes, which when handled competently have led to peacefully settled disputes and properly functioning and accountable governing institutions.

Until the model of peacemaking is fixed and until the region’s leaders begin to pay a price for their financial and human rights crimes, the status quo will enjoy a further lease on life.

In East and Central Africa, however, peace efforts have consistently failed due to a common but fatal flaw. The regional heads of state who lead these processes attempt to prop up their autocratic fellow heads of state in war-torn countries in an attempt to resist African-wide demands for democratization. The leaders of most of the countries sponsoring the peace talks are themselves strongmen who rule over semi-authoritarian or authoritarian states, and thus have an interest in engendering or replicating similar governing systems in their neighbors. This cannot work, however, in South Sudan and Congo, nor in Sudan, Burundi, Central African Republic, or other conflict-ridden states in the region where current leaders cannot enforce stability through violence alone.

South Sudan’s and Congo’s kleptocratic ruling parties concentrate all power and wealth, leaving large swathes of the population completely marginalized and highly motivated to violently contest the status quo. Because this rot at the core has never been addressed through peace efforts, endless conflict results.

Peace efforts led by regional leaders have done little to promote inclusive processes and transitions, and they often manipulate peace efforts to achieve their own political and economic interests. Their mediation model receives little or no challenge from external states supporting the efforts, such as the United States, China, and key European governments, as well as United Nations peacekeeping missions in Congo and South Sudan.

Ambassador Haley has a two-fold opportunity to help alter the negative trajectory of peace efforts in South Sudan and Congo. First, she should confront this failed conflict resolution model that aims to reinforce semi-authoritarian kleptocrats in an effort to create stability. The U.S. should be pressing for inclusive peace agreements with real power and wealth sharing tied to democratic transitions in both Congo and South Sudan. U.S. advocacy for basic freedoms should be prioritized, because repression will only beget more violence and extremism, as demonstrated in neighboring Sudan, where the regime continues to provide support to radicalized groups that recruit for ISIS and al-Qaeda.

Second, for the U.S. to have a role in reforming these efforts for peace and human rights, new leverage must be built. To create that leverage, Ambassador Haley should work with allies to impose biting consequences on the leaders of governments or rebel groups and their networks of collaborators who undermine peace, orchestrate war crimes, repress fundamental rights, and steal the natural resource wealth of their countries. Utilizing the tools of financial pressure – particularly targeted sanctions on networks of leaders and their commercial partners combined with the aggressive use of anti-money laundering measures – can help shift the calculations of the region’s war-mongers over time from war to peace and from mass corruption to good governance. There has to be a price for intransigence, and the U.S. has the underutilized policy tools to begin to exact that price.

I cannot help it that the Washington media and much of both the anti-Trump and pro-Trump forces have narratives they want to push that are falsehoods, but I can tell you the truth about Jeff Flake.

Flake is no martyr. You can love his speech, and it was good, but let’s not kid ourselves. Flake says our kids are going to ask what we did to stop what is happening and Flake’s honest answer will be he quit. And he is quitting. But the media narrative on both sides is convenient, self-serving, and a fabrication.

I’m sorry Trump haters, but Jeff Flake is no martyr who spoke truth to power and met defeat for doing so. I’m sorry Trump humpers, but Steve Bannon did not defeat Jeff Flake in a game of 13 dimensional chess. The truth is Jeff Flake defeated himself.

Jeff Flake had a 100 percent lifetime Club for Growth record in the United States House of Representatives. He was a conservative’s conservative and stood up to the House GOP leadership. He used that reputation to catapult himself into the Senate with the backing of most every major conservative group. He towed a tough line on the budget, ObamaCare, immigration, etc.

Then he got to the Senate and promptly caved on it all. Friends of his tell me that he had no support system in the Senate. In the House, at least, there were other Club for Growth candidates. The smaller Senate with even fewer conservatives unleashed Jeff Flake’s need to be liked. He went from being a reliable Club for Growth members to a reliable Mitch McConnell member.

Jeff Flake defeated himself with a series of poor decisions over six years that alienated him from his base, alienated Republican donors who he heavily pursued in 2012, and then alienated Trump fans.

Voters in Arizona felt betrayed.

Democrats had no use for Flake because he spent years campaigning as a hard core conservative. Republicans had no use for him because he lied his way into the Senate, promptly doing the opposite of many of his core campaign promises. Flake failed to build a new coalition of support while heaping scorn on his existing coalition.

Flake could have been opposed to President Trump and even been outspoken about it. But he could not sell out his conservatism and then become an outspoken Trump critic. That is, however, what he chose to do.

So yesterday he gave a fancy speech giving all the anti-Trump forces their rhetorical viagra. The media fell over in a rapturous applause. And no one bothered to remember all politics is local. Jeff Flake defeated himself with a series of poor decisions over six years that alienated him from his base, alienated Republican donors who he heavily pursued in 2012, and then alienated Trump fans.

He was in jeopardy before going to war with President Trump.

WAWA SANDWICH CONTAINED MAGGOTS, MAN CLAIMS

Lisa Donovan, who says she slipped on the discarded “hoagie guts” in June of 2014, argued that the incident was the result of negligence on the part of Wawa. However, defense attorneys claimed that Donovan had failed to provide testimony from a liability expert on the issue of whether or not the store was negligent. They also asked for a summary judgement.

The AP reports that Donovan argued an expert was unnecessary, as dirty parking lots are a hazard that anyone can identify. The judge agreed, likening the abandoned “hoagie guts” to a pool of water on the floor of a grocery store.

“Whether Defendant was negligent in cleaning up ‘hoagie guts’ in its parking lot, is within the intelligence of a layperson … a lay jury has common knowledge of what conditions are expected and reasonable in a grocery store or when walking down a residential street,” the judge found, per court documents.

The judge also denied Wawa’s motion for a summary judgement.

While there's nothing groundbreaking, it does provide us with some interesting background information on the relationship between Jobs and Clinton.","As the CEO of Apple, not to mention a widely revered tech luminary, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was no stranger to rubbing elbows with the political elite. Especially towards the last few years of his life, and coinciding with the ever-increasing relevance of technology in our day-to-day lives, Jobs became discernibly more visible on the political scene. As a quick example, Jobs in 2012 famously told then-President Barack Obama that the manufacturing jobs responsible for making the iPhone a reality ""aren't coming back"" to the United States. You might also recall that Jobs even gave Clinton advice during the Monica Lewisnky scandal of 1998.

""Please excuse my presumption in making these suggestions,"" the letter notes at the end. ""I just wanted to make sure that these folks didn't escape your attention as you make these critical decisions.""

Jobs further championed Grove in a follow-up letter:

Andy is at the center of the exploding information revolution, and he could bring many of these perspectives to defense strategy and its current uses of information technology (command & control, intelligence,). He could be a secret weapon to change our perspectives and thinking about defense as our nation faces new world roles and fiscal limitations. I have never met a better manager and leader in my life (including Dave Packard and Bob Noyce). Andy has no public policy experience, but he is one of the smartest and fastest learners I have ever met. He was born in Hungary and is a US citizen.

Unsurprisingly, when the school system began to focus on left-wing indoctrination and intimidation instead of the fundamentals of education, student performance began to slip.

Every American, in every state should make sure their elected school officials are focused on education – not political indoctrination.","Headlines about left-wing college students engaging in radical, sometimes racially charged protests are becoming all too common.

In October 2016, students at University of California, Berkeley created a human chain in an attempt to block white students from going to class.

This past May, students at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington demanded – in the name of racial equity – that white students stay home from school for a day. These students shouted down faculty who disagreed with them, and the dispute led to multiple protests that eventually forced the college to hold its commencement ceremony 30 miles away from campus.

These stories are outrageous, but unfortunately, nothing new. Universities have been a hotbed for left-wing activism for decades. In fact, Ronald Reagan ran for Governor of California in 1966 promising to crack down on the rioting and radicalism at Berkeley.

This sudden decline in performance is what happens when educators think it is their job to impose their political views on students.

A recent story out of Minnesota, however, suggests that the left is now bringing this same radicalism to K-12 public education, and the ones suffering are the young students, who are in their most impressionable years.

Katherine Kersten, founding director and Senior Policy Fellow at the Center of the American Experiment, recently wrote about liberal policy and curriculum changes made by Edina school system officials in Minnesota that are causing the once celebrated school system to slip.

The school system itself adopted a so-called “All for All” policy in 2013 which all students “will acquire an awareness of their own cultural identity and value racial, cultural, and ethnic diversities so as to understand, communicate with, and effectively interact with people across cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds.”

This may sound innocent, even laudable. But the implementation of this policy shows it is merely a thinly veiled attempt to instill radical, left-wing political views in impressionable children.

According to Kersten, grade school-aged students in the Edina system are learning the alphabet by reading a book called A is for Activist.

As the title suggests, it’s a left-wing “ABC” book that teaches children concepts such as C stands for “Creative Counter to Corporate vultures,” “F is for Feminist,” “T is for Trans” – you get the idea.

The book’s own description describes it as being “written and illustrated for the next generation of progressives: families who want their kids to grow up in a space that is unapologetic about activism, environmental justice, civil rights, LGBTQ rights, and everything else that activists believe in and fight for.”

This is pure, unapologetic political indoctrination of American youth. Imagine the outrage among educators if young students were assigned a book designed to create the next generation of conservatives.

The indoctrination continues throughout the student experience in the school system.

An 11th grade U.S. Literature and Composition teacher in the Edina system instructs students in her syllabus that by the end of the school year, they will have, “learned how to apply marxist [sic], feminist, post-colonial, psychoanalytic, reader response, and aesthetic lenses to literature.” Notice the absence of any sort of conservative or traditionalist lens.

A high school in the system offered a course called “Race, Racism, and Whiteness” as an elective during its May term in the 2016-2017 school year. The school system superintendent later denied offering such a course, but the Center of the American Experiment found proof.

When President Trump was elected, Kersten writes that the entire school system went into hysteria. Teachers were openly crying in class the day after the election, and one reportedly told students that “Trump winning is worse than 9/11 and the Columbine shooting.”

Many students who don’t conform to the liberal leanings of the faculty reported being afraid to express their opinions, and after the election, some requested to be picked up early from school for fear of being berated for their views.

Unsurprisingly, when the school system began to focus on left-wing indoctrination and intimidation instead of the fundamentals of education, student performance began to slip.

Citing Minnesota Department of Education statistics, Kersten reported that the percentage of students attending Edina High School who met state standards for reading dropped from 86 percent in 2014 to 79 percent in 2017. In math, 79 percent of Edina high school students were performing at grade level in 2014, while only 66 percent are today.

The high school used to be fifth in the state for reading scores, now it’s 29th. It used to be 10th in math proficiency, now it’s 40th.

Presidential advisers cutting sweetheart deals with a foreign power, signing million dollar lobbying contracts with that foreign power, bribes being proffered, and the foreign government gained unprecedented access to government agencies and crucial U.S. natural resources? And what if I told you that foreign power was Russia?

Collusion you say? Perhaps. Collusion with Trump? Nope.

I’m talking about a news story that fittingly is coming back from the dead just before Halloween to scare a lot of Democrats, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Obama administration officials. If you want to take a deeper dive on this issue, read the book ""Clinton Cash,"" by Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute. But here are the basics.

A decade ago, a long-time Clinton Foundation donor, Frank Giustra, sold his uranium company to another firm, Uranium One. With that deal, Uranium One now owned uranium mines in the western U.S., including Wyoming, with about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity, and about ten percent of the actual uranium mined in the U.S.

In 2009, Rosatom, Russia’s nuclear agency, took a 17-percent position in Uranium One. A year later, in the summer of 2010, Rosatom bought majority control of the Uranium One, effectively giving the Russian government-controlled entity proprietary access to one-fifth of the U.S. uranium supply.

Consider this: Russia got its generous foothold in the U.S. uranium market in less time than it takes most 16-year-olds to get a driver’s license.

All of this was taking place after years of what could best be categorized as challenging times in U.S.-Russia relations, as Russia attempted to annex Georgia, intimidated Ukraine and threatened the former-captive nations of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia with short-range nuclear weapons. In short, Russia was doing nothing that would indicate it was a country unwilling to build and potentially use nuclear weapons; the signs of aggression were everywhere.

Now there is a process that the U.S. government uses to ensure that any business deal that may include significant national security issues is given serious, in-depth and careful review and approval. That review is run through the Treasury Department’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CIFIUS), which includes representatives from Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Justice, and State, as well as the U.S. trade representative and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and National Security Council. In addition, the director of national intelligence also has input to the review.

CIFIUS and Congressional reviews killed deals like the Rosatom purchase before. In 2006 it helped kill the deal by a Dubai owned company to buy U.S. ports, in part because of the national security risks it presented, and it killed multiple deals with Chinese companies as well in 2009 and 2010. Yet, between the first week of August 2010 and October 22, 2010, the Obama Administration in expedited time approved the sale of crucial national security resources to Russia by rubber stamping the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom. In 2015, Senator Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, noted the expedited time of the deal's approval in a letter to then Attorney General Loretta Lynch, calling it a deal that was ""apparently approved in record speed.""

According to most law firms that deal in such matters, CIFIUS reviews involving sensitive national security matters can take up to 120 days. The Rosatom deal took fewer than 90 days. More outrageous: it appears there were no Congressional oversight hearings. Even more outrageous – and puzzling – members of the CIFIUS review board were aware of attempts by Russian government efforts to bribe U.S.-based executives in the U.S. uranium industry at the time this deal was being approved.

This wasn’t simply your typical Clinton back room deal. This was a deal that was reviewed by virtually every senior Obama administration official, many of whom were aware of the Clinton connection, the FBI bribery investigation, and Rosatom’s history.

On October 5th of 2010, Republicans in Congress demanded that the Obama Administration review the Rosatom deal more closely, citing a host of national security issues. For example, one rationale cited by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for approving the deal was that Rosatom did not have an export license to sell or ship the U.S. uranium overseas. But as the Congressional letter noted, Russia’s government-controlled nuclear companies had been sanctioned numerous times for breaking uranium import-export deals, particularly to the countries they aid in building nuclear capacity, such as Iran (yes, Rosatom helped build the Iranian Bushere nuclear plant and trained Iranian nuclear scientists). To paraphrase a pop culture reference Vladamir Putin would appreciate: “An export license? Russia doesn’t need a stinkin’ export license!”

Consider this: Russia got its generous foothold in the U.S. uranium market in less time than it takes most 16-year-olds to get a driver’s license. Russia got its deal moved through the Obama Administration faster than it took the Obama Administration Department of Justice’s Anti-Trust Division to approve any of the mergers of two U.S. companies it reviewed.

How is that possible? Clearly there were motivated folks to get the deal done. One of those was clearly Hillary Clinton, whose family foundation raked in millions from donors with ties to Russia, as well as the uranium industry. Some media outlets have pointed out that the total take for the foundation may have been as “little” as $4 million. But for a cash-starved foundation that can’t even afford to give back $250,000 from serial sex-offender Harvey Weinstein, $4 million is a decent cash reserve.

But let’s be clear, this wasn’t simply your typical Clinton back room deal. This was a deal that was reviewed by virtually every senior Obama administration official, many of whom were aware of the Clinton connection, the FBI bribery investigation, and Rosatom’s history. And let's not forget either: controlling the global supply chain is the very obvious goal of Putin's. To make matters worse, President Barack Obama reviewed the case.

Why would such a deal go through? Sometimes the easiest explanation is the right one: maybe it was nothing more than a payback to Democrat and Clinton donors. When nothing makes sense in Washington D.C., just follow the money.

While this scandal's original focus was on Uranium One and the Clinton Foundation, it goes far deeper into a Democratic administration than anyone within the party wants to admit. Which is perhaps why President Obama seemed less than excited about pushing the Trump-Russia collusion narrative. Perhaps in a rare moment of self-recollection and awareness, he realized that eventually the breadth of this story would end up exactly where we are today, with all eyes looking at Obama's appointees, wondering why they sold America’s national security for the uranium-market equivalent of 30 pieces of silver.",Hillary Clinton and the real Russian collusion,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/25/hillary-clinton-and-real-russian-collusion.html

Just last week, we had students from Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Japan, Liberia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, and Mali around our table. We’ve made our goal to fill our home as often as possible with people who are different from us—to learn, to laugh, and to grow—but you might not get that impression if you Google our business or check out my personal Facebook profile.

That’s because 10 months ago, my husband and I filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota law that would require our small business to celebrate same-sex marriages if we enter into the marriage industry at all.

As Christians, we’d love to use our talents as filmmakers to celebrate the goodness of marriage as taught in the Bible though our work, but the state has made it clear that if we don’t promote all messages about marriage, we’ll face enormous fines, and even up to 90 days in jail, simply for living according to our convictions.

Since then, we’ve received a staggering amount of messages wishing death, disease, and poverty on us, our family, and even some of our closest associates all because we challenged the idea that the government shouldn’t have the power to silence or threaten anyone for not promoting all messages.

So when a federal judge ruled in our case, and equated our request to protect our conscience to posting a “White Applicants Only” sign in our window, we were both hurt and deeply offended. Like most people in the expressive professions, we work with all people; we just can’t promote all messages.

A person’s protected status is irrelevant to these types of message-based decisions. For example, an atheist print-shop owner is no more guilty of religious discrimination for declining to design a T-shirt for a Christian that proclaims “God exists” than we are guilty of sexual orientation discrimination for declining to create films promoting messages about marriage with which we disagree.

Not just our business practices, but our whole lives, run counter to the “whites only” analogy. Two of our sons are adopted from Ethiopia. Our youngest child is half Cameroonian and half Native American. And having eight children means we can’t afford to travel the world, so we bring the world to us. We do this precisely because we believe beauty exists in the diversity of God’s creation.

In fact, several years ago we intentionally began to stay home on holidays so that we could celebrate with people who would otherwise have no place to go. This has included spending Christmas with an alcoholic Vietnam veteran, a bisexual international student, and yes, even Trump supporters, among many, many others. We love all people. We work with all people. We simply don’t promote all messages.

But the irony of it all is that every single person operates this way. Nobody wants to be forced to promote messages—via custom artistic expression in our case—or have to repress their own speech just because their opinion is unpopular in the eyes of the government.

If the First Amendment only protects speech that is popular in its cultural day, then it really doesn’t protect any speech.

This is why we’re appealing the court’s ruling. This case is about preserving the freedom of all people to live according to their sincerely held beliefs—a principle we all should be able to support.

We are all on a journey with our convictions. I wish I could invite you into our home and discuss it over one of my daughter’s amazing homemade lemon tarts. But until that can happen, no matter where you are on that path or what you believe about marriage, we should all be able to agree that living peacefully according to our deepest convictions without the fear of government punishment is best for everyone.",Christian videographer: Let's live together in peace instead of silencing those with whom we disagree,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/20/christian-videographer-lets-live-together-in-peace-instead-silencing-those-with-whom-disagree.html

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

A spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve, the U.S name given to the mission to defeat ISIS, told Fox News that the rebuilding of Raqqa will be overseen by the Raqqa Civil Council, a local governing body that has been put in charge since the liberation.
The U.S intention was for representatives from both Kurdish and Arab tribes in Raqqa province to join the council, and receive SDF support.
“Many of the Arab tribes didn’t even want to attend the liberation celebrations,” one Syrian insider told Fox News.
“The various local forces will make their own decisions and arrangements, and these would likely play out against our interests.”","The fall of the final ISIS stronghold of Raqqa – the terror group’s self-declared caliphate capital – by the Kurdish-led, U.S-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) last week has heralded much celebration.

But as the jubilation dies down, what remains is little more than smoldering rubble from air bombardment, akin to an apocalyptic wasteland. So whose burden is it to restore the ruined Raqqa?

“It is the responsibility of all countries, especially the U.S. and the Coalition because the Coalition’s airstrikes and artillery shelling were ‘half’ responsible for destroying Raqqa, the other half goes to ISIS car bombings,” local activist Sarmad Al Jilane, former CEO at Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently and now an advocacy expert at human rights media group Sound and Picture, told Fox News. “Around eighty percent of Raqqa is destroyed, and the rest is damaged.”

While the cost in lives goes far beyond any dollar amount – as tens of thousands of Raqqa residents have been run from their homes and livelihood with thousands more dead and disabled from almost four years of ISIS occupation – the return to any sense of normalcy will require billions.

According to the latest figures released by the Pentagon, U.S taxpayers have already spent an average of $13.6 million per day to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria since August 8, 2014 – just under $1.6 billion – of which the largest portion was shouldered by the Air Force. So should the U.S bear the responsibility of rebuilding?

Statistics released by monitoring group Air Wars claimed that U.S-led forces dropped 5,775 bombs, shells and missiles in the month of August alone – and more than 20,000 throughout the three-year campaign. While the U.S. has assumed much of the costs and planning to defeat ISIS in the Middle East, U.S Secretary of State Rex Tillerson earlier this year warned the international community that reconstruction will “require more from you.”

“The U.S has spent billions and took a big responsibility to get rid of ISIS. ISIS is a threat not only to the U.S but to the whole world, so the whole international community should be addressing the issue of rebuilding the city,” affirmed Bassam Barabandi, a Syrian diplomatic defector and now a political adviser to the official opposition negotiations team at the Syrian High Negotiations Committee.

A spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve, the U.S name given to the mission to defeat ISIS, told Fox News that the rebuilding of Raqqa will be overseen by the Raqqa Civil Council, a local governing body that has been put in charge since the liberation. The U.S has “no defined role in reconstruction,” the spokesperson said, and will remain focused on the final defeat of ISIS from pockets across Iraq and Syria.

The coalition is continuing to provide training to the SDF, thus funding such endeavors as the detection and removal of explosive ordnance, which have already killed members of at least nine families attempting to return to their homes in the city post-liberation.

The coalition also provides security and logistical support to the local council and to non-governmental agencies, to assist in rebuilding homes, buildings and medical buildings as well as restoring electricity and providing potable water.

However, some Syrians are warning that there are already glaring fractions within the Raqqa Civil Council, whose job ultimately is to plan the restoration and maintain its security. Syrians told Fox News that the council’s loyalties are largely divided.

The U.S intention was for representatives from both Kurdish and Arab tribes in Raqqa province to join the council, and receive SDF support. However, Raqqa is traditionally an overwhelmingly Sunni Arab-populated city, and a prominent portion would rather not be aligned with SDF but with Turkish forces, also Sunni Arabs, who view the Kurdish fighters as the enemy.

“Many of the Arab tribes didn’t even want to attend the liberation celebrations,” one Syrian insider told Fox News. “There is already a push to form a new council with new leadership.”

Al Jilane also argued that many members of the civil council “are not locals of Raqqa,” and for civilians to feel confident in returning, “locals and activists should be the ones in charge.”

In an effort to try and mobilize some of the disenfranchised Sunni tribesman and council members, Syrian sources said, Saudi Affairs Minister Thamer al-Sabhan visited Raqqa late last week alongside U.S special envoy to the coalition against ISIS, Brett McGurk, to meet with the Raqqa Civil Council.

It is believed Saudi Arabia – a prominent backer of opposition forces against the Assad regime – is mulling a request to significantly contribute to the rebuilding, in return for influence among the tribes.

While Syria’s embattled President Bashar al-Assad has insisted he intends to take back the entire country after more than six years of civil war, the U.S. has maintained that the territory is not to be returned into the dictator’s hands.

“The U.S. in partnership with allies including Gulf States like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will work as part of a stabilization effort. But we must ensure that not a single dollar goes into areas under control of the Assad regime,” noted Tony Badran, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD). “Otherwise, we would be paying Assad and Iran for having destroyed the country and ethnically cleansed its population.”

National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster concurred last week at an FDD that it is U.S. policy to ensure that absolutely no money goes to reconstructing anything that is under the regime’s control. However, Badran cautioned that the Russians are working in parallel to “create arrangements between the Kurdish-controlled areas and Damascus,” which means that if the U.S. wants to vigorously enforce that policy and maintain influence in the Raqqa region, it must now develop a broader plan beyond just defeating ISIS.

“Without a broader plan,” he cautioned. “The various local forces will make their own decisions and arrangements, and these would likely play out against our interests.”",Rebuilding Raqqa: Should U.S taxpayers pay to rebuild the ruined former ISIS stronghold?,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/25/rebuilding-raqqa-should-u-s-taxpayers-pay-to-rebuild-ruined-former-isis-stronghold.html

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html
70,"['arms', 'say', 'song', 'kiss', 'saw', 'took', 'love', 'daughter', 'happened', 'children', 'things', 'wife', 'looked']","But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other.
One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, we were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse. To love each other well is to love our children well.",What happened when my daughter saw me kiss my wife,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/what-happened-when-my-daughter-saw-me-kiss-my-wife.html

Charleston Hartfield, 34, was buried Friday following private graveside services. His burial came after a funeral that drew more than 2,000 family members, friends and police and military officers, with honors that included a motorcade down the Las Vegas Strip.

The married father of two was off-duty and attending the Oct. 1 concert where a gunman opened fire from a hotel room.

LAS VEGAS SHOOTING DETAILS STILL MURKY AS MANDALAY BAY ORDERED TO KEEP EVIDENCE

However, a year before his death, Hartfield began a computer file detailing the instructions for his funeral.

“If you’re reading this, then I’ve been called home,” Hartfield’s note read. The file was found by his wife, Veronica, following his death.

“Nothing I type will make this any easier, so I will get to the facts. My largest request: Please do not allow anyone to wear black. Black is totally depressing and I don’t want anyone expressing their sorrow over my passing,” Hartfield’s instructions read.

Hartfield asked that Nina Simone and Johnny Cash songs also be played during his funeral.

“I would like for everyone to enjoy themselves. And remember me for who I was. The truth only. None of that stuff about how great I was. Only real stories,” the officer wrote.

Everyone broke that rule over the next hour.

Friends, his cousin, brother and sister, and police and military officials including Brig. Gen. Zachary Doser, the head of the Nevada Army National Guard, characterized the man most called ""Chucky"" as an inspiration, a mentor and a quick wit.

Doser praised Hartfield, who at age 34 had accumulated 17 years of military service in Iraq and with a quartermaster unit in the Nevada Guard, as the epitome of ""everything good about being an American.""

Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo called Hartfield, an 11-year police veteran, a “remarkable officer” killed by “an unremarkable person.”

COUNTRY STARS HONOR LAS VEGAS SHOOTING VICTIMS AT CMT ARTISTS

Investigators have not determined what motivated the shooter, Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired accountant, real estate investor and high-stakes gambler, to plan and execute his attack.

Lombardo said Hartfield 's death was considered on-duty because he tried to shield, protect and shepherd people in a concert crowd from danger.

""That night, in a hail of gunfire, Charlie's last actions spoke for him,"" Lombardo said. ""He took actions to save lives.""

Hartfield asked to be buried in a veteran’s area so he could continue to “protect” the U.S. with the other buried veterans.

“The only way I would like to be placed in the ground is if it’s in a veteran’s area. That way myself and the crusty old vets can hold formations and continue to protect and serve our great country once more,” Hartfield wrote.

Gladd called Scovern and his friend Gannon Ingles to help retrieve the trapped dog.

Scovern captured the men using hiking gear to lapel down the mine shaft and retrieve the dog.

TEAM CLINTON BORROWS DON JR.’S RUSSIA DEFENSE

So here we are. The former spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s campaign is taking essentially the same position as Donald Trump Jr. about efforts to get help from Kremlin-tied operatives to help win the presidency.

Whoooo boy…

Brian Fallon, who was the top talker for Clinton’s campaign, responded to news that the campaign’s lawyer had lied about paying an American firm with close ties to Vladimir Putin’s regime to dig dirt on now-President Trump much the way Trump’s son did to the revelation that he eagerly agreed to a meeting with Putinists to get dirt on Hillary.

Fallon denied any knowledge of the lie, but then made it clear that he didn’t see anything wrong with dumping Kremlin-canted information into reporters’ inboxes. “…if I had gotten handed it last fall, I would have had no problem passing it along,” Fallon bragged.

When we think back to the revelation of Trump Jr.’s meeting with Russians peddling dirt on Clinton, there was a similar course of events. First, he denied participating in the meeting, then seemed to regret having participated and finally declared himself smart for having done so.

With this latest debacle, Team Clinton has swiftly vindicated the younger Trump and the central argument of their campaign about Russia canoodling which is that they may have done unsavory things, but that everybody else does it too.

To say that this substantially undercuts Clinton and her remaining devotees’ credibility in accusing Trump of Russia collusion just scratches the surface, but let’s back up for a moment and put in perspective what we are dealing with.

We have known for some time about the existence of the Russia-sourced dossier on Trump’s business and personal life that was compiled during his 2016 candidacy. CNN first reported in January that a prominent Republican supporting one of Trump’s primary rivals commissioned the firm Fusion GPS to put together a dirt pile on Trump. After Trump won the nomination, Democratic figures picked up the case expanded the efforts to include the work of a former British spy.

The big news today is not that Democrats were involved in producing this scandal-soaked report on Trump’s vulnerabilities to Russian influence, but that the effort was tied directly to Clinton’s campaign and the national party.

When we look back at how Democrats got to their current pitiful condition the misjudgment and obliviousness of Clinton’s campaign and its proxies at the DNC will deserve special consideration.

We don’t know how much Team Clinton knew about Fusion GPS’s ties to Putin, particularly the efforts to roll back sanctions against Russian oligarchs imposed on friends of Moscow’s murderous regime. But it could have hardly been a secret that the firm had Russia connections. After all, that’s why they hired them.

We don’t know which parts of the dossier are credible and which parts are not. That long ago became the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But we do know that nothing about this revelation should bring more than cold comfort to Republicans worried about what Mueller might have on Trump.

Trump defenders are pushing hard on a narrative that the whole investigation is the fruit of this dossier. That is far from the truth. Both Trump’s former campaign chairman and former national security adviser would have likely been bound for the dock regardless of if the dossier had ever existed.

It didn’t take a former member of MI-6 to sniff out Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn.

But what this revelation and Fallon’s response does do is bolster the case of the most cynical of Trump supporters who say that whatever Team Trump did with Russian figures is permissible because Clinton would have done as bad or worse if given the chance.

TIME OUT: MAZEL TOV!

Fox News: “A huge trove of Jewish documents and manuscripts, thought to have been destroyed in the Holocaust, has been discovered in Lithuania. More than 170,000 pages of rare materials, including a postcard from famed modernist painter Marc Chagall and letters from the writer Sholem Aleichem, were found in the Martynas Mazvydas National Library of Lithuania, earlier this year. The discovery, announced Tuesday by the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York, is of immense historical importance. ‘When a find like this comes along, it’s monumental,’ David Fishman, professor of Jewish history at the Jewish Theological Seminary and author of the book, ‘The Book Smugglers’ told Fox News. ‘It’s the most important find since the Dead Sea Scrolls.’ Fishman explained that discoveries such as this can offer valuable insight into the lives of East European Jews before the Holocaust. ‘Not only were the Jews annihilated, but also the record of their history was destroyed,’ he said.”

FLAKE DEPARTURE MAY HELP GOP SALVAGE SEAT

FiveThirtyEight: “Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, an ardent critic of President Trump, announced Tuesday that he will not run for re-election in 2018. Flake, a Republican, was arguably the most vulnerable senator of either party who was up for re-election next year… So how does Flake’s exit change Arizona’s 2018 Senate election? Big picture: It doesn’t. Arizona is likely to remain the Democrats’ best opportunity to pick up a Republican-held seat. But Flake’s retirement could make that pickup more or less likely — we just don’t know which yet. The general election between the likely Democratic nominee, U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, and whomever the Republicans nominate starts as a tossup. At this time, the only notable Republican running against Sinema is Kelli Ward, a former Arizona state senator who has closely aligned herself with Trump. Sinema led Ward in an August HighGround Public Affairs survey 32 percent to 31 percent, with 38 percent of voters undecided.”

McConnell-tied Super PAC comes out swinging against Ward - The Hill: “A Republican super PAC with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Tuesday took a shot at former Arizona state Sen. Kelli Ward (R), arguing that she will not be the Republican nominee in the wake of Sen. Jeff Flake’s (R-Ariz.) decision to not run for reelection. … ‘Sen. Jeff Flake will be remembered for a distinguished and impactful career in Congress, as well as his independent streak and genial manner,’ Senate Leadership Fund president Steven Law said in a statement. ‘The one political upshot of Sen. Flake’s decision today is that Steve Bannon’s hand-picked candidate, conspiracy-theorist Kelli Ward, will not be the Republican nominee for this Senate seat in 2018.’”

Arpaio still considering run for Flake’s seat - WashEx: “Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio says he’s still considering a Senate campaign in Arizona… Arpaio … previously said he was considering a primary challenge against Flake. ‘It’s still out there, I haven’t made a decision,’ he told the Washington Examiner on Tuesday, shortly after Flake’s announcement. The former sheriff said he met twice recently with Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist who has sought to recruit anti-establishment Senate candidates.”

Flake says he’s had ‘enough’ - WaPo: “There is a sickness in our system — and it is contagious. … Nine months of this administration is enough for us to stop pretending that this is somehow normal, and that we are on the verge of some sort of pivot to governing, to stability. Nine months is more than enough for us to say, loudly and clearly: Enough. The outcome of this is in our hands. We can no longer remain silent, merely observing this train wreck, passively, as if waiting for someone else to do something. The longer we wait, the greater the damage, the harsher the judgment of history.”

Jay Cost: But as for you Sen. Corker… - WaPo: “Flake always opposed Trump, and he can say that he finally decided to issue the full-throated denunciation Trump had coming. [Bob Corker?] His late awakening shouldn’t win him any points. … Corker is a different story altogether, deserving neither praise nor sympathy. He helped facilitate Trump’s march to the Oval Office, and has only recently grown squeamish over the president’s antics. But why now? After all, Trump is doing exactly what we never-Trumpers warned he would do — and what Trump himself telegraphed that he’d do. For onetime Trump backers like Corker to suddenly act surprised and dismayed by the president’s bad behavior reeks of hypocrisy.”



DEMS RAISING AND RECRUITING BIGLY. BUT WHERE

NYT: “Democratic congressional challengers have posted very impressive fund-raising tallies so far this year. In the last quarter, nearly three dozen Republican incumbents were outraised by at least one Democratic challenger — an astonishing number against sitting members of Congress. … But there’s an important pattern under the big numbers that will shape the battleground in the 2018 midterm elections. So far, nearly all of the biggest Democratic recruiting struggles have been in working-class areas. And Democrats might have too many challengers successfully fund-raising in the most affluent districts. Democrats have debated extensively about whether they ought to focus on winning back working-class Trump voters or on expanding their gains in diverse, well-educated Sun Belt suburbs. This can be a false choice: They can do both to some extent, especially in congressional elections where individual candidates can run campaigns well suited to their districts.”

Kraushaar: Why Northam scares liberal Democrats - National Journal: “A former George W. Bush voter, [Virginia Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam] is running as a moderate Democratic pragmatist in the spirit of Bill Clinton—or recently-elected Gov. Roy Cooper, one of the most-prominent Democrats to win during last year’s Trump wave in neighboring North Carolina. And despite all the Democratic angst about the race tightening, his own campaign’s polls have shown him consistently ahead. The average of public polling shows that he’s leading by a healthy 6-point margin. The real reason you’re hearing so much wailing from Democrats is because they fear that Northam could pave the way for a moderate revival within the party—that a victory would prove that the party’s candidates can win without being held hostage by the increasingly progressive base.”

GOP establishment locks arms with Roy Moore for fundraising - Politico: “Roy Moore has campaigned as Mr. Anti-Establishment. Now, he and the establishment are starting to link up. The Alabama Republican’s Senate campaign on Tuesday signed a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee, National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Alabama Republican Party, according to a filing with the Federal Election Commission. … Moore has pledged to oppose Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, among other things. But the fundraising pact is a formal behind-the-scenes step by the establishment to support Moore, after unsuccessfully spending millions to defeat him in Alabama’s primary.”



CUTS TO RETIREMENT SAVINGS TAX SHELTER STILL ON TABLE

WSJ: “Republicans are still weighing adjustments to a popular retirement savings program, the chief of the House tax writing committee said Wednesday, contradicting President Donald Trump’s statement this week that it would be unchanged in the forthcoming tax overhaul proposal. Ahead of next week’s release of the House GOP tax overhaul bill, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R., Texas) also said House Republicans were still discussing changes to the state and local tax deduction, and said he was hopeful that they would reach a compromise with lawmakers from high-tax states. Mr. Brady’s remarks at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor indicated that many aspects of the tax code were still in play just days before Republicans plan to release their proposal for rewriting it. Mr. Brady said Tuesday that he planned to unveil the tax bill Nov. 1 if Republicans adopt a budget as planned on Thursday.”



Deficits, schmeficits - WaPo: “House conservatives have warned for years about the threat posed by the national debt, and for months they pushed to include a path to ambitious spending cuts in budget legislation. On Thursday, most of them plan to vote for a Senate-written budget that not only fails to make way for spending cuts but also explicitly envisions adding up to $1.5 trillion to the existing $20 trillion national debt to accommodate a tax overhaul.”



Senate fight on domestic spying up next - WaPo: “The Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday voted 12-3 to advance a bill that renews a powerful surveillance authority enabling the government to collect foreign intelligence on U.S. soil. Though the committee’s bill imposes a new procedural requirement for the FBI to review and use Americans’ emails and other communications collected under the authority, it does not require a warrant as many privacy-minded lawmakers wanted. Nor does it require that a federal court find that the American whose communications is searched may be engaged in criminal activity or is an agent of a foreign power. Instead, during a closed session, the committee voted unanimously to include a proposal from Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) as an amendment to the reauthorization of the law, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, according two individuals close to the committee.”

Congress votes to roll back provision making easier to sue banks - USA Today: “The Republican-led Senate narrowly voted Tuesday to repeal a banking rule that would let consumers band together to sue their bank or credit card company to resolve financial disputes. Vice President [Mike Pence] cast the final vote to break a 50-50 tie. The banking industry had been lobbying hard to roll back the regulation from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau had moved to ban most types of mandatory arbitration clauses found in the fine print of agreements consumers often enter into when opening a checking account or getting a credit card. The vote reflects the effort of the Trump administration and congressional Republicans to undo regulations that the GOP argues harms the free market. The measure now moves to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.”



Senate passes hurricane relief, flood insurance package - Bloomberg: “The Senate sent President Donald Trump a $36.5 billion hurricane relief bill Tuesday that gives Puerto Rico access to $4.9 billion in low-interest Treasury loans, amid concerns that recovery efforts from the recent disasters will require significantly more funding. The measure, passed 82-17, also would replenish the troubled National Flood Insurance Program, which runs out of money as early as this week. The vote followed a failed push by Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas to insert more disaster recovery aid into the bill for his state, hit hard by flooding from Hurricane Harvey in late August. Democrat Bill Nelson of Florida also pushed unsuccessfully for up to $3 billion more for his state’s citrus industry.”

DEA faces subpoena over ‘pill dumping’ - The Hill: “Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) on Wednesday threatened to subpoena the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for data on ‘pill dumping’ in West Virginia that could be contributing to the state’s opioid crisis. Walden said the agency is taking too long to comply with the Energy and Commerce Committee’s May 8 request for information regarding drug suppliers pumping millions of opioids into the state West Virginia. … The agency has responded to some, but not all, requests for information, Walden said, adding that some responses have been inadequate. ’I’m going to be very blunt: my patience is wearing thing,’ he said.”

TRUMP DATA MAVEN REACHED OUT TO ASSANGE

Daily Beast: “Alexander Nix, who heads a controversial data-analytics firm that worked for President Donald Trump’s campaign, wrote in an email last year that he reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange about Hillary Clinton’s missing 33,000 emails. Nix, who heads Cambridge Analytica, told a third party that he reached out to Assange about his firm somehow helping the WikiLeaks editor release Clinton’s missing emails, according to two sources familiar with a congressional investigation into interactions between Trump associates and the Kremlin. Those sources also relayed that, according to Nix’s email, Assange told the Cambridge Analytica CEO that he didn’t want his help, and preferred to do the work on his own. If the claims Nix made in that email are true, this would be the closest known connection between Trump’s campaign and Assange. … After publication, Assange provided this statement to The Daily Beast: ‘We can confirm an approach by Cambridge Analytica and can confirm that it was rejected by WikiLeaks.’”

Manafort faces money-laundering probe in collaboration with Russia probe - WSJ: “The Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office is pursuing an investigation into possible money laundering by Paul Manafort, said three people familiar with the matter, adding to the federal and state probes concerning the former Trump campaign chairman. The investigation by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York is being conducted in collaboration with a probe by special counsel Robert Mueller into Mr. Manafort and possible money laundering, according to two of these people.”

House Republicans open two investigations into Obama era - NYT: “House Republicans on Tuesday announced investigations into two of President Trump’s most frequent grievances, unveiling new inquiries into actions of the Obama administration connected to Hillary Clinton. In the first of two back-to-back announcements, the top Republicans on the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees said they would formally examine the Obama Justice Department’s investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s emails. Less than an hour later, Republicans from the Intelligence and Oversight Committees said they were opening a separate inquiry into the administration’s approval of a 2010 agreement that left a Russian-backed company in control of much of the United States’ uranium. … But the uranium deal and the Justice Department’s handling of the Clinton case have been regular targets of Mr. Trump’s, first on the 2016 presidential campaign trail and now in Washington.”

AUDIBLE: HMMMMMMMM…

“I haven’t decided to run. But I’ve decided I’m not going to decide not to run. We’ll see what happens.” – Former Vice President Joe Biden discussing a potential 2020 presidential run in an interview with Vanity Fair.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“With respect to 401 K’s. That’s where middle America lives. They don’t do Roth’s. This is just a scheme to add more tax dollars to the coffers. My guess is many of the people on the Hill don’t know how to work a grocery store. They don’t know that volume decreases prices, therefore people buy more, expanding the economy for goods and services. But hey the good ole boys want to increase the price of goods and services, thereby decreasing the trade of goods and services. Let it be said that trends start in California, but DC is the last to know.” – Doreen Howard, Newmarket, N.H.



[Ed. note: You are quite right, Ms. Howard, that D.C. is often the last to know. And you are also quite right that employer-based tax shelters for retirement are hugely popular with middle-class voters. As it stands, workers are allowed to contribute up to $18,500 a year tax free. That bumps up to $24,000 for folks over 50. That makes the proposal to lower the cap to as little as $2,400 sound very dramatic. The current estimate is that the government misses out on about $115 billion a year in revenue because of these tax shelters, so it’s reasonable to ask how much of the $1.5 trillion Republicans are looking to offset in revenues could be raised by dropping the caps. The investment firm Vanguard estimates that 94 million Americans hold assets in excess of $7 trillion in 401(k)’s or similar vehicles. That sounds like a lot of money, but relatively few Americans are getting anywhere close to the current caps. In fact, American workers are far behind where they need to be in their retirement savings in general. The issue for these accounts and the tax plan may not be their unpopularity but that the real revenues that the bill’s authors are looking for might not really be there.]



“I was just thinking, after listening to Senator Corker’s remarks, about term limits. If term limits were imposed do you think that there would be more of this kind of what do I have to lose attitude? Is this just something that is specific to this President in that he loves picking fights and now has some Senators who aren’t scared to talk back? Would the feeling of a time limit on their time in office overshadow all of this and cause them to work harder on getting things done? Just curious your thoughts.” – Jeff Cox, Broken Arrow, Okla.

[Ed. note: I think there’s a lot of truth to that, Mr. Cox. If Americans want more straight talk from their lawmakers, more lame ducks might mean more honesty. For those concerned about the way term limits might make it harder for the legislative branch to stand up to the executive, your point certainly cuts in the other direction.]

A MODEST LIFE IS A HAPPY LIFE, BUT $1.56 MIL DOESN’T HURT

NPR: “[At] Tokyo’s Imperial Hotel [in 1922], a courier came to the door to make a delivery. The courier either refused a tip or [Albert Einstein] had no small change, but Einstein wanted to give the messenger something nonetheless. So on a piece of hotel stationery, Einstein wrote in German his theory of happiness: ‘A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness.’ … He told the bellhop to save the notes — they just might be valuable in the future. And indeed they were. In an auction in Jerusalem on Tuesday, the note on happiness sold to an anonymous European bidder for $1.56 million. … The seller of the Imperial Hotel notes is reportedly a grandson of the Japanese bellboy’s brother who lives in Germany. It turns out Einstein’s theory of valuation was right on the money: ‘They are very, very happy,’ [a spokeswoman for the auction house] told the Times.”

These attributes, Nissan says, help strengthen the link between the car and its owner, by turning the car from simply a mode of transport to something more of a close, reliable partner capable of delivering a safer, more convenient and more environmentally friendly way of getting from point A to B.

On Wednesday, Nissan unveiled a concept at the 2017 Tokyo Motor Show that embodies the complete Nissan Intelligent Mobility philosophy.

Called the IMx, the concept is in the form of an electric SUV built on the same platform as the recently revealed second-generation Leaf. Unlike the Leaf, the IMx has a substantial range of 373 miles on a single charge, made possible by a specially developed high-density battery stored in the vehicle floor.

An electric motor features at each axle creating an all-wheel-drive system. The combined peak output is 430 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque, which is enough to rival some V-8 engines from not long ago.

You won’t always be using that grunt when behind the wheel of the IMx. That’s because the concept car has a self-driving mode. When selected, the special mode stows the steering wheel inside the dashboard and reclines all seats, giving the driver more space and allowing the vehicle’s occupants to relax and enjoy their commute.

Nissan calls its self-driving technology ProPilot. The first vehicle with a ProPilot system is the new Leaf, though the Leaf’s system is still very basic as it’s only designed to control the distance to the vehicle in front while in a single lane, using a speed preset by the driver (between about 18 mph and 62 mph). A fully self-driving ProPilot system is still years or possibly even decades away.

The last tenet in Nissan Intelligent Mobility, connectivity, is much more diverse than the first two. This is exemplified in the IMx which features several aspects of connectivity. For example, an advanced interface using artificial intelligence allows the owner to easily connect with the car and control many of its features by simply using eye movements and hand gestures.

The IMx can also connect with the surrounding infrastructure. For example, when not in use, the car can park itself in a spot where it can connect to the local power grid and either charge up or act as a “virtual” power plant by returning electricity to the grid. And once the vehicle is needed again, it will be able to pick up its owner and take him or her home.

Nissan hasn’t said whether the IMx is bound for production. However, the automaker has been dropping hints at more models based on the new Leaf, with an SUV the most likely option for the first of these. A sports car has also been teased on more than one occasion.

Nissan also used the Tokyo Motor Show to unveil a Nismo-enhanced Leaf concept and announce a commitment to the Formula E Championship. Nissan will become the first Japanese automaker in the sport when it replaces its alliance partner Renault in the 2018/2019 season of the electric car racing series.

How do you know when the liberal media meltdown is approaching an apex? Just look for apples, bananas and a strong smell of smug.

Reaching deep in their drawer of smug, CNN unleashed a “Facts First” initiative, starting with an ad featuring an apple, with a voice-over warning viewers that some awful, yet unnamed, person or network is trying to convince you the apple is a banana. While a juvenile attempt to discredit President Trump’s complaints about the network’s shoddy news coverage, they manage only to remind us of why they’re in this fix in the first place.

What CNN reveals with this abject sanctimony is their contempt for the viewers themselves. “This is an apple. Some people might try to tell you that it’s a banana. They might scream banana, banana, banana, over and over and over again. They might put BANANA in all caps. You might even start to believe that this is a banana. But it’s not. This is an apple.” And then the words “Facts First” appear on screen.

This is 30 seconds of CNN condescendingly treating news consumers as idiots, unable to judge for themselves. Think about this: Someone at CNN thought it would be a great idea to suggest people who don’t trust CNN are either brainwashed or just plain stupid.

Think about this: Someone at CNN thought it would be a great idea to suggest people who don’t trust CNN are either brainwashed or just plain stupid.

They must be feeling very, um, special right around now as sole possessors of the truth, as a Harris Poll in May found that 65 percent of voters feel that fake news in the mainstream news media is a big problem.

From May 2017, The Hill reported, “Nearly two-thirds of Americans say the mainstream press is full of fake news, a sentiment that is held by a majority of voters across the ideological spectrum. According to data from the latest Harvard-Harris poll … 65 percent of voters believe there is a lot of fake news in the mainstream media. That number includes 80 percent of Republicans, 60 percent of independents and 53 percent of Democrats.”

And why might Americans (including the president) consider CNN fake news?

Consider some recent headlines: Huffington Post: “CNN mistakes sex toy flag for ISIS Flag at London gay pride.” Daily Mail: “CNN anchor mistakes Star-Spangled Banner for French national anthem.”

Federalist: “CNN producer fesses up: We’re just doing the Russia stuff for ratings.” Referring to the Project Veritas undercover video of a CNN producer, they reported, “When asked if he thought the Russia collusion story was legitimate or all hype, [John] Bonifield said it’s ‘mostly [expletive] right now.’

” ‘Like we don’t have any big giant proof,’ he said. ‘I think the president is probably right to say, like, “Look, you are witch-hunting me. You have no smoking gun. You have no real proof.” ‘ “

That looks an awful lot like a banana, no?

The New York Times referred to CNN as having a “unique role as nemesis for Mr. Trump.” Really? Also The New York Times: “3 CNN journalists resign after retracted story on Trump ally.” A story with three reporters and one anonymous source. When the target of the hit piece, Anthony Scaramucci, threatened to sue, only then did the network retract and apologize.

I guess that’s what happens when you’re an official “nemesis” — your prize is a basket full of bananas.

National Review: “CNN calls attacked Jerusalem synagogue a mosque; equates terrorists with victims.”

And let’s not forget CNN hunting down and threatening a person on Reddit who created an anti-CNN WrestleMania gif, featuring President Trump wrestling a man (with a CNN logo head) to the ground. Yes, it was funny because it was a joke. Then CNN went … bananas.

The Hill reported on CNN’s bizarre reaction about the hunt for the person who dared to make fun of the network: “He is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again.” The story, titled “How CNN found the Reddit user behind the Trump wrestling GIF,” quotes from CNN.com: “CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.”

And that’s how #CNNBlackmail began to trend on Twitter. A senior reporter at Vox tweeted, “I can’t emphasize how bad this is on CNN’s part. This is basically ‘don’t post stuff we don’t like or we’ll dox you.’ Extremely unethical.” To say the least.

The Federalist reminds us of another CNN banana: “A banana is when you run conspiracy-mongering pieces that assert Republicans want to make rape and domestic violence pre-existing conditions in their Obamacare repeal bill when there is not a single word or action that backs up the allegation.”

CNN’s history is replete with getting things wrong. And then a producer gets caught on a hidden camera admitting that he knows what they’re promoting is bunk. And then you have three high-value journalists resign because a major story is insupportable and has to be retracted.

This is what happens when you decide to call your crusade against a politician you don’t like “news.” Sorta like calling an apple a banana.","Tammy Bruce: CNN's latest, desperate attempt to hammer Trump is mind-boggling",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/25/tammy-bruce-cnns-latest-desperate-to-hammer-trump-is-mind-boggling.html

""I was just crossing the street. I heard someone yell at me from the car, like it happened, so I just kind of ignored it and kept walking,"" she said.

She said she got suspicious, so she pulled out her cell phone and called her mom so she'd have someone to talk with while she walked. The woman said that's when the driver pulled back around, next to her.

""He was like, 'Can I have your number?' I said no and kept walking. So he kind of pulled up a little bit in front of me and then shot at the ground right next to me,"" the victim recalled.

She said he pulled out a handgun, fired a shot toward her feet, then yelled at her in a nasty tone, warning her that she ""better watch how she talks to people.""

""I was just kind of shocked because obviously you don’t expect that to happen,"" she said.

She said next, the men sped off; her mother was still on the other end of the phone call.

""She just kind of heard me stop talking, and then she heard the gunshot, and she just was like, 'What was that? What was that? What was happening?'""

Her mother was at the church where the victim was headed and came running toward her daughter. No one got hurt, but the woman said the gunshot will ring in her ears and her mind for a long time.

Both sides quickly finished their questioning Wednesday of San Francisco Police Officer Raymond Ortiz, who was part of the CSI unit that responded to Pier 14 the night of July 1, 2015, when Steinle was shot and killed in San Francisco.

During his testimony on Tuesday, Ortiz showed jurors video and several pictures showing the entire length of the pier, including the swivel chair the defendant Jose Ines Garcia Zarate was in, the exact spot where Kate was hit, and the location of several witnesses in relation to them.

SFPD Officer Andrew Bryant, who arrested Zarate after the shooting, took the stand next. Bryant told the jury that he noticed the suspect on the scene and when Zarate saw him, his eyes got very big, ""like deer in headlights,"" and quickly walked the other direction.

Bryant said he pulled out his weapon and yelled ""stop,"" but the suspect kept walking. A plainclothed officer appeared and ordered Zarate to the ground, which he obeyed.

He said Zarate was cuffed and searched before being sat in the back of the police car. About 45 minutes later, the suspect's hands were put in bags to protect any gun residue that was potentially on them.

When the defense team cross-examined Bryant, they suggested that perhaps the residue ultimately found on Zarate's hands was actually transferred to him from an officer.

The jury also heard from SFPD Bomb Squad Officer Scott Hurley, who's part of the ""underwater hazards device team"" and recovered the murder weapon from the ocean floor.

None of the victim's family members were seen in court.

On Tuesday, jurors heard from Michelle Lo, a witness to the slaying.

KATE STEINLE TRIAL FEATURES TESTIMONY OF WITNESS TO KILLING BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

Lo said she was on vacation in San Francisco with her family at the time. She remembered a man dressed in black who ""looked like a homeless person"" and was spinning around in a chair ""grinning and laughing"" who made her uncomfortable.

She said she and her family continued along a pier before hearing a ""very sharp scream"" and seeing a woman on the ground. And she said she saw the same man from earlier walking away.

Zarate, 54, admitted shooting Steinle, but says it was an accident.

Steinle's father testified Monday that before she died, she said to him: ""Help me, Dad.""

The prosecution said those were her last words.

While Garcia's immigration status is what brought the case into the national spotlight, jurors will not hear evidence about that, and it will not be a factor in the trial.

Steinle's slaying became a signature issue for Donald Trump as he was running for president. He invoked the slaying in calling for the construction of a wall on the Mexican border and stepping up deportations and cracking down on illegal immigration.

“The Failing [New York Times] set Liddle’ Bob Corker up by recording his conversation.
“The reason Flake and Corker dropped out of the Senate race is very simple, they had zero chance of being elected,” Trump tweeted.","As President Trump headed to Capitol Hill Tuesday to get lawmakers on board with his tax plan, at least one GOP senator was likely to keep his distance.

Trump and Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., have publicly hurled personal insults at one another for several months. Corker has called the White House an “adult day care center,” and Trump opined that Corker “couldn’t get elected dog catcher.”

Corker still attended Tuesday's lunch with Trump and Senate Republicans to discuss tax reform. But Trump and Corker, who is not running for re-election next year, most likely skipped the hugs and handshakes.

Here is a look at the Trump versus Corker tiff.

Charlottesville fallout

Despite a cozy friendship during the presidential campaign, the relationship between Corker and Trump publicly soured after the president’s response to the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August. Trump initially blamed “both sides” – the white nationalists and the counter-protesters – for violent clashes.

“The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful,” Corker told reporters.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders initially called Corker’s remarks “ridiculous” and an “outrageous claim.” Trump eventually responded on Twitter.

“Strange statement by Bob Corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in ’18,” Trump tweeted on Aug. 25. “Tennessee not happy!”

TRUMP’S FEUDS WITH REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS, FROM RAND PAUL TO LINDSEY GRAHAM

At the time, Corker had not yet announced that he wouldn’t run for reelection.

Corker eventually told NBC News that he stood by what he said at the time. Corker added that he discussed the comments with Trump for “about five minutes” in what Corker described as a “kind of humorous” conversation.

Adult day care center

About a week after Corker said he had a “humorous” conversation with Trump about his public rebuke in August, Trump lambasted the outgoing senator on Twitter.

“Senator Bob Corker ‘begged’ me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said ‘NO’ and he dropped out (said he could not win without my endorsement). He also wanted to be Secretary of State,” Trump said. “I said ‘NO THANKS.’ He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!”

“Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn’t have the guts to run!” Trump continued. “Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that's about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!”

Corker responded with his own tweet.

“It’s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center,” Corker said. “Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.”

Corker’s nickname is born

Corker went after Trump in a wide-ranging interview with the New York Times, in which he said Trump was treating the presidency like a “reality show” and warned that the president could be putting the U.S. “on the path to World War III.”

“He concerns me. He would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation,” Corker said.

Two days later, Trump dubbed the senator “Liddle’ Bob Corker” as he accused the newspaper of recording the interview with Corker without his knowledge.

“The Failing [New York Times] set Liddle’ Bob Corker up by recording his conversation. Was made to sound a fool, and that’s what I am dealing with!” Trump tweeted.

INSIDE THE TRUMP AND MCCONNELL FEUD, FROM HEALTH CARE TO THE BUDGET

The New York Times released audio of the interview in which Corker says he knows his aides are recording the interview and hoped the reporters were as well.

Corker ‘couldn’t get elected dog catcher’

The brouhaha escalated Tuesday morning when Corker blasted the president on several morning shows, and Trump took his criticisms of the senator to Twitter.

Corker said on NBC's ""Today"" show that the Republican-led Congress should set the course on taxes after Trump shot down at least one GOP idea on retirement plans on Monday.

Asked if Trump should leave well enough alone, Corker said, ""I think that's the best way for us to have success.""

TRUMP RIPS CORKER FOR SUGGESTING WHITE HOUSE STEP ASIDE ON TAX REFORM

Corker also told ABC that when it comes to foreign policy, he wished Trump would “leave it to the professionals for a while and see if we can do something that’s constructive for our country, the region and the world.”

“Bob Corker, who helped President [Obama] give us the bad Iran Deal & couldn’t get elected dog catch in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts,” Trump responded on Twitter. “Corker dropped out of the race in Tennessee when I refused to endorse him, and now is only negative on anything Trump. Look at his record!”

“Isn’t it sad that lightweight Senator Bob Corker, who couldn’t get re-elected in the Great State of Tennessee, will now fight Tax Cuts plus!” Trump added.

“Sen. Corker is the incompetent head of the Foreign Relations Committee, & look how poorly the U.S. has done. He doesn’t have a clue as the entire World WAS laughing and taking advantage of us,” Trump continued. “People like liddle’ Bob Corker have set the U.S. way back. Now we move forward!”

Corker, again, responded with a single tweet.

“Same untruths from an utterly untruthful president,” he said, using the hashtag #AlertTheDaycareStaff in an apparent throwback to his earlier tweet.

Corker wouldn’t support Trump again

After Trump’s tweetstorm, Corker told reporters that Trump is “utterly untruthful” as he avoided blatantly calling the president a “liar.”

He also told Fox News that “there’s no question” that Trump is “debasing” the country and said his “political model … is to divide.”

And when asked by CNN if he would support Trump’s presidential campaign again, Corker said, “Let’s just put it this way, I would not do that again.”

Love fest

Trump continued to assail the senator on Twitter Wednesday morning as he contended that both Corker and Sen. Jeff Flake – who announced a day prior that he would also not seek reelection – “had zero chance” of being elected in their prospective states again.

“The reason Flake and Corker dropped out of the Senate race is very simple, they had zero chance of being elected,” Trump tweeted. “Now act so hurt [and] wounded!”

Trump also said his meeting with GOP senators to discuss tax reform “was a love fest with standing ovations and great ideas for USA” – aside from Flake and Corker.

Bowe Bergdahl has become a factor in the soldier's sentencing as a military judge weighs the president's impact on public perception of military justice.

Army Col. Jeffery R. Nance, the judge deciding Bergdahl's punishment for walking off his post, heard defense arguments Monday that Trump recently reaffirmed his scathing criticism and is preventing a fair sentencing hearing.

While campaigning, Trump repeatedly called Bergdahl a ""traitor"" who deserved harsh punishment such as being shot. Nance previously ruled those comments were ""disturbing"" but didn't amount to unlawful command influence and noted the statements were made before Trump became commander in chief.

But last week Trump addressed his past comments when asked about them at a news conference. He replied that he couldn't say anything more about the case, ""but I think people have heard my comments in the past."" That, the defense said, shows he harbors the same views now that he commands the military.

Prosecutors argued Trump's comments didn't reaffirm his campaign-trail criticism and were narrowly focused on answering a reporter.

Nance said he was having a ""hard time"" with prosecutors' interpretation, noting public confidence in military courts was something he had to consider.

Nance said his interpretation was that Trump was essentially saying: ""I shouldn't comment on that, but I think everyone knows what I think on Bowe Bergdahl.""

Bergdahl faces a maximum sentence of life in prison after pleading guilty last week to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Nance allowed the attorneys to question him about whether he was swayed by Trump's comments, and responded that he would be fair.

""I don't have any doubt whatsoever that I can be fair and impartial in the sentencing in this matter,"" Nance said.

Former Army lawyer Eric Carpenter said the judge has to worry not only about whether Trump has directly influenced the case, but also what the public thinks under a military justice concept called apparent unlawful command influence. Nance's remarks Monday should resolve the question of whether Trump directly swayed the court, but the judge could still make concessions to the defense to address these concerns, Carpenter said.

""It gives you a clue that he's concerned about public appearance, and he can grant pretty significant remedies just to preserve the public's faith in the system,"" said Carpenter, who teaches law at Florida International University.

Carpenter doubts the judge would dismiss the case outright, but said Nance could limit Bergdahl's punishment because of Trump.

The White House issued a statement Friday that any military justice case must be ""resolved on its own facts."" White House representatives didn't respond to an email seeking comment Monday.

Bergahl's sentencing, set to begin Monday, has been delayed until Wednesday because one of the defense attorneys wasn't available until then, the judge said.

Bergdahl, 31, pleaded guilty last week. Prosecutors made no deal to cap his punishment, so the judge has wide leeway to decide his sentence. Several more days of testimony are expected.

Nance is expected to weigh factors including Bergdahl's willingness to admit guilt, his five years of captivity by Taliban allies, and serious wounds suffered by soldiers and a Navy SEAL who searched for him.

Bergdahl, from Hailey, Idaho, was captured soon after walking off his remote post in 2009. He has said he was caged, kept in darkness and beaten, and tried to escape more than a dozen times before President Obama brought Bergdahl home in 2014 in a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.

Opinion polls show Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for nearly two decades, will win reelection comfortably if he decides to seek what would be his fourth term in March.

However, a significant minority of voters accuse him of overseeing a corrupt system that has isolated Russia from the rest of the world.

Many of them have taken part in mass protests organized by Putin critic Alexei Navalny.

Russian officials say Navalny is ineligible to run for president due to a criminal conviction which has left an opening for a genuine opponent.

Sobchak is seen by many as an alternative option to those that have had enough of Putin.

The reality TV star, who has been described by Vogue magazine as the Russian version of socialite Paris and is the daughter of Putin’s former mentor, said she had decided to run because she was tired of the same politicians, including Putin, running year after year.

The 35-year-old said she had the right to run for Russia’s top political job under the country’s constitution, which stipulates that all candidates must be 35 or older.

“I decided to exercise that right because I am against all of those (candidates) who usually exercise that right,” she said.

“When I was 18 and was studying in university, Vladimir Putin became president of Russia. Children who were born that year will go and vote themselves this year. Just think about that.”

But some Russian liberals fear Sobchak’s participation will play into the Kremlin’s hands by splitting the opposition vote.

Sobchak is the daughter of Anatoly Sobchak, the reformist former mayor of St. Petersburg who hired Putin as an official in City Hall in the 1990s.

Sobchak’s Instagram account, often featuring photographs of her dressed in designer outfits and appearing at glitzy society events, has 5.2 million followers.

After graduating from the prestigious MGIMO University in Moscow, she became a nationwide celebrity when she hosted a Russian reality TV show called Dom 2.

She became active in opposition politics around the time that Putin, in 2012, was reelected to the presidency after stepping down for four years to comply with constitutional term limits.

Russia, Russia, Russia. For months it was all we heard about. The left couldn't get enough of it. They really wanted you to believe that Hillary lost and Trump won because of Russian meddling.

My how times change! Now it's Russia and the Clinton connection. Of course the media refuses to cover and investigate, but there is yet another Clinton scandal here.

Rep. Devon Nunes, R-Calif., Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, is investigating the following:

A Russian backed company wanted to take control of a big chunk of America’s uranium business. They gave millions, $145 million to a Clinton Foundation charity. Bill Clinton got a half million for a speech in Moscow and he met with Vladimir Putin, bingo. Shortly thereafter Hillary’s State Department gives the okay for the Russians to buy our uranium. Is this pay to play? “Baloney,"" says Hillary.

Wait...there's more on the Russia/Clinton connection. The Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee paid for the Russian ""dossier.” They bought, they funded, and they instigated, a so-called ""report"" on Donald Trump. Of course it was full of salacious and totally unproven dirt. Back then, the Clinton people denied any knowledge, and took great offense at the mere suggestion they knew anything about it.

Times change.

Two points: first, Democrats may regret their Russia, Russia, Russia campaign. Former president Jimmy Carter says the Russians had little, if any, impact on the election. And now the Russia investigation has veered off-course to bring in the Clintons.

And second, the Democrats will surely regret the continuing presence of Hillary Clinton. She lost. She's mired in scandal, again. And she won't go away.

A few months ago, it was Trump and the Republicans getting unwanted attention. Now it’s Hillary, Bill and the Democrats.

Again, things change fast.

Five people remain hospitalized and seven others were released after being treated for the disease, the New York City Health Department announced on Tuesday. The cases were reported in the last two weeks in Flushing, Queens, and the patients’ ages ranged between early 30s to late 80s. Health officials are investigating two more cases to determine if it was part of the current cluster. There have been no deaths reported.

Health officials have taken water samples from several cooling tower systems in the area where the cases were reported to test for Legionella, the bacteria that causes the potentially fatal disease.

“As with our previous Legionnaires’ disease investigations, we are in the process of investigating the source of the cluster and are working with building owners in the area to rapidly test and clean cooling towers,” Dr. Mary T. Bassett, city health commissioner, said in a statement.

“The whole Russia thing … this was the Democrats coming up with an excuse for losing the election,” Trump told reporters.
The law firm that retained Fusion GPS reportedly was paid millions in legal fees by the Clinton campaign and the DNC.
Sources, however, told The Post that neither the Clinton campaign nor the DNC specifically directed Steele’s work, labeling the intelligence officer simply as a Fusion GPS subcontractor.
“Tom Perez and the new leadership of the DNC were not involved in any decision-making regarding Fusion GPS, nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization,"" DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement.","President Trump, in a wide-ranging sparring session with reporters Wednesday afternoon, blasted Hillary Clinton over new revelations her campaign helped fund a salacious anti-Trump dossier last year – calling the project a “disgrace” and claiming the tables have turned on Democrats over the “Russia hoax.”

“They’re embarrassed by it, but I think it’s a disgrace,” Trump told reporters, before heading to Texas for a briefing on Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts and a Republican fundraiser. “It’s a very sad commentary on politics in this country.”

In the midst of a court case that threatened to reveal the dossier’s funding, it emerged Tuesday night that political consulting firm Fusion GPS was retained last year by Marc E. Elias, an attorney representing the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. The firm then hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to write the dossier that contained unverified and lurid allegations about Trump and his team’s ties to Moscow.

The Washington Post first reported on the connections, which were confirmed by Fox News.

Trump, though, repeatedly said Wednesday that this information only came out because the court case would have revealed it. Amid a series of Russia-related controversies that have Democrats – at least for now – on defense, Trump suggested the allegations of Russia collusion with his campaign have boomeranged and are hurting Democrats.

“The whole Russia thing … this was the Democrats coming up with an excuse for losing the election,” Trump told reporters. “They lost it and they lost it very badly. And they didn’t know what to say, so they made up the whole Russia hoax.”

Trump added: “Now it’s turning out that the hoax is turned around, and you look at what’s happened with Russia and the uranium deal and the fake dossier, and it’s all turned around.”

'The whole Russia thing...this was the Democrats coming up with an excuse for losing the election' - President Donald Trump

Trump was referring not only to the dossier but the Obama administration’s 2010 approval of a Canadian mining company’s sale to a Russian firm that gave them partial control of U.S. uranium reserves.

The law firm that retained Fusion GPS reportedly was paid millions in legal fees by the Clinton campaign and the DNC.

Sources, however, told The Post that neither the Clinton campaign nor the DNC specifically directed Steele’s work, labeling the intelligence officer simply as a Fusion GPS subcontractor.

The Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, stressed that the current leadership was not involved in the arrangement.

“Tom Perez and the new leadership of the DNC were not involved in any decision-making regarding Fusion GPS, nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization,"" DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement. ""But let’s be clear, there is a serious federal investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, and the American public deserves to know what happened.”

A spokesman for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who led the DNC at the time, told Fox News on Wednesday that, “She did not have any knowledge of this arrangement.”

What exactly Hillary Clinton knew is unclear. But Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement that, “I personally wasn’t aware of this during the campaign.” However, he said, “if I had gotten handed it last fall, I would have had no problem passing it along and urging reporters to look into it.”

The Washington Post report noted that while Elias and his law firm retained Fusion GPS in April 2016, the firm’s research before that was funded by an “unknown Republican client” during the GOP primary.

Asked Wednesday if he knows who that was, Trump teased the media.

“I think I would know but I won’t say,” he said. “I have one name in mind. … It will probably be revealed.”

During his Q&A with reporters on the White House lawn, the president pivoted to a range of other subjects, including Republican unity as compared with Democratic unity.

“I’ll tell you what—honestly, the Republicans are very, very well united,” Trump said, while claiming there’s “hatred, division and animosity” between Democrats like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.

The president covered immigration, tax reform and opioid abuse.

Trump told reporters he would “love to do a DACA deal,” but he needed something “very substantial” to complete legislation helping so-called dreamers -- listing “the wall” and the ability to “stop drugs from pouring in” to the U.S. Trump again vowed that at some point, the administration would declare a “national emergency” for the opioid epidemic.

Trump jumped to tax reform, promising an “incredible” plan.

“We’re going to bring back $4 trillion, I think at least, from overseas, and that money is going to be put back into our country,” Trump said.

He also defended his phone conversations with Gold Star families, amid controversy over one phone call with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, who was killed in Niger.

“It’s a rough time for these people. It’s a tough time. It couldn’t be tougher. But I have such respect for those families,” Trump said.

Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., as well as the widow, Myeshia Johnson, had criticized Trump’s tone during that call.","Trump rips Clinton link to Fusion GPS dossier as a 'disgrace,' says Russia 'hoax is turned around'",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/25/trump-rips-clinton-link-to-fusion-gps-dossier-as-disgrace-says-russia-hoax-is-turned-around.html

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts.
And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts.
Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts?
Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts.","Sitting at my usual corner table in the back of Buzzy’s 8-Ball Tavern and Pool Room, It occurred to me on Thursday night that there are any number of serious issues and current crisis that we could talk about for this week’s dispatch from the front lines.

But setting all those issues aside, let me tell you something that may have escaped your attention while you’ve been busy digging a backyard bomb shelter or getting up to speed on which starlets haven’t been groped by Weinstein. Apparently, and I did not see this coming, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) leadership has decided to open the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts to, wait for it… girls.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts. Boys whittled wood into sharp, pointy things and set fire to stuff, while girls generated an incredible amount of revenue selling delicious cookies. I’m particularly fond of Samoas.

My oldest boy Scooter is in the Cub Scouts, and I can vouch for the fact that he and his Den cohorts love to whittle. They can take a 400 pound oak log and turn it into a sharp, pointy twig in less time than it takes to whistle the theme to ""The Andy Griffith Show."" To be honest, they’re a pack of smelly, loud boys with a remarkable ability to recite the entire Scout oath while actually burping. I can see why girls would be clamoring to join.

In reality, most are not. And the Girl Scouts of America, which after taking into account global cookie sales, I believe is the country’s 7th largest corporation, have criticized what they see as a blatant effort to increase membership dues by the BSA. Membership numbers are down in general for youth groups across America so this may be less about gender and more about dough. Which reminds me, I also like the Thin Mints.

Back in August of this year, the president of the Girl Scouts sent a letter to the BSA president stating “…I formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 per cent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts… and not consider expanding to recruit girls.” That, my friends, is how you win a merit badge for subtle insult.

At this point, It would be fairly easy to morph this into a high brow column about gender fluidity and the need to be considerate over what pronouns someone uses when referring to their particular identification. Or perhaps turn to the subject of gender equality and how girls and boys are really no different and so no association or organization should exclude one or the other.

But I’m a guy, raising a houseful of little guys, and so my thinking isn’t particularly complicated. I’m guessing the BSA’s decision is partly driven by a need for additional revenue, as suggested by the Girl Scouts leadership, and likely in part out of concern that they might be sued by some overly sensitive soul who wants to prove a point that most folks really don’t care about.

I admit to being a bit old fashioned. Believing that there’s a place for a Boy Scouts organization and a Girl Scouts organization that focus on their respective genders doesn’t make me a misogynist or a sexist or anything else ending in “ist” or even an “ism.” I happen to believe that there’s value and benefit in girls having their own space and boys having their own space on occasion…as long as they offer equal space and opportunity.

I know that Scooter and his pals at their current stage of life would prefer to keep the “no girls allowed” sign on their clubhouse door. And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts. Give them a couple years and they’ll see things differently…they may even realize girls don’t find it attractive when you make farting noises. Although to be fair, I didn’t have that epiphany until my mid 20s.

Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts? I would have done that research but it seems like a lot of work and I’ve been busy whittling.

Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts. For their part, the BSA leadership claims the change was designed to provide more options for parents. According to BSA’s Chief Scout Executive, “We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.”

So there you have it. Sally can now be a Cub Scout. And soon, Sally can join the Boy Scouts and eventually earn the coveted Eagle Scout award. I haven’t raised this development with Scooter yet. He may or may not care, it’s hard to tell what a 10-year-old boy’s response will be. But I’ll bet you a box of cookies there’ll be a fart noise involved.",There’s a place for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

Shortly after Inauguration Day, Eli’sha Davies, 9, learned that the president was taking a big salary cut in his new job. So he decided to send him $3 to help him pay his bills, WGRZ reported.

The story gained attention after Trump wrote him back this week, reportedly sending a letter, a picture, and the $3, urging Davies to put it towards bettering his community.

But Davies’ mother told reporters that the money was actually meant to go towards a new mandolin the boy had been saving for, WGRZ reported. But he was having trouble because he kept finding people he thought needed the money more than he did, like the president.

The Young Musicians Education Foundation Inc. is a local charity that helps kids get access to instruments who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford them, WGRZ reported.

When John Wildeman, the president of the Foundation, heard about Davies' story, he decided that he wanted to help out, so he gifted him the mandolin he wanted.

""$3 is a lot of money to a little kid, most kids,"" Wildeman said. ""For him to sacrifice that and send that money to someone who he thought really needed it, that meant an awful lot to me.""

""I'm like a kid at Christmas when I know we're giving a child an instrument like this,"" Wildeman said. ""It's just a thrill for me to be able to do it.""

In addition to hiking admission fees at the highly-frequented Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone and Zion National Parks, the plan would raise the price of entry at Utah’s Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands and Zion parks; California’s Sequoia & Kings Canyon and Joshua Tree parks; Montana’s Glacier; Wyoming’s Grand Teton; Washington’s Mount Rainier and Olympic; as well as Shenandoah in Virginia; Acadia in Maine; Rocky Mountain in Colorado; and Denali in Alaska.

Under the proposed plan, the NPS would charge $70 per vehicle, $50 per motorcycle, and $30 per person during each park’s peak visitation season, which most commonly runs from May to September.

“It is not every day in congressional investigations that we find a smoking gun,” Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said Tuesday. “Here, we have it.”

While Eric Holder was U.S. attorney general, the Justice Department allowed prosecutors to strike agreements compelling big companies to give money to outside groups not connected to their cases to meet settlement burdens. Republican lawmakers long have decried those payments as a “slush fund” that boosted liberal groups, and the Trump DOJ ended the practice earlier this year.

But internal Justice Department emails released Tuesday by Goodlatte indicated that not only were officials involved in determining what organizations would get the money, but also Justice Department officials may have intervened to make sure the settlements didn’t go to conservative groups.

In one such email in July 2014, a senior Justice Department official expressed “concerns” about what groups would receive settlement money from Citigroup — saying they didn’t want money going to a group that does “conservative property-rights legal services.”

DOJ ENDS HOLDER-ERA ‘SLUSH FUND’ PAYOUTS TO OUTSIDE GROUPS

“Concerns include: a) not allowing Citi to pick a statewide intermediary like the Pacific Legal Foundation (does conservative property-rights legal services),” the official, whose name is redacted in the email, wrote under the title of “Acting Senior Counselor for Access to Justice.”

The official added that “we are more likely to get the right result from a state bar association affiliated entity.”

The Pacific Legal Foundation responded to the email release Tuesday by telling Fox News it believes “permanent reforms to prevent such abuse are needed.”

“We are flattered that the previous administration would be concerned enough about our success vindicating individual liberty and property rights to prevent settlement funds from making their way to Pacific Legal Foundation,” PLF CEO Steven D. Anderson said in a statement.

Goodlatte, who is sponsoring the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017, disclosed the emails during a speech on the House floor, taking aim at then-Associate Attorney General Tony West.

“Aiding their political allies was only the half of it,” Goodlatte said. “The evidence of the Obama DOJ’s abuse of power shows that Tony West’s team went out of its way to exclude conservative groups.”

The documents indicate West played an active role in helping certain organizations obtain settlement information.

“Can you explain to Tony the best way to allocate some money to an organization of our choosing?” Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Elizabeth Taylor wrote in one November 2013 email.

Groups who received funding also expressed appreciation for West’s efforts, according to the emails.

“Now that it has been more than 24 hours for us all to try and digest the Bank of America settlement, I would like to discuss ways we might want to recognize and show appreciation for the Department of Justice and specifically Associate Attorney General Tony West,” wrote Charles R. Dunlap, executive director of the Indiana Bar, in an August 2014 email.

Dunlap wrote that West “by all accounts was the one person most responsible” for the Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts group receiving money.

One person, Bob LeClair, responded to Dunlap’s email by saying, “Frankly, I would be willing to have us build a statue [of West] and then we could bow down to this statue each day after we get our $200,000.”

West, who now works as an executive vice president at PepsiCo, did not immediately return an email from Fox News seeking comment.

In 2015, however, Geoffrey Graber, who oversaw the Justice Department’s big banks settlements, told Goodlatte during a congressional hearing that the department “did not want to be in the business of picking and choosing which organizations may or may not receive any funding under the agreement.”

“But internal DOJ documents tell a different story,” Goodlatte said Tuesday. “They show that contrary to Graber’s sworn testimony, the donation provisions were structured to aid the Obama administration’s political friends and exclude conservative groups.”

Even before the release of Tuesday’s emails, Republicans had blasted these settlements as a “slush fund” for favored groups.

Gibson Guitars was forced to pay $50,000 to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in 2012, though that organization has nothing to do with the case. In 2014, Bank of America gave money to the National Urban League, the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America and the National Council of La Raza as part of a major mortgage fraud settlement stemming from the 2008 financial crisis.

'Aiding their political allies was only the half of it.' - House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.

Asked about the emails, the Justice Department on Tuesday referred Fox News to Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ statement in June after he announced the end to the practice.

“When the federal government settles a case against a corporate wrongdoer, any settlement funds should go first to the victims and then to the American people — not to bankroll third-party special interest groups or the political friends of whoever is in power,” Sessions said.

Goodlatte on Tuesday praised Sessions’ move to end mandatory donations, but called his legislation a “good governance measure,” and called it necessary to prevent a future Justice Department from reversing the action. The bill prohibits the Justice Department from requiring defendants to donate money to outside groups as part of a settlement with the federal government.

Beauty competitions long have been controversial in Egypt, with opposition coming from a wide range of sources, including religious organizations and government officials. Recently, the home of the founder of a beauty contest was set on fire shortly before the event was scheduled to take place.

Now, the subject has moved front and center again, with a member of the parliamentary Human Rights Committee pushing a ban on the Miss Egypt Pageant, which the official condemned as a national security threat.

Solaf Darwish, the parliament member, and several other government officials want more control over pageants if they are to continue, according to published reports.

“Miss Egypt Pageant 2017 has stirred public discontent,” said Darwish to Al-Monitor. “There were videos of the contestants in their bedrooms and in fitting rooms, which does not blend with the values ​​and traditions of Egyptian society.”

Religious organizations also are weighing in, hoping to up the ante against beauty contests.

Al-Azhar’s Senior Scholars Committee, a group whose website says its mission includes carrying “the burden and the responsibility of ‎protecting and preserving the purity, moderation, and modesty of Islam over the ‎centuries,” has expressed total opposition to the basic concept of beauty competitions, saying they violate Sharia laws.

Al-Azhar officials say that the very requirement that beauty contest judges must visually inspect a woman’s body and appearance are in contradiction of Sharia laws.

Darwish has argued that, unlike some critics of the contests, she is not seeking an all-out ban on them, but wants them to be answerable to the government to ensure that they comply with cultural and moral values.

“I only want to temporarily suspend them until the government and the Egyptian parliament agree on mechanisms to regulate them in line with the norms prevailing in Egyptian society and assign a specific ministry to supervise them,” Darwish is quoted as telling Al-Monitor.

Efforts to get a comment from the Egyptian Embassy in Washington D.C. were unsuccessful.

Beauty pageant organizers and winners defend the events, saying they are not just about physical appeal.

Fatima Baker, the beauty pageant organizer whose home was set ablaze, told the Al Arabiya Network that her event was the victim of “a misunderstanding of the contest and its purpose.”

“The contest, which is the first of its kind in Egypt, isn’t just about physical beauty, but also about education, fitness, style, aspirations, knowledge of the Quran and social activism,” she said.

Baker noted that the contest had generated a lot of enthusiasm from Egyptians.

“Suffice it to say that within days we received 250 applications and had to close the registration,” she said. “The winner won’t be selected based on her beauty. The contest is not at all about that. I’m a resident of the Delta region and I’m against showcasing local girls in this way.”",Egyptian government has new crackdown target: beauty contests,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/25/egyptian-government-has-new-crackdown-target-beauty-contests.html

Let’s give plausible accounts of the known facts, then explain why demands that Robert Mueller recuse himself from the Russia investigation may not be the fanciful partisan grandstanding you imagine.

Here’s a story consistent with what has been reported in the press—how reliably reported is uncertain. Democratic political opponents of Donald Trump financed a British former spook who spread money among contacts in Russia, who in turn over drinks solicited stories from their supposedly “connected” sources in Moscow. If these people were really connected in any meaningful sense, then they made sure the stories they spun were consistent with the interests of the regime, if not actually scripted by the regime.

The resulting Trump dossier then became a factor in Obama administration decisions to launch an FBI counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign, and after the election to trumpet suspicions of Trump collusion with Russia.

We know of a second, possibly even more consequential way the FBI was effectively a vehicle for Russian meddling in U.S. politics. Authoritative news reports say FBI chief James Comey’s intervention in the Hillary Clinton email matter was prompted by a Russian intelligence document that his colleagues suspected was a Russian plant.

OK, Mr. Mueller was a former close colleague and leader but no longer part of the FBI when these events occurred. This may or may not make him a questionable person to lead a Russia-meddling investigation in which the FBI’s own actions are necessarily a concern.

A restaurant called Under, which is slated to open near the Norwegian village of Båly, will become Europe’s first underwater restaurant upon opening in the North Atlantic Ocean in 2018. Situated on the country’s southern coast, the structure that houses the restaurant will straddle both the land and the sea — the entrance being at the water’s edge, and the dining area installed on the ocean floor.

OAKLAND A'S PLAYER SAYS PRO-TRUMP WAITER REFUSED TO SERVE HIM

“More than an aquarium, the structure will become a part of its marine environment, coming to rest directly on the sea bed five meters below the water's surface,” writes Snøhetta, the architecture firm designing the restaurant.

The restaurant itself will be comprised of three levels, according to Snøhetta. The first is more or less a lobby, or “wardrobe area.” A “Champagne bar” is located one level down, decorated with “subdued” colors evocative of “shells, rocks and sand.” Dining tables are located on the lowest level, which also boasts muted lighting, a blue-and-green color scheme and a panoramic window overlooking the aquatic life on the seabed.

The restaurant floor can accommodate between 80 and 100 diners.

14 CLASSIC AMERICAN DRIVE-INS THAT ARE STILL IN OPERATION

In order to withstand the waves of the North Atlantic Sea, Under’s concrete walls will be 1 meter thick, according to Snøhetta. The exterior of the structure, which somewhat resembles a large shipping container, will also feature a “coarse surface that invites mussels to cling on,” and ultimately serve as an artificial reef, they write.

In addition, the designers of Under are hoping to impart a learning experience on diners, with informational plaques positioned along a pathway to the restaurant’s entrance. Snøhetta further claims the structure will also function as a ""research center for marine life,” though they do not elaborate.

Despite being Europe’s first underwater restaurant, Under is by no means the first underwater eatery in the world. Similar underwater dining experiences are currently available for patrons in the Maldives, Dubai and Israel.

Both sides quickly finished their questioning Wednesday of San Francisco Police Officer Raymond Ortiz, who was part of the CSI unit that responded to Pier 14 the night of July 1, 2015, when Steinle was shot and killed in San Francisco.

During his testimony on Tuesday, Ortiz showed jurors video and several pictures showing the entire length of the pier, including the swivel chair the defendant Jose Ines Garcia Zarate was in, the exact spot where Kate was hit, and the location of several witnesses in relation to them.

SFPD Officer Andrew Bryant, who arrested Zarate after the shooting, took the stand next. Bryant told the jury that he noticed the suspect on the scene and when Zarate saw him, his eyes got very big, ""like deer in headlights,"" and quickly walked the other direction.

Bryant said he pulled out his weapon and yelled ""stop,"" but the suspect kept walking. A plainclothed officer appeared and ordered Zarate to the ground, which he obeyed.

He said Zarate was cuffed and searched before being sat in the back of the police car. About 45 minutes later, the suspect's hands were put in bags to protect any gun residue that was potentially on them.

When the defense team cross-examined Bryant, they suggested that perhaps the residue ultimately found on Zarate's hands was actually transferred to him from an officer.

The jury also heard from SFPD Bomb Squad Officer Scott Hurley, who's part of the ""underwater hazards device team"" and recovered the murder weapon from the ocean floor.

None of the victim's family members were seen in court.

On Tuesday, jurors heard from Michelle Lo, a witness to the slaying.

KATE STEINLE TRIAL FEATURES TESTIMONY OF WITNESS TO KILLING BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

Lo said she was on vacation in San Francisco with her family at the time. She remembered a man dressed in black who ""looked like a homeless person"" and was spinning around in a chair ""grinning and laughing"" who made her uncomfortable.

She said she and her family continued along a pier before hearing a ""very sharp scream"" and seeing a woman on the ground. And she said she saw the same man from earlier walking away.

Zarate, 54, admitted shooting Steinle, but says it was an accident.

Steinle's father testified Monday that before she died, she said to him: ""Help me, Dad.""

The prosecution said those were her last words.

While Garcia's immigration status is what brought the case into the national spotlight, jurors will not hear evidence about that, and it will not be a factor in the trial.

Steinle's slaying became a signature issue for Donald Trump as he was running for president. He invoked the slaying in calling for the construction of a wall on the Mexican border and stepping up deportations and cracking down on illegal immigration.

If these people were really connected in any meaningful sense, then they made sure the stories they spun were consistent with the interests of the regime, if not actually scripted by the regime.

The resulting Trump dossier then became a factor in Obama administration decisions to launch an FBI counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign, and after the election to trumpet suspicions of Trump collusion with Russia.

We know of a second, possibly even more consequential way the FBI was effectively a vehicle for Russian meddling in U.S. politics. Authoritative news reports say FBI chief James Comey’s intervention in the Hillary Clinton email matter was prompted by a Russian intelligence document that his colleagues suspected was a Russian plant.

Russia, Russia, Russia. For months it was all we heard about. The left couldn't get enough of it. They really wanted you to believe that Hillary lost and Trump won because of Russian meddling.

My how times change! Now it's Russia and the Clinton connection. Of course the media refuses to cover and investigate, but there is yet another Clinton scandal here.

Rep. Devon Nunes, R-Calif., Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, is investigating the following:

A Russian backed company wanted to take control of a big chunk of America’s uranium business. They gave millions, $145 million to a Clinton Foundation charity. Bill Clinton got a half million for a speech in Moscow and he met with Vladimir Putin, bingo. Shortly thereafter Hillary’s State Department gives the okay for the Russians to buy our uranium. Is this pay to play? “Baloney,"" says Hillary.

Wait...there's more on the Russia/Clinton connection. The Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee paid for the Russian ""dossier.” They bought, they funded, and they instigated, a so-called ""report"" on Donald Trump. Of course it was full of salacious and totally unproven dirt. Back then, the Clinton people denied any knowledge, and took great offense at the mere suggestion they knew anything about it.

Times change.

Two points: first, Democrats may regret their Russia, Russia, Russia campaign. Former president Jimmy Carter says the Russians had little, if any, impact on the election. And now the Russia investigation has veered off-course to bring in the Clintons.

And second, the Democrats will surely regret the continuing presence of Hillary Clinton. She lost. She's mired in scandal, again. And she won't go away.

A few months ago, it was Trump and the Republicans getting unwanted attention. Now it’s Hillary, Bill and the Democrats.

Again, things change fast.

The National Trust for Historic Preservation has named Clayborn Temple to its National Treasures portfolio.

The designation means the privately-funded trust will help groups raise money for the rehabilitation of the old church and develop re-use plans for the building.

Other National Treasure locations include the Houston Astrodome and Nashville's Music Row.

""These are places of national significance, where usually, they're threatened,"" said David Brown, the trust's chief preservation officer. ""In some cases, it's because they haven't been used for a number of years. ... Sometimes they're threatened simply because of development that's happening in the area.""

The trust also accepted the temple into the National Fund for Sacred Places, making it eligible for a grant of up to $250,000.

Clayborn Temple is undergoing renovation. It was the home base for the sanitation workers strike that brought civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King. Jr. to the city nearly 50 years ago.

It was the starting point for the March 28, 1968, march led by King, a rally that turned violent when police and protesters clashed on Beale Street.

After King was assassinated in Memphis a week later, and after the strike ended with the workers securing a pay raise, the church's influence waned. It fell into disrepair and became an empty landmark overshadowed by the modern FedEx Forum sports arena across the street.

The temple's cornerstone was laid in 1891, and it was dedicated in 1893 by the Second Presbyterian Church.

Built in the Romanesque Revival style, it boasted a limestone exterior, hardwood floors, curved pews, a majestic organ, and a 110-foot tower topped with a 120-foot spire. The spire and pews are long gone, but the tower, organ and parts of the original floor remain.

Last year, a group called Clayborn Reborn announced it was renovating the church, which had been closed for years. The effort was boosted when the National Park Service announced a $400,000 grant for renovations.

The goal is to fix up the church for meetings, religious ceremonies, community events and other gatherings.

Rob Thompson, director of the Clayborn Reborn project, has estimated that $10 million must be raised to pay for renovations.",Temple known for role in civil rights gets boost from group,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/25/temple-known-for-role-in-civil-rights-gets-boost-from-group.html

""The one constant was always, 'I want to see my girls grow up, and I want to walk them down the aisle,'"" said Cheryl Shelton.

With seven daughters, the family realized it was unlikely the U.S. Army veteran would be able to accomplish that, so they came up with a plan to make his dream a reality.

With last minute help from hospice; David's Bridal; Taylor Elchert Photography in Tiffin, Ohio; a local hair studio, and others, the plan came together in just days.

""We had this idea we put together in three days. We got all the wedding gowns for the girls and hospice helped us out a great deal with some of the planning,"" said Cheryl.

""What girl doesn't want to get in a wedding dress and her hair and makeup done? So I was all in but more so for the reasoning behind it,"" said Candice Talbot.

The plan was kept a secret from Willie who was asked only to give away Emily Flinn, the only one of his daughters who was already married, so she could renew her vows.

""We got maried at a courthouse so there wasn't the formality to it where he could actually give me away,"" said Flinn.

""He had no clue that this was going on and everybody got dressed, so I said, 'she is going to have all the girls be the bridesmaids and everything for her;' little did he know that they were all going to be brides,"" said Cheryl.

""Actually, it was my sister, Candice, that texted me and said, 'hey, you need to pick out a wedding dress and give me your measurements because we are going to pick one out for you; you are going to walk down the aisle on Saturday,"" said Jennifer Talbot.

Three days later, with Willie in his dress uniform in a backyard ceremony, each of his daughters came out of the house, one at a time, all in wedding gowns.

""He looked a little confused , and then it was just great to see everybody,"" said Flinn.

""This was very touching for him and it was a dream that we could fulfill to the best or the closest we could possibly do,"" said Cheryl.

In a father-daughter ceremony performed by Millersburg Christian Church Pastor Wes McElravy, the girls got to see the gleam in their father's eye they would expect to see at their actual wedding.

And Willie was helped out of his wheelchair to stand with his daughters and experience his greatest wish.

""I always assumed that my dad would be there to walk me down the aisle and when the possibility was there that he wasn't going to be able to -- this was everything,"" said Lindsey Shelton.

Less than two weeks after the ceremony, on Monday, October 16, Willie Shelton passed away.

The girls will each now also have something of their own to keep for their actual weddings.

All seven will have a locket in which they will have a photo of their father with them in a wedding dress, and the words, ""a father's love never ends,"" engraved on the back.

""Even though part of the dream was fulfilled last week, when they get married, the rest of it will be because he will still be with them,"" said Cheryl.

Through their loss, the family says it is only fitting that they honor the life and the memory of Willie.

""He was the happiest person, the most giving person, and this was our chance to give him something,"" said Jennifer.​

""His problems with Arizona voters pre-date Trump the candidate.”But the sparring with Trump might not have helped either.
“Neither of them really depend on Trump voters,” David Payne, president of the Codavate public affairs firm, said Wednesday.
After conservative Judge Roy Moore won Alabama’s special GOP Senate primary last month, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned about the perils of divisive GOP Senate candidates losing in the general election -- as happened in 2010 and 2012 with nominees like Christine O’Donnell, in Delaware, and Richard Mourdock in Indiana.
“My goal as the leader of the Republican Party in the Senate is to keep us in the majority.","The two Republican senators who have cited frustration with Donald Trump’s presidency as reason for their retirement also were grappling with weak poll numbers, spurring questions about whether more Trump critics might face pressure to call it quits.

Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake announced Tuesday that he wouldn’t seek a second term -- in a lofty Senate floor speech in which the senator said he’d no longer be “complicit or silent” about Trump’s perceived offenses.

Flake followed with a Washington Post op-ed Wednesday in which he said: “Nine months of this administration is enough for us to stop pretending that this is somehow normal.”

But his polls numbers for a 2018 reelection already were under water. Just 37 percent of Arizona Republican voters approved of Flake’s job performance and 50 percent disapproved, according to a recent Morning Consult poll.

“He was going to lose, and he was going to lose big,” Constantin Querard, a GOP consultant in Arizona, told Fox News on Wednesday.

Flake's fallout with Trump started even before the president took office, when he withheld his endorsement because Trump insulted Vietnam veteran and Arizona senior GOP Sen. John McCain. Then came his anti-Trump book this summer, “Conscience of a Conservative.”

“He wrote a book about me before I ever heard of him,” Trump told reporters Wednesday. “The first time I saw him on TV … I assumed he was a Democrat. … His poll numbers are terrible. He's done terribly for the great people of Arizona, a state that likes Trump.”

Flake’s relationship with Arizona voters began to deteriorate soon after he went from the House to the Senate and became a member of the chamber’s bipartisan, so-called Gang of Eight that pushed for comprehensive immigration reform.

“In a border state like Arizona, if your single issue is amnesty, you should expect to have problems with your base,"" Querard also said. ""His problems with Arizona voters pre-date Trump the candidate.”

But the sparring with Trump might not have helped either.

“Everything is in place to get me [to Washington] and drain the swamp,” Kelli Ward, a Republican candidate for Flake’s seat who is backed by Trump ally Steve Bannon, told Fox News' ""Outnumbered"" on Wednesday.

Corker’s relationship with Trump, compared with Flake's, seemed to unravel more recently in August, when the two-term senator questioned the president’s “competence” and leadership after the deadly protests in Charlottesville, Va., where a woman was fatally struck by a car allegedly driven by a white supremacist.

Corker announced in September he would not seek reelection. Polls for the Tennessee Star in June showed just 41 percent of likely GOP primary voters said Corker “deserved reelection.”

In their still-escalating war of words, fought largely on Twitter, Corker suggested Trump got ahold of a cellphone and started tweeting insults at him because “TheDayCareStaff#” was off duty. Trump called Corker “liddle Bob” and taunted that he “couldn’t get elected dog catcher.”

So who could be next?

Senate Republicans’ failure this summer to repeal and replace ObamaCare has put such GOP incumbent senators as Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, and Dean Heller, of Nevada, on Trump’s radar.

Endangered Heller got a taste of what running for reelection in 2018 would be like when he said in June that he couldn’t support Senate Republicans' ObamaCare replacement bill.

A Trump-aligned super PAC, America First Policies, promptly announced an anti-Heller ad campaign. And while Heller was sitting next to Trump at a White House event, the president said about him: “He wants to remain a senator, doesn't he?”

Trump has been easier on Murkowski and fellow GOP Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, in trying to get their votes for ending ObamaCare and giving him his first big legislative win.

“Alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under ObamaCare, worst in the country. Deductibles high, people angry! Lisa M comes through,” Trump tweeted in September about Murkowski.

Collins is far more comfortable in Maine than Flake is in Arizona. Maine voters picked Democrat Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016. And Collins, two years earlier, won a fourth term with more than 68 percent of the vote.

“Neither of them really depend on Trump voters,” David Payne, president of the Codavate public affairs firm, said Wednesday. “Collins is completely insulated.”

For now, Collins is staying put, having announced earlier this month that she will not run for governor.

The pressures on moderate senators, however, could create future problems for the Trump agenda.

Despite the Flake-Trump feud, Flake voted for the Trump agenda roughly 90 percent of the time. Republicans will be under heavy pressure to prevent the seat from flipping next fall.

After conservative Judge Roy Moore won Alabama’s special GOP Senate primary last month, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned about the perils of divisive GOP Senate candidates losing in the general election -- as happened in 2010 and 2012 with nominees like Christine O’Donnell, in Delaware, and Richard Mourdock in Indiana.

“They were not able to appeal to a broader electorate in the general election,” the Kentucky Republican said. “My goal as the leader of the Republican Party in the Senate is to keep us in the majority. The way you do that is not complicated. You have to ... nominate people who can actually win.”",Trump’s Senate critics see support collapse – who’s next?,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/25/trump-s-senate-critics-see-support-collapse-who-s-next.html

Researchers named the star Kronos, after the Titan of Greek mythology who ate his own children out of fears they'd dethrone him, according to a statement from Princeton University. Kronos belongs to a binary star system, or double-star system, located 350 light-years from Earth.

Astronomers discovered the star's ravenous habits while comparing its chemical composition to that of its stellar twin, named Krios — the Greek Titan god of the constellations and Kronos' older brother. The results showed that Kronos had an unusually high level of rock-forming minerals, suggesting it feasted on roughly 15 Earth masses' worth of rocky planets in its lifetime, according to the study. [Gallery: Dying Stars Consume Rocky Alien Planets]

Both stars — designated as HD 240430 and HD 240429, respectively — are approximately 4 billion years old, and they appear to be yellow G-type stars, similar to (but slightly younger than) the sun. Observations also showed that the stars orbit each other once every 10,000 years or so, according to the study.

At first, astronomers questioned whether the two stars were in fact a binary pair, because they are located a whopping two light-years apart. But further research confirmed that the co-moving stars have the same radial velocities. Their movements toward and away from Earth match — a key indicator of a binary star system, according to the statement.

What is most surprising about the stellar duo is that they are composed of drastically different materials. The study revealed that Kronos had an unusually high level of minerals such as magnesium, aluminum, silicon, iron, chromium and yttrium — metals that make up the bulk of rocky planets such as Earth. However, the ravenous star did not have an equally high level of volatile compounds, which are most often found in gas form, like oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and potassium, according to the statement.

Most metal-rich stars ""have all the other elements enhanced at a similar level, whereas Kronos has volatile elements suppressed, which makes it really weird in the general context of stellar abundance patterns,"" Semyeong Oh, a graduate student at Princeton and lead author of the study, said in the statement.

The abundance of rock-forming minerals was concentrated in Kronos' outer layers, rather than mixed throughout the star. Furthermore, the researchers confirmed that the types of minerals in the outer layers of the star solidify at warmer temperatures — a characteristic of rocky planets, which form closer to their parent star than gas giants do.

Therefore, Kronos likely consumed 15 Earth-mass planets in order to gain the unusual abundance of rock-forming minerals, the researchers said; otherwise, the star would have a higher abundance of volatiles from gobbling up gas giants.

""All of the elements that would make up a rocky planet are exactly the elements that are enhanced on Kronos,"" Oh said. ""And the volatile elements are not enhanced, so that provides a strong argument for a planet engulfment scenario, instead of something else.""

The study also provides new insight into stellar formation and exoplanets.

""At the moment, we are still at the stage of piecing together different observations to determine how and when exoplanets form,"" said Jessie Christiansen, an astronomer at the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology who was not involved in the research.

""It's difficult to directly observe planet formation around young stars — they are typically shrouded in dust, and the stars themselves are very active, which makes it hard to disentangle any signals from the planets,"" Christiansen said. ""So we have to infer what we can from the limited information we have. If borne out, this new window onto the masses and compositions of the material in the early stages of planetary systems may provide crucial constraints for planet formation theories.""

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote. Change the bag often.",8 overlooked germy places in your kitchen to clean now,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/8-overlooked-germy-places-in-your-kitchen-to-clean-now.html

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

“The life in North Korea is hell … life in America is heaven.”Fox News' Inwook Song contributed to this article.","North Korean Choi Kwanghyuk is one of the lucky ones.

The 55-year-old managed to escape from the work camp where he was sent after being targeted and persecuted by the government for his Christian faith.

“We couldn’t raise our voice during a service, we couldn’t sing out loud during a worship … that was hard,” Choi told Fox News through a translator. “Also, we had to hide so that other people could not see us.”

Despite having to hide his faith in plain sight while living in North Hamgyong province, Choi was still compelled to bring religion to others when he started an underground church.

“There were about nine people,” he said. “I couldn’t do mission work because we had to keep it secret that we had a church.”

“If that information had leaked, we could have faced the death penalty.”

North Korea is officially an atheist state where – except for a “show church” in Pyongyang that tourists are shown -- public worship is forbidden. The country is ranked the most oppressive place for Christians in the world and has had that ignominious status for years, according to Open Doors USA.

“[Choi’s] statements describing oppression, as well as his report of imprisonment for owning a Bible or practicing faith, align with everything we know about North Korea,” Open Doors President David Curry told Fox News. “Rated the worst place for the persecution of Christians, North Korea treats Christians horrendously and registers them as 'enemies of the state' for their faith.”

The totalitarian state forces the estimated 300,000 Christians living there to hide their religious beliefs and fellowship among each other.

“In a nation where the ruling regime demands total control over the general public, anything that challenges the government’s power is seen as a threat, including religion,” Jeff King, president of International Christian Concern, told Fox News. “As a result, the North Korean government does everything in its power to squash the spread of Christianity.""

This leads much of the religious population in North Korea to go underground with their worship, much like Choi and his church were forced to do.

“We had only one Bible,” he said. “North Hamgyong province is very cold. In the winter, we would dig a big hole and store kimchi there. We sometimes had services there. In the summer, we had services in the mountain or by the river.”

“The life in North Korea is hell. The life in America is heaven.” - Choi Kwanghyuk

“I never heard the term ‘underground church’ until I got here [to the U.S.].”

In 2008, North Korean authorities caught up to Choi and arrested him. He was held in prison by the state security department where he says he was interrogated about his faith.

“I was tortured there,” he said. “I kept denying it.”

He said that he was about to be sent to one of North Korea’s brutal labor camps when he was able to break free.

“I decided to escape because I thought that once they sent me to the other camp, they could eventually send me to the concentration camp or kill me,” Choi recalled. “I was traveling back and forth between China and North Korea, but they kept searching for me, and I knew it could put my friends in danger too, so I left.”

The North Korean gulag system is notorious for harsh conditions and brutal treatment of its prisoners.

Choi feared being sent to the most notorious camp within the system -- Camp 22.

Also known as Hoeryong concentration camp, and part of a large system of prison camps throughout the Communist dictatorship, Camp 22 is an 87-square-mile penal colony located in North Hamgyong province where most of the prisoners are people accused of criticizing the government.

Inmates, most of whom are serving life sentences, face harsh and often lethal conditions. According to the testimony of a former guard from Camp 22, prisoners live in bunkhouses with 100 people per room and some 30 percent show the markings of torture and beatings -- torn ears, gouged eyes and faces covered with scars.

“Unfortunately, it is inexplicably easy to wind up in one of these camps. While someone can be sent to one of these camps for openly evangelizing, someone can just as easily be sent there for simply being in contact with a religious person,” said King of the International Christian Concern.

Prisoners are forced to stand on their toes in tanks filled with water up to their noses for 24 hours, stripped and hanged upside-down while being beaten or given the infamous ""pigeon torture” -- where both hands are chained to a wall at a height of 2 feet, forcing them to crouch for hours at a time.

Tiny rations of watery corn porridge leave inmates on the brink of starvation, and many hunt rats, snakes and frogs for protein. Some even take the drastic measure of searching through animal dung for undigested seeds to eat. Beatings are handed out daily for offenses as simple as not bowing down in respect to the guards fast enough. Prisoners are used as practice targets during martial arts training. Guards routinely rape female inmates.

Choi said he finally escaped to neighboring China. While he was figuring out where to go next, he had heard how the general image of North Korean defectors was not positive among those in South Korea.

“So, I applied for asylum in the U.S.,” he told Fox News.

Choi, who was single when he lived in North Korea, was granted asylum in the U.S. in 2013. He first lived in Dallas before eventually moving to Los Angeles where he now lives.

Choi said that as a result of injuries he received while being tortured, he is unable to work but has committed himself to telling the world about the human rights abuses in his native land.

“First of all, every human must have the right to freedom,” he said. “There is no freedom in North Korea. By law, they have the freedom of religion and the freedom of the press, but the reality is very different.”

And despite the hardships he may face, Choi said that life in the U.S. is a vast improvement.

“There is an enormous difference between my life in North Korea and my life in the U.S,” he said.

“The life in North Korea is hell … life in America is heaven.”

But since Kim Jong Nam’s death in February, when two women lunged at him and smeared the banned VX nerve agent on him at Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpar airport, the first family of North Korea has been thrown into the spotlight. Reports soon circulated that Kim Jong Un had his half-brother, whom he had never met, killed because of fears a coup was being plotted to overthrow him.

Kim’s remaining siblings — Kim Yo Jong, Kim Sul Song and Kim Jong Chul — have remained mostly in the background since the death of their father, Kim Jong Il, in 2011. Kim Yo Jong, his sister, made international headlines earlier this month when she was voted to become an alternate member of the political bureau of the party’s central committee, the state’s Korean Central News Agency announced.

Here’s what he know about the siblings:

Kim Jong Nam:

As Kim Jong Il’s eldest child, Kim Jong Nam was poised to succeed his father when Kim Jong Il died. Jong Nam was born in May 1971 and the former dictator was reportedly fond of his first son, often dining and calling him despite raising him in secret and sealing him behind palace gates, the BBC reported. Like many of siblings, Jong Nam studied in Switzerland and lived in Russia before returning to North Korea in the late 1980s.

His chances to rule the volatile regime grew rocky over the years. He still worked for his father by serving in the regime’s internal security apparatus and the foreign exchange earning operations. But any chance Jong Nam had to become the supreme ruler officially ended in May 2001 when he was arrested at an airport in Tokyo for using a counterfeit passport, according to the BBC. He reportedly told officials he was planning to visit Tokyo Disneyland.

The incident became a source of embarrassment that drove Jong Nam into exile in Macau. He was reportedly traveling with a fake Portuguese passport at the time. In interviews, Jong Nam said he had “no interest” in becoming the next North Korean leader, according to the Telegraph. He also had a home in Beijing.

Jong Nam died in early February after two women carried out a daring assassination at the Malaysian airport. Siti Aisyah, 25, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, are on trial in connection with the death, though they have insisted they thought they were playing a prank for a reality TV show. North Korean agents are also suspected of engineering the plot.

Kim Jong Il’s eldest son could have been seen as a potential rival to Jong Un. A report by Japanese magazine Nikkei Asian Review also claimed the North Korean leader “flew into a rage” when he uncovered a coup that planned to replace him with Jong Nam.

Kim Jong Chul

Kim Jong Chul is mostly known because he is a huge fan of rock legend Eric Clapton. Several reports stated the despot’s brother was spotted at Clapton concerts in London. Japanese broadcaster TBS also said they had video of Jong Chul, donning sunglasses and a leather jacket, at a Clapton performance in 2015 — though the video has since been removed.

Thae Yong Ho, North Korea’s former deputy ambassador in London, told Reuters in February he accompanied Jong Chul to the Clapton concert in 2015. Thae, who defected from North to South Korea, was also ordered to get the tickets.

“I realized, ‘Ah! It must be Kim Jong Chol! In North Korea who else would be interested but Kim Jong Chol?'” Thae recalled to Reuters.

Jong Chol is also a guitarist.

“He’s very free,” Thae said. “But he’s only interested in guitars and music.”

It’s unclear if Jong Chol plays any role in Kim Jong Un’s regime. He left North Korea in the late 1990s and was reportedly deemed “like a little girl” by Kim Jong Il.

Kim Yo Jong

Kim Yo Jong, believed to be 28 or 30, is said to be one of the leader’s closest confidants. They both have the same mother, Ko Yong Hui. In early October, Yo Jong was elected to become an alternate member of the politiburo, the top decision-making body that Kim Jong Un presides over. The sister also replaced their aunt, Kim Kyong Hee, in that position.

Yo Jong forged a bond with her brother when they studied in Bern, Switzerland for two years. She was spotted next to Jong Un when their father died in 2011. Afterwards, sources said she helped the now-leader to consolidate power, said Michael Madden, founder of the influential NK Leadership Watch website.

Yo Jong began her career working in the regime’s Propaganda and Agitation Department, managing North Korea’s cultural affairs and news media. She was also photographed alongside her late father in a May 2009 trip in Wonsan University of Agriculture.

Madden added the appointment shows the sister's daily activities are more substantive and more important than some analysts had contended. He said it also indicates the Ko Yong Hui line has been ""conclusively established as the sole succeeding branch of the Kim family” following Jong Nam’s murder.

Kim Sul Song

The eldest daughter of Kim Jong Il was also rumored to be the former leader’s favorite child. Very few details are known about her, but she is reportedly a significant, secret player in the regime. She also previously served in the propaganda department and as Kim Jong Il's secretary, the BBC reported.

Chevrolet won't say why.

The Bowling Green factory where the Corvette has been manufactured since 1981 has been shut down the past few months for the installation of a new paint shop and other upgrades, so the model year was already truncated.

Chevy is still scheduled to build around 9,700 of the coupes and convertibles by January, according to the newspaper, so 2018 cars won’t exactly be rare, but they may end up being among the last of their kind.

Although the folks at Chevy haven’t admitted it, they are hard at work on a next-generation sports car that’s believed to be a mid-engine successor to the Corvette.

In response, one cheeky citizen took to Le Bon Coin, a Craigslist-type classified website, to post an ad for a small slice of baguette slathered in butter — known as a “tartine” — in an attempt capitalize on the demand.

“Tartine for sale covered in real half-salted (demi-sel) Breton butter, bought just a week ago. I stress that the tartine has been toasted, however I waited for it to cool before applying the butter,” the seller wrote in a post that has since gone viral, The Local reports.

He also priced the item at 5 euro, or just under $6.

While the seller later told France Radio that the ad was a joke simply meant to poke fun at the ongoing butter crisis, the dairy disaster is no laughing matter.

According to The Local, the trouble began in 2015 when the European Union abolished its system of milk quotas, ultimately leading to a decline in production that coincided with a rising demand for buttery baked goods from Europe across Asia and the Middle East.

Jason Lewis, R-Minn.","WASHINGTON-- Some Americans could see a lot more drones flying around their communities as the result of a Trump administration test program to increase government and commercial use of the unmanned aircraft.

President Donald Trump gave the go-ahead Wednesday, signing a directive intended to increase the number and complexity of drone flights.

The presidential memo would allow exemptions from current safety rules so communities could move ahead with testing of drone operations.

States, communities and tribes selected to participate would devise their own trial programs in partnership with government and industry drone users. The administration anticipates approving at least five applications, but there is no limit on the number of communities that can join.

The Federal Aviation Administration would review each program. The agency would grant waivers, if necessary, to rules that now restrict drone operations. Examples include prohibitions on flights over people, nighttime flights and flights beyond the line of sight of the drone operator.

Among the things that could be tested are package deliveries; the reliability and security of data links between pilot and aircraft; and technology to prevent collisions between drones and other aircraft and to detect and counter drones flying in restricted areas.

The trial program will collect data on drone operations that will aid the government's effort to develop a separate air traffic control system for low-flying unmanned aircraft, Michael Kratsios of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy told reporters in a conference call. Ultimately, the information is intended to be used to more generally expand drone flights around the country.

The test zones are expected to start going into place in about a year. The program would continue for three years after that.

The program is intended ""to foster technological innovation that will be a catalyst for ideas that have the potential to change our day-to-day lives,"" said Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. She noted that drones have proven to be an especially valuable tool in emergency situations, including assessing damage from natural disasters such as the recent hurricanes and the wildfires in California.

Drone-makers and businesses that want to fly drones have pushed for looser restrictions. Trump discussed the issue with industry leaders at a White House meeting in June.

In the past two years, the FAA has registered over 1 million drones. The majority of them belong to hobbyists. There are now more registered drones than registered manned aircraft in the U.S.

Safety restrictions on drone flights have limited drone use, and U.S. technology companies seeking to test and deploy commercial drones have often done so overseas. For example, Google's Project Wing is testing drones in Australia, and Amazon is testing drone deliveries in the United Kingdom.

""In order to maintain American leadership in this emerging industry here at home, our country needs a regulatory framework that encourages innovation while ensuring airspace safety,"" Kratsios said.

Safety concerns over drones have risen recently after the collision of a civilian drone and an Army helicopter over Staten Island, New York, and the first verified collision in North America between a drone and a commercial aircraft, in Quebec City, Canada.

The test program doesn't address complaints by local governments that low-flying drones present safety, privacy and nuisance risks. The FAA says it has the sole authority to regulate the national airspace, but some communities have passed their own restrictions.

The test program ""doesn't go far enough in protecting local control and the rights to privacy and property,"" said Rep. Jason Lewis, R-Minn. He has introduced a bill to give local governments more control over drones flying under 200 feet.

But Doug Johnson, vice president of technology policy at the Consumer Technology Association, said the test program recognizes that ""the federal government cannot manage policymaking and enforcement by itself"" and must work with local governments.

""Public-private partnerships like those that would be created by the program are critical to realizing the economic benefits of drones,"" he said.

The association, whose members include drone-makers, has estimated 3.4 million drones will be sold in the U.S. this year, 40 percent more than last year. Revenue from those sales is estimated at about $1.1 billion.",Trump OKs test program to expand domestic drone flights,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/25/trump-oks-test-program-to-expand-domestic-drone-flights.html

Al-Khelaifi met with Swiss prosecutors two weeks after they announced the case against him.","A Guatemalan judge who once served as general secretary of his country's soccer federation is expected to be the first person sentenced in the U.S. in the world soccer bribery scandal.

Hector Trujillo, 63, is set to receive his sentence Wednesday in a federal courtroom in Brooklyn, N.Y., after pleading guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy in June.

Trujillo confessed to accepting almost $200,000 in bribes from a company that tried to secure sports marketing contracts.

Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of more than three years in prison and suggest Trujillo should pay $415,000 in restitution. The defense is asking for no time behind the bars for crimes committed between 2009 and 2016, and urged the judge to show leniency because the case ended Trujillo’s “successful and prominent career and tarnished his spotless reputation as a respected jurist and advocate.”

They also said the arrest forced Trujillo to resign as an alternate judge on Guatemala's constitutional court and say his health debilitated following the arrest by U.S. authorities.

Under the plea agreement, Trujillo will not object any sentence less than four years and nine months in prison, and agreed to forfeit $175,000.

He is currently living in Miami, free on $4 million bail.

Trujillo was arrested in December 2015 in Florida during a Disney cruise with his family. In pre-sentence papers, prosecutors argue that he underrates the seriousness of his committed crimes, claiming he did not violate the laws of Guatemala, despite breaking FIFA rules.

""While the defendant may not have played the largest role or pocketed the most money of all of the defendants in the case, his conduct nevertheless shows that he engaged in the same type of conduct as the rest of the corrupt soccer officials who have been charged. And that corrupt conduct requires a significant sentence,"" prosecutors said in court documents.

The U.S. investigation of corruption scandal linked with FIFA has led to indictments or guilty pleas from more than 40 people and companies linked to the sport in the America since 2015.

Meanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain soccer club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, a 43-year-old Qatari soccer and television executive, was questioned Wednesday by Swiss authorities who accuse him of bribing a FIFA official in a World Cup broadcasting rights deal.

Al-Khelaifi is accused of letting former FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke to use his luxury villa on the Island of Sardinia – seized two weeks ago by Italian authorities – in exchange for 2026-2030 broadcasting rights of the World Cup.

Al-Khelaifi met with Swiss prosecutors two weeks after they announced the case against him. The Qatari executive denies the allegations.

The interrogation was expected to last for several hours due to translation issues and “lots of questions” during the interview, according to Andre Marty, a spokesman for the Swiss attorney general’s office.

“The world of football needs to be patient as for the results of this first interrogation,” the spokesman said Wednesday.

Country star Alan Jackson, the late guitarist and singer Jerry Reed and songwriter Don Schlitz were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on Sunday.

Country icon Loretta Lynn returned to the Hall of Fame for the first time since she suffered a stroke in May to formally induct Jackson. Lynn, who cancelled her tour dates this year to recover, said Jackson was the only person that could make her leave her house.

She recalled meeting Jackson when he was a nervous young artist decades ago and knowing then that he would ""be one of the greatest singers in country music.""

""He hadn't let me down,"" said Lynn, who is also a member of the Hall of Fame.

The 59-year-old Jackson is still one of country music's most successful solo artists, having sold nearly 45 million albums in the United States and had 26 singles reach the top of the Billboard country charts.

With his baritone voice and knack for telling stories about small town Southern life, the Newnan, Georgia-born singer was among a wave of neo-traditionalists that broke through in the 1990s.

He joked that when he was signed to Arista Nashville, a label started by Clive Davis, they had no idea how popular he would become.

""I was just a token country singer they signed for that label and bam, I took off,"" Jackson said.

Many of his hits became instant classics, from the barroom staple ""Chattahoochee"" to the somber ""Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)"" written after the Sept. 11 attacks.

But he's also been characterized as shy and uneasy in the media spotlight.

""I am not really shy, just socially awkward,"" Jackson said. ""I just don't like to talk too much.""

Instead, he let his songs speak for him, often writing about his father, his wife and the everyday joys and sorrows of the average man. Other hits include ""It's Five O'Clock Somewhere,"" ''A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'Bout Love)"" and ""When Somebody Loves You.""

George Strait, Alison Krauss and Lee Ann Womack each performed one of Jackson's songs in his honor.

Reed, who died at age 71 in 2008, was first known as an in-demand studio musician with a unique finger picking style on the guitar. He played for and wrote songs for stars like Elvis Presley and Porter Wagoner.

Reed, originally from Atlanta, became more popular when his songs began charting. His hit song ""When You're Hot, You're Hot"" earned him a Grammy award.

In later years, he started appearing in TV and movies, most notably playing Burt Reynolds' sidekick in ""Smokey and the Bandit."" He also sang many of the songs on the soundtrack, including ""East Bound and Down.""

His daughters, Seidina Hubbard and Lottie Zavala, accepted the honor on his behalf.

Hubbard said one of her fondest memories of growing up was listening ""to the beautiful sound of that guitar in the house all the time.""

Performing some of his songs were guitarists Tommy Emmanuel, John Knowles and Steve Wariner, while Jamey Johnson performed one of his personal favorites, ""East Bound and Down.""

Schlitz, 65, from Durham, North Carolina, had his first songwriting hit in 1978 when Kenny Rogers recorded his song, ""The Gambler,"" which became Rogers' signature song throughout his career.

Other songs he helped write include ""On the Other Hand"" and ""Forever and Ever, Amen,"" both sung by Randy Travis; ""When You Say Nothing at All,"" recorded by both Keith Whitley and Alison Krauss; and ""Strong Enough to Bend,"" by Tanya Tucker.

He was elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012 and helped to create the popular songwriters in the round format at Nashville's famed Bluebird Café.

Aloe Blacc and Vince Gill sang a duet version of ""The Gambler,"" while singers Charlie Worsham and Mary Chapin Carpenter also performed his songs in his honor.

Schlitz gave some advice to his grandchildren seated in the audience from what he had learned in his career.

""No one does this alone. In your life, be a part of something bigger than yourself,"" Schlitz said.",Loretta Lynn returns after stroke to honor Alan Jackson,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/loretta-lynn-returns-after-stroke-to-honor-alan-jackson.html

FOX NEWS - The controversial dossier containing salacious allegations about President Donald Trump and his possible connections to Russia, including coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, resulted from funding by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee to the firm Fusion GPS, a source familiar with the situation confirmed to Fox News.

Fusion GPS was retained by Marc E. Elias, an attorney representing the DNC and the Clinton campaign, The Washington Post first reported Tuesday. Fusion GPS then reportedly hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to write the now-infamous dossier.

Steele had ties both to the U.S. intelligence community and the FBI.

Prior to the firm being retained in April 2016 by Elias and his law firm, Perkins Coie, Fusion GPS’s research had been subsidized by an unidentified Republican during the GOP primary.

But the Clinton campaign – and the DNC – saw the research through, funding the firm through the end of October 2016, just days before Trump defeated Clinton in the general election, according to The Post's reporting.

Steele’s findings and other research were then submitted to Elias via Fusion GPS, The Post reported. The method and the amount of the information that was provided to the campaign and the DNC wasn't immediately clear. It also wasn’t known who in those organizations knew about the roles of both Steele and Fusion GPS.

Andrew Jackson’s leadership proved to be exactly what the fledgling United States needed as it battled enemies coming from all sides in the War of 1812, culminating with his role at the decisive Battle of New Orleans. We get a peek at his leadership style here:

His next venture into public service would suit him better: thanks to his strong relationships and sound political instincts, he was elected major general of the Tennessee militia, in February 1802. Maintained by the state, not the federal government, the militia was provisioned by local men who supplied their own weapons and uniforms and served short contracts of a few months’ duration.

Leading the militia was a good fit for Jackson’s style, because it gave him the chance to serve the people he loved with the freedom he needed and the challenge he craved. General Jackson repeatedly won reelection as well as the deep loyalty of his men. They liked what he said. He was often outspoken, and many shared his uncompromising views on defending settlers’ rights. With rumors of war, he was ready to defend his people and was just the man to rally westerners to the cause of American liberty.

“Citizens!” he wrote in a broadside. “Your government has at last yielded to the impulse of a nation. . . . Are we the titled slaves of George the Third? The military conscripts of Napoleon the great? Or the frozen peasants of the Russian czar? No -- we are the free-born sons of America; the citizens of the only republic now existing in the world.”

Jackson understood the stakes of the war, and he recognized the strategy as only a westerner could. Of critical importance to victory in the West was a port city near the Gulf Coast. As Jackson would soon say to his troops, in the autumn of 1812, “Every man of the western country turns his eyes intuitively upon the mouth of the Mississippi.” Together, he observed, “[we are] committed by nature herself [to] the defense of the lower Mississippi and the city of New Orleans.”

Beauty competitions long have been controversial in Egypt, with opposition coming from a wide range of sources, including religious organizations and government officials. Recently, the home of the founder of a beauty contest was set on fire shortly before the event was scheduled to take place.

Now, the subject has moved front and center again, with a member of the parliamentary Human Rights Committee pushing a ban on the Miss Egypt Pageant, which the official condemned as a national security threat.

Solaf Darwish, the parliament member, and several other government officials want more control over pageants if they are to continue, according to published reports.

“Miss Egypt Pageant 2017 has stirred public discontent,” said Darwish to Al-Monitor. “There were videos of the contestants in their bedrooms and in fitting rooms, which does not blend with the values ​​and traditions of Egyptian society.”

Religious organizations also are weighing in, hoping to up the ante against beauty contests.

Al-Azhar’s Senior Scholars Committee, a group whose website says its mission includes carrying “the burden and the responsibility of ‎protecting and preserving the purity, moderation, and modesty of Islam over the ‎centuries,” has expressed total opposition to the basic concept of beauty competitions, saying they violate Sharia laws.

Al-Azhar officials say that the very requirement that beauty contest judges must visually inspect a woman’s body and appearance are in contradiction of Sharia laws.

Darwish has argued that, unlike some critics of the contests, she is not seeking an all-out ban on them, but wants them to be answerable to the government to ensure that they comply with cultural and moral values.

“I only want to temporarily suspend them until the government and the Egyptian parliament agree on mechanisms to regulate them in line with the norms prevailing in Egyptian society and assign a specific ministry to supervise them,” Darwish is quoted as telling Al-Monitor.

Efforts to get a comment from the Egyptian Embassy in Washington D.C. were unsuccessful.

Beauty pageant organizers and winners defend the events, saying they are not just about physical appeal.

Fatima Baker, the beauty pageant organizer whose home was set ablaze, told the Al Arabiya Network that her event was the victim of “a misunderstanding of the contest and its purpose.”

“The contest, which is the first of its kind in Egypt, isn’t just about physical beauty, but also about education, fitness, style, aspirations, knowledge of the Quran and social activism,” she said.

Baker noted that the contest had generated a lot of enthusiasm from Egyptians.

“Suffice it to say that within days we received 250 applications and had to close the registration,” she said. “The winner won’t be selected based on her beauty. The contest is not at all about that. I’m a resident of the Delta region and I’m against showcasing local girls in this way.”",Egyptian government has new crackdown target: beauty contests,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/25/egyptian-government-has-new-crackdown-target-beauty-contests.html

In the midst of a court case that threatened to reveal the dossier’s funding, it emerged overnight that political consulting firm Fusion GPS was retained last year by Marc E. Elias, an attorney representing the DNC and the Clinton campaign. The firm then hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to write the now-infamous dossier.

The Washington Post first reported on the connections, which were confirmed by Fox News.

Not only did the Clinton campaign and DNC fund the firm through the end of October 2016, but the FBI reportedly arranged to pay Steele to proceed with intelligence gathering on Donald Trump and Russia after Trump’s election. That deal was later nixed after the former intelligence officer was identified in news reports.

CLINTON CAMP, DNC HELPED FUND RESEARCH THAT LED TO TRUMP DOSSIER

House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said Wednesday that his biggest questions concern to what extent the FBI relied on that document to launch its Russia probe.

“My focus has always been whether or not the Department of Justice and the FBI relied upon an unsourced CI document to launch a counterintelligence investigation,” he told Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.” “I want to know whether the nation’s premier law enforcement agency relied on a document that looks like the National Enquirer prepared it. … And if they relied upon an unsourced, un-vetted document to launch a really important investigation … then I think our country is big enough to handle that truth.”

He noted that representatives with Fusion GPS pleaded the Fifth in a Capitol Hill appearance last week.

“Usually people plead the Fifth when they think the answer’s going to get them in trouble,” he said.

Further, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said at a Washington, D.C., event on Wednesday that the FBI has been “stonewalling” Congress’ request for documents, voicing frustration about learning this information through the media.

“The FBI needs to comply with the documents request that Congress has on their desk right now and they need to do it immediately,” Ryan said.

The controversial dossier contained unverified and lurid allegations about dirt the Russians had on Trump and his campaign's possible connections to Moscow.

Perkins Coie was paid $5.6 million in legal fees by the Clinton campaign in a time period ranging from June 2015 to December 2016, The Post reported, citing campaign finance records. The DNC also paid the firm $3.6 million for “legal and compliance consulting” going back to November 2015.

Sources told The Post that neither the Clinton campaign nor the DNC specifically directed Steele’s work, labeling the intelligence officer simply as a Fusion GPS subcontractor.

But after the Post story broke, reporters with The New York Times blasted Elias and others on Twitter, accusing them of denying the connection for months.

“When I tried to report this story, Clinton campaign lawyer @marceelias pushed back vigorously, saying ‘You (or your sources) are wrong,’” New York Times reporter Kenneth Vogel tweeted.

“Folks involved in funding this lied about it, and with sanctimony, for a year,” Times reporter Maggie Haberman tweeted.

Former Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon boasted on Twitter that, while he didn’t know about Steele’s hiring before the election, “If I had, I would have volunteered to go to Europe and try to help him.”

He added, “I have no idea what Fusion or Steele were paid but if even a shred of that dossier ends up helping Mueller, it will prove money well spent.”

But he defended Elias on the issue of whether he denied the funding connection, tweeting: “Dont know what Elias may have said but if he was coy, he was prob just being a good lawyer honoring confidentiality.”

Haberman countered: “’coy’ is not responding at all. ‘Your sources are wrong’ is a bit different.”

The Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, stressed that the current leadership was not involved in the arrangement.

“Tom Perez and the new leadership of the DNC were not involved in any decision-making regarding Fusion GPS, nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization,"" DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement. ""But let’s be clear, there is a serious federal investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, and the American public deserves to know what happened.”

A spokesman for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who led the DNC at the time, told Fox News on Wednesday that, “She did not have any knowledge of this arrangement.”

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

RELATED: Duvet vs. Coverlet - What’s the Difference?

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor. Remember to read the manufacturer’s care guide that comes with your purchase.",How to choose the best bedding for cold winter nights,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/how-to-choose-best-bedding-for-cold-winter-nights.html

The teenager, who loved nothing more than writing and performing her own songs, believed that a radio tour would allow her to follow in the footsteps of her heroes like Patsy Cline, Linda Ronstadt, Martina McBride and all of the other female artists who came before her.

But Armiger told Fox News she would soon learn that the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry came with a hefty price.

Years before pop superstar Taylor Swift was groped by a radio DJ from Denver, Colo., Armiger says she was fending off a different handsy DJ while she was underage.

""I was at a radio station in Texas and was taking a promo photo with one of the on-air DJs after doing my performances and he grabbed my butt during the photo,"" Armiger told us. ""And at the same time he was whispering in my ear, 'When are you going to be legal?'""

Armiger told us she ""was shocked"" and ""terrified"" but had no one to lean on for support.

""I brought up my fears and I was told that's how it was and if I wanted to be in music, I'd have to get over it,"" she said.

Armiger decided to keep her mouth shut after that, but things came to a head in June 2016 when the singer was sued by her record label, Cold River, and filed a counterclaim alleging the label told her to ""sex it up"" in order to become successful.

According to the lawsuit, Armiger said she was asked to ""purchase 'hot, game-changing' clothes,"" ""hug, kiss and flirt"" with radio programmers. Armiger said she was told she needed to make the programmers ""wish you would take them home with you.""

Cold River Record head Pete O'Heeron told Fox News at the time the suit was ""baseless"" and ""an attempt to try and smear good people.""

Armiger said she can't comment on her battle with Cold River after a settlement was made, but said she now wants to share her stories of sexual harassment after hearing the bombshell sexual abuse allegations against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that have rocked Hollywood.

""There's something really horrible going on behind the scenes,"" she told us, saying the country music community has its fair share of Weinstein-like behavior.

The now-26-year-old detailed several other stories of sexual harassment that she's encountered. Armiger recalled taking a radio programmer and his team to lunch when the program director asked everyone to share their ""top five list of women they would want to sleep with.""

After sharing his first choice, Armiger said a radio programmer turned to her, ""looking me in the eyes, he said, 'But you would absolutely be my No. 2.'""

Armiger said he then turned to her guitar player and said, ""Surely you've been f--king her. Where is she on your list?""

The guitar player suggested the group change the subject to something more appropriate, but Armiger said she still ""got flack"" for the exchange.

""The programmer called and said if I ever brought that guitar player back again he'd never play my music again,"" she recalled.

The singer said she was similarly rebuked after a radio DJ was interviewing her about her album ""Confessions of a Nice Girl"" at the 2010 ACM Awards.

""As we were doing the interview, he is trying to feel me up under the table -- this is on air -- trying to ask me whether or not my album title was true because surely I couldn't be a nice girl. I had to be a naughty girl,"" Armiger said.

When the DJ later asked her what her least favorite interview question was, Armiger was ""pissed"" and curtly said, ""The worst question is that you're asking me if I'm a nice girl or a naughty girl because what kind of person asks that?""

She said ""that didn't go over well"" and she learned ""not to talk back"" after that.

When Armiger filed her lawsuit against Cold River, she said many people in the country music world would not work with her anymore.

""When my story first became public and in the aftermath when I was finally to start looking for other opportunities in the industry, we went to [publishing houses] but we would be met with, 'We're not going to sign you, but we're really a big fan and we just want to know your story and how are you?'""

She continued, ""That was the consensus; that was everywhere I went. I would talk to booking agents and they were scared to work with me because they either thought somehow the tour would be canceled or I was a liability to work with.""

Armiger said she does not want to name her harassers out of fear of retribution, but she hopes coming forward with her story of harassment in the country music world will make a difference because ""it has to change.""

""I don't think it will change until people start speaking out, and for the most part they're too scared,"" she told us. ""Look at my story -- they'll see that I spoke out and spoke my truth and thought for the most part people would believe my story. I didn't ever think that it would be met with doubt or disdain.""",Katie Armiger says she was blacklisted from country music after sexual harassment allegations,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/katie-armiger-says-was-blacklisted-from-country-music-after-sexual-harassment-allegations.html

In a blog post on Tuesday, Twitter's GM of Revenue Product and Engineering Bruce Falck wrote that the company was announcing new steps to ""increase transparency for all ads on Twitter, including political ads and issue-based ads,"" as well as ""improving controls for our customers and adopting stricter advertising policies.""

As part of the initiative, Twitter is launching an Advertising Transparency Center, which will show things like who funded the ads, including those who may have a political agenda, how long they have been running and the creatives associated with the ad campaigns.

TWITTER UNCOVERS $274K IN AD SPENDING BY TO RUSSIAN OPERATIVES TIED TO 2016 ELECTION

In September, Twitter announced it uncovered several accounts linked to the same Russian activity that Facebook saw on its platform, as well as $274,000 spent on ads by a company with ties to the Russian government during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.

Twitter said Russia Today (RT), which it classified as having ""strong links to the Russian government,"" reportedly tried to interfere in the U.S. election, while undermining ""trust in American democracy."" Twitter's move prompted a scathing response from Russia Today.

The social media giant is making the ad transparency pledge as it tries to fend off proposed legislation that would regulate ad sales on its network.

The Honest Ads Act, co-sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R.-AZ., Sen. Mark Warner, D.-VA and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D.-MN., is aimed at requiring Facebook, Google and other digital media companies to make details about the ads — and in particular, political ads — public, including how the ads are targeted and how much they cost.

""To make it clear when you are seeing or engaging with an electioneering [political] ad, we will now require that electioneering advertisers identify their campaigns as such,"" Falck added. ""We will also change the look and feel of these ads and include a visual political ad indicator.""

Facebook and Google have also said they will work with legislators on the purported efforts from Russian-based operatives to meddle with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

In a tweet, Warner said the changes proposed by Twitter were ""a good first step,"" adding ""Online political ads need more transparency & disclosure.""

'THE SINS OF SILICON VALLEY': BACKLASH MOUNTS AGAINST FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, AMAZON

In addition to the aforementioned changes, Twitter said there would be a section in the Transparency Center for politcal ads for details such as ""transparency about the identity of the organization funding the campaign,""and ""targeting demographics, such as age, gender and geography."" Twitter will also introduce ""stronger penalties for advertisers who violate policies,"" though it did not specify what those penalties are.

The aforementioned Silicon Valley giants are set to face a Senate hearing next week where they will likely be asked to describe and explain how the Russian-based operatives abused their respective ad platforms.

It is unclear whom from each company will attend the hearings, though Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg are not expected to attend. Facebook is holding its third-quarter conference call with investors on the day of the hearing.

WAWA SANDWICH CONTAINED MAGGOTS, MAN CLAIMS

Lisa Donovan, who says she slipped on the discarded “hoagie guts” in June of 2014, argued that the incident was the result of negligence on the part of Wawa. However, defense attorneys claimed that Donovan had failed to provide testimony from a liability expert on the issue of whether or not the store was negligent. They also asked for a summary judgement.

“Whether Defendant was negligent in cleaning up ‘hoagie guts’ in its parking lot, is within the intelligence of a layperson … a lay jury has common knowledge of what conditions are expected and reasonable in a grocery store or when walking down a residential street,” the judge found, per court documents.

The judge also denied Wawa’s motion for a summary judgement.

“Being able to feel ‘normal,’ even for a little while, was beyond a gift,” says the 5-foot-8 benefits administrator of her visit to the Resort, on the Bahamian island of Eleuthera. Riley says she loved it so much, she plans to return next year.

The secret retreat, founded two years ago by entrepreneur James King, encourages fuller-figured tourists to let it all hang out while on vacation. They can loll on chaise lounges built to hold 560 pounds; sleep — or enjoy worry-free sex — on king-size, steel-reinforced beds; and stroll the private beach without what King calls “fear of judgment.”

“What’s so great is [the Resort’s] recognition that people of size have insecurities and challenges that the general public never considers,” Riley tells The Post of her visit in November 2015, soon after it opened. “Will they have chairs I can sit on? Will the bed hold my weight? Will I fit in the tub?

“Can you imagine how it feels to walk down a beach and hear people refer to you as a beached whale?” continues Riley, who lives in Arlington, Texas. “I wore a bikini and never felt uncomfortable, and I was noticed for my beauty, not my size. Living as a plus-size person in a judgmental world is stressful.”

King says around 60 percent of his clientele are American, and roughly 10 percent of them come from the New York metro area.

The rest travel from as far afield as the UK and Spain.

Activities include swimming and kayaking on a nearby lagoon. Other options are boating or fishing.

King — who was inspired to found the resort because previous hotels he worked at didn’t cater to obese people — books only small groups of up to 24 people at a time. The $16,400 rate for a six-day stay includes three buffets a day. Drinks and tips are on the honor system.

King says he used to take individual guests but insists on group bookings to preserve the homely atmosphere.

“For the first couple of months, we did single bookings, but the issue was a lot of people just started to relax and feel comfortable and then new people turned up,” he says.

King, who is of a normal weight himself, says he hopes to open a second resort on nearby Cat Island for plus-size couples and singles.

“Why should 40 percent of our population be subjected to being ignored by the hospitality industry?” he asks.

Bad Rabbit, which appears to have originated in Ukraine, hit computers at the Odessa international airport in southern Ukraine and the Kiev subway. Prominent Russian media outlets such as Interfax and Fontanka also reported being targeted Tuesday.

The Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Group-IB said Wednesday the ransomware also tried to penetrate the computers of major Russian banks but failed. None of the banks has reported any attacks, though the Russian Central Bank said Wednesday it had recorded BadRabbit's attack on its systems but they were not compromised.

HUGE 'PETYA' RANSOMWARE ATTACK HITS EUROPE, SPARKS MASS DISRUPTION

Cybersecurity specialist Kaspersky Lab, which is based in Moscow, describes Bad Rabbit as a “drive-by” attack. “Victims download a fake Adobe Flash installer from infected websites and manually launch the .exe file, thus infecting themselves,” it said, in a statement. Kaspersky Lab reported that the criminals behind Bad Rabbit are demanding 0.05 bitcoin as ransom, roughly equivalent to $280.

While most of the ransomware’s victims have been in Russia, Kaspersky Lab also noted attacks in Ukraine, Turkey and Germany.

Prague, Czech Republic-based cybersecurity firm Avast Software reported late Tuesday that Bad Rabbit had been detected in the U.S. ""We expect a growing number of detections in the hours ahead,"" it tweeted.

Bad Rabbit is a suspected variant of the recent ‘Petya’ ransomware that sparked disruption across Europe, according to a number of experts, including the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). “US-CERT discourages individuals and organizations from paying the ransom, as this does not guarantee that access will be restored,” it said in a post on Tuesday.

PETYA RANSOMWARE: EXPERTS TOUT 'VACCINE' TO PROTECT COMPUTERS FROM CRIPPLING CYBER ATTACK

Experts warn that organizations across the globe should be on their guard against Bad Rabbit. “As businesses in Russia and Ukraine report infections, global companies must look inward and ask themselves, ‘Have I done enough? Did we patch our systems after Petya? Have we shored up our perimeter web and email defenses?’” Steve Malone, director of security product management at email security specialist Mimecast explained in an email to Fox News. “History tells us the answer to these questions is very likely no, so once again, brace for further widespread outbreaks.”

“Ransomware is cheap to make and lucrative when it works, so we can expect to see a lot more of it,” noted Shirali Patel, cybersecurity manager at defense and cybersecurity specialist Raytheon, in an email. “While reports indicate Bad Rabbit is affecting networks primarily in Russia and eastern Europe, we know how easily malware can jump from one host to another.”

“For organizations to effectively defend against attacks like Bad Rabbit, they need to have instant visibility into which of their assets are susceptible to the attack,” added Manoj Asnani, vice president of product and design at security specialist Balbix. “On-tap visibility is very hard to achieve manually. Security teams must have automated systems in place that can continuously monitor these type of attack vectors and provide vital information instantly when needed.”

AFTER NSA TOOL USED IN PETYA CYBERATTACK, CONGRESSMAN URGES AGENCY TO THWART MALWARE

Bad Rabbit has emerged just four months after Petya, which itself came hot on the heels of the WannaCry ransomware that wreaked havoc across the globe.

The scale of the ransomware threat was highlighted last year when a Los Angeles hospital paid nearly $17,000 in bitcoins to hackers who disabled its computer network.

However, Bob Rudis, chief data scientist of cybersecurity specialist Rapid7 does not think that Bad Rabbit will hammer U.S. organizations. ""Enough awareness has been raised and researchers have identified a number of ways to prevent the attack from

occurring that it is unlikely we'll see significant growth,"" he explained, via email. ""As of now, BadRabbit has been contained to the original target regions, with a few confirmed infections in the U.S., but these appear to be rare.""

""Usually we mow a lot of crops down there at night so the deer come out into the fields when they get used to the tractor. There weren't any deer, so I just made the dreaded walk one day and just found them dead everywhere,"" sportsman and farmer Ben Gamble told USA Today.

""I walked the creek one day and found about a dozen in a 300 yard walk, and that answered all my questions. That was all I needed to see,” he continued.

The disease, which is spread through biting midges and other tiny biting insects, is common for deer to get, says Mime Barnes, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency information and education officer. What isn’t common is the number of deer the virus has killed this year – the highest number since 2007.

""The disease has always been around and it kind up pops up here and there, and there's no predictor of when it's going to be an outbreak or how big the outbreak will be,"" Barnes said to USA Today.

At the beginning of October, the wildlife agency received 158 deer reported death in Morgan County alone.

Gamble and a group of over 20 other hunters lease land in the county to hunt.

""We get on our side-by-sides and take a ride across the farms we own and lease and sometimes we'd count 100 deer. This time this year we'd be lucky if we saw one deer,"" Gamble said.

However, just because these infections don’t run rampant does not mean that they don’t happen. In fact, several types of intestinal parasites might just be gaining ground in Western countries.

A Sushi Problem

One type of intestinal parasite that may be increasing is often found in sushi. The fact that more cases are occurring in developed areas doesn’t mean that more fish are infected. Instead, it reflects people’s increased interest in eating raw fish as a meal.

In one case published in the journal BMJ Case Reports, a healthy man from Portugal made a trip to his doctor after more than a week of severe stomach pain. He was also experiencing vomiting and a low-grade fever.

CARPENTER DIES AFTER CONTRACTING FLESH-EATING BACTERIA INFECTION WHILE FIXING HARVEY-DAMAGED HOMES

Upon careful evaluation, the doctors discovered that the man had recently eaten sushi. Suspecting a parasite, the doctor performed an endoscopy where he viewed the man’s digestive tract through a tiny tube with a camera.

Sure enough, the parasite anisakiasis had attached itself to the lining of the man’s stomach. His symptoms disappeared immediately once the parasite and its larvae were removed.

“Most of the cases were described in Japan due to food habits; however, it has been increasingly recognized in Western countries,” the study's authors noted.

With this increased interest in raw food, especially sushi, people should stay aware of safety habits. Experts recommend eating sushi only at high grade restaurants where workers are sure to have taken important precautions.

A Summer of Cyclospora

Normally, health experts encourage you to eat plenty of fresh produce, but in the case of cyclosporiasis, fresh produce is likely the culprit.

This intestinal illness happens when a person gets infected by the parasite Cyclospora cayetanensis. Thankfully, you can’t spread Cyclospora from person to person, but it does spread through contaminated food or water.

The most common symptom to watch for is watery diarrhea that lasts for several weeks. It may also be the cause of cases with prolonged, intermittent diarrhea.

THE DANGERS OF STREP THROAT

As for the source, not all fresh produce will have this parasite. Infection happens more often in tropical regions; so most U.S. outbreaks are actually related to imported produce such as basil and raspberries.

In addition, reported cases usually increase in the summer months, possibly due to the higher demand of tropical produce. According to the CDC, reported cases of cyclosporiasis more than doubled this year: 206 cases in 2017 versus 88 cases in 2016.

This increase shows that more food and water sources are being contaminated. The CDC recommends avoiding anything that was possibly contaminated by feces. Also, food growers and producers should follow the guides offered by the FDA to ensure proper growing, storage and processing procedures.

The Silent Offender

Last, another offending parasite that has caused problems in Western countries is the tapeworm. Different species of the tapeworm can be found in meats like beef or pork, and one species can cause a dangerous infection called cysticercosis.

In the case of cysticercosis, a person becomes infected by swallowing tapeworm eggs from the Taenia solium species. The larvae then infect various tissues, forming cysts in areas like the brain or muscle. This infection is dangerous because it can lead to harmful swelling and seizures.

Many cases of tapeworm infection go unnoticed and unreported due to mild or nonexistent symptoms. Although the CDC estimates about 1000 cases in the U.S. each year, the actual number may be much higher or lower.

How are most people infected? Although people can get a tapeworm infection through dogs, this route of infection is not very common. Rather, most people become infected by eating raw or undercooked beef or pork.

TREATING FIRST-DEGREE BURNS

Typically, Americans have a higher risk if they live in a concentrated or poor community, especially if the sanitation is poor. Areas with more animals have a greater risk as well.

In addition, people may get the parasite through contact with an infected person who has not practiced good hygiene or by travelling out of the country.

Protecting Yourself from Parasites

Although different types of intestinal parasites infect humans through different routes, you can protect yourself through a few general practices:

Cook all meat to the appropriate temperatures recommended by the FDA.

Eat only at restaurants with a grade A, especially sushi restaurants.

Practice good hygiene: regular hand-washing, bathing, proper cycling of worn clothing.

Wash and peel all raw fruits and vegetables.

When travelling abroad, only drink bottled or boiled water and stay aware of any food safety concerns at your destinations.

Generally, intestinal parasites aren’t as common in developed countries as in poorer areas. However, people in the US do get these infections, and many may be unaware of this problem.

Through awareness of food safety practices and proper hygiene, you can protect yourself from many types of intestinal parasites and keep your tummy healthy and happy.

A spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve, the U.S name given to the mission to defeat ISIS, told Fox News that the rebuilding of Raqqa will be overseen by the Raqqa Civil Council, a local governing body that has been put in charge since the liberation.
The U.S intention was for representatives from both Kurdish and Arab tribes in Raqqa province to join the council, and receive SDF support.
“Many of the Arab tribes didn’t even want to attend the liberation celebrations,” one Syrian insider told Fox News.
“The various local forces will make their own decisions and arrangements, and these would likely play out against our interests.”","The fall of the final ISIS stronghold of Raqqa – the terror group’s self-declared caliphate capital – by the Kurdish-led, U.S-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) last week has heralded much celebration.

But as the jubilation dies down, what remains is little more than smoldering rubble from air bombardment, akin to an apocalyptic wasteland. So whose burden is it to restore the ruined Raqqa?

“It is the responsibility of all countries, especially the U.S. and the Coalition because the Coalition’s airstrikes and artillery shelling were ‘half’ responsible for destroying Raqqa, the other half goes to ISIS car bombings,” local activist Sarmad Al Jilane, former CEO at Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently and now an advocacy expert at human rights media group Sound and Picture, told Fox News. “Around eighty percent of Raqqa is destroyed, and the rest is damaged.”

While the cost in lives goes far beyond any dollar amount – as tens of thousands of Raqqa residents have been run from their homes and livelihood with thousands more dead and disabled from almost four years of ISIS occupation – the return to any sense of normalcy will require billions.

According to the latest figures released by the Pentagon, U.S taxpayers have already spent an average of $13.6 million per day to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria since August 8, 2014 – just under $1.6 billion – of which the largest portion was shouldered by the Air Force. So should the U.S bear the responsibility of rebuilding?

Statistics released by monitoring group Air Wars claimed that U.S-led forces dropped 5,775 bombs, shells and missiles in the month of August alone – and more than 20,000 throughout the three-year campaign. While the U.S. has assumed much of the costs and planning to defeat ISIS in the Middle East, U.S Secretary of State Rex Tillerson earlier this year warned the international community that reconstruction will “require more from you.”

“The U.S has spent billions and took a big responsibility to get rid of ISIS. ISIS is a threat not only to the U.S but to the whole world, so the whole international community should be addressing the issue of rebuilding the city,” affirmed Bassam Barabandi, a Syrian diplomatic defector and now a political adviser to the official opposition negotiations team at the Syrian High Negotiations Committee.

A spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve, the U.S name given to the mission to defeat ISIS, told Fox News that the rebuilding of Raqqa will be overseen by the Raqqa Civil Council, a local governing body that has been put in charge since the liberation. The U.S has “no defined role in reconstruction,” the spokesperson said, and will remain focused on the final defeat of ISIS from pockets across Iraq and Syria.

The coalition is continuing to provide training to the SDF, thus funding such endeavors as the detection and removal of explosive ordnance, which have already killed members of at least nine families attempting to return to their homes in the city post-liberation.

The coalition also provides security and logistical support to the local council and to non-governmental agencies, to assist in rebuilding homes, buildings and medical buildings as well as restoring electricity and providing potable water.

However, some Syrians are warning that there are already glaring fractions within the Raqqa Civil Council, whose job ultimately is to plan the restoration and maintain its security. Syrians told Fox News that the council’s loyalties are largely divided.

The U.S intention was for representatives from both Kurdish and Arab tribes in Raqqa province to join the council, and receive SDF support. However, Raqqa is traditionally an overwhelmingly Sunni Arab-populated city, and a prominent portion would rather not be aligned with SDF but with Turkish forces, also Sunni Arabs, who view the Kurdish fighters as the enemy.

“Many of the Arab tribes didn’t even want to attend the liberation celebrations,” one Syrian insider told Fox News. “There is already a push to form a new council with new leadership.”

Al Jilane also argued that many members of the civil council “are not locals of Raqqa,” and for civilians to feel confident in returning, “locals and activists should be the ones in charge.”

In an effort to try and mobilize some of the disenfranchised Sunni tribesman and council members, Syrian sources said, Saudi Affairs Minister Thamer al-Sabhan visited Raqqa late last week alongside U.S special envoy to the coalition against ISIS, Brett McGurk, to meet with the Raqqa Civil Council.

It is believed Saudi Arabia – a prominent backer of opposition forces against the Assad regime – is mulling a request to significantly contribute to the rebuilding, in return for influence among the tribes.

While Syria’s embattled President Bashar al-Assad has insisted he intends to take back the entire country after more than six years of civil war, the U.S. has maintained that the territory is not to be returned into the dictator’s hands.

“The U.S. in partnership with allies including Gulf States like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will work as part of a stabilization effort. But we must ensure that not a single dollar goes into areas under control of the Assad regime,” noted Tony Badran, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD). “Otherwise, we would be paying Assad and Iran for having destroyed the country and ethnically cleansed its population.”

National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster concurred last week at an FDD that it is U.S. policy to ensure that absolutely no money goes to reconstructing anything that is under the regime’s control. However, Badran cautioned that the Russians are working in parallel to “create arrangements between the Kurdish-controlled areas and Damascus,” which means that if the U.S. wants to vigorously enforce that policy and maintain influence in the Raqqa region, it must now develop a broader plan beyond just defeating ISIS.

“Without a broader plan,” he cautioned. “The various local forces will make their own decisions and arrangements, and these would likely play out against our interests.”",Rebuilding Raqqa: Should U.S taxpayers pay to rebuild the ruined former ISIS stronghold?,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/25/rebuilding-raqqa-should-u-s-taxpayers-pay-to-rebuild-ruined-former-isis-stronghold.html

Especially towards the last few years of his life, and coinciding with the ever-increasing relevance of technology in our day-to-day lives, Jobs became discernibly more visible on the political scene. As a quick example, Jobs in 2012 famously told then-President Barack Obama that the manufacturing jobs responsible for making the iPhone a reality ""aren't coming back"" to the United States. You might also recall that Jobs even gave Clinton advice during the Monica Lewisnky scandal of 1998.

""Please excuse my presumption in making these suggestions,"" the letter notes at the end. ""I just wanted to make sure that these folks didn't escape your attention as you make these critical decisions.""

Jobs further championed Grove in a follow-up letter:

Andy is at the center of the exploding information revolution, and he could bring many of these perspectives to defense strategy and its current uses of information technology (command & control, intelligence,). He could be a secret weapon to change our perspectives and thinking about defense as our nation faces new world roles and fiscal limitations.

Andy has no public policy experience, but he is one of the smartest and fastest learners I have ever met. He was born in Hungary and is a US citizen.

Unsurprisingly, when the school system began to focus on left-wing indoctrination and intimidation instead of the fundamentals of education, student performance began to slip.

Every American, in every state should make sure their elected school officials are focused on education – not political indoctrination.","Headlines about left-wing college students engaging in radical, sometimes racially charged protests are becoming all too common.

In October 2016, students at University of California, Berkeley created a human chain in an attempt to block white students from going to class.

This past May, students at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington demanded – in the name of racial equity – that white students stay home from school for a day. These students shouted down faculty who disagreed with them, and the dispute led to multiple protests that eventually forced the college to hold its commencement ceremony 30 miles away from campus.

These stories are outrageous, but unfortunately, nothing new. Universities have been a hotbed for left-wing activism for decades. In fact, Ronald Reagan ran for Governor of California in 1966 promising to crack down on the rioting and radicalism at Berkeley.

This sudden decline in performance is what happens when educators think it is their job to impose their political views on students.

A recent story out of Minnesota, however, suggests that the left is now bringing this same radicalism to K-12 public education, and the ones suffering are the young students, who are in their most impressionable years.

Katherine Kersten, founding director and Senior Policy Fellow at the Center of the American Experiment, recently wrote about liberal policy and curriculum changes made by Edina school system officials in Minnesota that are causing the once celebrated school system to slip.

The school system itself adopted a so-called “All for All” policy in 2013 which all students “will acquire an awareness of their own cultural identity and value racial, cultural, and ethnic diversities so as to understand, communicate with, and effectively interact with people across cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds.”

This may sound innocent, even laudable. But the implementation of this policy shows it is merely a thinly veiled attempt to instill radical, left-wing political views in impressionable children.

According to Kersten, grade school-aged students in the Edina system are learning the alphabet by reading a book called A is for Activist.

As the title suggests, it’s a left-wing “ABC” book that teaches children concepts such as C stands for “Creative Counter to Corporate vultures,” “F is for Feminist,” “T is for Trans” – you get the idea.

The book’s own description describes it as being “written and illustrated for the next generation of progressives: families who want their kids to grow up in a space that is unapologetic about activism, environmental justice, civil rights, LGBTQ rights, and everything else that activists believe in and fight for.”

This is pure, unapologetic political indoctrination of American youth. Imagine the outrage among educators if young students were assigned a book designed to create the next generation of conservatives.

The indoctrination continues throughout the student experience in the school system.

An 11th grade U.S. Literature and Composition teacher in the Edina system instructs students in her syllabus that by the end of the school year, they will have, “learned how to apply marxist [sic], feminist, post-colonial, psychoanalytic, reader response, and aesthetic lenses to literature.” Notice the absence of any sort of conservative or traditionalist lens.

A high school in the system offered a course called “Race, Racism, and Whiteness” as an elective during its May term in the 2016-2017 school year. The school system superintendent later denied offering such a course, but the Center of the American Experiment found proof.

When President Trump was elected, Kersten writes that the entire school system went into hysteria. Teachers were openly crying in class the day after the election, and one reportedly told students that “Trump winning is worse than 9/11 and the Columbine shooting.”

Many students who don’t conform to the liberal leanings of the faculty reported being afraid to express their opinions, and after the election, some requested to be picked up early from school for fear of being berated for their views.

Unsurprisingly, when the school system began to focus on left-wing indoctrination and intimidation instead of the fundamentals of education, student performance began to slip.

Citing Minnesota Department of Education statistics, Kersten reported that the percentage of students attending Edina High School who met state standards for reading dropped from 86 percent in 2014 to 79 percent in 2017. In math, 79 percent of Edina high school students were performing at grade level in 2014, while only 66 percent are today.

The high school used to be fifth in the state for reading scores, now it’s 29th. It used to be 10th in math proficiency, now it’s 40th.

Both sides quickly finished their questioning Wednesday of San Francisco Police Officer Raymond Ortiz, who was part of the CSI unit that responded to Pier 14 the night of July 1, 2015, when Steinle was shot and killed in San Francisco.

During his testimony on Tuesday, Ortiz showed jurors video and several pictures showing the entire length of the pier, including the swivel chair the defendant Jose Ines Garcia Zarate was in, the exact spot where Kate was hit, and the location of several witnesses in relation to them.

SFPD Officer Andrew Bryant, who arrested Zarate after the shooting, took the stand next. Bryant told the jury that he noticed the suspect on the scene and when Zarate saw him, his eyes got very big, ""like deer in headlights,"" and quickly walked the other direction.

Bryant said he pulled out his weapon and yelled ""stop,"" but the suspect kept walking. A plainclothed officer appeared and ordered Zarate to the ground, which he obeyed.

He said Zarate was cuffed and searched before being sat in the back of the police car. About 45 minutes later, the suspect's hands were put in bags to protect any gun residue that was potentially on them.

When the defense team cross-examined Bryant, they suggested that perhaps the residue ultimately found on Zarate's hands was actually transferred to him from an officer.

The jury also heard from SFPD Bomb Squad Officer Scott Hurley, who's part of the ""underwater hazards device team"" and recovered the murder weapon from the ocean floor.

None of the victim's family members were seen in court.

On Tuesday, jurors heard from Michelle Lo, a witness to the slaying.

KATE STEINLE TRIAL FEATURES TESTIMONY OF WITNESS TO KILLING BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

Lo said she was on vacation in San Francisco with her family at the time. She remembered a man dressed in black who ""looked like a homeless person"" and was spinning around in a chair ""grinning and laughing"" who made her uncomfortable.

She said she and her family continued along a pier before hearing a ""very sharp scream"" and seeing a woman on the ground. And she said she saw the same man from earlier walking away.

Zarate, 54, admitted shooting Steinle, but says it was an accident.

Steinle's father testified Monday that before she died, she said to him: ""Help me, Dad.""

The prosecution said those were her last words.

While Garcia's immigration status is what brought the case into the national spotlight, jurors will not hear evidence about that, and it will not be a factor in the trial.

Steinle's slaying became a signature issue for Donald Trump as he was running for president. He invoked the slaying in calling for the construction of a wall on the Mexican border and stepping up deportations and cracking down on illegal immigration.

Police in Lincoln County responded to a 911 call around 6pm Saturday and found 10-year-old Austin Almanza dead.

He'd been shot with a broadhead arrow that traveled through his abdomen before hitting his 8-year-old brother, Ayden, in the arm, police say, per the Oklahoman and KFOR.

Ayden was out of a local hospital Sunday, per KOCO, while a 13-year-old boy remains in custody as an investigation continues. Sheriff Charlie Dougherty says the 13-year-old was playing with Austin and Ayden in a treehouse on a vacant lot, as he'd done several times before, when the boys had their alleged disagreement, per KOCO and BuzzFeed News.

The teenager then picked up the crossbow and fired an arrow fitted with a broadhead blade, Dougherty says. ""Austin is not dead because of an accident. He's dead because of an action that took place,"" the sheriff adds.

The identity of the 13-year-old hasn't been released, as he's a minor. Dougherty says charges against him are expected next week. (This man killed his mom and two brothers with a crossbow weeks before his planned wedding.)

Haley, who’s in the middle of a three-country visit in Africa, left the camp as several hundred protesters opposing President Salva Kiir approached, a spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the U.N. told Fox News. The protesters “became upset that [Haley] was not able to meet with them, due to time constraint,” the U.N. told The Associated Press.

Shortly after Haley left the camp, which is meant for homeless and displaced residents, U.N. security guards fired tear gas into the crowd of more than 100 people who looted and destroyed a charity office operating there, an aid worker at the camp said.

Frustration has been growing both inside and outside of South Sudan over the conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people, and created Africa’s largest displacement of civilians since the Rwanda genocide in 1994.

“We are disappointed by what we are seeing. This is not what we thought we were investing it,” Haley said in remarks released later by the U.N. “What we thought we were investing in was a free, fair society where people could be safe and South Sudan is the opposite of that.”

Just before Haley left the camp, residents attempted to hand the ambassador a letter with their position on the “current crisis.” The U.N. said a “petition” was delivered before Haley had left.

Haley is the highest-level U.S. government official to visit South Sudan since President Donald Trump took office in January. The ambassador is in Africa to see the involvement of both the U.S. and the U.N. in Ethiopia, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where she arrived late Wednesday.

President Kiir appealed for the Trump administration to remain engaged with the country during his meeting with Haley.

The United States is South Sudan's largest donor and was instrumental in the country's creation. Since the country gained independence in 2011, the U.S. has given more than $5 billion for humanitarian and development initiatives, according to the U.S. Embassy.

South Sudan plunged into civil war in late 2013, and the country faces mass displacement, starvation and allegations of government corruption and war crimes. More than 2 million people have fled the country.

Rhodes is one of several Obama administration officials tied to the unmasking allegations. Former national security adviser Susan Rice and former ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power also have been questioned for their alleged involvement in requests to identify Americans whose names surfaced in foreign intelligence reporting.

Rhodes was not available for comment after his meeting.

Power spoke to the same committee earlier this month. Sources have told Fox News that Power was unmasking at such a rapid pace in the final months of the Obama administration that she averaged more than one request for every working day in 2016. A Power spokesman, however, called the reports about her intelligence requests “false.”

Former attorney general Loretta Lynch also was interviewed by the committee last week.

And back in September, Rice told congressional investigators that she unmasked Trump associates to learn more about the campaign’s contact with foreign officials.

Lilly Biagini, who had her legs amputated at age 6 due to a joint disorder, was forced to evacuate her Santa Rosa home with her family in the middle of the night.

“Everything is gone,” Biagini said. “My wheelchair. My prosthetics. Everything. I couldn’t believe it. I seriously had no words.”

Biagini was diagnosed with arthrogryposis, which left her with stiff joints that wouldn’t bend from the waist down. She relies on her prosthetics to run track and ride horses, KTVU reported.

Her mother told the news outlet that Biagini’s prosthetics are a part of her identity. On Friday, staff at Hanger Clinic provided and fitted Biagini with new prosthetics free-of-charge.

“She’s just such a beautiful light in this world to start with, and to be able to put that smile back on her face is priceless,” Pola O’Rourke, of the Hanger Clinic, told KTVU.

Biagini, who prefers prosthetics over a wheelchair, said her confidence has returned.

“I don’t feel that confident anymore,” she said, of losing her prosthetics. “But when I got my legs, I got it back immediately. I’m super excited.”

A group of engineers from the 2018 Ford Mustang team did a little after-hours work to develop some new go-fast equipment for the pony car that turned out so good, they convinced management to put it on sale.

The Performance Pack Level 2 will be an add-on to the previously announced Performance Pack (now Level 1), which already includes goodies like larger brakes, a TORSEN limited slip differential and a stiffer chassis than the stock Mustang GT.

Level 2 firms up the chassis even more, lowers the ride height by an inch, swaps in a set of computer-controlled MagneRide dampers, allows quicker steering and features Michelin Sport Cup 2 tires that are 1.5-inches wider than the standard rubber. There are also a deep front splitter and new rear spoiler that improve downforce at speed.

Along with the aerodynamic parts, a unique set of dark, 10-spoke wheels are the most striking visual giveaway for the Level 2 package, so keep an eye out for them if you don’t want to get surprised by one of these special ‘Stangs at the track.

You can confirm your suspicions by looking inside, because the package will only be offered on cars with six-speed manual transmissions, while it ꟷ and all 2018 Mustang GTs ꟷ will be equipped with an updated 5.0-liter V8 that’s gotten a 25 hp bump to 460 hp.

Great stories in this episode include an underage Carly trying out for Dollywood, an exuberant Clayton opening up for Kenny Chesney and a broken-down van that made it to the venue on time with the help of five random cousins in rural West Virginia. As Clayton puts it, ""when you're out on the road, everything is not as glamorous as it seems.""

Both artists sing some of their best, with Carly telling the story behind her big hit ""Every Little Thing"" before sharing a beautiful rendition of the soulful ballad.

The teenager, who loved nothing more than writing and performing her own songs, believed that a radio tour would allow her to follow in the footsteps of her heroes like Patsy Cline, Linda Ronstadt, Martina McBride and all of the other female artists who came before her.

But Armiger told Fox News she would soon learn that the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry came with a hefty price.

Years before pop superstar Taylor Swift was groped by a radio DJ from Denver, Colo., Armiger says she was fending off a different handsy DJ while she was underage.

""I was at a radio station in Texas and was taking a promo photo with one of the on-air DJs after doing my performances and he grabbed my butt during the photo,"" Armiger told us. ""And at the same time he was whispering in my ear, 'When are you going to be legal?'""

Armiger told us she ""was shocked"" and ""terrified"" but had no one to lean on for support.

""I brought up my fears and I was told that's how it was and if I wanted to be in music, I'd have to get over it,"" she said.

Armiger decided to keep her mouth shut after that, but things came to a head in June 2016 when the singer was sued by her record label, Cold River, and filed a counterclaim alleging the label told her to ""sex it up"" in order to become successful.

According to the lawsuit, Armiger said she was asked to ""purchase 'hot, game-changing' clothes,"" ""hug, kiss and flirt"" with radio programmers. Armiger said she was told she needed to make the programmers ""wish you would take them home with you.""

Cold River Record head Pete O'Heeron told Fox News at the time the suit was ""baseless"" and ""an attempt to try and smear good people.""

Armiger said she can't comment on her battle with Cold River after a settlement was made, but said she now wants to share her stories of sexual harassment after hearing the bombshell sexual abuse allegations against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that have rocked Hollywood.

""There's something really horrible going on behind the scenes,"" she told us, saying the country music community has its fair share of Weinstein-like behavior.

The now-26-year-old detailed several other stories of sexual harassment that she's encountered. Armiger recalled taking a radio programmer and his team to lunch when the program director asked everyone to share their ""top five list of women they would want to sleep with.""

After sharing his first choice, Armiger said a radio programmer turned to her, ""looking me in the eyes, he said, 'But you would absolutely be my No. 2.'""

Armiger said he then turned to her guitar player and said, ""Surely you've been f--king her. Where is she on your list?""

The guitar player suggested the group change the subject to something more appropriate, but Armiger said she still ""got flack"" for the exchange.

""The programmer called and said if I ever brought that guitar player back again he'd never play my music again,"" she recalled.

The singer said she was similarly rebuked after a radio DJ was interviewing her about her album ""Confessions of a Nice Girl"" at the 2010 ACM Awards.

""As we were doing the interview, he is trying to feel me up under the table -- this is on air -- trying to ask me whether or not my album title was true because surely I couldn't be a nice girl. I had to be a naughty girl,"" Armiger said.

When the DJ later asked her what her least favorite interview question was, Armiger was ""pissed"" and curtly said, ""The worst question is that you're asking me if I'm a nice girl or a naughty girl because what kind of person asks that?""

She said ""that didn't go over well"" and she learned ""not to talk back"" after that.

When Armiger filed her lawsuit against Cold River, she said many people in the country music world would not work with her anymore.

""When my story first became public and in the aftermath when I was finally to start looking for other opportunities in the industry, we went to [publishing houses] but we would be met with, 'We're not going to sign you, but we're really a big fan and we just want to know your story and how are you?'""

She continued, ""That was the consensus; that was everywhere I went. I would talk to booking agents and they were scared to work with me because they either thought somehow the tour would be canceled or I was a liability to work with.""

Armiger said she does not want to name her harassers out of fear of retribution, but she hopes coming forward with her story of harassment in the country music world will make a difference because ""it has to change.""

""I don't think it will change until people start speaking out, and for the most part they're too scared,"" she told us. ""Look at my story -- they'll see that I spoke out and spoke my truth and thought for the most part people would believe my story. I didn't ever think that it would be met with doubt or disdain.""",Katie Armiger says she was blacklisted from country music after sexual harassment allegations,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/katie-armiger-says-was-blacklisted-from-country-music-after-sexual-harassment-allegations.html

We’ve got good news for you — scientists are working on an injection that blocks your hunger for junk food.

And in doing so it can help you slim down by stopping you from eating as much.

The injection has also been shown to reduce the risk of obesity-related diseases like diabetes in fat monkeys — more good news!

A protein, called GDF15, has been found to naturally regulate body weight in humans and animals.

When it’s injected into mice it made them eat less and lose weight, reports New Scientist.

Several teams have tried to use it as an obesity treatment before but were unsuccessful as the protein broke down too quickly in the body for it to have any effect.

But now a team from pharmaceutical company Amgen has found a way to make it last longer in the body.

They used an antibody and added it to the protein, which made it take longer to break down.

When it was used on obese monkeys it made them eat 40 percent less.

And when given weekly injections they lost an incredible 10 percent of their body fat over a six week period.

They were also more tolerate of glucose, or sugar, which meant their risk of developing type 2 diabetes was reduced.

There are currently five obesity medications that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

These have been found to help patients lose an average of seven to 12 percent of their body weight over the course of a year.

But none have been as successful as the new drug looks like it could be.

Study author Murielle Véniant said the GDF15 hybrid injection did not appear to cause any adverse side effects in monkeys.

Clinical trials will be needed to see how the drug works on people before it is available.

Other studies have found that when injecting the protein into mice it binds to neurons in the stomach and intestines and sends signals to the part of the brain responsible for appetite.

That same part of the brain is responsible for your cravings.

The protein caused mice to keep food in their stomachs for twice as long, making them feel fuller for longer.

“As a result, the North Korean government does everything in its power to squash the spread of Christianity.""
In the summer, we had services in the mountain or by the river.”“The life in North Korea is hell.
“There is an enormous difference between my life in North Korea and my life in the U.S,” he said.
“The life in North Korea is hell … life in America is heaven.”Fox News' Inwook Song contributed to this article.","North Korean Choi Kwanghyuk is one of the lucky ones.

The 55-year-old managed to escape from the work camp where he was sent after being targeted and persecuted by the government for his Christian faith.

“We couldn’t raise our voice during a service, we couldn’t sing out loud during a worship … that was hard,” Choi told Fox News through a translator. “Also, we had to hide so that other people could not see us.”

Despite having to hide his faith in plain sight while living in North Hamgyong province, Choi was still compelled to bring religion to others when he started an underground church.

“There were about nine people,” he said. “I couldn’t do mission work because we had to keep it secret that we had a church.”

“If that information had leaked, we could have faced the death penalty.”

North Korea is officially an atheist state where – except for a “show church” in Pyongyang that tourists are shown -- public worship is forbidden. The country is ranked the most oppressive place for Christians in the world and has had that ignominious status for years, according to Open Doors USA.

“[Choi’s] statements describing oppression, as well as his report of imprisonment for owning a Bible or practicing faith, align with everything we know about North Korea,” Open Doors President David Curry told Fox News. “Rated the worst place for the persecution of Christians, North Korea treats Christians horrendously and registers them as 'enemies of the state' for their faith.”

The totalitarian state forces the estimated 300,000 Christians living there to hide their religious beliefs and fellowship among each other.

“In a nation where the ruling regime demands total control over the general public, anything that challenges the government’s power is seen as a threat, including religion,” Jeff King, president of International Christian Concern, told Fox News. “As a result, the North Korean government does everything in its power to squash the spread of Christianity.""

This leads much of the religious population in North Korea to go underground with their worship, much like Choi and his church were forced to do.

“We had only one Bible,” he said. “North Hamgyong province is very cold. In the winter, we would dig a big hole and store kimchi there. We sometimes had services there. In the summer, we had services in the mountain or by the river.”

“The life in North Korea is hell. The life in America is heaven.” - Choi Kwanghyuk

“I never heard the term ‘underground church’ until I got here [to the U.S.].”

In 2008, North Korean authorities caught up to Choi and arrested him. He was held in prison by the state security department where he says he was interrogated about his faith.

“I was tortured there,” he said. “I kept denying it.”

He said that he was about to be sent to one of North Korea’s brutal labor camps when he was able to break free.

“I decided to escape because I thought that once they sent me to the other camp, they could eventually send me to the concentration camp or kill me,” Choi recalled. “I was traveling back and forth between China and North Korea, but they kept searching for me, and I knew it could put my friends in danger too, so I left.”

The North Korean gulag system is notorious for harsh conditions and brutal treatment of its prisoners.

Choi feared being sent to the most notorious camp within the system -- Camp 22.

Also known as Hoeryong concentration camp, and part of a large system of prison camps throughout the Communist dictatorship, Camp 22 is an 87-square-mile penal colony located in North Hamgyong province where most of the prisoners are people accused of criticizing the government.

Inmates, most of whom are serving life sentences, face harsh and often lethal conditions. According to the testimony of a former guard from Camp 22, prisoners live in bunkhouses with 100 people per room and some 30 percent show the markings of torture and beatings -- torn ears, gouged eyes and faces covered with scars.

“Unfortunately, it is inexplicably easy to wind up in one of these camps. While someone can be sent to one of these camps for openly evangelizing, someone can just as easily be sent there for simply being in contact with a religious person,” said King of the International Christian Concern.

Prisoners are forced to stand on their toes in tanks filled with water up to their noses for 24 hours, stripped and hanged upside-down while being beaten or given the infamous ""pigeon torture” -- where both hands are chained to a wall at a height of 2 feet, forcing them to crouch for hours at a time.

Tiny rations of watery corn porridge leave inmates on the brink of starvation, and many hunt rats, snakes and frogs for protein. Some even take the drastic measure of searching through animal dung for undigested seeds to eat. Beatings are handed out daily for offenses as simple as not bowing down in respect to the guards fast enough. Prisoners are used as practice targets during martial arts training. Guards routinely rape female inmates.

Choi said he finally escaped to neighboring China. While he was figuring out where to go next, he had heard how the general image of North Korean defectors was not positive among those in South Korea.

“So, I applied for asylum in the U.S.,” he told Fox News.

Choi, who was single when he lived in North Korea, was granted asylum in the U.S. in 2013. He first lived in Dallas before eventually moving to Los Angeles where he now lives.

Choi said that as a result of injuries he received while being tortured, he is unable to work but has committed himself to telling the world about the human rights abuses in his native land.

“First of all, every human must have the right to freedom,” he said. “There is no freedom in North Korea. By law, they have the freedom of religion and the freedom of the press, but the reality is very different.”

And despite the hardships he may face, Choi said that life in the U.S. is a vast improvement.

“There is an enormous difference between my life in North Korea and my life in the U.S,” he said.

“The life in North Korea is hell … life in America is heaven.”

Former attorney general Loretta Lynch also was interviewed by the committee last week.

And back in September, Rice told congressional investigators that she unmasked Trump associates to learn more about the campaign’s contact with foreign officials.

Meanwhile, congressional committees continue to probe allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.

Costa noted that Phoenix may be the most prevalent place in the U.S. for UFO sightings, perhaps due to the Phoenix Lights phenomena two decades ago.

In 1997, there were two events that occurred in Phoenix, Arizona, and Sonora, Mexico. Thousands of witnesses say they saw a formation of five lights in a V-shape, producing no sound and a triangular formation of lights. The U.S Air Force claimed the second group of lights were flares dropped from a A-10 Warthog aircraft.

Lind, an actress who starred on the AMC series “Turn: Washington’s Spies,” wrote in an Instagram post that Bush senior “touched me from behind” and then told her a dirty joke during a 2014 promotional event. The post appears to have been deleted on Wednesday.

Bush’s office said in a statement to several media outlets that “President Bush would never — under any circumstance — intentionally cause anyone distress, and he most sincerely apologizes if his attempt at humor offended Ms. Lind.” Reached later on Wednesday morning, Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said after the post was deleted, he was “not sure where things stand.”

Representatives for Lind and AMC did not immediately return requests for comment.

In her Instagram post, Lind used the hashtag “#MeToo,” the social media campaign in which individuals have shared their stories of sexual harassment and assault. She wrote that she decided to open up about the incident because she was “disturbed today by a photo I saw of President Barack Obama shaking hands with George H.W. Bush in a gathering of ex-presidents organizing aid to states and territories damaged by recent hurricanes.”

In the Instagram caption, Lind said she was with cast members about to do a photo shoot with Bush when the incident occurred.

“He didn’t shake my hand,” she wrote. “He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side. He told me a dirty joke. And then, all the while being photographed, touched me again.

The judge on Tuesday ruled the woman, known as S.A., was incapable of making her own decisions and gave her parents the power to make medical decisions on her behalf. Her lawyer had argued that she wanted to make her own decisions and that she can manage her eating disorder on her own.

Superior Court Judge Paul Armstrong found that her physicians have determined she does not understand the risks to her life by not eating and she has a chance of recovery through her parents' guardianship.

The Parsippany resident weighed 60 pounds in June when she was taken to a clinic in Princeton and has since gained 15 pounds.

Her mother told the Daily Record of Parsippany the case makes other parents hopeful.

The ruling follows the February death of a 30-year-old Morris County woman who successfully fought force-feeding. Her parents and doctors supported a ruling, also handed down by Armstrong, that allowed her to refuse a feeding tube. Court documents indicate that she had undergone a decade of unsuccessful treatment and had suffered organ damage. Her parents wanted her to continue treatment but also wanted to respect her wishes.

In S.A.'s case, Armstrong cited the Journal of Psychiatric Practice, which argues that compulsory feeding can be effective in the early stages of anorexia, before organ failure.

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

Temperatures across Southern California are expected to top 100 degrees during the next few days as part of a late October heatwave.

The National Weather Service warned of dangerous heat Tuesday and Wednesday, with highs predicted to reach 95 to 105 degrees in many areas, coupled with hot, gusty Santa Ana winds that could reach 60 mph at times.

Despite the heat, Kershaw warmed up wearing his Dodgers jacket. Fewer fans than usual watched the team take batting practice from the exposed outfield pavilion seats, while others sought any shade they could find.

""They're from Houston, I'm from Texas, it's going to be hot for everybody,'' Kershaw said when asked about the heat. ""We're all used to it. It will be fine.''

AT LONG LAST, KERSHAW TO PITCH IN WORLD SERIES

Elsewhere in the region, Downtown Los Angeles passed its 108-year-old record of 99 degrees for the date before midday Tuesday.

Even proximity to the ocean was no relief, as surfing mecca Huntington Beach also reached 103.



The Los Angeles Fire Department declared its first citywide Red Flag Alert since May 2014, banning vehicles from being parked on roads in areas designated as very high fire hazard zones for at least 24 hours starting at 8 a.m. Tuesday.

""These are narrow streets with hairpin turns, areas that would essentially create a chokepoint if a car was parked there while people were trying to evacuate out and a fire apparatus is trying to get into those areas to extinguish a fire,"" Captain Erik Scott with the LAFD told FOX 11.

Southern California fire agencies put extra firefighters on duty. Rangers patrolling the Santa Monica Mountains were on the lookout for signs of fire or risks such as people smoking in the sprawling area covered with dangerously flammable dry grass.

Andrew Jackson’s leadership proved to be exactly what the fledgling United States needed as it battled enemies coming from all sides in the War of 1812, culminating with his role at the decisive Battle of New Orleans. We get a peek at his leadership style here:

His next venture into public service would suit him better: thanks to his strong relationships and sound political instincts, he was elected major general of the Tennessee militia, in February 1802. Maintained by the state, not the federal government, the militia was provisioned by local men who supplied their own weapons and uniforms and served short contracts of a few months’ duration.

Leading the militia was a good fit for Jackson’s style, because it gave him the chance to serve the people he loved with the freedom he needed and the challenge he craved. General Jackson repeatedly won reelection as well as the deep loyalty of his men. They liked what he said. He was often outspoken, and many shared his uncompromising views on defending settlers’ rights. With rumors of war, he was ready to defend his people and was just the man to rally westerners to the cause of American liberty.

“Citizens!” he wrote in a broadside. “Your government has at last yielded to the impulse of a nation. . . . Are we the titled slaves of George the Third? The military conscripts of Napoleon the great? Or the frozen peasants of the Russian czar? No -- we are the free-born sons of America; the citizens of the only republic now existing in the world.”

Jackson understood the stakes of the war, and he recognized the strategy as only a westerner could. Of critical importance to victory in the West was a port city near the Gulf Coast. As Jackson would soon say to his troops, in the autumn of 1812, “Every man of the western country turns his eyes intuitively upon the mouth of the Mississippi.” Together, he observed, “[we are] committed by nature herself [to] the defense of the lower Mississippi and the city of New Orleans.”

The FBI released sketches of two women Papini said abducted her on Nov. 2, 2016 while she was out for a run near her home.

The first woman was described by Papini as Hispanic, between 20 and 30 years old, about 5 feet 5 inches tall, with coarse, curly dark hair, thin eyebrows and pierced ears, FBI officials said.

Papini also told investigators the women were driving a dark-colored SUV with a ""large rear side window.""

""Sherri continues to look at photographs of various makes and models of SUV’s in an effort to provide a more detailed description,"" the sheriff's office said.

In addition to the details on the suspects, the sheriff's office gave additional details on Papini's physical condition when she was found on the side of Interstate 5 on Thanksgiving, 140 miles away from her home.

Authorities said they conducted a polygraph exam of Keith and ""excluded him from involvement"" in his wife's disappearance.

""Keith and Sherri Papini have remained in contact with the Sheriff’s Office and the FBI,"" the sheriff's office said. ""Sherri, continues to provide details as she can recall them, but has not been able to provide a complete detailed statement due to her poor recollection.""

Papini and her husband are believed to still live in Redding, Calif.

Days before Papini's disappearance, police said she was texting with a man in Michigan, and the two tried to meet up while he was in California. Investigators later interviewed the man, and determined he was not involved in Papini's disappearance.

Officials said they have received over 600 tips from around the world as part of their investigation, and continue to review all tips they receive.

A $10,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the identification of the two women.

The Jewish community in Turkey is now fewer than 17,000 people.","In Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s post-coup purge of any entity deemed to have the slightest opposition to his authoritarian rule, he’s closed down 187 media outlets under the guise of being Gülenist – a synonym for any Turk not fawning at the feet of his Justice and Development Party (AKP).

But even before summer 2016’s short-lived coup, the Turkish president was embarking on a war against free speech. Bugün TV, which was stormed on a live broadcast two years ago by government forces unleashing tear gas, water cannons and gate cutters, was seized by the regime “to prevent crime.”

After the coup attempt, confiscated media outlets went on sale. The state-run Savings Deposit Insurance Fund found a buyer for the TV station: the killer of a Jewish businessman.

Sancaktar Media owner Burhanettin Türkeş was convicted in the 1995 murder of Nesim Malki, who was shot while driving in the northwestern city of Bursa. Türkeş was sent to prison in 2004 and released five years later.

Now, Türkeş is promising to tow the Erdoğan line in Bugün TV’s programming.

In July, protesters threw rocks at the Neve Shalom synagogue in Istanbul and kicked the doors in a fit of, as many anti-Semities call it, anti-Israel sentiment.

It’s not a surprising turn of events under a regime where anti-Semitism is a feature, not a bug, and the Gülen boogeyman meme takes on shades of “must be the Jews” as well. Pro-Erdoğan media have claimed that exiled cleric Fethullah Gülen must have Jewish lineage, thereby putting Jews at the center of the supposed coup plot.

“Fethullah Gülen is sharp witted. He quickly smells of money and power. Because he is a Jew. That’s the reason he loves Israel almost to the point of sickness,” Sabah columnist Ersin Ramoğlu wrote in December. “…Where his cunning comes from, why the CIA has gotten hold of him and his love of Israel can be understood from the family of this clown.”

Forestry Minister Veysel Eroğlu, in a December parliament speech, predicted Gülen would die in the U.S., where he has lived in self-imposed exile since 1999, “and he will be buried in a cemetery with Jews.” The party refrain on Erdoğan’s top foe is that traitor must equal Jew.

For more rank anti-Semitism, see the “not in my backyard” stunt: Before Kurdistan’s independence referendum at the end of September, pro-Erdoğan media frothed at the mouth spreading Jews-at-the-border fake news that KRG President Mahmoud Barzani planned to flood a new Kurdish state with 200,000 Israelis. That whipped up an ultra-nationalist protest that forced the evacuation of the Israeli Embassy in Ankara.

Pro-Erdoğan media breathlessly carry the president’s Rosh Hashanah best-wishes statements, but consider that Iran’s regime issues those empty felicitations as well. Propaganda and policy speak loudest. Turkey praised the reconciliation of Hamas and Fatah this month, with Erdoğan spokesman Ibrahim Kalın declaring, “Israel should end its siege on Palestinian lands and avoid any movement that would harm the reconciliation process.” On a delegation to Tehran, Hamas deputy chief Salah al-Arouri confirmed, “We’re not in the stage of recognition [of Israel]; rather we are now in the stage of preparing to eliminate the Zionist entity.”

Erdoğan has accused the Jewish state of ""keeping Hitler's spirit alive.” In May, the president said of Israel, “They feel they are immune to any punishment for their crimes, but the international community needs to stand up against them.”

In July, protesters threw rocks at the Neve Shalom synagogue in Istanbul and kicked the doors in a fit of, as many anti-Semities call it, anti-Israel sentiment.

The Jewish community in Turkey is now fewer than 17,000 people. As Erdoğan pushes Islamism into Ataturk’s secular republic, as he holds onto power with a white-knuckle grip, as he arrests 60,000 Turks for perceived threats to his power and accuses them of all being magically woven into a Gülenist ouster plot – and his acolytes dutifully tie Gülen to Jews – the community has much to be nervous about.","Anti-Semitism in Erdogan’s Turkey is a feature, not a bug",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/25/anti-semitism-in-erdogan-s-turkey-is-feature-not-bug.html

In the letter, however, Española hints that she would be willing go on display “for a limited period of time” if the conditions were right.
But she’s hoping that with LACMA opening a show on 18th-century artwork next month, Española’s owner might reach out again.","A painting by famed 18th century Mexican artist Miguel Cabrera – long believed lost to history - may have been hanging in obscurity on the wall of a Los Angeles home for the last 60 years.

The artwork, nicknamed “Española,” is the only missing piece from the 16 Cabrera did in a series of casta, or caste, paintings. The painting's location remained a mystery for decades, until two years ago, when Ilona Katzew, the curator of Latin American art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, received a cryptic letter written in the voice of the little girl featured in the artwork.

“You should know that I am well and living less than two (2) miles from LACMA,” Española wrote in the letter to Katzew, the Los Angeles Times reported. “I have been in the same family for I believe 60 years, although I do not know how I was acquired.”

Since opening the letter, Katzew has puzzled over where in that two mile radius “Española” is hiding, but clues to the painting’s whereabouts are few and far between.

The three-paragraph letter gave no more indication of the painting’s location or means of contacting the owner. The mailing label was trimmed down to remove any information about its origin. The postage was a pair of 37-cent stamps – retired a decade before the letter was sent – and a commemorative stamp honoring writer Jack London that was issued in 1988.

Five photos of the painting – the only ones known to exist of the work - were also included with the letter, but the only information that Katzew was able to glean from them was that the artwork was in a modern frame and that it was apparently hanging high on a wall.

In the letter, however, Española hints that she would be willing go on display “for a limited period of time” if the conditions were right.

“If you ever gather a reunion of all my siblings, I would welcome the opportunity to be on display for a limited period of time,” the letter noted. “I am not lost, I just do not wish to be found.”

The 16 paintings in Cabrera’s casta series – an art style that explored interracial marriages and children in the Spain’s New World colonies – were purportedly sent to Spain from Mexico shortly after the artist’s death and displayed in the home of the Viceroy of New Spain, Joaquin de Montserrat.

In 2015, 14 of the painting were housed in museums across the U.S., Spain and Mexico. The most recently discovered one – a painting of a Spanish father, his half-Spanish, half-African wife, and their albino baby – was found under a couch in a northern California home and quickly obtained by LACMA.

“My owner has enjoyed seeing #6,” Española’s letter said in reference to the most recently acquired painting, “and I am pleased that we are all now accounted for despite the diaspora.”

But it’s been two years since the most recent Cabrera was acquired – and since Española’s letter – and Katzew hasn’t had any other contact with the painting’s owner. But she’s hoping that with LACMA opening a show on 18th-century artwork next month, Española’s owner might reach out again.",Cryptic letter taunts museum curator looking for missing masterpiece,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/23/cryptic-letter-taunts-museum-curator-looking-for-missing-masterpiece.html

The Centers for Disease Control estimates that more than 513,000 women and girls are at risk of FGM in the U.S. Although this hideous practice has been outlawed under federal law since 1996, the first federal prosecution of a Michigan female doctor who is charged with performing this barbaric procedure on little girls is taking place right now in Detroit.

The linguistic lies are already underway by the defense team and FGM supporters. This brutal procedure performed on young girls from the ages 5 to12, known as clitoridectomy, consists of partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or its prepuce—the least drastic of four types of FGM—for purposes of ensuring “purity” and the inability to enjoy sexual pleasure throughout her adult life. The defense lawyer of Dr. Jamana Nagarwala, the doctor charged in Michigan, has described the procedure as benign and merely removing a mucous membrane. Sounds inconsequential and genteel, but it’s certainly not.

Former United Nations consultant Fuambai Ahmadu appeared recently on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” and downplayed the procedure as a mere “nick” of the clitoris and equated it to nothing more than “female circumcision.” See how cleverly the egalitarian language of the Left is used to obscure the brutality of this procedure?

These linguistic terms for the horrific mutilation of girl’s genitals demonstrate the verbal jujitsu employed to mask the brutal and barbaric physical assault on an unsuspecting, innocent little girls. Be prepared for more.

These linguistic terms for the horrific mutilation of girl’s genitals demonstrate the verbal jujitsu employed to mask the brutal and barbaric physical assault on an unsuspecting, innocent little girls. Be prepared for more.

The ugly truth of this ancient religious and cultural practice must be brought to light by those who examine these victims, as well as the FGM victims themselves. One of the foremost heroic advocates against FGM is Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the prominent international human rights advocate who underwent this procedure as a little girl in Somali. Ms. Hirsi powerfully and passionately describes FGM as a “sexual assault” upon her innocent body. She forcefully counteracts the silence and equivocation of FGM advocates by stating that “the aim of FGM in all its forms is to control female sexuality. The clitoris is removed to take physical pleasure from sex and reduce the libido.”

Conversely, Ms. Ahmadu of the UN also claimed on Fox that the indicted Michigan doctor, who is accused of mutilating two young girls, only performed a “nick” on the girls and that the victims weren’t actually mutilated. Only a nick?

The forensic doctors who examined Dr. Nagarwala’s 7-year-old victims provided preliminary findings to the FBI which found that one girl’s “genitals are not normal in appearance. Her labia minor has been altered or removed, and her clitoral hood is also abnormal in appearance and observed some scar tissue and small healing lacerations.” The second child told the forensic doctor that she could barely walk and that she felt pain all the way down to her ankle. The examining doctor made preliminary findings that the second girl’s “clitoral hood has a small incision, and there is a small tear in her labia minora.” Hardly just an inconsequential nick.

As an attorney in the child welfare system where every imaginable child abuse injury crossed my desk, the genital mutilation and physical abuse inflicted on Dr. Nagarwala’s victims would be evidence that the defendant engaged in “torture” and “sexual penetration with a foreign object” under most state child welfare laws. Torture is not a mere nicking.

Beware of the minimizing, renaming and rationalizing of FGM to disguise the heinousness of female genital mutilation. The Michigan defense team will employ every tactic to normalize and obscure the reality of this brutality. Be prepared for a campaign to rename the procedure so mutilation disappears from its name.

FGM defenders, like Fuambai Ahmadu, downplay the horrific procedure as a mere nicks and demand a linguistic renaming FGM as “inclusive gender surgeries” or “gender inclusive genital surgeries.” Incredibly, she attempts to elevate FGM as a human right, by insisting, “in our culture, we don’t discriminate, we have gender-egalitarian surgeries. We do not discriminate.”

Oxenberg explained that in 2011 the mother-daughter duo decided to sign up for a class targeted at helping gain self-esteem called Nxivm.

The official website for the organization describes itself as ""the turning point — a remarkable development in scientific and psychodynamic understanding, education and technology that can facilitate this transition so the pattern of humanity's rises and falls can actually be broken and transformed.

""We find ourselves on this Earth with the resources, intellect and creativity that can generate abundance for everyone — or destroy all that we have created. NXIVM represents the change humanity needs in order to alter the course of history.""

Oxenberg said her daughter was ""the sweetest, most nonconfrontational, easiest child of all my children.” She said India became immersed in the organization quickly and donated the majority of her inheritance to it.

Former member Bonnie Piesse warned Oxenberg, telling her that India was a part of the ""secret sisterhood"" and that she should do something about it. ""You need to save India,” she told Oxenberg.

According to SF Gate, a complaint filed by former member Sarah Edmondson about NXIVM claimed ""participants were required to provide some sort of damaging collateral such as a nude photo or a dark revelation from their past, in order to become part of the club.""

Additionally, Edmonson claims that the she was given a ""tattoo"" that she was told symbolized the elements.

On October 5th of 2010, Republicans in Congress demanded that the Obama Administration review the Rosatom deal more closely, citing a host of national security issues.","You may have heard of the scandal brewing in Washington. Presidential advisers cutting sweetheart deals with a foreign power, signing million dollar lobbying contracts with that foreign power, bribes being proffered, and the foreign government gained unprecedented access to government agencies and crucial U.S. natural resources? And what if I told you that foreign power was Russia?

Collusion you say? Perhaps. Collusion with Trump? Nope.

I’m talking about a news story that fittingly is coming back from the dead just before Halloween to scare a lot of Democrats, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Obama administration officials. If you want to take a deeper dive on this issue, read the book ""Clinton Cash,"" by Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute. But here are the basics.

A decade ago, a long-time Clinton Foundation donor, Frank Giustra, sold his uranium company to another firm, Uranium One. With that deal, Uranium One now owned uranium mines in the western U.S., including Wyoming, with about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity, and about ten percent of the actual uranium mined in the U.S.

In 2009, Rosatom, Russia’s nuclear agency, took a 17-percent position in Uranium One. A year later, in the summer of 2010, Rosatom bought majority control of the Uranium One, effectively giving the Russian government-controlled entity proprietary access to one-fifth of the U.S. uranium supply.

Consider this: Russia got its generous foothold in the U.S. uranium market in less time than it takes most 16-year-olds to get a driver’s license.

All of this was taking place after years of what could best be categorized as challenging times in U.S.-Russia relations, as Russia attempted to annex Georgia, intimidated Ukraine and threatened the former-captive nations of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia with short-range nuclear weapons. In short, Russia was doing nothing that would indicate it was a country unwilling to build and potentially use nuclear weapons; the signs of aggression were everywhere.

Now there is a process that the U.S. government uses to ensure that any business deal that may include significant national security issues is given serious, in-depth and careful review and approval. That review is run through the Treasury Department’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CIFIUS), which includes representatives from Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Justice, and State, as well as the U.S. trade representative and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and National Security Council. In addition, the director of national intelligence also has input to the review.

CIFIUS and Congressional reviews killed deals like the Rosatom purchase before. In 2006 it helped kill the deal by a Dubai owned company to buy U.S. ports, in part because of the national security risks it presented, and it killed multiple deals with Chinese companies as well in 2009 and 2010. Yet, between the first week of August 2010 and October 22, 2010, the Obama Administration in expedited time approved the sale of crucial national security resources to Russia by rubber stamping the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom. In 2015, Senator Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, noted the expedited time of the deal's approval in a letter to then Attorney General Loretta Lynch, calling it a deal that was ""apparently approved in record speed.""

According to most law firms that deal in such matters, CIFIUS reviews involving sensitive national security matters can take up to 120 days. The Rosatom deal took fewer than 90 days. More outrageous: it appears there were no Congressional oversight hearings. Even more outrageous – and puzzling – members of the CIFIUS review board were aware of attempts by Russian government efforts to bribe U.S.-based executives in the U.S. uranium industry at the time this deal was being approved.

This wasn’t simply your typical Clinton back room deal. This was a deal that was reviewed by virtually every senior Obama administration official, many of whom were aware of the Clinton connection, the FBI bribery investigation, and Rosatom’s history.

On October 5th of 2010, Republicans in Congress demanded that the Obama Administration review the Rosatom deal more closely, citing a host of national security issues. For example, one rationale cited by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for approving the deal was that Rosatom did not have an export license to sell or ship the U.S. uranium overseas. But as the Congressional letter noted, Russia’s government-controlled nuclear companies had been sanctioned numerous times for breaking uranium import-export deals, particularly to the countries they aid in building nuclear capacity, such as Iran (yes, Rosatom helped build the Iranian Bushere nuclear plant and trained Iranian nuclear scientists). To paraphrase a pop culture reference Vladamir Putin would appreciate: “An export license? Russia doesn’t need a stinkin’ export license!”

Consider this: Russia got its generous foothold in the U.S. uranium market in less time than it takes most 16-year-olds to get a driver’s license. Russia got its deal moved through the Obama Administration faster than it took the Obama Administration Department of Justice’s Anti-Trust Division to approve any of the mergers of two U.S. companies it reviewed.

How is that possible? Clearly there were motivated folks to get the deal done. One of those was clearly Hillary Clinton, whose family foundation raked in millions from donors with ties to Russia, as well as the uranium industry. Some media outlets have pointed out that the total take for the foundation may have been as “little” as $4 million. But for a cash-starved foundation that can’t even afford to give back $250,000 from serial sex-offender Harvey Weinstein, $4 million is a decent cash reserve.

But let’s be clear, this wasn’t simply your typical Clinton back room deal. This was a deal that was reviewed by virtually every senior Obama administration official, many of whom were aware of the Clinton connection, the FBI bribery investigation, and Rosatom’s history. And let's not forget either: controlling the global supply chain is the very obvious goal of Putin's. To make matters worse, President Barack Obama reviewed the case.

Why would such a deal go through? Sometimes the easiest explanation is the right one: maybe it was nothing more than a payback to Democrat and Clinton donors. When nothing makes sense in Washington D.C., just follow the money.

While this scandal's original focus was on Uranium One and the Clinton Foundation, it goes far deeper into a Democratic administration than anyone within the party wants to admit. Which is perhaps why President Obama seemed less than excited about pushing the Trump-Russia collusion narrative. Perhaps in a rare moment of self-recollection and awareness, he realized that eventually the breadth of this story would end up exactly where we are today, with all eyes looking at Obama's appointees, wondering why they sold America’s national security for the uranium-market equivalent of 30 pieces of silver.",Hillary Clinton and the real Russian collusion,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/25/hillary-clinton-and-real-russian-collusion.html

Bowe Bergdahl.

Bergdahl, who had walked away from his unit, was held captive by the Taliban for five years.

The wounded SEAL, retired Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer James Hatch, entered the courtroom for Bergdahl’s sentencing hearing with a limp and a service dog named Mina. Bergdahl pleaded guilty last week to desertion and endangering his comrades. He could face life in prison.

Hatch told the court at Fort Bragg, N.C., that when he was assigned the mission to find Bergdahl he thought “someone is going to get killed trying to rescue him,” but pushed on anyways because Bergdahl “was an American"" and had a mom.

Hatch was largely stoic and spoke in measured tones -- except when he talked about the slain military dog.

""His name was Remco,"" Hatch said as his voice cracked, recalling the moments before the dog was blasted in the head and killed.

""Take your time,"" said the prosecutor, Army Maj. Justin Oshana.

ARMY SGT. BOWE BERGDAHL: WHO IS HE?

Remco was leading them through a field when the dog located two enemy fighters the team had seen at a distance. Hatch said the fighters sprayed AK-47 bullets at them, killing the dog. Hatch was hit in the leg.

""I screamed a lot. It hurt really bad...I thought I was dead,"" he said.

Hatch said his unit was rescued, but medics had to kill two Afghans before taking off in the helicopter. Remco was brought on board and staff tried to resuscitate him, but it failed -- the dog’s jaw was blown off.

Photos of Hatch’s injuries and a vest that Remco was wearing that medics had to cut off were shown in the courtroom.

Hatch said the dog helped protect his team by locating enemy fighters after the SEALs lost sight of them in a chaotic situation.

He added his team's helicopters came under fire as they landed in an area near the Pakistan border where they had information on Bergdahl's possible whereabouts. He said the mission was hastily planned, and their only objective was the Bergdahl search.

Hatch said he believes he would have died if a comrade hadn't quickly applied a tourniquet. Hatch has subsequently had 18 surgeries.

BERGDAHL PLEADS GUILTY IN DESERTION CASE

He now runs a nonprofit dedicated to the care and support of military and law enforcement dogs.

Another witness, Capt. John Billings, told the court Wednesday that Bergdahl was one of his soldiers and they decided to rescue him because they wanted “to bring Bowe home….we leave no man behind.”

Billings, a platoon leader, described difficult conditions while searching for Bergdahl, as his patrol developed dysentery while trudging about in 100-degree temperatures with little sleep or water.

As the hearing got underway, an Army judge also said he was still considering a motion by the defense to dismiss the case. The defense has argued that President Trump's comments about Bergdahl prevent Bergdahl from having a fair sentencing hearing.

The judge, Army Col. Jeffery Nance said Monday he would be fair and hasn't been influenced by Trump, but that he does have concerns that the president's comments are affecting public perceptions.

While campaigning for president, Trump repeatedly called Bergdahl a traitor and suggested he be shot or thrown from a plane without a parachute. Nance ruled in February those comments didn't constitute unlawful command influence, noting that Trump was a civilian candidate for president at the time. The defense argued that Trump revived his campaign comments the day of Bergdahl's plea hearing, by saying at a news conference that he thinks people are aware of what he said before.

Prosecutors are expected to call more witnesses in the afternoon to discuss the search missions and resulting wounds to multiple soldiers. Nance ruled those injuries would not have happened had Bergdahl, 31, not endangered his comrades in 2009 by walking away from his post.

Prosecutors made no deal to cap Bergdahl's punishment, so the judge has wide leeway to decide his sentence. Several more days of testimony are expected.

Bergdahl has said he was caged, kept in darkness and beaten, and that he tried to escape more than a dozen times before President Barack Obama brought Bergdahl home in 2014 in a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.

A planetary scientist from Colorado’s Southwest Research Institute believes he might have the answer, and it’s literally chilling.

Speaking at a meeting of the American Astronomy Society Division for Planetary Sciences Division, Alan Stern proposed an incredible answer to the question which has long puzzled astronomers and first contact hopefuls: aliens aren’t living outside.

It sounds like total bunk to us since humans are spread across just about every nook and cranny of planet Earth, but there’s a very real possibility that life could form, evolve, and even gain advanced intelligence without ever seeing the surface of their own planet. This would be most likely on frigid ocean worlds where underwater thermal vents would provide the heat energy to sustain life, and with the sheer number of frigid ocean worlds we already know exist, there’s no shortage of opportunities for this to happen.

If an intelligent alien civilization evolved in the depths of an icy ocean world, it would be incredibly difficult for humanity to detect it, and even harder for them to contact us. In fact, even venturing to the surface of their own planet would be an incredibly difficult task, and as Stern notes, doing so would essentially be the equivalent of mankind venturing into space — a mysterious, frigid, and dangerous place.

It’s obviously very difficult for us to imagine an entire civilization of intelligent creatures living deep within the ocean, but our understanding of the requirements for life mean that it’s entirely possible. The only question is whether or not it exists somewhere out there in the vast number of unexplored worlds.",Scientist proposes wild explanation for why we haven't discovered aliens yet,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2017/10/25/scientist-proposes-wild-explanation-for-why-havent-discovered-aliens-yet.html

It will be the 104-win Los Angeles Dodgers against the 101-win Houston Astros, just the eighth time in baseball history -- and first since 1970 -- that the two teams playing for the championship hit triple-digit victories. And with temperatures in Los Angeles expected to soar to the 100-degree mark, the heat will be on in more ways than one.

The Astros and Dodgers were National League West rivals as late as 1993, and Houston only moved into the American League in 2013. The clubs staged an epic playoff series in 1981 when the likes of Nolan Ryan and Fernando Valenzuela were leading the charge.

On Tuesday, it will be another classic duel in Astros-Dodgers history as Houston's Dallas Keuchel will face Los Angeles' Clayton Kershaw in Game 1. Both left-handers are former Cy Young Award winners.

""They're a great team,"" Kershaw said about the Astros on Monday. ""Their whole lineup is really solid. You saw that all year. They won 100 games for a reason. It starts with (Jose) Altuve and (Carlos) Correa in the middle of that lineup. They're both exceptional baseball players. Really all the way down (the lineup), they have a lot of guys that swing the bats well.""

Although he sounded choked up on multiple occasions after the Dodgers advanced to the World Series with a victory over the Chicago Cubs in Game 5 of the National League Championship Series, Kershaw says he is locked in now that Los Angeles finally learned its opponent late Saturday night.

And while an emotional release before the World Series might sound a bit premature, remember that for all of Kershaw's regular-season greatness, his MVP and three Cy Young Awards, he is also known for his less-than-commanding postseason results: 6-7 with a 4.40 ERA.

Some of Kershaw's postseason struggles have been because of short rest between outings. After starting the Dodgers' NLCS clincher at Wrigley Field last week, he will pitch on regular rest in Game 1.

Keuchel has shown a far better playoff acumen, going 4-1 over his six postseason appearances with a 2.59 ERA, although it has come in over a third fewer games than Kershaw. Keuchel went 1-1 in the just-concluded AL Championship Series against the New York Yankees, posting a 3.09 ERA while striking out 18 batters and walking just two in 11 2/3 innings.

""They'll be the deepest team that we've played, hands down, and my job is to go out there and get the job done,"" Keuchel said. ""But obviously (Justin) Turner is killing it right now, and (Yasiel) Puig always presents a challenge. He likes to swing the bat. And if you don't make quality pitches, he'll make you pay. But you could talk about Chris Taylor, you could talk about (Enrique) Hernandez, who used to be with us. Logan Forsythe, who I went to college with. Top to bottom, you could talk about everybody.""

A season ago, Keuchel would have salivated at the chance to face the Dodgers' lineup. Los Angeles was historically bad against left-handed pitching, yet still managed to worm its way into the NLCS. This year, the Dodgers' offense has been transformed.

Turner has been worth every penny of his newly minted four-year, $64 million deal, while Puig might be playing his best baseball since his splashy debut in 2013. Taylor, who struggled to move past Triple-A in the Seattle Mariners' organization, has transformed himself into a leadoff man with power, while rookie Cody Bellinger was a huge reason the Dodgers went on a 44-7 stretch in the middle of the season.

And then there is reigning NL Rookie of the Year Corey Seager, who will be added to the active roster despite missing the NLCS because of a back injury. Seager and his sweet lefty swing might be reduced to designated hitter duties when the series shifts to Houston on Friday.

""We're not going to concede anything because we've got a pretty good team on our own side,"" said Astros manager A.J. Hinch, who announced that Jake Marisnick (thumb) would not be on the World Series roster.

""(We have) a lot of respect for (Dodgers manager) Dave (Roberts) and the guys that are across the way, Clayton Kershaw, all the way through their entire roster. They didn't sneak up on anybody this year. There were some crazy performances out of them, but we'll compete with them. We'll do our best.""

The Astros, meanwhile, might be as balanced as teams get when considering pitching, offense, baserunning and defense. They are tied for the lead among all playoff teams with 89 hits over 11 games while striking out 6.8 times per game. The Dodgers have 73 hits in eight games, striking out 8.5 times per game.

Altuve leads the charge for the Astros, batting .400 this postseason with a .500 on-base percentage while hitting five home runs and collecting eight walks. First baseman Yuli Gurriel might not have any postseason home runs, but he is hitting the ball as hard as anybody and has posted a .366 postseason batting average with a .409 OBP.

Add Correa's nine RBIs and George Springer's 10 hits, and the Astros are showing offensive balance in October.

Yet the talk before the series began was the Dodgers facing Keuchel in Game 1, followed by Justin Verlander in Game 2. Verlander will pitch opposite Dodgers lefty Rich Hill.

""It's going to be a great series, but looking at the 1-2 (in the rotation) that they're running out at you, you know you've got to beat them a couple of times in a long series,"" Roberts said. ""It's going to be a fun series.""",World Series stage set with epic matchup,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/24/world-series-stage-set-with-epic-matchup.html

A box made from a tree stump on which Abraham Lincoln purportedly gave one of his earliest political speeches was given to the Rochester Historical Preservation Society last week, the (Springfield) State Journal-Register reports.

Lincoln delivered a speech in the town in 1832, when he campaigned for the state House, according to the newspaper.

Terry Campbell of Green City, Missouri, gave the box to the society Friday on behalf of the Campbell family, the State Journal-Register said. The land where Lincoln spoke reportedly has been in the family for more than 130 years.

Campbell inherited the box after his father, Bill Campbell, died several years ago. They’d discussed donating it.

“He told me about the box and that Lincoln had stood on this stump to give his first political speech, and when he got done, members of the family cut the stump down and then built boards out of it to build a box,” Terry Campbell told the newspaper. “There were actually two boxes made out of the stump, both of them alike, and (my dad) had the one.”

The society’s president, John Runions, told the Journal-Register that the box is “a great link” to Lincoln for the small community outside the state capitol of Springfield.

“Once I got it, I knew what it was, and my dad was the same way,” Terry Campbell said of the object. “He didn’t use it for anything. He kept it on a shelf. We knew what it was and that was just kind of a heirloom that sat there and we looked at it.”

Maulsby and online commenters contend that a song about workers happily picking cotton is a racist reference to black slaves toiling in the fields of the South.

Springfield Schools Superintendent Matt Geha said the song came from a book of American folk music, adding that he hadn't received any calls on Friday, but was aware of the complaints circulating on social media.

“I know that timing can sound bad, but it's a historical component for what the choir department had to use for their curriculum,” Geha said.

The short song includes the lyrics: “Cotton needs pickin' so bad, we're going'na pick all over this field.”

Maulsby told The Blade the performance came “a little bit too close” to when a racial slur was “being used directly across the street in the parking lot.”

Earlier this month, about a dozen male students affiliated with a Christian youth organization called Young Life recorded themselves with a Confederate flag during what has been described as a rally. Some images of the rally posted on Snapchat reportedly included racial slurs.

The actor, best known for his starring role on the TV series ""Hercules,"" said on Adam Carolla's podcast Tuesday that the deceased designer sexually harassed him when Sorbo was working as a model in the early '90s.

Versace was shot to death in his Miami Beach home in 1997.

""I’ve got my sexual harassment story,"" Sorbo said. ""[Versace] wanted to meet me because of my height. At 6-foot, 3-inches, he wanted me to do fashion shows with these 6-foot tall women.""

Sorbo said he was invited to dinner parties with the fashion designer and one time when he showed up to dine, no one except for Versace was there.

""All of a sudden, his hand goes up my leg,"" Sorbo recalled. ""[I told him], 'Dude, you know I’m straight?'""

“This is why I like you. You’re not a girly man. You are a man’s man,” Sorbo said Versace told him.

“In life, you must f--k everything. You must do the dog, and the cat, and the boy, and the girl,"" Sorbo quoted Versace as saying.

The actor said after that, Versace still booked him for his fashion shows but he never gave the actor a full campaign like he had said.

Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it.
Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do.
But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","I sat on a parenting panel last month with a well-known and widely respected counselor by the name of Sissy Goff, M.Ed, LPC-MHSP. She is the Director of Child & Adolescent Counseling at Daystar in Nashville and when asked about the biggest issue facing kids today, she confirmed what you’ve probably read about recently on your news feed or even your Facebook feed – the increasing anxiety epidemic in our country.

But it’s not just an epidemic among our kids. It’s an epidemic among us -- their parents.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults.

In a recent article entitled “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety” we glean significant insight into the anxiety epidemic:

I’ll just share just two key points from the article:

* Privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic.

* For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop.’ Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.

If you’re reading this article as a mom, I imagine it breaks your heart like it breaks mine (as the mother of four boys who range in age from toddler to teenager) to learn that the pressure our kids are under “is relentless and getting worse.” Of course, I think we already assumed this to be true. But knowing it to be true leaves us responsible to do something to fight against it.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

See, we parents aren’t the only ones linking accomplishment to acceptance and success to significance. Our kids are attempting to answer the question, “Is who I am enough?” by how well they perform on the field, how much they excel in school, and how many likes they get on their Instagram feed.

They are attempting to answer that question, “Is who I am enough?” by proving they can do enough and be enough. Whatever “enough” is. Because you and I both know enough is never enough when the goal is perpetual perfection.

The primary message our kids receive is that they’d better be the best at everything, and this leaves them afraid to reveal their inadequacies and insecurities—and hiding behind the best version of themselves.

In turn, parents of anxious teens feel helpless and hopeless, questioning all of the steps we are -- or aren’t -- taking. Our confidence as moms crumbles as we try to help our kids navigate the battles they have to fight and the mountains they have to climb.

We are constantly second guessing ourselves: “Have I done too much? Have I not done enough? Am I helping or am I hurting my child?”

Our anxiety escalates and overflows into our parenting and onto our kids, who then take our anxiety on top of their own.

I won’t pretend to even begin to be able to solve this for us here. I don’t have all the answers. Not even a little bit. But I do have this one nugget – which is the primary message woven into my new book, ""Mom Set Free,"" and I believe it to be true with everything in me.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.

It starts with us. It doesn’t end with us. But we are part of the solution.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

Of course, some kids are just more prone to perfection seeking than others. Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it. But often, we parents play a role in the pressure -- and therefore, anxiety -- our kids feel, so we have to be willing to take an honest look at how we pile our own pressure onto our kids.

And ultimately, it is our responsibility to help our kids push back the pressure they face with the truth of God’s Word. I am not at all suggesting that therapy and medication aren’t part of the solution. They often times are. But please let us not forget the alive and powerful Word of God that has the absolute power to show us where our significance comes from and ultimately set us free from proving our worth and our value in our performance.

Kids who constantly feel like they just don't measure up and who feel they have “everything” to prove need to be told – over and over again - they actually have “nothing” to prove. Because this pressure to prove our value and worth has left parents and children alike longing for what all our hearts most crave:

• to be known—truly and deeply known

• to be accepted—for who they are, not who they wish they were to be loved—with no strings attached

This isn’t sentimental fluff. This is solid truth from which freedom springs. There is absolutely no denying the inherent and deepest longing every human soul holds.

If we want to raise kids who find freedom from the pressure to get it ALL right in order to be accepted and welcomed, then we are going to need to walk in that freedom first. Or at least be willing to discover how to walk in that freedom alongside our kids.

We need to know that failing doesn’t make us failures and succeeding doesn’t make us significant. At least not in the eyes of our Creator -- the only One whose opinion of us really matters in the end.

In God’s eyes we are of great worth, not because of anything we have or haven’t done, but because of what has been done for us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The cross has the final word on our value. Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do. But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","America's teen anxiety epidemic is heartbreaking.

The family of a 21-year-old college student who was left with shattered ribs and a lacerated liver after being shot in the Las Vegas massacre “wants answers” from festival organizers and hotel management, one of her attorneys told Fox News, as police continue to remain tight-lipped about the massacre.

Paige Gasper, a Sonoma State University student, was working three jobs and saved up for a $236 ticket to the Route 91 Harvest music festival before she was hit by a bullet from Stephen Paddock, who was firing out of his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, attorney Michelle Simpson Tuegel said. Paddock killed 58 people in the Oct. 1 attack and left hundreds of others, like Gasper, injured.

“A kid like that expects two simple things: to have a good time at a concert and to be safe,” Tuegal told Fox News on Monday.

The lawsuit, and at least one other like it so far, is filed against MGM Resorts International, Live Nation Entertainment and a bump stock maker, among other parties.

“They feel like things need to be safer,” Tuegel said when asked about how Gasper’s family feels about the situation. She said the family is prepared for a lengthy case proceeding and investigation, including one that her firm is doing independently of Las Vegas Police, whose sheriff last appeared in front of the media on Oct. 13. No motive has been identified.

VEGAS REBRANDING SHOWS DIFFICULTY OF MESSAGING AFTER TRAGEDY

Tuegal also said her firm expects to be filing another Las Vegas shooting-related lawsuit soon and that Paige is “doing better” but still has a “road ahead of recovery,” including additional doctor and psychological appointments.

“Based on information we have from our client…and other statements we have gathered….our client was trampled a bit,” Tuegal told Fox News. “Chaos ensued after that.”

Tuegal blasted concert organizers as not keeping attendees of the festival informed about what to do in case of a crisis.

“There appears to have been no PA, emergency announcement. No pre-planned ‘here is where the exits are in case of the emergency,’” she said.

“Knowing these large outdoor events are targets is not new to anyone,” she added.

A lawsuit filed last week in Los Angeles by attorney Richard Bridgford on behalf of Gus Castilla, the father of 28-year-old Andrea Castilla who was killed in the attack, also criticizes MGM Resorts International for not keeping close enough tabs on Paddock’s actions.

“It's inconceivable to us that the perpetrator was capable of transporting what amounts to an actual armory of weapons into the hotel, especially in an era in which shooting incidents and terrorism are front page news on a daily basis,” Bridgford’s firm said in a statement provided to Fox News.

“What's truly regrettable, especially in these times of known heightened risk, is that this tragedy was completely foreseeable and thus avoidable. That such things will occur is a virtual certainty these days,” the statement adds. “As such, those who profit from attracting the public into their business venues must do a far better job of safeguarding them. As a result of their failure to do so my client has forever lost his beautiful and intelligent daughter of only 28 years.""

FULL COVERAGE OF LAS VEGAS MASSACRE

The lawsuit also alleges that the festival’s exits were poorly marked for the panicked crowd.

“During this time, the lights at the outdoor venue came on, giving defendant Paddock, who had a bird’s-eye view of the music festival, more visibility,” the lawsuit says. “Gunfire continued to rain down during this time.”

A statement put out by Live Nation the day after the attack said the concert company is “heartbroken over the tragedy.

“And while we are stunned and grieving over this incomprehensible act of violence, we know that this is a moment when we must come together to prevent more tragedies like this from occurring,"" the statement read.

MGM has said it is cooperating with law enforcement in the investigation.

“We are grateful for all who came to the victims’ aid that evening, including our employees, first responders, the police and citizens who acted in countless ways to assist,” the company said, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “Out of respect for the victims we are not going to try this case in the public domain and we will give our response through the appropriate legal channels.”","Family of Las Vegas victim 'wants answers,' lawyer says, as authorities remain tight-lipped",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/23/family-las-vegas-victim-wants-answers-lawyer-says-as-authorities-remain-tight-lipped.html

Rose, now 69, served as a medic in the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group, an elite division of the Special Forces. It was so secret that, for more than four decades, he never spoke about it to anyone – not even the people he served with.

Those that served with him, however, never forgot the bravery he showed during a four-day mission, called “Operation Tailwind,” in the landlocked country in September 1970.

Rose, then a sergeant, ran through a hail of gunfire to treat more than 50 soldiers who were fighting the North Vietnamese Army – using one hand to hoist wounded men onto his back while he fired on the enemy with his other hand.

In spite of his own injuries, he didn’t sleep for days to make sure all 16 American soldiers deployed with him made it home.

They did.

Forty-seven years later, Rose was commemorated for his ""extraordinary selfless service"" on Monday when he received the Medal of Honor during a ceremony with President Trump at the White House.

""For many years the story of Mike's heroism has gone untold. But today we gather to tell the world of his valor and proudly present him with out nation's highest military honor,"" Trump said.

The president recounted the details of Rose's time in battle before awarding him the medal, recognizing ""the true American hero that he is.""

Following the ceremony, Rose told reporters that he considered the award to be ""a collective medal"" for all of the servicemen who fought in the battle and was ""convinced that they have been recognized for the great service that did to this country.""

""This is our medal, it's not mine. We all earned it,"" Rose said.

Rose enlisted in April 1967 at the urging of his father – to avoid getting drafted by the Navy or the Marine Corps. In 1968, he graduated as a Special Forces medic and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group before being reassigned to the 46th Special Forces Company headquartered in Thailand a year later.

It was there, in April 1970, that Rose was assigned to the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group. The unit’s real purpose was to join forces with local fighters to attack North Vietnamese forces in Laos – officially off limits for combat, USA Today reported.

On Sept. 11, 1970, the unit – comprised of Americans, Vietnamese and indigenous paramilitary Montagnard personnel – were sent deep into enemy territory. As soon as they made contact, two Americans and two Montagnards were wounded, and Rose jumped into action.

The Army said the gunfire got so intense Rose had to crawl from position to position to treat the wounded.

“The actions that Mike performed during that operation, you can’t imagine it, you can’t put it into words,” said retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley, who was in charge of the unit, on Friday. “We were going into an area that U.S. forces had not been in….Had we not come out the day we were extracted, we probably would not have left.”

During the extraction of the troops, one of the helicopters crashed to the ground, injuring many on board and killing one.

Ignoring his own injuries – sustained earlier in the mission – Rose re-entered the destroyed helicopter to pull a solider to safety. McCarley said the soldier shouldn’t have survived, but did, thanks to Rose.

“I had the opportunity to meet with him [years later]…it had not affected him in any way,” he added. “Mike did a miraculous job.”

Despite the many who were wounded, only three men died during the four days of almost constant gunfire deep in enemy territory.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more. I’m proud of him, [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.” - Retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley

“My job was to focus on the individuals that were hurt,” he said on Friday. “When you focus, you don’t concern yourself on getting hurt or killed. You just have to do your job and keep going down the road.”

For his bravery, Rose earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation’s second-highest award for valor.

But what happened during those four days in Laos were never mentioned.

“When we left MAG SOC, the unit did not exist. If anyone asked me, I was going to be a mail clerk during the Vietnam War,” Rose said.

That is until 1998, when a report by CNN and Time magazine revealed Rose and the soldiers in Operation Tailwind were sent to Laos to capture American defectors and had used deadly Sarin nerve gas during the attack.

A Pentagon investigation dismissed the report, saying the mission focused on collecting intelligence on the logistics of the North Vietnamese army and destroying their supplies.

While the story of Rose’s valor has now led to a Medal of Honor, however, the covert operations by the U.S. in Laos are still obscured as somewhere “deep in enemy-controlled territory.”

McCarley said he was disappointed Rose had previously only received the Distinguished Service Cross, saying he deserved the top honor.

For more than 40 years, McCarley and others in the military and government fought to get the award upgraded.

Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more,” McCarley said. “I’m proud of him [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.”

Rose, who was joined by his wife, Margaret Rose, and their children and grandchildren -- as well as 10 of the men who served with him in Laos -- said he considers it a privilege to be part of the small group of service members who have received the Medal of Honor.

“We cannot forget these men and women who served this country valiantly,” he said.","Army Capt.

The creature seen in the video is a Creatonotos gangis moth, a species of arctiine moth found in Southeast Asia and Australia.

The creature is said to live in parts of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland.

It is defined by its white, black, red and yellow colored body, which also features tentacle-like legs. But all of those appendages have a purpose.

Known as coremata (or hair-pencils), they are scent organs used to produce pheromones to attract a mate.

The males have four eversible coremata at the tip of the abdomen which emit pheromones; when inflated each organ is longer than the abdomen.

The moths have a wingspan of about four centimeters.

Facebook user Gandik shared footage of the insect after he saw it in Indonesia.

One of many people reacted to the footage, saying: “I would literally burn the house down if I saw this.”

Another wrote: “I’m usually not creeped out by bugs but, ugh I wouldn’t touch that.”

Actress Valerie Bertinelli, who America watched grow up on the hit show One Day at a Time, is now a fixture in the food world. The Golden Globe award-winning actress with her own Food Network show, sits down with Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo to talk about recipes from her new book Valerie's Home Cooking.

Take a LISTEN:

Back when we had a house in Park City, Utah, we frequented an Italian restaurant so often they put a sign above our regular table that said, ""Wolfie's Booth."" The reason we were at the restaurant so often? Their bacon-wrapped jalapeño shrimp. (Hold on a moment while I savor the memory of them. Seriously, my mouth is watering.) Sadly, the restaurant closed before I was able to get their recipe, so I developed this particular one on my own and have tinkered with it over the years to the point where I look for excuses to make it. A party, Sunday night football, a birthday, Tuesday night . . . I'm in, and so is my entire family, along with a few of my neighbors. The sauce is sweet with a hint of Cherry Coke, and once it connects with the jalapeño, it sits on the tongue with an exciting contrast of hot and sweet and savory. It goes well with a cold cocktail or even a light beer. These will disappear quickly.

Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Shrimp with Cherry Cola BBQ Sauce

Serves 16 Hands-on 35 minutes Total 45 minutes

CHERRY COLA BBQ SAUCE

1½ tablespoons bacon drippings

1/2 large red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)

2 garlic cloves, chopped

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon garlic powder

¼ teaspoon dry mustard

2 cups cherry cola soft drink

½ cup red wine vinegar

1 cup ketchup

SHRIMP

16 extra-large shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed (about 12 ounces)

1 jalapeño chile, stem removed, seeded, and cut lengthwise into 16 thin strips

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon black pepper

8 bacon slices, halved crosswise

Make the BBQ Sauce: Heat the bacon drippings in a small saucepan over medium-high. Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic, and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Stir in the salt, garlic powder, and dry mustard, and cook, stirring often, until the spices are toasted and fragrant and the onions are a deep maroon color, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cherry cola and vinegar, and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Stir in the ketchup. Bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until reduced to about 2 cups and the mixture coats the back of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Shrimp: Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium. Cut a long 1/4-inch-deep slit in the inner curve of each shrimp; insert 1 jalapeño strip. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Wrap each shrimp tightly with 1 bacon piece. Set on a plate, seam sides down.

Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp, seam sides down, in the hot skillet, and cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon is crisp and the shrimp are just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Serve the shrimp with the BBQ sauce.

Make Ahead: The BBQ sauce will hold up to 2 weeks in the fridge. If you're prepping for a party, the shrimp can be wrapped ahead of time and cooked later.

Trick Technique: If you're someone who loves their bacon in the morning, start saving the drippings in a jar for uses like this one!

Hamburger Helpa

Don't laugh. This dish might give you more insight into my culinary history than almost anything else. It's a throwback to my childhood and it speaks directly to my more-than-occasional desire for quickness and efficiency, in that I love a good casserole or one-skillet dish. No fuss, no muss, easy cleanup, and get-right-to-it dinner. I made this for Wolfie and his friends when they came home after soccer or Little League practice. I can still picture everyone at the kitchen table, doing homework, while I simmered the beef in the mélange of spices and added macaroni, cheese, and breadcrumbs, and then announced to a sea of smiling faces, ""Dinner's ready."" Years later, I whipped out this dish when Tom's kids entered the picture and everyone came home from college during breaks. We all know the store-bought mix; this homemade version is even better than the classic, I promise.

Serves 4 Hands-on 10 minutes Total 35 minutes

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 pound ground 90% lean beef

¼ teaspoon black pepper

1 teaspoon kosher salt

8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni

2 cups whole milk

1¼ cups warm water

1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

1/4 teaspoon paprika

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

11/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

½ cup chopped American cheese

2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives

1/4 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)

1 scallion, green part sliced

Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add the beef, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring to crumble, until browned, about 5 minutes. Preheat the broiler with the oven rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat. Reduce the stovetop heat to medium, and stir in the macaroni. Add the milk, warm water, mustard, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. 3. Bring to a low simmer; cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the macaroni is tender, about 12 minutes. Add the cheeses, and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheeses melt. Stir in the chives. Sprinkle the panko over the macaroni mixture. Broil until the panko is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with the scallion, and serve immediately.

Variation: Add some slices of jalapeño for extra kick.

Bannon and Priebus aren’t alone in needing to brush off their resumes after working briefly for the Trump administration; in less than a year since Donald Trump became president, more than one dozen high-level officials have been fired or resigned from the administration.

Read on for a look at what some former Trump administration officials are up to now.

Steve Bannon

Steve Bannon, a hardcore populist, was removed as the president’s chief strategist on Aug. 18. And it wasn’t long before the former Breitbart News chief was back at his old conservative publication.

“If there’s any confusion out there, let me clear it up: I’m leaving the White House and going to war for Trump against his opponents -- on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America,” Bannon told Bloomberg following his departure.

FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS, FROM BANNON TO COMEY

Bannon returned to Breitbart as its executive chairman on the same day his ouster from the White House was announced and led its evening editorial meeting, the site said.

“The populist-nationalist movement got a lot stronger today,” Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow said in a statement. “Breitbart gained an executive chairman with his finger on the pulse of the Trump agenda.”

Trump praised his former employee on social media and predicted that Bannon will be “a tough and smart new voice” at the publication he headed for several years prior to working for Trump.

But Bannon and Trump butted heads as they both campaigned for opposing candidates in a special election primary in Alabama. Bannon backed the conservative former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, and Trump campaigned for incumbent Sen. Luther Strange. Moore won.

James Comey

In less than a year, James Comey went from F.B.I. director to college faculty.

Comey, who was unceremoniously fired by Trump in May, joined Howard University as part-time lecturer for the fall as the 2017-2018 Gwendolyn S. and Colbert I. King Endowed Chair in Public Policy.

The King Chair is part of the Washington, D.C., college’s push to “provide students access to experienced, senior public service executives who developed and advanced public policy initiatives,” according to a university press release.

Comey, who was sacked from his job at the F.B.I. just two months after he announced the agency was looking into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia’s meddling in the presidential election, said he was “honored” to be at Howard.

RNC OFFICIALS WHO FOLLOWED SPICER, PRIEBUS TO WHITE HOUSE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR JOBS

“Howard has a longstanding history of being a vibrant academic community and the perfect place to have a rich dialogue on many of the most pressing issues we face today,” Comey said in a statement.

Comey’s time at Howard got off to a rough start after his convocation address was overtaken by raucous protestors.

Anthony Scaramucci

Anthony Scaramucci was the White House communications director for only 10 days, but he caused quite the shake-up in less than two weeks.

During his tenure, the Goldman Sachs alumnus ranted about his coworkers in an infamous and crude interview with the New Yorker – specifically slamming former chief of staff Reince Priebus as a “paranoid schizophrenic” and former chief strategist Steve Bannon.

Since he’s left the White House, Scaramucci has been quite active on social media – including tweeting some vaguely self-deprecating images.

COMBATIVE EX-TRUMP AIDE EXPECTED TO JOIN BREITBART NEWS

On Aug. 4, Scaramucci tweeted a cartoon depicting a cartoonist banging his head against the wall in frustration as Trump seems to fire “White House misfits” at a rapid pace. A computer screen in the cartoon reads, “New flash! Mooch out!!” – invoking Scaramucci’s common nick name, “The Mooch.”

On Aug. 22, he tweeted an image of a t-shirt that reads, “I was communications director for 10 days and all I got was this lousy shirt.”

Scaramucci is expected to speak at a Liberty University convocation in November.

He has also appeared on a variety of talk shows, including “The View” and Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show.”

Michael Flynn

Trump’s former national security adviser is no longer part of the White House, but he still remains under multiple investigations for his dealings with foreign governments, particularly Russia, during the presidential campaign.

The embattled former Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn resigned under harsh scrutiny in February after it was revealed that he misled the administration when it came to his ties to and conversations with Russian officials.

Since his firing, Flynn registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department in March.

TRUMP’S ECONOMIC ADVISER DRAFTS RESIGNATION LETTER

Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Flynn was involved in the push to obtain former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails from Russian hackers during the presidential campaign.

Several of Flynn’s allies and appointees in the White House have been slowly pushed out as well.

Sean Spicer

Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer could have been a star – a dancing star, that is.

After Spicer resigned as Anthony Scaramucci was hired as the White House’s short-lived communications director, he reportedly turned down an opportunity to be a contestant on ABC’s “Dancing with the Stars.”

Sources told TMZ that Spicer turned down the gig because he has an “overwhelming number of commitments in the fall” and because “he’s not a good dancer.”

Since he announced he was leaving the Trump administration, Spicer has been photographed with fans at Fenway Park and “is angling” to appear on “Saturday Night Live.” Spicer was also able to finally meet the pope. The former press secretary was infamously denied the opportunity to meet Pope Francis during Trump's trip to the Vatican in May.

STEVE BANNON CLAIMS SCALP IN BID TO RESHAPE GOP

Spicer announced in September that he joined the Worldwide Speakers Group as a paid speaker.

“Melissa McCarthy’s depiction of his press briefing performances earned him a spot in Saturday Night Live lore, but it was his role as the architect of the Republican National Committee’s PR strategy that earned him a reputation as one of the party’s most effective and hardest-charging strategists and communicators,” his bio states.

His speaking topics include: navigating crises, a conservative viewpoint, “an objective look at the philosophies, people and policies making the news” and the Trump administration.

Spicer has continued to consistently share Trump’s tweets and messages of support for the administration on Twitter.

Spicer also made a surprise appearance at the Emmy Awards in September, seemingly poking fun at his own claim about the size of the inauguration audience.

Reince Priebus

The former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus has rejoined his old law firm, he announced on Twitter Wednesday.

Priebus said he has joined the Michael Best & Friedrich, a Milwaukee-based firm, as its president and will work from Washington, D.C. Priebus worked for the firm for about 13 years before he was the Republican National Committee chairman, according to the Associated Press.

Priebus also announced that he has joined the Washington Speakers Bureau.

Trump tweeted his congratulations to his former chief of staff and called him a “really good and talented man.”

“We’re proud of you, Reince!” Trump said.

Sheryl Stiles suffered the heart attack and fell down an escalator, the report said. A family member said she was on her way back to her hotel room.

Her son was among the 58 people killed Oct. 1 in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

He was buried Friday following private graveside services. His burial came after a funeral that drew more than 2,000 family members, friends and police and military officers, with honors that included a motorcade down the Las Vegas Strip.

Afterward the mourning for her son continued. Stiles reportedly suffered the heart attack as well as a brain injury in the fall. She was reportedly placed on life support and died two days later from pulmonary arrest and acute cardio infraction.

Cecil Ralston, a cousin, said the police chaplain told him that she wanted to be with Charleston and that she “wanted to die.”

Her son was a married father of two and was off-duty during the massacre, where a gunman opened fire on a concert audience from a hotel room.

A year before his death, Hartfield began a computer file detailing the instructions for his funeral.

“If you’re reading this, then I’ve been called home,” Hartfield’s note read. The file was found by his wife, Veronica, following his death.

“Nothing I type will make this any easier, so I will get to the facts. My largest request: Please do not allow anyone to wear black. Black is totally depressing and I don’t want anyone expressing their sorrow over my passing,” Hartfield’s instructions read.

Hartfield asked that songs by Nina Simone and Johnny Cash be played during his funeral.

“I would like for everyone to enjoy themselves. And remember me for who I was. The truth only. None of that stuff about how great I was. Only real stories,” the officer wrote.

Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo called Hartfield, an 11-year police veteran, a “remarkable officer” killed by “an unremarkable person.”

“What I was amazed, it’s almost $6 million that they paid and it’s totally discredited, it’s a total phony. I call it fake news. It’s disgraceful,” Trump said on “Lou Dobbs Tonight.”

Hillary Clinton recently slammed new reports of her ties to Russia's nuclear energy deals, claiming the corruption allegations have been “debunked repeatedly.”

The former secretary of state said on C-SPAN Monday that ""It’s the same baloney they’ve been peddling for years, and there’s been no credible evidence by anyone.""

Trump said the Clinton camp is now trying to backtrack from the dossier that contained allegations that the Russian government had collected compromising information about Trump and that the Kremlin was engaged in an active effort to assist his presidential campaign.

“It is very interesting. She denied it. Her own people denied it. Everybody and now they are sort of scooting around trying to figure out what to say,” he said.

The show's format pivoted to focus on victims of the shooting, as well as those recovering from hurricanes and wildfires, with a night of somber tributes, inspirational anthems and voices lifted in harmony.

Aldean, who was on stage at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when the shooting occurred Oct. 1, stood side-by-side with the night's other award winners, including Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, Chris Stapleton and Keith Urban, to dedicate the night to music fans. The honorees did not accept awards or give speeches as usual, but some chose to perform or other musicians performed in their honor.

""Heartbroken doesn't even begin to describe how some of us feel. But we have proven time and again in this country that we have the power to overcome anything that threatens our way of life, or our freedom.

Andra Day kicked off the awards show with her anthem ""Rise Up,"" in a beautiful harmony duet by Little Big Town. Then Lee Ann Womack, Danielle Bradbury and rapper Common joined them for a performance of ""Stand Up For Something.""

""On this night when we usually celebrate a year of music, we also want to celebrate a year of incredible human spirit, the spirit we see in our fans every night,"" Stapleton said.

""So in some small way we want to thank you for your resolve and perhaps lift your spirits for just a moment,"" Urban said.

The names of the 58 victims from Las Vegas were listed during an in memoriam segment, along with the names of Petty, Gregg Allman, Glen Campbell, Don Williams and Troy Gentry.

Other performances including Bryan singing his single ""Fast,"" and Stapleton singing his song ""Broken Halos,"" a song that he's dedicated to victims of the Vegas shooting.

The Backstreet Boys sang Florida Georgia Line's emotional ballad ""H.O.L.Y."" and Keith Urban performed a jazzy version of his song ""Blue Ain't Your Color.""

The NYPD said Villafane was suspended without pay “for the good of the department.”This article originally appeared on New York Post","An off-duty NYPD officer went berserk in a Godiva store when she was told they were closing — even fighting police who responded to the call, cops said.

Officer Amanda Villafane went to the store at the Stamford Town Center with her mother and Christopher Salvadore, 32, around 6 p.m. Sunday, police said.

“They were told the store was closing,” Stamford Police Sgt. Brian Butler said. “They were not happy with that answer.”

That’s when Villafane took off her jacket and started yelling, video of the incident shows.

(WARNING: Video contains explicit language)

At one point, she can be heard threatening a clerk: “I will knock you the f–k out!”

Salvadore, who at first seemed to be trying to hold the officer back, allegedly punched an 18-year-old who was filming the incident with his phone.

Making matters worse, Villafane showed her NYPD identification and fought with a cop.

“When they went to arrest her she didn’t want to cooperate so they had to take her to the ground and cuff her,” Butler said.

He said the floor was covered with “blood and chocolate.”

Villafane was charged with criminal trespassing, disorderly conduct and interfering with police. Salvador was charge with assault and disorderly conduct.

The NYPD said Villafane was suspended without pay “for the good of the department.”

Pots and pans sure look gleaming and gorgeous coming out of the box, but after years of spaghetti dinners, roast chickens and holiday feasts, a well-used cookware arsenal is bound to show its age. Make your sauté pans, stockpots and skillets worthy of the hanging pot rack once again with a little elbow grease and a couple of easy-to-find, mild cleaning products (including ketchup, of all things) — and learn how keep the glow once you've got it back.

Below you'll find daily care and stain removal tips for cookware made of stainless steel, copper, enameled cast iron and more.

Good practices for all cookware. No matter the type of cookware, it is best to wash it as soon as possible after cooking (cleaning as you go is ideal), and use the least abrasive cleaning method you can. Washing by hand is always preferable, even for pots and pans that claim to be dishwasher safe. Washing by hand will prevent the scratches and discoloration that can happen in a dishwasher over time.

The tips and techniques that follow are good general guidelines, but you may also want to check the manufacturer's suggestions. If your cookware is under warranty, using the wrong cleaning product can void your agreement, so it pays to do your homework.

Stainless Steel

Everyday care: Ideally, wash your stainless steel pots and pans by hand soon after use, using regular dish soap. That said, stainless steel pans are one of the few types that can handle a trip through the dishwasher — so if you are in a rush, don't worry about tossing it in with the dishes. Regular cleaning in the dishwasher may create spots or a cloudy surface.

Stain removal: To brighten up cloudy or spotty stainless steel, rub the surface with a rag dampened with white vinegar. To treat stains on the bottom of the pan caused by high heat, sprinkle a gentle scouring powder (like Barkeeper's Friend) on a wet sponge or rag to create a paste, and rub it onto the stained area. Rinse with water.

Copper

Everyday care: Wash copper pots and pans by hand, using warm, soapy water.

Stain removal: Bring that lustrous finish back to discolored copper by covering your pan with ketchup (yes, ketchup) or lemon. Let the ketchup sit on your pan for at least 10 minutes, then rub the discoloration away with a rag or sponge. Rinse clean with warm water.

Enameled Cast Iron

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool before washing it — a sudden temperature change may crack the enamel. Soak the pan in warm water first, then use a soft sponge and a mild dishwashing detergent to clean it. Do not use abrasive scrubbing pads, as they can damage the enamel finish.

Stain removal: Treat discoloration on the outside of the pan using a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. For tough stains on the inside surface, fill the pan with white vinegar and water and bring to a boil on the stovetop. Turn off the heat and let the pan soak with the vinegar solution, then wash as usual.

Hard Anodized Aluminum

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool completely before washing it, and never place a hot pan in cold water, which can cause warping. Wash by hand, using a mild dishwashing detergent and warm water — putting your hard anodized pans in the dishwasher may void your warranty.

Stain removal: For stains on the outside only, use a paste of baking soda or a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. Rinse with warm water.

Nonstick

Everyday care: Use low to medium heat only — higher temperatures can permanently damage nonstick pans. Wash promptly with a soft sponge and warm, soapy water. If scratches or flakes begin to appear on the nonstick surface of your pan, recycle or toss it immediately. Otherwise those flakes will end up in your food ... not something you want to happen!

Stain removal: On the outside only, try using a paste of Barkeeper's Friend or a similar scouring powder.

Cast Iron

Initial seasoning: When you buy a new cast iron pan, wash it by hand in warm, soapy water. Dry the pan with a towel, then put it in a 300-degree oven for about five minutes to dry it completely — even a bit of remaining moisture can cause rust to form on cast iron pans. Next, using a paper towel, rub about a tablespoon of olive or vegetable oil over the surface of the pan, inside and out. Wipe away excess oil — you are aiming for a thin coat. Put the pan in a 300-degree oven for an hour, let it cool, then rub it all over with a clean rag.

Everyday care: Never use soap on your cast iron pan. Promptly after each use, wipe out the pan using a paper towel and a bit of oil. If food is stuck on, run the pan under hot water and scrub the food off with a soft brush or plastic scouring pad — remember, no soap! Soap will remove the seasoning, which is what creates that wonderful nonstick surface.

Stain removal and long-term care: For really tough, stuck-on food, boil water in your pan on the stovetop for a few minutes, then clean it as usual. Reseasoning occasionally will help maintain the finish.

Clay Pot

Everyday care: Most clay pots must be soaked in water for 15 to 30 minutes before each use. Always place your clay pot in a cold oven so the pot can come up to temperature gradually. Do not use your clay pot on the stovetop or under a broiler, and never put a hot pot on a cold surface — any sudden temperature changes can break it.

Clean it promptly, using a paste of baking soda; rinse with warm water. Soap is not recommended for unglazed clay pots, though you may be able to use a mild soap on clay pots that have been glazed; check with the manufacturer.

Stain removal: Try leaving a paste of baking soda on the discolored area for at least 10 minutes, then wipe away and rinse with water. Do not use abrasive sponges or harsh cleaning products on a clay pot.",Essential cleaning tips for the 7 most popular cookware materials,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/essential-cleaning-tips-for-7-most-popular-cookware-materials.html

Let’s give plausible accounts of the known facts, then explain why demands that Robert Mueller recuse himself from the Russia investigation may not be the fanciful partisan grandstanding you imagine.

Here’s a story consistent with what has been reported in the press—how reliably reported is uncertain. Democratic political opponents of Donald Trump financed a British former spook who spread money among contacts in Russia, who in turn over drinks solicited stories from their supposedly “connected” sources in Moscow. If these people were really connected in any meaningful sense, then they made sure the stories they spun were consistent with the interests of the regime, if not actually scripted by the regime.

The resulting Trump dossier then became a factor in Obama administration decisions to launch an FBI counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign, and after the election to trumpet suspicions of Trump collusion with Russia.

We know of a second, possibly even more consequential way the FBI was effectively a vehicle for Russian meddling in U.S. politics. Authoritative news reports say FBI chief James Comey’s intervention in the Hillary Clinton email matter was prompted by a Russian intelligence document that his colleagues suspected was a Russian plant.

OK, Mr. Mueller was a former close colleague and leader but no longer part of the FBI when these events occurred. This may or may not make him a questionable person to lead a Russia-meddling investigation in which the FBI’s own actions are necessarily a concern.

Perkins was subjected to years of sexual harassment by her boss.","A former assistant to Harvey Weinstein who signed a non-disclosure agreement before accepting a monetary settlement from the movie mogul has decided enough is enough, breaking her silence about his sexual harassment of her.

Zelda Perkins was one of at least eight alleged victims to reach settlements and sign NDAs with Weinstein related to years of sexual harassment and abuse .

Perkins came forward Monday, telling the Financial Times that Weinstein’s sexual misconduct began the very first day she ended up alone with him while working out of Miramax’s London office.

“He went out of the room and came back in his underwear,” she recalled. “He asked me if I would give him a massage. Then he asked if he could massage me.”

She and a colleague split a roughly $330,000 settlement in October 1998 and signed agreements barring them from going public with their allegations.

“I want to publicly break my non-disclosure agreement,” said Perkins, who now works for the Robert Fox theater production company. “Unless somebody does this there won’t be a debate about how egregious these agreements are and the amount of duress that victims are put under.”

Perkins’ NDA included a donation to a woman’s charity and her demands that Weinstein undergo therapy “for as long as his therapist deems necessary.” Miramax said it would comply with that clause for three years.

The company also promised that it would appoint three “complaint handlers” to investigate any subsequent sexual harassment complaints.

If a complaint was filed against Weinstein within two years of Perkins’ contract and it resulted in either a settlement of either roughly $46,000 or six months’ salary, Miramax would report it to Disney, its then-owner, or fire Weinstein.

It’s unclear whether Miramax fully abided by the terms of Perkins’ NDA.

Perkins was subjected to years of sexual harassment by her boss.

Weinstein, she said, would often walk around the room naked and asked her to be in the room while he bathed.

“This was his behavior on every occasion I was alone with him,” Perkins said. “I often had to wake him up in the hotel in the mornings and he would try to pull me into bed.”

Perkins said her breaking point came after her colleague came forward “white as a sheet and shaking” with similar allegations while the crew was in Venice for a film festival from in September 1998.

“She told me something terrible had happened. She was in shock and crying and finding it very hard to talk. I was furious, deeply upset and very shocked. I said: ‘We need to go to the police’ but she was too distressed. Neither of us knew what to do in a foreign environment.”

Perkins said negotiating her NDA was “incredibly distressing” and that she was told it ultimately came down to his word against hers.

“I was very upset because the whole point was that we had to stop him by exposing his behavior,” she said. “I was warned that he and his lawyers would try to destroy my credibility if I went to court. They told me he would try to destroy me and my family.”

Perkins said part of the reason why she publicly came forward now — despite potential legal ramifications — is because NDAs should be “regulated in a fair way.”

“I want to call into question the legitimacy of agreements where the inequality of power is so stark and relies on money rather than morality,” she explained. “I want other women who have been sidelined and who aren’t being allowed to own their own history or their trauma to be able to discuss what they have suffered. I want them to see that the sky won’t fall in.”

She added, “My entire world fell in because I thought the law was there to protect those who abided by it. I discovered that it had nothing to do with right and wrong and everything to do with money and power.”

But some retailers are using the viral campaign to sell products, and not everyone agrees with this decision.

One product in particular has sparked a wave of backlash, with many accusing the designer of profiting off others’ pain. Jewelry company Adornia announced its latest product, a lariat necklace spelling out “Me Too,” which retails for $44.

Initially, the brand promised to donate 10 percent of all proceeds to the Rape Abuse Incest National Network. However, it later amended that amount to 100 percent, though it’s unclear whether this was spurred on by harsh criticism of the product or was simply a typo.

Allure reports that Adornia’s PR company followed up their initial email, correcting the error. “Apologies for the typo — 100% of the proceeds from this necklace is being donated to RAINN. Designer Moran Amir was inspired by her own experience as a survivor of adolescent sexual abuse to help women speak out loud.” However, according to Refinery29, Adornia designer Moran Amir made the change in an effort to assuage people’s criticism of her motives. “To eschew any controversy that I was profiting off of other people's pain, I raised the donation to RAINN to 100%,” she said.

But despite the altruistic element, reactions to the necklace were fierce, with people on Twitter calling the product “opportunistic” and “gross.”

“Today in the complete and utter reprehensible cooptation of feminist causes, a brand is selling a ""ME TOO"" necklace,” one Twitter user wrote.

“It seems really opportunistic and tone-deaf to be commodifying an organic movement for awareness of sexual assault with #MeToo jewelry,” another user wrote. ""I really like the idea of wearing our beliefs on our sleeve proverbial or not.""

FITNESS COMPANY SLAMMED FOR 'INAPPROPRIATE' POSTER BLASTS CRITICS AS 'WHINY FEMINAZIS'

Others argue that there’s nothing wrong with the necklace, and is simply a symbol of female empowerment.

“I think it's cool. Feminists have always used fashion to get the message across, from Suffragette sashes to throwing away bras. Dope,” another user tweeted.

In spite of the harsh feedback to the product, Amir is standing by the necklace, and the company has responded to critics multiple times on Twitter.

“We mean no offense so decided to increase the donation to 100% for this necklace in order to state our mission more clearly,” Adornia wrote.

“I appreciate your feedback. Our intention was to unite women through this expression, not profit off their pain,” the company wrote.

Amir explained to Refinery29 why she created the necklace in the first place, noting how shocked she was by the controversy.

Gerre and Doug, who was then married to his wife of about 20 years, started off as friends and active members of the church.

“It wasn’t right,” claimed a former parishioner. “People were talking.”

“It was a scandal,” another churchgoer added.

Court documents obtained by In Touch revealed Drummond’s father, William, a beloved local doctor, reportedly didn’t agree with Gerre’s request for a divorce.

“The defendant desires to continue to live in a loving and supportive marriage with the plaintiff,” the documents claimed.

The couple ultimately divorced in 1997. Gerre and Doug tied the knot in 1999 and left Oklahoma. They currently live in Signal Mountain, Tenn., which is located 12 hours away from Drummond and her children. William moved on and remarried.

Doug’s wife was allegedly hurt by the end of her own marriage.

“Everyone felt terrible for her,” insisted one local resident.

As for Drummond, she’s been married to cattle ranch owner Ladd Drummond since 1996. The popular food blogger told Us Weekly the secret behind their lasting marriage is sharing quality time together, despite her hectic schedule.

""They said, ‘OK, looks good. Since you have dense breasts, just go across the hall for your sonogram. But during the sonogram, something was detected,"" said the 53-year-old.

Goodacre was later told she had Stage 1 invasive ductal carcinoma. She underwent a lumpectomy and radiation.

Her husband of 23 years said he was scared he was going to lose her. ""I know from losing my mom that the worst can happen. She's my best friend, and I really don't know what I would do without her,"" he said.

The talk show host lost his mom to ovarian cancer when he was 13.

While Goodacre did not have to undergo chemotherapy, she was placed on the drug Tamoxifen for the last five years.

The drug helps to treat and reduce the chance of breast cancer but can have side effects including weight gain.

“I’ve always been a pretty fit person, and so to be just rounder and heavier and not to really be able to do much about it — that’s been hard,"" she said. ""It’s taken a lot out of my self-confidence.""

Connick Jr. said of the drug's impact, ""It’s a part of how the cancer and the treatment impacted her, and it was a real issue, even though she will always be the most beautiful woman in the world.""

The couple waited to come forward with their story until the five-year mark.

FOX NEWS - The controversial dossier containing salacious allegations about President Donald Trump and his possible connections to Russia, including coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, resulted from funding by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee to the firm Fusion GPS, a source familiar with the situation confirmed to Fox News.

Fusion GPS was retained by Marc E. Elias, an attorney representing the DNC and the Clinton campaign, The Washington Post first reported Tuesday. Fusion GPS then reportedly hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to write the now-infamous dossier.

Steele had ties both to the U.S. intelligence community and the FBI.

Prior to the firm being retained in April 2016 by Elias and his law firm, Perkins Coie, Fusion GPS’s research had been subsidized by an unidentified Republican during the GOP primary.

But the Clinton campaign – and the DNC – saw the research through, funding the firm through the end of October 2016, just days before Trump defeated Clinton in the general election, according to The Post's reporting.

Sheykhet, 20, was studying to be a physical therapist, and had recently filed a protection from abuse order against Darby over an incident that occurred weeks before her murder.

Darby was arrested Sept. 26 and charged with felony criminal trespass for allegedly breaking into Sheykhet's apartment.

Haley, who’s in the middle of a three-country visit in Africa, left the camp as several hundred protesters opposing President Salva Kiir approached, a spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the U.N. told Fox News. The protesters “became upset that [Haley] was not able to meet with them, due to time constraint,” the U.N. told The Associated Press.

Shortly after Haley left the camp, which is meant for homeless and displaced residents, U.N. security guards fired tear gas into the crowd of more than 100 people who looted and destroyed a charity office operating there, an aid worked at the camp said.

Frustration has been growing both inside and outside of South Sudan over the conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people, and created African’s largest displacement of civilians since the Rwanda genocide in 1994.

“We are disappointed by what we are seeing. This is not what we thought we were investing it,” Haley said in remarks released later by the U.N. “What we thought we were investing in was a free, fair society where people could be safe and South Sudan is the opposite of that.”

Just before Haley left the camp, residents attempted to hand the ambassador a letter with their position on the “current crisis.” The U.N. said a “petition” was delivered before Haley had left.

Haley is the highest-level U.S. government official to visit South Sudan since President Donald Trump took office in January. The ambassador is in Africa to see the involvement of both the U.S. and the U.N. in Ethiopia, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where she arrived late Wednesday.

President Kiir appealed for the Trump administration to remain engaged with the country during his meeting with Haley.

The United States is South Sudan's largest donor and was instrumental in the country's creation. Since the country gained independence in 2011, the U.S. has given more than $5 billion for humanitarian and development initiatives, according to the U.S. Embassy.

South Sudan plunged into civil war in late 2013, and the country faces mass displacement, starvation and allegations of government corruption and war crimes. More than 2 million people have fled the country.

But since Kim Jong Nam’s death in February, when two women lunged at him and smeared the banned VX nerve agent on him at Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpar airport, the first family of North Korea has been thrown into the spotlight. Reports soon circulated that Kim Jong Un had his half-brother, whom he had never met, killed because of fears a coup was being plotted to overthrow him.

Kim’s remaining siblings — Kim Yo Jong, Kim Sul Song and Kim Jong Chul — have remained mostly in the background since the death of their father, Kim Jong Il, in 2011. Kim Yo Jong, his sister, made international headlines earlier this month when she was voted to become an alternate member of the political bureau of the party’s central committee, the state’s Korean Central News Agency announced.

Here’s what he know about the siblings:

Kim Jong Nam:

As Kim Jong Il’s eldest child, Kim Jong Nam was poised to succeed his father when Kim Jong Il died. Jong Nam was born in May 1971 and the former dictator was reportedly fond of his first son, often dining and calling him despite raising him in secret and sealing him behind palace gates, the BBC reported. Like many of siblings, Jong Nam studied in Switzerland and lived in Russia before returning to North Korea in the late 1980s.

His chances to rule the volatile regime grew rocky over the years. He still worked for his father by serving in the regime’s internal security apparatus and the foreign exchange earning operations. But any chance Jong Nam had to become the supreme ruler officially ended in May 2001 when he was arrested at an airport in Tokyo for using a counterfeit passport, according to the BBC. He reportedly told officials he was planning to visit Tokyo Disneyland.

The incident became a source of embarrassment that drove Jong Nam into exile in Macau. He was reportedly traveling with a fake Portuguese passport at the time. In interviews, Jong Nam said he had “no interest” in becoming the next North Korean leader, according to the Telegraph. He also had a home in Beijing.

Jong Nam died in early February after two women carried out a daring assassination at the Malaysian airport. Siti Aisyah, 25, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, are on trial in connection with the death, though they have insisted they thought they were playing a prank for a reality TV show. North Korean agents are also suspected of engineering the plot.

Kim Jong Il’s eldest son could have been seen as a potential rival to Jong Un. A report by Japanese magazine Nikkei Asian Review also claimed the North Korean leader “flew into a rage” when he uncovered a coup that planned to replace him with Jong Nam.

Kim Jong Chul

Kim Jong Chul is mostly known because he is a huge fan of rock legend Eric Clapton. Several reports stated the despot’s brother was spotted at Clapton concerts in London. Japanese broadcaster TBS also said they had video of Jong Chul, donning sunglasses and a leather jacket, at a Clapton performance in 2015 — though the video has since been removed.

Thae Yong Ho, North Korea’s former deputy ambassador in London, told Reuters in February he accompanied Jong Chul to the Clapton concert in 2015. Thae, who defected from North to South Korea, was also ordered to get the tickets.

“I realized, ‘Ah! It must be Kim Jong Chol! In North Korea who else would be interested but Kim Jong Chol?'” Thae recalled to Reuters.

Jong Chol is also a guitarist.

“He’s very free,” Thae said. “But he’s only interested in guitars and music.”

It’s unclear if Jong Chol plays any role in Kim Jong Un’s regime. He left North Korea in the late 1990s and was reportedly deemed “like a little girl” by Kim Jong Il.

Kim Yo Jong

Kim Yo Jong, believed to be 28 or 30, is said to be one of the leader’s closest confidants. They both have the same mother, Ko Yong Hui. In early October, Yo Jong was elected to become an alternate member of the politiburo, the top decision-making body that Kim Jong Un presides over. The sister also replaced their aunt, Kim Kyong Hee, in that position.

Yo Jong forged a bond with her brother when they studied in Bern, Switzerland for two years. She was spotted next to Jong Un when their father died in 2011. Afterwards, sources said she helped the now-leader to consolidate power, said Michael Madden, founder of the influential NK Leadership Watch website.

Yo Jong began her career working in the regime’s Propaganda and Agitation Department, managing North Korea’s cultural affairs and news media. She was also photographed alongside her late father in a May 2009 trip in Wonsan University of Agriculture.

Madden added the appointment shows the sister's daily activities are more substantive and more important than some analysts had contended. He said it also indicates the Ko Yong Hui line has been ""conclusively established as the sole succeeding branch of the Kim family” following Jong Nam’s murder.

Kim Sul Song

The eldest daughter of Kim Jong Il was also rumored to be the former leader’s favorite child. Very few details are known about her, but she is reportedly a significant, secret player in the regime.

Grassley, R-Iowa, tweeted late Tuesday, calling for the Justice Department to appoint an independent counsel to investigate the deal.

“Whoever in DOJ is capable w authority to appoint a special counsel shld do so to investigate Uranium One 'whoever' means if u aren’t recused,” Grassley tweeted.

His message may have been a reference to Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- who recused himself from the investigation into Russia's election meddling and potential collusion with Trump associates -- or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein is overseeing the Russia probe, but as a U.S. attorney reportedly helped supervise a bribery probe into a subsidiary of the same Russian firm involved in the Uranium One deal.

The deal, which was covered extensively in 2015, concerns the 2010 approval of the sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company. The U.S. was involved because the sale gave the Russians control of part of the uranium supply in the U.S.

The Hill reported, however, that the FBI had evidence as early as 2009 that Russian operatives used bribes, kickbacks and other dirty tactics to expand Moscow’s atomic energy footprint in the U.S., related to a subsidiary of the same Russian firm. Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill quickly started asking questions about how the deal was approved the following year by an inter-agency committee.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS LAUNCH NEW PROBES INTO OBAMA-ERA URANIUM ONE DEAL, FBI HANDLING OF CLINTON CASE

In addition to Grassley’s calls for a special counsel investigation, House Republicans on Tuesday launched new probes into several Obama-era controversies, including administration’s approval of the deal that gave Russians partial control over American uranium reserves.

Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said his committee would not “jump to any conclusions,” but would “try and get the facts.”

Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., threatened to use his subpoena power to get access to a former FBI informant in the case who apparently has not yet been released from a non-disclosure agreement. U.S. government officials have told Fox News that senior Justice Department officials are in deliberations over providing the FBI informant to Congress.

But while congressional probes and subpoena power could undercover more details, the FBI informant’s attorney, Victoria Toensing, echoed Grassley’s calls for a special counsel.

“This cries out for a special counsel,” Toensing said on Fox News' “Hannity” Tuesday night. “Congressional committees are fine, but this is a criminal investigation and Jeff Sessions isn’t ever going to feel comfortable appointing that, and Rod Rosenstein is recused because he was the U.S. attorney.”

Toensing added that while Sessions can technically appoint a special counsel, he likely was “not going to be comfortable doing it.”

“He ought to get somebody in here and get this off their hands,” Toensing said.

Charlie Daniels on Senator Bob Corker lashing out at President Trump:

I don't know what to make of him... I don't know what he's trying to accomplish. I know one thing, if he keeps on he's probably going to get smacked back.

On the country's perception of President Trump:

I think they realize that if the establishment politics do not work, we've found it out, they've made a lot of promises they haven't kept. This is a wide looped swing. I honestly think they're so scared of this guy because he's so unconventional and so non-political that if it does work what he's doing, people are going to say 'what do we need you guys for anymore?'

On why he chose this title for his autobiography:

The title is about accentuating the positives, don't dwell on the negatives. The full seats are the positives, you deal with them.
