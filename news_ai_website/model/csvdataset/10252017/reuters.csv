In September, U.S. officials ordered Kaspersky’s products removed from government computers, saying the firm was vulnerable to Kremlin influence and that using the software could jeopardize national security.

After that announcement, the Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 5 that hackers working for the Russian government appeared to have targeted a National Security Agency (NSA) worker by using Kaspersky software to identify classified files in 2015. The New York Times reported on Oct. 10 that Israeli officials reported the operation to the United States after they hacked into Kaspersky's network.

The Russian government has denied any involvement.

Kaspersky began an internal inquiry in a bid to restore trust. On Wednesday, it said it had stumbled on the code in 2014 when the consumer version of its popular software flagged a zip file as malicious on a U.S. computer.

While reviewing the file’s contents, a Kaspersky analyst discovered it contained the source code for a hacking tool later attributed to what Kaspersky calls the Equation Group. The software removed the file and the analyst reported the matter to Chief Executive Eugene Kaspersky, who ordered that the copy of the code be destroyed, the company said.

Kaspersky said it assumed the 2014 source code episode was connected to the NSA’s loss of files described in media reports.

“We deleted the archive because we don’t need the source code to improve our protection technologies and because of concerns regarding the handling of classified materials,” said Kaspersky spokeswoman Sarah Kitsos.

Source code, which is normally hidden and gives instructions to computers, would have posed no danger to the Kaspersky customer.

Former employees told Reuters in July that the company had on rare occasions removed uninfected files. Kaspersky spokeswoman Yuliya Shlychkova on Wednesday said removals of such uninfected material happen “extremely rarely.”

Kaspersky said no third parties saw the code, though the media reports said the spy tool had ended up in the hands of the Russian government.

Kaspersky denied the Journal’s report that its programs searched for keywords including “top secret.”

The company said it found no evidence that it had been hacked by Russian spies or anyone except the Israelis, though it suggested others could have obtained the tools by hacking into the American’s computer through a back door it later spotted there.

The NSA declined to comment on Kaspersky’s review.

The new 2014 date of the incident is of interest because Kaspersky only announced its discovery of an espionage campaign by the Equation Group in February 2015. At that time, Reuters cited former NSA employees who said that Equation Group was an NSA project.

Kaspersky’s Equation Group report was one of its most celebrated findings, since it indicated that the group could infect firmware on most computers. That gave the NSA almost undetectable presence.

Shlychkova said the American machine’s files were found before the big Equation Group announcement but after Kaspersky had discovered Equation software on a machine in the Middle East. She said that occurred in March 2014.

Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who led calls in the U.S. Congress to purge Kaspersky products from federal government networks, on Wednesday sent a letter to DHS acting Secretary Elaine Duke and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, urging the U.S. government to declassify information about Kaspersky products.

The step was necessary, Shaheen wrote, “to allow the American people to make informed decisions about risks to their privacy and security.”

Also on Tuesday, Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill sent a separate letter to DHS asking what was being done to ensure federal agencies were complying with the ban on Kaspersky products.

Kaspersky’s consumer anti-virus software has won high marks from reviewers.

Odinga, however, backed away from previous promises to hold large-scale protests on election day.

“We advise Kenyans who value democracy and justice to hold vigil and prayers away from polling stations, or just stay at home,” he told a cheering crowd of thousands of people on Wednesday in Uhuru Park, in the capital Nairobi.

“Convince your friends, neighbors and everyone else not participate,” he said, but if they support the president, he cautioned “do not insult or assault them. Instead, seek to open their eyes.”

Odinga is refusing to participate because he said that the election commission has failed to implement reforms to prevent another failed poll.

The Supreme Court was due to hear cases seeking to delay the polls but was unable to do so after five out of seven judges had failed to turn up, preventing a quorum.

Minutes after Chief Justice David Maraga said the case could not be heard, hundreds of supporters took to the streets of Kisumu, Odinga’s main stronghold.

Riot police used teargas to disperse them. Two protesters had gunshot wounds, a Reuters witness said.

“If the government subverts the sovereign will of the people ... then people are entitled to rebel against this government,” Kisumu governor Anyang Nyong‘o, a hardline Odinga supporter, told reporters in Kisumu.

Such comments seem certain to fuel fears of a major confrontation with security forces, already blamed for killing nearly 50 people in Kisumu and Nairobi slums after the canceled August vote.

Trump told reporters he wants to protect the popular tax-deferred savings program, but said it was possible it could be part of congressional negotiations over tax cuts.

“Maybe we’ll use it as negotiating, but trust me ... there are certain kinds of deals you don’t want to negotiate with,” Trump said on the White House South Lawn as he prepared to depart on a trip to Dallas.

On Capitol Hill, Representative Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means committee, said Trump and lawmakers were discussing how to handle 401(k) plans. The employer-administered plans have been used for four decades by millions of workers to save for retirement.

”No decision’s yet been made on if there will be any changes,“ Brady told reporters. ”We’re simply considering ideas to help people save more and save early in life.

“If we can reach consensus on that, including with the president, in a good way, we’ll move forward - but if not, we will keep things as they are,” Brady said. “All the focus is on can we help people save more.”

Currently, employees may contribute up to $18,000 a year to the tax-deferred accounts, with those 50 and older able to contribute up to $24,000. Savings are typically invested in mutual funds.

Brady was expected to introduce tax overhaul legislation next week, as Trump has long promised. Republican leaders want Congress to approve the measure by the end of this year. It includes a sharp cut in the corporate tax rate.

But many details are still being worked out, including how to offset revenue that would be lost to tax cuts. One way to do that might be to limit pre-tax 401(k) contributions, which would help the government realize more revenue in the near term but would result in a decline in revenue generation down the road.

Earlier this week, after The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported that Republicans were considering capping annual contributions at $2,400, Trump wrote on Twitter: “There will be NO change to your 401(k)”.

Tampering with 401(k) plans, which have largely replaced defined benefit pensions in the United States, would risk alienating tens of millions of workers, as well as the mutual fund operators which rely on the plans for much of their business. Many companies match a percentage of their employees’ 401(k) contributions.

Changes to the tax-deferred savings program could also provide ammunition to Democrats, who have painted Trump’s plan, with its $6 trillion in tax cuts, as a gift to the rich and corporate America that would balloon the federal deficit.",Trump and U.S. House tax lawmaker reopen door to 401(k) changes,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-taxes/trump-and-u-s-house-tax-lawmaker-reopen-door-to-401-changes-idUSKBN1CU2MI

The company has yet to announce a date for its third-quarter earnings and management's first conference call with Wall Street analysts since it disclosed the breach last month. That is a departure from its normal practice of scheduling earnings by mid-October.

Equifax has until Nov. 9 to release its results or seek an extension from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which gives large companies 40 days after the close of a quarter to report their financials to investors.

Company representatives declined to say when the results will be issued.

Equifax is struggling to recover from one of the worst cyber attacks in history. Its shares are down about 24 percent from Sept. 7, when it announced the breach, which prompted outrage from U.S. lawmakers and consumers and the departure of its chief executive. State and federal probes into the incident are underway.

“A significant amount of uncertainty remains regarding the financial and operational impacts from Equifax’s breach,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Gary Bisbee said in a note on Monday, as he cut his recommendation on the stock to “hold” from “buy.”

Lingering questions include how the incident might hurt earnings of the Atlanta-based company, the impact on Equifax’s market share and the likelihood of the U.S. government tightening regulation of the credit reporting industry, Bisbee said.

Equifax’s shares were down 0.8 percent at $107.90 on Wednesday, having rebounded from a more than two-and-a-half-year low of $89.59 on Sept. 14.

The average analyst price target on the stock is now $124.62, down from $153.25 before the breach, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Still, 11 of the 15 analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters who cover the company have a “buy” or “strong buy” recommendation on the stock. Four others have hold ratings.

Equifax, one of the big three credit reporting bureaus along with Experian Plc (EXPN.L) and TransUnion (TRU.N), is expected to report earnings of $1.49 per share, not including one-time items, for the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That has dropped 2.1 percent over the past month, but is still above the $1.44 the company reported for the same period last year.

SEEKING CLARITY

The chief near-term risk for Equifax is how the breach will weigh on its workforce solutions unit, which provides payroll and human-resources services to companies, said Morningstar analyst Brett Horn. That unit made up about 20 percent of Equifax’s $3.1 billion in total revenue last year.

The breach may cause businesses to question whether they should provide sensitive employee information to Equifax, Horn said.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service temporarily suspended a contract worth more than $7 million it recently awarded to Equifax following another security issue with Equifax’s website.

Horn said Equifax may not be ready to provide investors with financial details about how much the incident will cost to clean up and how it will affect future earnings.

That may depend on how much of the post-breach expenses will be paid by insurers and how much the free credit monitoring and identity theft services the company is offering consumers as a result of the breach will ultimately cost.

When it finally does report earnings and talk to analysts, investors are eager for an update on the company’s search for a new chief executive, new chief security officer and new chief information officer to replace executives who departed after the hack.

Rich Sichel, senior investment strategist at The Philadelphia Trust Co, said he wants answers to some of those questions before he considers investing in the stock.

“Too much is unknown,” Sichel said. “I wouldn’t be in a bighurry to get in.”","Equifax, reeling from hack, still has no earnings report date",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CU2R1-OCABS

Haley was the first senior member of President Donald Trump’s administration to visit South Sudan, which spiraled into civil war in 2013, just two years after gaining independence from Sudan. She met one on one with Kiir for some 45 minutes.

“I let him know that the United States was at a crossroads and that every decision going forward was going to be based on his actions,” Haley told reporters after the meeting in the capital Juba.

The United Nations has warned that the violence in South Sudan, which has forced some 4 million people to flee their homes, was providing “fertile ground” for a genocide. Kiir’s government has denied U.N. allegations of ethnic cleansing.

Haley had to cut short a visit to a camp for South Sudanese displaced by the violence amid rowdy anti-Kiir protests.

“He understood that Americans were disappointed in his leadership in South Sudan, I made that very clear. And he understood that all the aid or help that he hopes will go forward is not a given,” she said.

Haley did not elaborate on what further action Washington could take, but said that Kiir “got what I was trying to say.” On Monday she said Washington was considering how to pressure Kiir into peace, though noted that withdrawing aid may not work.

The Trump administration last month imposed sanctions on two senior South Sudanese officials and the former army chief.

“We have lost trust in the government and we now need to regain that trust and the only way to regain that trust is through the actions of taking care of all of the people,” Haley told South Sudan’s Eye Radio.

PROTEST CUTS SHORT CAMP VISIT

She demanded that Kiir allow full and consistent humanitarian aid access and bring peace and stability to the country. She said she pushed a timeline for Kiir to act, but declined to elaborate.

Nhial Deng Nihal, a senior adviser to Kiir, said the president told Haley his government and a U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan had established “mechanisms that work jointly to improve and address the humanitarian problems.”

He also told reporters that Kiir said government troops “will also be observing a cessation of hostilities in order to create an atmosphere for dialogue.”

The civil war was sparked by a feud between Kiir, a Dinka, and his former deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer. It has plunged parts of the world’s youngest nation into famine.

A fragile peace deal broke down last year and Machar fled the country. He is being held in South Africa to stop him stirring up trouble, sources told Reuters in December.

Haley had to cut short a visit to a camp in Juba, where U.N. peacekeepers are protecting some 30,000 displaced people, after hundreds of rowdy pro-Machar protesters blocked nearby roads, yelling “Salva Kiir is a killer” and “Welcome USA.”

Protesters held a large sign that read “South Sudan IDPs (internally displaced people) and refugees love President Trump, the peacemaker and supporter of human rights.”

A spokeswoman for the U.N. mission said the protest “started to gain momentum after (Haley) left, IDPs became upset that she was not able to meet with them.” Haley was meeting with a displaced family when she had to leave early due to security concerns.

The previous U.S. administrations of President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama were heavily involved in the birth of South Sudan, which signed a peace accord with Sudan in 2005 and gained independence in 2011.","U.S. has lost trust in South Sudan, Trump envoy tells president",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southsudan-usa/u-s-has-lost-trust-in-south-sudan-trump-envoy-tells-president-idUSKBN1CT2ZB?il=0

Xi led his team in order of rank on to a stage at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, overlooking Tiananmen Square, culminating a week-long party conclave at which he laid out his vision for an increasingly prosperous China confident of its place on the world stage.

Apart from Xi, Premier Li Keqiang was the only one to retain his spot amid sweeping changes on the Politburo Standing Committee. There has been persistent speculation Xi could seek to stay on in some capacity beyond the end of his customary second five years in power, which began on Wednesday.

All seven Standing Committee members are men in their 60s and, for the first time, none was born before China’s 1949 Communist revolution.

The make-up of the committee, which has ultimate control over the world’s second-largest economy, appeared to be a compromise to include a blend of Xi allies and those considered loyal to party elders, including Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, former presidents whose networks still wield influence.

Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, said Xi appeared to have traded securing favorable amendments to the constitution in exchange for a compromise on the make-up of the Standing Committee, a line-up he likened to a “team of rivals”.

The member considered closest to Xi is Li Zhanshu, who has often accompanied Xi on overseas trips in a chief-of-staff-style role as the head the party’s General Office.

Li, who is not related to the premier, was named the third-ranked member, meaning he will most likely assume the role of head of the largely rubber-stamp parliament. That will not be confirmed until parliament meets in March.

Xi had already strengthened his hand considerably ahead of the announcement, with his political theory and “Belt and Road” infrastructure-led development strategy put into the party constitution. He was named the party’s “core” last year.

POLITICAL CAPITAL

Guangdong party secretary Hu Chunhua and Chongqing party boss Chen Miner had been previously seen as prominent contenders to succeed Xi among the party’s so-called sixth generation of leaders but were not included in the Standing Committee.

Instead, both were named to the wider 25-member Politburo, a rung below the Standing Committee.

“He’s consolidated his power without making unnecessary problems for himself,” said David Zweig, a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

“The costs of keeping Wang Qishan or getting Chen Miner were too high. He didn’t need to do it.”

Wang, who led Xi’s sweeping anti-graft campaign and was considered China’s second most-powerful politician, is above retirement age; Chen was comparatively junior.

While the Standing Committee bears the hallmarks of compromise, the new Politburo is stacked with more than a dozen Xi allies, including Chen, Beijing party boss Cai Qi, economic adviser Liu He and Ding Xuexiang, who is expected to become Xi’s chief of staff as director of the party’s General Office.

“Xi has managed to put a lot of his own people there, as much as possible,” said Bo Zhiyue, a New Zealand-based expert on Chinese politics.

“Most of Xi’s close associates are too junior to be put into the Politburo Standing Committee right away.”

‘DREAM TEAM’

Blanket state media coverage made no mention of factional politics or alliances, while an editorial on the official People’s Daily’s WeChat account hailed the new seven-man line-up as a “dream team” to lead China into its “new era”.

Xi, who has sought to revitalize the Communist Party’s role across Chinese society, made no mention of who his successor might be as he introduced his new Standing Committee at a media event broadcast live around the country. His remarks were translated consecutively into English.

Xi did not take questions, but said the party had weathered trials and tribulations.

“We will also work with other nations to build a global community with a shared future, and make new and greater contributions to the noble cause of peace and development for all humanity,” he said.

Xi and Li were first promoted to the Standing Committee at the 17th Party Congress in 2007, in a clear signal that the pair would succeed Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao and occupy the top two offices - which they did five years later.

“Despite some sales lift from queso and pricing, we view this result and outlook as disappointing, particularly for those looking for a more meaningful recovery,” Credit Suisse analyst Jason West said in a research note.

Chipotle has been struggling to recover from a bruising string of food safety lapses that started in late 2015, which has pushed down the value of its stock by more than half since touching a record high in August 2015.

“We continue on the sidelines given our belief that a sales recovery will take longer than many investors expect as we maintain that competitive intrusion is the most significant long term issue for Chipotle,” Canaccord’s Collier wrote in a note.

McDonald’s on Tuesday reported market-beating same-store sales.

Chipotle said comparable sales so far in the fourth quarter quarter-to-date were up 2-3 percent, but did not issue longer-term outlook, leading analysts to say this eroded some of their confidence in the company’s turnaround.

The median price target on the stock - the most shorted among U.S. restaurants - has dropped 15 percent to $325.58 in just one month, Thomson Reuters data shows.

“Here, today, in the very heart of European democracy, we have women being molested and harassed,” Polish member Jadwiga Wisniewska told the chamber. “This is unimaginable.”

This month’s allegations about Hollywood producer Weinstein - who denies all accusations of non-consensual sex - has set off a wave of reflection about sexual harassment in Europe as in other parts of the world.

Several MEPs held signs bearing the Twitter hashtag #metoo. “I have been sexually harassed, just like millions of other women in the European Union,” German member Terry Reintke said.

“It is about time that we very clearly say that we should not be ashamed. The perpetrators should be ashamed.”

In the EU institutions themselves, with an unusual mix of powerful hierarchies, politics and a culturally diverse workforce drawn from across the continent, women are accusing managers of doing too little for too long to stamp out abuse.

“We’ve all heard the stories and rumors going on for many years,” Britain’s Margot Parker said during the debate in Strasbourg, the Brussels-based parliament’s second home.

“The very place that claims to legislate against this sort of disgusting behavior is turning a blind eye to its practice.”

This week, Parliament President Antonio Tajani spoke of his “shock and indignation” after a Sunday Times report on more than a dozen mostly young female parliamentary aides who complained of groping, stalking and other harassment by male lawmakers.

He pledged to step up existing protections to encourage people to come forward, something campaigners say is overdue.

“NO SURPRISE”

“It comes as no surprise to those of us working for years on the fight to end violence against women that sexual harassment is also widespread throughout the EU institutions,” said the European Women’s Lobby, a Brussels-based, pan-European organization.

“There is still inadequate means to ensure that women still feel safe enough to come forward to report incidences.”

At the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU which employs 32,000 people, 55 percent of them women, measures have been in place since 2006 to prevent any form of harassment and to protect whistleblowers.

Over the past five years an average of 13 complaints have been made each year, with disciplinary sanctions being imposed in about four cases each year, Commission figures show.

Commenting on those figures, European Women’s Lobby secretary-general Joanna Maycock, told Reuters that the number of complaints seemed “very low” for the size of the workforce.

The Commission’s gender equality chief, Czech Commissioner Vera Jourova, said last week that she had herself been a victim of sexual harassment in the past but saw “stigmatization” as preventing many women in Brussels from speaking up.

The Weinstein affair was, she feared, the “peak of the iceberg”.

Jourova was speaking to Brussels’ Politico news service, which has set up a confidential website that has garnered more than 30 allegations in a week, from both women and men, of offences including rape, connected to the European Parliament.",EU too?

In September, U.S. officials ordered Kaspersky’s products removed from government computers, saying the firm was vulnerable to Kremlin influence and that using the software could jeopardize national security.

After that announcement, the Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 5 that hackers working for the Russian government appeared to have targeted a National Security Agency (NSA) worker by using Kaspersky software to identify classified files in 2015. The New York Times reported on Oct. 10 that Israeli officials reported the operation to the United States after they hacked into Kaspersky's network.

The Russian government has denied any involvement.

Kaspersky began an internal inquiry in a bid to restore trust. On Wednesday, it said it had stumbled on the code in 2014 when the consumer version of its popular software flagged a zip file as malicious on a U.S. computer.

While reviewing the file’s contents, a Kaspersky analyst discovered it contained the source code for a hacking tool later attributed to what Kaspersky calls the Equation Group. The software removed the file and the analyst reported the matter to Chief Executive Eugene Kaspersky, who ordered that the copy of the code be destroyed, the company said.

Kaspersky said it assumed the 2014 source code episode was connected to the NSA’s loss of files described in media reports.

“We deleted the archive because we don’t need the source code to improve our protection technologies and because of concerns regarding the handling of classified materials,” said Kaspersky spokeswoman Sarah Kitsos.

Source code, which is normally hidden and gives instructions to computers, would have posed no danger to the Kaspersky customer.

Former employees told Reuters in July that the company had on rare occasions removed uninfected files. Kaspersky spokeswoman Yuliya Shlychkova on Wednesday said removals of such uninfected material happen “extremely rarely.”

Kaspersky said no third parties saw the code, though the media reports said the spy tool had ended up in the hands of the Russian government.

Kaspersky denied the Journal’s report that its programs searched for keywords including “top secret.”

The company said it found no evidence that it had been hacked by Russian spies or anyone except the Israelis, though it suggested others could have obtained the tools by hacking into the American’s computer through a back door it later spotted there.

The NSA declined to comment on Kaspersky’s review.

The new 2014 date of the incident is of interest because Kaspersky only announced its discovery of an espionage campaign by the Equation Group in February 2015. At that time, Reuters cited former NSA employees who said that Equation Group was an NSA project.

Kaspersky’s Equation Group report was one of its most celebrated findings, since it indicated that the group could infect firmware on most computers. That gave the NSA almost undetectable presence.

Shlychkova said the American machine’s files were found before the big Equation Group announcement but after Kaspersky had discovered Equation software on a machine in the Middle East. She said that occurred in March 2014.

Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who led calls in the U.S. Congress to purge Kaspersky products from federal government networks, on Wednesday sent a letter to DHS acting Secretary Elaine Duke and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, urging the U.S. government to declassify information about Kaspersky products.

The step was necessary, Shaheen wrote, “to allow the American people to make informed decisions about risks to their privacy and security.”

Also on Tuesday, Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill sent a separate letter to DHS asking what was being done to ensure federal agencies were complying with the ban on Kaspersky products.

Kaspersky’s consumer anti-virus software has won high marks from reviewers.

Asia’s third-largest economy will grow at 6.7 percent in the fiscal year ending March 2018, the slowest since the new methodology of measuring gross domestic product (GDP) was introduced in the 2014-15 fiscal year, according to the latest poll of 30 economists.

The poll was taken on Oct. 12-24, closing just before India announced a $32.43 billion plan to recapitalise state banks, a bid to tackle a major drag on the economy.

While the latest poll’s number for this year matches the International Monetary Fund’s toned-down forecast - that was 7.2 percent earlier - it is a sharp decline from 7.3 percent the July Reuters poll showed.

But despite the broad and marked slowdown expected in economic activity, India’s projected growth rate will be second to the world’s fastest growing major economy - China - if predictions are met. [ECILT/CN]

A majority of economists said the risk to their already lower outlook for Indian growth this fiscal year is skewed further to the downside as stressed corporate balance sheets prevent a recovery in private capital spending and mounting bad loans at Indian banks remain a burden.

All but three of 23 respondents who answered an extra question said the government had imposed too many sweeping changes for the economy in a short period of time, referring to demonetization and the GST, and that has lowered growth expectations.

“Demonetization was unnecessary and had a huge disruptive effect. Even before the economy could recover from that shock, came (the) GST,” said Kunal Kundu, vice president and India economist at Societe Generale.

“More importantly, the government was not prepared adequately enough, thereby transmitting further shock to the slowing economy.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision last November to scrap high-value old banknotes wiped out about 86 percent of currency in circulation virtually overnight in an economy which is largely cash-based.

That has hurt consumer spending, which powers more than half of the $2 trillion economy.

But just when some improvement in data raised hopes that the impact of the cash clampdown had been absorbed, confusion among businesses on pricing goods and services after the July 1 implementation of GST has impacted activity.

The economy grew at 5.7 percent annually in the April-June quarter, its lowest level in more than three years and well below expectations.

However, nearly three-fourths of 23 respondents who answered an extra question said India does not need a stimulus package and instead should focus on fiscal discipline which is vital for investment from outside the country to flow in.

“There is limited scope for any stimulus when the budget fiscal deficit projections will anyways be breached on account of revenue shortfall,” said Abhishek Upadhyay, economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership.

Despite bleak growth expectations, the Reserve Bank of India is forecast to keep key policy rates on hold through mid-2019, focusing on anchoring inflation.

The latest Reuters poll predicted retail inflation to average 3.5 percent this fiscal year, unchanged from the July median but below the RBI’s medium-term target of 4.0 percent.

Inflation was expected to average 4.5 percent in 2018-2019, compared to 4.3 percent in the previous poll.

“With inflation trending up directionally and RBI’s insistence on 4 percent target on a durable basis, a convincing case for a rate cut appears less plausible,” said Madhavi Arora, economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank.

House Speaker Paul Ryan already sounded a bit triumphant on Tuesday when he said Congress was “on the verge of doing something that is going to make a big difference for so many families.” On Thursday, his chamber is expected to approve a Senate budget resolution that would allow tax cuts to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. The House had initially approved a plan that didn’t allow for any such additions.

Independent tax analysts expect the White House-backed reform plan will add $2 trillion to $5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. But proposals to offset tax cuts are already facing opposition. On Monday, Trump tweeted his rejection to proposals that would cap tax-deferred employee contributions to 401(k) retirement accounts to $2,400 a year. Currently, workers up to 50 years old can contribute up to $18,000 a year. Senate Finance Chair Orrin Hatch said Congress may disagree with the president on some of these issues.

Trump also expressed doubt about a Republican option to add a fourth tax bracket for the top wealthy earners, which could leave them paying as much or more than they do now. At the same time, Republicans are squabbling over a proposal to repeal deductions for state and local taxes, which would raise $1 trillion over a decade.

Resolving the differences was never going to be easy. Trump may have complicated the task on Tuesday when he tweeted fresh insults at Republican Senator Bob Corker, who has been skeptical about the tax effort.

Airlines contacted by Reuters said the new measures could include short security interviews with passengers at check-in or the boarding gate, sparking concerns over flight delays and extended processing time.

They will affect 325,000 airline passengers on about 2,100 commercial flights arriving daily in the United States, on 180 airlines from 280 airports in 105 countries.

U.S. Transportation Security Administration officials are giving some airlines or airports additional time to comply with the new interviews as long the U.S. government has approved security plans by Thursday.

“TSA will continue to work closely with our aviation partners and verify that all security enhancements are accurately implemented,” TSA spokeswoman Lucy Martinez said in a statement Wednesday.

The United States announced the new rules in June to end its restrictions on carry-on electronic devices on planes coming from 10 airports in eight countries in the Middle East and North Africa in response to concerns that explosives could be hidden in electronic devices.

Those restrictions were lifted in July, but the Trump administration said it could reimpose measures on a case by case basis if airlines and airports did not boost security.

European and U.S. officials said at the time that airlines had 120 days to comply with the measures, including increased passenger screening. The 120-day deadline is Thursday. Airlines had until late July to expand explosive trace detection testing.

“We see this as a big issue for China Airlines,” Steve Chang, senior vice president of the Taiwanese firm told reporters on Wednesday, adding the airline was trying to consult with the American Institute in the country over the issue.

Korean Airlines, South Korea’s flagship carrier, also said it had a lot of concerns with the new measures.

“We are asking customers to show up at the airport early ... It’s just inconvenient for the passengers,” President and Chief Operating Officer Walter Cho told Reuters in Taipei.

Lufthansa Group said on Tuesday the measures would be in place by Thursday and travelers could face short interviews at check-in or at the gate.

Economy passengers on Lufthansa’s Swiss airline have been asked to check in at least 90 minutes before departure.

Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said it would suspend in-town check-in and self bag-drop services for passengers booked on direct flights to the United States. The airline said passengers would also have short security interviews and it has advised travelers to arrive three hours before departure.

Singapore Airlines Ltd said the security checks could include inspections of personal electronic devices as well as security questioning during check-in and boarding.

Airlines for America, a U.S. trade group, said the changes “are complex security measures” but praised U.S. officials for giving airlines flexibility in meeting the new rules.

Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said the industry understood security threats to aviation were made regularly but in this case the U.S. government had not shared any specific dangers before changing the rules.

“What we have seen is very strange,” he told reporters in Taipei. “Unilateral measures announced without any prior consultation... That is something that is very concerning and disturbing.”

At their annual meeting in Taipei, Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) members passed a resolution calling for security measures to be risk-based, outcome-focused and proportionate to the probable threat.

“Unilateral actions taken by individual governments reacting to emerging threats may result in unnecessary disruption or lead to unintended safety consequences,” said the members.

AAPA includes most large Asian airlines but not mainland Chinese carriers.

“The risk is other countries make similar demands,” AAPA Director General Andrew Herdman said.

U.S. authorities in June also ordered increased security around aircraft and in passenger areas, and other places where travelers can be cleared by U.S. officials before they depart and ordered enhanced screening of personal electronic devices. Some of those new requirements take effect this week as well.

The TSA said in July it was imposing new security rules requiring U.S. domestic airline travelers to remove all electronic items larger than mobile phones such as tablets, e-readers and video game consoles from carry-on baggage for screening.",Airlines get ready for new U.S. security rules from Thursday,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-airlines-security/airlines-get-ready-for-new-u-s-security-rules-from-thursday-idUSKBN1CT2GE

O Brasil realizará na sexta-feira seu primeiro leilão em pré-sal em quatro anos. Os oito blocos em oferta detêm bilhões de barris em reservas e, pela primeira vez, o país permitirá que petroleiras estrangeiras sejam operadoras dos campos da região, e não só a Petrobras.

A Shell avalia que pode bombear o petróleo desses campos do pré-sal abaixo do custo de equilíbrio considerado pela empresa, de 40 dólares por barril, disse à Reuters o vice-presidente executivo da divisão de águas profundas da companhia, Wael Sawan.

A alta qualidade e o volume de produção que os poços do pré-sal podem proporcionar os tornam uma proposta atraente, disse ele.

“Acho que o Brasil realmente tem um subsolo naturalmente abençoado, que lhe permite competir com o melhor do que está lá fora no mundo”, comentou ele no intervalo de uma conferência de petróleo no Rio de Janeiro.

Sawan preferiu não dar detalhes sobre quais blocos a Shell estaria interessada ou se a companhia daria lances com empresas parceiras.

Reformas no Brasil realizadas sob o governo do presidente Michel Temer tornaram as reservas de petróleo algo mais atraente, disse Sawan. Se a Shell não pudesse produzir o óleo abaixo de 40 dólares por barril, não seria capaz de operar os blocos, acrescentou.

Como outras empresas de petróleo, a Shell cortou os custos desde que os preços da commodity caíram a partir de 2014 e reduziu a participação em campos petrolíferos de maior custo.

A Shell é a segunda maior produtora de petróleo do Brasil e principal parceira da Petrobras na produção do pré-sal.

Seu projeto em Libra, um bloco que a Shell ganhou como parte de um consórcio no primeiro leilão do pré-sal, em 2013, deve produzir o primeiro petróleo, ainda em teste, em novembro ou dezembro, disse o executivo. Isso ocorre alguns meses após julho, data originalmente programada.

A Petrobras é a operadora desse projeto, e a francesa Total e as chinesas CNOOC e CNPC também estão no consórcio.

GOLFO DO MÉXICO

A Shell tomará uma decisão final sobre investimento em seu projeto bilionário Vito, no Golfo do México dos Estados Unidos, em 2018, disse Sawan.

“Estamos bem avançados no projeto, testando onde o mercado está, e, em última análise, a decisão virá em 2018, seja sim ou não”, afirmou.

Se a Shell prosseguir com o projeto, o Vito se tornaria um centro de produção para a empresa na região, disse ele.

A Shell também estaria interessada em desenvolver projetos de energia no leste do Golfo do México se a administração do presidente dos EUA, Donald Trump, acabar com a moratória sobre a perfuração na área, disse ele.

Trump assinou uma ordem executiva em abril com o objetivo de abrir mais terrenos offshore para o leasing de petróleo e gás, levando a uma revisão que poderia levantar as proibições de perfuração no leste do Golfo do México, entre outras áreas.

Dem Berliner und zehn weiteren Beschuldigten wird Mitgliedschaft in einer terroristischen Vereinigung vorgeworfen. Das Gericht im Istanbuler Bezirk Caglayan eröffnete den Prozess zunächst mit der Feststellung der Identitäten. Für die Bundesregierung verfolgte der deutsche Generalkonsul in Istanbul den Prozessauftakt im Gerichtssaal. Es sei noch keine endgültige Entscheidung zu erwarten, sagte eine Außenamts-Sprecherin in Berlin. “Die Erwartung unsererseits wäre, dass es (...) eine Entscheidung über U-Haft Ja oder Nein gibt.”

Den Beschuldigten, darunter mehrere Vertreter der Menschenrechtsorganisation Amnesty International (AI), drohen bis zu 15 Jahre Haft. Steudtner war am 5. Juli mit anderen Aktivisten bei einem Seminar auf einer türkischen Insel festgenommen worden. “Es handelte sich um ein Treffen auf einer Insel vor Istanbul, veranstaltet von Vertretern mehrerer Menschenrechtsorganisationen, mit dem Thema digitale Sicherheit und Stressabbau”, sagte die Türkei-Expertin von AI-Deutschland, Amke Dietert, im RBB. “Für beides ist Peter Steudtner ein Experte.”

AI-GENERALSEKRETÄR: AM ENDE NUR FREILASSUNG MÖGLICH

Die Polizei riegelte den Vorplatz vor dem Gerichtsgebäude im Istanbuler Bezirk Caglayan ab, auf dem sich rund 50 Demonstranten und Journalisten versammelten. “Vor dem Hintergrund der absurden Vorwürfe könnte es, wenn es ein rechtsstaatliches Verfahren heute gibt, eigentlich am Ende des Tages nur eine Freilassung geben”, sagte vor Ort der Generalsekretär von Amnesty International in Deutschland, Markus Beeko. “Aber wir werden sehen, ob die türkische Justiz sich hier weiter instrumentalisieren lässt.”

Von den Beschuldigten sitzen acht in Untersuchungshaft. Unter den mit Steudtner im Juli Festgenommenen war auch die Direktorin der türkischen Sektion von AI, Idil Eser. Der Vorsitzende von AI in der Türkei, Taner Kilic, war in einem anderen Verfahren einige Monate zuvor inhaftiert worden, bevor sein Fall diesem Prozess zugeordnet wurde. Unter den Beschuldigten ist auch der Schwede Ali Gharavi.

Die Bundesregierung hat mehrfach Steudtners Freilassung gefordert. Als Reaktion auf seine Inhaftierung hatte die Bundesregierung die Reisehinweise für Touristen in der Türkei verschärft. Eine Sprecherin des Auswärtigen Amtes in Berlin sagte, zuletzt habe die Leiterin der Rechts- und Konsularabteilung am 13. Oktober Steudtner in der Haft besucht.

In its medium-term budget policy statement, the Treasury said the deficit was likely to reach 4.3 percent of gross domestic product in the 2017/18 fiscal year, which began in April. It had previously estimated a deficit of 3.1 percent.

The projected deficit would be the highest since 2009. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 3.9 percent.

“The period ahead is not going to be an easy one,” Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said in his budget speech to parliament. “Following several years of expenditure restraint, further budget cuts will involve hard choices and difficult compromises.”

The rand fell to its lowest in 10 months against the dollar in response and bonds weakened. South Africa’s sovereign dollar bonds also fell.

“More worrying for markets, however, was the minister’s admission that the deficit will remain essentially stable over the coming three years,” Capital Economics Africa economist John Ashbourne said.

“Previous budgets have always included the optimistic prediction that things will improve later in the forecast period.”

The Treasury also lowered its forecast for this year’s economic growth, to 0.7 percent from an earlier estimate of 1.3 percent. Since a 2009 recession, growth has fallen short of the government’s target of 5.4 percent, the level economists say is needed to curb unemployment, which stands at 27.7 percent.

Weak growth has stymied the government’s ability to generate revenue and lower its gross debt, which is expected to rise by nearly 1 trillion rand in the next three years, to 59.7 percent of GDP.

The economic gloom is compounded by allegations of corruption in state-owned companies and claims of influence-peddling in government that have hurt investor confidence.

Political uncertainty is growing before an African National Congress conference in December. The conference will elect a new party leader to succeed President Jacob Zuma, who is battling several scandals, including corruption allegations.

The poor budget numbers came as hundreds of university students marched to Parliament on Wednesday, clashing with police, as they demanded free higher education. Weeks of protests for free education last year led to several universities closing temporarily.

BAILOUTS, NUCLEAR

Credit downgrades have put off investors, and the Treasury warned that capital outflows could destabilise the economy. S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s are scheduled to review South Africa in November. Fitch has not published its review calendar for South Africa.

The rating agencies won’t like the policy statement, BNP Paribas South Africa economist Jeff Schultz said. “Not enough was done to instil confidence that fiscal consolidation remains front of mind for the Treasury,” Schultz said.

Also worrying are bailouts of state companies - a total of 13.7 billion rand ($984.87 million) to just South African Airways and South African post office. Gigaba said the bailouts threatened the Treasury’s spending ceiling and to avoid a breach it would sell part of its stake in telecoms company Telkom.

Investors are also watching plans by the government to build costly nuclear power plants, which Gigaba said would be considered once the economy recovers.

“Nuclear is not off the agenda,” he said. “The point I have emphasized is that the country and the budget cannot afford it.”

Les Pixel 2 et 2XL, lancés jeudi au prix de départ de 649 dollars, sont à la pointe de l‘offensive lancée par Google pour concurrencer l‘iPhone d‘Apple.

Google a dit dimanche qu‘il voulait déterminer si les écrans du Pixel 2 étaient affectés par un problème de rétention de l‘image, à la suite des informations publiées par le blog AndroidCentral après une semaine d‘utilisation du combiné.

Cette rétention (dite “burn-in”) n‘apparaît habituellement qu‘après plusieurs années d‘usage.

Google devra sans doute arrêter la production s‘il y a un problème, a dit Ryan Reith, analyste du consultant IDC.

“Nous prenons très au sérieux toute information relative à un problème et nos ingénieurs enquêtent très rapidement”, a déclaré à Reuters Mario Queiroz, vice-président de Google chargé des produits Pixel. “Nous en dirons plus dès que nous aurons des données pertinentes”.

Google avait dit auparavant qu‘il pourrait implanter un nouveau logiciel après que des utilisateurs eurent fait état d‘un reflet bleu sur l‘écran de 6 pouces du Pixel 2XL.

Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the committee, said two of the nominees were of “grave concern”: Bill Wehrum, nominated for assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, and Michael Dourson to head up the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention.

Carper called Dourson “one of the most troubling nominees I have ever considered during my time on this committee.”

Senator James Inhofe of oil-producing Oklahoma, the panel’s senior Republican, praised the passage of the nominees and urged the full Senate to quickly confirm them so they can “improve public health within the scope of the EPA’s authority.”

Republicans say the EPA under former President Barack Obama overstepped its authority to regulate. Scott Pruitt, President Donald Trump’s EPA administrator, has said the agency had an “activist agenda” under former President Barack Obama.

Pruitt has worked to do away with regulations pushed through by the Obama administration, and has proposed scrapping the landmark Clean Power Plan that sought to curb emissions linked to climate change. Pruitt sued the agency more than a dozen times when he was Oklahoma’s attorney general.

The first visit to Russia by a German president since 2010 happened as relations remain strained over Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and a pro-Russian separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine, as well as German accusations of Russian meddling in its politics, something Moscow denies.

“It’s essential that we use this opportunity for us as presidents to continue our dialogue to try to improve our bilateral relations, the state of which we can’t be happy about,” Steinmeier told Putin at the start of talks.

Steinmeier, a Social Democrat who previously served as foreign minister, has long called for increased engagement with Moscow.

His party, which will go into opposition after four years in a coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, wants a gradual easing of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow for its role in Ukraine.

Steinmeier has also launched a disarmament initiative he hopes will spur Russia and the United States to embark on talks about reducing conventional weapons.

Merkel, who has resisted moves to ease sanctions on Russia, is now trying to forge a three-way alliance with the pro-business Free Democrats and the environmental Greens.

A new Russia policy is unlikely to take shape until coalition negotiations begin in late November, but the Greens have generally backed a hard-line stance against Moscow for its annexation of Crimea and backing for the Syrian government.",German president tells Putin: we need to work on our relationship,https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-germany-putin-steinmeier/german-president-tells-putin-we-need-to-work-on-our-relationship-idINKBN1CU249

Yet one group is chronically under-represented among the political elite: women.

The founding father of communist China, Mao Zedong, may have once said that women “hold up half the sky” but when the twice-a-decade party congress selected a new batch of top leaders this week, females weren’t holding up much at all.

No women made it onto the elite Politburo Standing Committee, the group of seven men at the pinnacle of the party. None ever have.

In the new Politburo, only one of its 25 members is a woman -- Sun Chunlan, head of the party body charged with outreach to non-Communists. It is her second term and she is likely to retire in five years. On the previous Politburo, there were two women, Sun and Vice Premier Liu Yandong - who is past retirement age and has stepped down from the Politburo.

One rung down, just 4.9 percent of the new Central Committee, a mere 10 of the body’s 204 members, are women. That number was unchanged from the outgoing Central Committee, which presided for five years, but lower than in 2007-2012 when there were 13.

(For a graphic on 'Women in China's Communist Party' click tmsnrt.rs/2lcfg0w)

The State Council Information Office, which doubles as the party’s propaganda department, did not respond to faxed questions for comment on why there are so few women in senior party positions.

By way of comparison, five members of U.S. President Donald Trump’s 24-member cabinet are women, and about 20 percent of the U.S. Congress are female. In Japan, two out of 20 members of the cabinet are women as are about 10 percent of the lower house lawmakers newly elected on Sunday.

ASTRONAUTS AND HOUSEKEEPERS

At the Chinese party congress itself, the overall numbers were stronger: about a quarter of its 2,287 delegates were women - roughly commensurate with the proportion in the roughly 90 million-member party.

But with most senior leadership posts in the hands of men, activist Xiong Jing, an NGO project manager who edits a feminist social media site, said many of the women delegates to the party congress were there merely as “decoration”.

“This problem is a cliché,” she said. “With the political system as it is now, I think even if more women were involved, whether as party congress delegates or in government, they may be very limited in what they can do.”

The party takes the appearance of representativeness seriously when it comes to some groups.

At party congresses and annual sessions of parliament, there are delegates from China’s 56 different ethnic groups, every branch of the military and police, private businesses, the state sector and, of course, the government.

The party congress this year featured delegates who were astronauts, athletes, actors, judges, farmers and more. There was even a delegate representing housekeepers, who showed up in her apron and maid’s cap.

“PARTY OF THE PEOPLE”

For women in general in China, political empowerment is lacking. China ranked 74th in political empowerment of women out of 144 countries in the World Economic Forum’s global Gender Gap Report last year. In 2006, it was no. 52 out of 115.

Leta Hong Fincher, a New York-based sociologist and author of the forthcoming book “Betraying Big Brother: The Rise of China’s Feminist Resistance”, says women in China are losing ground amid a resurgence of traditional gender norms.

“It’s my impression that the Communist Party is fundamentally not interested in having women at the senior levels at all,” she said.

In China’s pre-reform command economy under Mao, women were drafted into the workforce and recruited into nation-building.

The most powerful woman since the communist takeover in 1949 was Mao’s third wife, Jiang Qing. She and members of her “Gang of Four” were arrested after Mao’s death in 1976 and blamed for the excesses of the chaotic Cultural Revolution.

More recently, Hong Fincher says, the party has been spooked by China’s demographic challenges - an aging population, shrinking labour force and falling birth rates - and has aggressively promoted the idea that women should be getting married and having babies.

To be sure, in Chinese business there are some prominent female chief executives, such as Zhang Xin at real estate developer Soho China (0410.HK) and Zhou Qunfei, the billionaire founder of Lens Technology 399433.SZ.

And the party and government pay lip service to gender equality. The state constitution guarantees women the same rights as men.

“The government ... wants to appear to be taking gender equality seriously, when in reality it is not. It is actually in full retreat with regard to gender equality,” Hong Fincher said.

The election process for party congress delegates is tightly controlled, with candidates vetted for their loyalty to the party and leadership.

But congress delegate Tang Jialing, who is a crew member on a deep-sea research submersible, suggested that the lack of women reflected the will of the people.

“We are the party of the people. It’s the people who voted in more men than women. It’s the people’s choice,” she said.",Women fail to crack China's glass ceiling as party picks new leaders,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress-women/women-fail-to-crack-chinas-glass-ceiling-as-party-picks-new-leaders-idUSKBN1CU19I

Ties between Iran and the United States have deteriorated under U.S. President Donald Trump and suffered another deep blow two weeks ago when he decided not to certify that Tehran is complying with a 2015 nuclear pact and warning he might ultimately terminate it.

Iran has reacted defiantly, dismissing Trump’s demands for the pact to be toughened up. Last week, Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, the most powerful military force in the country, said its ballistic missile program would accelerate despite U.S. and European Union pressure to suspend it.

“The defense capabilities and strength of the country are not negotiable or up for haggling,” Khamenei was cited as saying at a ceremony at the Imam Ali army officer’s academy in Tehran, according to state media.

The ramping up of rhetoric on both sides has raised the specter of a possible military confrontation between the two countries. In recent months, small boats from the Revolutionary Guards navy have swarmed close to American warships in the Gulf, prompting the U.S. navy to fire flares and warning shots.

Under the landmark 2015 deal between Iran and world powers, the Islamic Republic agreed to curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of a number of sanctions.

The U.S. Senate is considering new legislation which could lead to Washington restoring sanctions on Iran should it test a ballistic missile able to carry a warhead or bar nuclear inspectors from any sites.

In response, Khamenei said last week that Tehran would stick to the nuclear accord with world powers as long as the other signatories respected it, but would “shred” the deal if Washington pulled out.",Iran says defense capabilities not negotiable amid U.S. pressure,https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-security-khamenei/iran-says-defence-capabilities-not-negotiable-amid-u-s-pressure-idINKBN1CU1JL?il=0

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling coalition has retained a two-thirds “super majority,” paving the way for him to become the nation’s longest-serving leader.

The win could give the nearly five-year old reflation programme a second wind. But there have been years of bold reform pledges from Abe, with inconsistent follow through. The risk is he uses this fresh mandate to revise the country’s pacifist constitution first, and take his time with reforms. That could deflate a long-running rally in Japanese stocks that has seen the Nikkei index rise 26.9 percent since Nov. 4, 2016.

The glacial pace of policy moves to loosen markets, cut red tape and catalyze entrepreneurship helps explain why Japanese wages are flat even though the country is enjoying its lowest unemployment rate in 23 years. The economy has grown for six straight quarters, the longest expansion since 2006, yet companies remain reluctant to share more profit with workers, or otherwise put their combined $2.7 trillion of cash reserves to work. Real wages rose just 0.1 percent in August after falling 1.1 percent in July, frustrating progress by the Bank of Japan toward its 2 percent inflation goal.

Theoretically Sunday‘s results clear the way for Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party to get more aggressive on the economic front. Abenomics has three “arrows.” Arrow No. 1, the Bank of Japan, is almost certain to maintain monetary easing, keeping the yen and bond yields under pressure. But monetary policy would have greater effect if the government would deploy the fiscal arrow by cutting the nearly 36 percent corporate tax rate. So would making life easier for startups, loosening onerous labor regulations, and improving the utilization of the female workforce – which together comprise Arrow No. 3.

Unfortunately, Abe has a deserved reputation for loose reform talk. His victory in 2014 inspired optimism that deep structural change was imminent, but instead Abe focused on re-writing the constitution. He still wants to amend Article 9, the constitutional clause preventing Japan from fielding a conventional military, as part of his legacy.

The gravelly voiced Guillaume, who thrived in Broadway musicals before starring on the TV series “Soap” and its spinoff “Benson,” died at his Los Angeles home, his wife Donna Brown Guillaume said in a statement. It is not known how long he had been battling cancer.

Robert Guillaume first played sarcastic and irascible butler Benson DuBois on the over-the-top soap opera parody series “Soap,” which debuted in 1977 and also starred Katherine Helmond, Richard Mulligan and Billy Crystal.

His work on that show won Guillaume won the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series in 1979.

His character became so popular that the ABC network created “Benson” for him and that series ran for seven seasons from 1979 to 1986. Guillaume’s character had been a butler on “Soap” but on “Benson” he served as a state governor’s director of household affairs, then state budget director, lieutenant governor and candidate for governor.

Guillaume won the Emmy for outstanding lead actor in a comedy series in 1985 for “Benson,” the last of six times that he was nominated for an Emmy playing the character. He became the first black actor to win that award.

In accepting the Emmy, he joked, “I’d like to thank Bill Cosby for not being here,” referring to the fact that the star of “The Cosby Show” and the leading contender for the award had earlier taken himself out of the running for it.

Guillaume said he was sensitive about not playing his character as a racial stereotype and was pleased that Benson evolved from being a butler to a political power player - albeit one that retained the same crotchety attitude.

‘UPWARD MOBILITY’

“In all honesty and candor and modesty, I always wanted the character to have that kind of upward mobility because it mirrored the American dream,” Guillaume told the Washington Post in 1985.

“When I took a role like Benson, which was in that time-honored sense ‘another black person in a servant’s role,’ I only took the part because it was a good part, it was a part in which I thought, with my own set of ideas about things, I could say something. And indeed that has been the case. We saw Benson was in no way anyone’s inferior.”

After the end of “Benson,” he starred in the short-lived sitcom “The Robert Guillaume Show” in 1989, as well as the series “Pacific Station” (1991-1992) and “Sports Night” (1998-2000). He suffered a stroke in 1999 on the set of “Sports Night” but was able to return to his role within weeks.

On film, Guillaume provided the voice for the mandrill Rafiki in Disney’s animated 1994 hit “The Lion King” and appeared with Morgan Freeman in the 1989 drama “Lean on Me.”

In 1977, he earned a Tony Award nomination for his role in the Broadway musical “Guys and Dolls.” He also had leading roles on stage in “Purlie” and “Golden Boy.”

Born Robert Peter Williams on Nov. 30, 1927, he changed his name to Robert Guillaume to make it more distinctive (Guillaume is French for William). He was raised by his strong-willed grandmother in a St. Louis slum after his alcoholic mother gave up her children and his father abandoned the family.

After a brief military stint, he worked a series of jobs including as a trolley driver to save money for college.

He studied music at Washington University in St. Louis, where he was noticed by a Hungarian opera singer who helped him get a scholarship to the 1957 Aspen Music Festival and School in Colorado. That was followed by an apprenticeship at a theater in Cleveland where he made his professional debut.","Robert Guillaume, star of TV's 'Benson,' dies at age 89",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CT30T-OCAEN

Over the course of several years, both companies have shifted their strategy, focusing on selling low-calorie versions of their colas and buying healthier beverage brands, as consumers move away from sugary sodas.

But Coke seems to be winning the so-called cola-wars by adopting a more aggressive approach to selling juices, teas and vitamin water and taking the lead on franchising its bottling operations to cut costs.

“Coca-Cola is clearly gaining share as evidenced by the very wide performance gap between itself and PepsiCo,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi wrote in a note.

The company had a 22 percent share of the North American non-alcoholic drinks market last year, ahead of PepsiCo’s 19 percent, according to Euromonitor data.

In the third quarter, Coca-Cola’s profit rose 38 percent to $1.45 billion and North America beverage sales rose to $2.75 billion.

In contrast, PepsiCo reported a drop in quarterly beverage sales in North America for the first time in two years, hit by weak demand for Gatorade and marketing missteps.

Coca-Cola has also reined in costs by refranchising its bottling operations - a move has helped it eliminate costs of operating a low-margin business, and given it a more predictable revenue stream.

General and selling expenses were down 20 percent in the third quarter, while cost of goods sold fell 18 percent.

Recent acquisitions of non-soda beverages such as salty mineral water brand Topo Chico, Honest Tea and Unilever’s (UNc.AS) AdeS soy-based beverages have increased the options Coca-Cola can offer to consumers.

Excluding items, the company earned a profit of 50 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate by a cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue fell 14.6 percent to $9.08 billion due to the refranchising, but beat the average estimate of $8.72 billion.

Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni called the five confidence motions to get the package approved quickly despite furious opposition from the anti-system 5-Star Movement and small leftist groups.

All five of the motions, on different articles of the law, garnered comfortable majorities, even though many leftist allies had deserted coalition ranks. The bill has already passed through the lower house. A sixth vote on another article, but which was not the subject of a confidence motion, also passed.

A final vote on the law is scheduled for Thursday morning.

The proposed voting system favors parties that form pre-election coalitions and is backed by the largest parties within Italy’s main centre-left and centre-right blocs. It will penalize groups that want to go it alone, such as 5-Star.

However, opinion polls indicate that the system, which is a mix of proportional representation and first-past-the-post, will not throw up an obvious winner, with the vote split three ways between the left, right and 5-Star.

A YouTrend survey for AGI newsagency said on Wednesday that none of the three main groups would get “anywhere near an absolute majority of seats”.

It said the only way for this to happen would be for one bloc to win more than 40 percent of the vote, adding this would trigger a landslide. At present, none of the three political groups are seen winning support of more than 33 percent.

Five-Star has denounced the reform as “an institutional coup d‘etat” and senators from the group closed their eyes, or put on a blindfold as they voted “no” in the Senate.

Hundreds of their supporters filled a central Rome square to denounce the bill, chanting “honesty” and waving party flags.

“This is a fraudulent law for people here. It ignores voting rights and instead favors amalgamations and hookups,” said Rossano Cioccolini, 56, a worker from the northern city of Milan who took a day of holiday to join the Rome rally.

“The largest party in Italy, 5-Star, will not get a look in because it doesn’t accept alliances,” he added.

The use of multiple confidence motions first in the lower house and now in the Senate has allowed the ruling centre-left coalition to truncate discussion on the bill and sidestep dozens of secret votes that could have allowed disillusioned lawmakers to betray their camp and ambush the bill.

The government says the new law is needed to harmonize the electoral system for the upper and lower houses and reduce the risk of different majorities materializing in the two chambers. Previous attempts at reform this past year have all failed.

In a letter sent to WhatsApp on Tuesday and published on Wednesday, the group of EU data protection authorities - known as the Article 29 Working Party - said the company had still not resolved its concerns about getting user consent for the data sharing.

They noted that the information given users about the privacy policy update was “seriously deficient as a means to inform their consent.”

“Whilst the WP29 (Article 29 Working Party) notes there is a balance to be struck between presenting the user with too much information and not enough, the initial screen made no mention at all of the key information users needed to make an informed choice, namely that clicking the agree button would result in their personal data being shared with the Facebook family of companies,” the letter said.

The Irish data protection authority - which has jurisdiction over Facebook in the EU because the company’s European headquarters are in Dublin - said in April that it hoped to reach a deal in the coming months on the data sharing with WhatsApp.

“Over the last year we have engaged with data protection authorities to explain how our 2016 terms and privacy policy update apply to people who use WhatsApp in Europe. We remain committed to respecting applicable law and will continue to work collaboratively with officials in Europe to address their questions,” a WhatsApp spokesman said.

The WP29 also said users’ consent was not freely given as WhatsApp effectively adopted a “take it or leave it approach in which users either signal their `consent’ to the sharing of data or they are unable to avail themselves of WhatsApp’s messaging service.”

An Apple spokesman confirmed the acquisition, which was earlier reported in New Zealand media. Both companies declined to provide details of the purchase.

Wireless charging allows users to recharge devices by placing them on a pad or other surface rather than inserting them in a cradle or attaching a cable.

Apple has been slow to adopt the technology, lagging behind its biggest rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other mobile phone companies that have offered wireless charging in some of their devices for several years.

Apple joined the industry body that develops the Qi wireless charging standard, the Wireless Power Consortium, in February. The iPhone 8 and X both support the standard.

Apple’s interest in PowerbyProxi may be driven by the latter’s other products, some of which can support transferring up to 150 watts through any non-metallic material, for wirelessly charging industrial machinery and medical equipment, said Jake Saunders, Asia Pacific vice president of ABI Research.

This could allow Apple to offer much larger pads that could quickly charge multiple consumer devices, including laptops and even electric scooters, he added.

For consumers, charging a single device on one pad may not be that appealing, “but when you get into multiple device charging it starts to get attractive”, Saunders said.

Apple recently announced its own AirPower accessory which it said would simultaneously charge up to three devices, including new versions of the Apple Watch, iPhone and AirPod charging case.

If approved at the FCC’s November meeting, the move would be a win for newspapers and broadcasters that have pushed for the change for decades, but was criticized by Democrats who said it could usher in a new era of media consolidation.

The FCC in 1975 banned cross-ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market, unless it granted a waiver, to ensure a diversity of opinions. The rule was made before the explosion of internet and cable news and Republican President Donald Trump and Pai have vowed to reduce government regulation.

“We must stop the federal government from intervening in the news business,” Pai told a congressional panel, noting that many newspapers have closed and many radio and TV stations are struggling. Pai moved earlier this year to make it easier for some companies to own a larger number of local stations.

Pai said the marketplace no longer justifies the rules, citing Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) dominance of internet advertising.

“Online competition for the collection and distribution of news is greater than ever. And just two internet companies claim 100 percent of recent online advertising growth; indeed, their digital ad revenue this year alone will be greater than the market cap of the entire broadcasting industry,” Pai said.

FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said at the hearing Wednesday the move would lead to further consolidation in the media business and should be opposed. There are three Republicans and two Democrats on the panel.

Pai also proposes to make it easier for companies to own multiple TV and radio stations in the same market and he would allow two local stations among the top four in a market to petition the FCC to merge.

The National Association of Broadcasters said it backs Pai’s plan, noting that policymakers have approved numerous “mega-mergers” among phone, cable and satellite programmers “while at the same time blocking broadcast/newspaper or radio/TV combinations in single markets.”

The group added “this nonsensical regulatory approach has harmed the economic underpinning of newspapers, reduced local journalism jobs, and punished free and local broadcasters at the expense of our pay TV and radio competitors.”

Free Press, an advocacy group, said the proposal would make it easier for Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc (SBGI.O) to complete its $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co (TRCO.N) with fewer divestitures.

The “disastrous proposal is tailor-made for Sinclair and other giant broadcast chains that push often slanted or cookie-cutter content over the public airwaves,” the group said.","FCC to loosen TV, newspaper ownership rules",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fcc-media/fcc-to-loosen-tv-newspaper-ownership-rules-idUSKBN1CU2TD?il=0

EU officials said that was a very tough goal, but one that could be achieved if London showed enough willingness.

Brussels envoys from the 27 EU states that will remain in the bloc after Britain exits on March 29, 2019, met for the first time since EU leaders last week decided not enough progress had been made in talks on the terms of the divorce with Britain to start discussions about future relations yet.

To encourage stronger efforts, EU leaders said they would start preparing now for talks on a transition period so they are ready if enough progress is made by the next summit in December.

“The process will start now, in the sense that we will meet successively... over the coming month,” one EU official involved in the talks said, adding there was likely to be discussion on the subject also during a ministerial meeting on Nov 20.

“We will prepare our thinking on the transition, the future relationship, and the possible additional guidelines for the December European Council,” the official said.

The outcome of the work would likely be presented in the December summit conclusions if leaders decide that enough progress was made on the divorce terms, officials said.

Britain wants an outline agreement with the European Union in place by the end of March 2018 on the transitional arrangements that will apply temporarily after it leaves the bloc, Brexit minister David Davis said on Wednesday.

EU officials said that was a very tough goal, but one that could be achieved if London showed enough willingness.

“It’s not so much if we can do it by the first quarter, but if we can get the UK to engage in a way that makes that possible,” the official said.

Both sides expect a transition period of around two years. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Tuesday said that would mean preserving the status quo as Britain would stay subject to EU laws and courts during that time.

In an interview with Belgium’s L‘Echo newspaper, Barnier said the only difference between full EU membership now and the transition period would be that “the British would no longer take part in decisions on European legislation”.

EU officials said the extra two years of transition would buy time for talks about a future free trade agreement, but poured cold water on the idea of extending the exit negotiations beyond that period with a view to keeping Britain within the EU.

“I don’t think anyone foresees an extension of the existing negotiation period,” the EU official said.

“We’ve already danced around with the UK for so long. First with Cameron. Then their referendum. Now this. It needs to end at some point,” the official said.

CANADA +

Businesses in Britain and in Europe are very concerned by the slow progress in Brexit talks. Not knowing what the future trade agreement between Britain and its biggest trading partner, the EU, will be, some have already started moving staff and operations out of Britain to hedge their bets.

More could follow should no more clarity be given by the two negotiating sides by the end of the year.

Barnier said that Britain could not count on a bespoke trade deal after Brexit and that since it has ruled out following the example of Norway’s relations with the EU it would probably have to model its ties on an arrangement the EU has with Canada.

Non-EU Norway currently pays for access to the bloc’s single market of 500 million people, though it is not part of the same customs union. In exchange, it is also obliged to allow the free movement of people in and out of the EU.

Britain wants to leave both the EU’s internal market and the customs union, meaning a “Canada +” scenario is more likely.

The European bloc’s trade deal with Canada, its most ambitious arrangement yet, has just taken effect. Under the deal Canada can still pursue its own bilateral trade agreements elsewhere in the world.",EU envoys start discussion on ties with London after Brexit,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-27/eu-27-start-internal-discussions-on-ties-with-london-after-brexit-idUKKBN1CU1XR

Benchmark U.S. 10-year note US10YT=RR yields hit a seven-month high of 2.475 percent, buoyed by economic data, recent optimism over progress on tax reform by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and anticipation of a nominee to head the Federal Reserve.

Equities pared losses as yields retreated, following a Fox Business interview with Trump in which he said he was still considering keeping current Fed Chair Janet Yellen in the position. The 10-year last fell 9/32 in price to yield 2.4371 percent.

“It is possible the market may be taking some solace that Yellen is still in the mix,” said Mike Beale, senior managing director at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.

“The market may be saying, maybe one of the more hawkish, (John) Taylor or (Kevin) Warsh, is off the table.”

Low interest rates have been a driving factor in the 8-year bull market, with investors pushed into equities as other lesser-yielding instruments are viewed as unattractive by comparison.

Earnings season so far has been largely positive, with 72.1 percent of the 165 S&P 500 companies that have reported to date topping expectations, matching the average for the past four quarters.

However, with U.S. indexes at record levels, investors have scrutinized earnings to see if they justify stretched valuations.

Also weighing on sentiment: President Trump and the U.S. House of Representatives’ top tax law writer reopened the door on Wednesday to changes in the 401(k) retirement savings program, just days after Trump seemed to rule out such a step. The debate could present another hurdle to a tax reform deal.

But an Iraqi military spokesman suggested an offensive - launched to wrest back territory after Kurds voted overwhelmingly for independence in a referendum in September - would continue regardless.

The Iraqi government has transformed the balance of power in the north of the country since launching its campaign last week against the Kurds, who govern an autonomous region of three northern provinces and had held a swathe of other territory.

“The fighting between the two sides will not produce a victory for any, it will take the country to total destruction,” the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) said in a statement.

The KRG proposed an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and “starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi Constitution”.

Baghdad has always considered the Kurdish secession referendum illegal. It responded last week by seizing back the city of Kirkuk, the oil-producing areas around it and other territory that the Kurds had captured from militant group Islamic State.

In a brief social media comment hinting that the campaign would continue, an Iraqi military spokesman said: “Military operations are not connected to politics.”

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has said the KRG should cancel the vote’s outcome as a pre-condition for talks. Several Shi‘ite members of parliament on Wednesday asked him to stick to his position and not to accept just a freeze of the referendum.

On Wednesday, Abadi began an official visit to neighboring Turkey and Iran. Turkey and Iran both have Kurdish populations of their own and have supported Baghdad taking a hard line on the referendum.

Now that the Kurds have swiftly yielded most of their territory outside of their autonomous region to the advancing Iraqi forces, there are signs of pressure easing. Iran announced the reopening of one of the border crossings with the Kurdistan region, which it had closed earlier this month in support of the Iraqi government.

In Ankara, President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was ready to give all support to Baghdad as it seeks to reopen a crude oil pipeline from the Kirkuk oilfields to Turkey. The pipeline goes through the Kurdish autonomous region. Iraq had stopped shipping oil through it when the Kurds took Kirkuk in 2014.

In a statement to media after meeting Abadi, Erdogan said they discussed what political, military and economic steps they could take after what he called the “illegitimate” Iraqi Kurdish referendum last month.

STRATEGICALLY VITAL

Abadi has ordered his army to recapture all disputed territory and has demanded central control of Iraq’s border crossings with Turkey, which are all located inside the Kurdish autonomous region.

Kurdish Peshmerga forces beat back an advance by Iranian-backed pro-government paramilitaries on Tuesday in the region of Rabi‘a, 40 km (25 miles) south of the Fish-Khabur border area with Turkey and Syria, Kurdish officials said.

Fish-Khabur is strategically vital because oil from both Kurdish and government-held parts of northern Iraq crosses via a pipeline there into Turkey, the main route out of the area for the exports that are crucial to any Kurdish independence bid.

The fighting so far has taken place outside the Kurdish autonomous region, but Fish-Khabur is inside it.

The fighting between the central government and the Kurds is particularly tricky for the United States which is a close ally of both sides, arming and training both the Kurds and the central government’s army to fight Islamic State.

U.S. Ambassador Douglas Silliman “worked with Iraqi security forces and Kurdish Peshmerga to end clashes endangering a Christian community and other civilians” north of Mosul, Washington’s Baghdad embassy said on its Twitter account.

The Iraqi government’s advance over the past week has been achieved with comparatively little violence, with Kurds mostly withdrawing without a fight.

But it caused Kurds to flee en masse from Tuz Khurmato, a multi-ethnic city south of Kirkuk where sectarian tension flared after Iraqi forces took control, humanitarian organizations said.Most of those displaced, estimated at nearly 30,000, are in need of urgent aid and staying in open shelters, officials from two international humanitarian organizations told Reuters.

Abadi pledged in an interview to the Wall Street Journal to disarm Shiite militias that refuse to come under his control after Islamic State’s defeat.

Iraqi forces are preparing in parallel an offensive to recapture the last patch of Iraqi territory still in the hands of Islamic State, on the border with Syria, the military said on Wednesday.

The militant group also holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is also shrinking there as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi‘ite militias backed by Iran and Russia.","Kurds offer to suspend independence drive, seek talks with Baghdad",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds-referendum/kurds-offer-to-suspend-independence-drive-seek-talks-with-baghdad-idUSKBN1CT37M

Sisi, denying accusations by human rights groups that he had allowed his forces to use torture, told a Paris news conference: “We do not practice torture and ... we must be wary of all the information published by rights organizations.”

With both France and Egypt concerned by the political vacuum in Libya and the threat from jihadist groups in Egypt, the two countries have cultivated even closer economic and military ties during Sisi’s rise to power.

But rights organizations have accused France under Macron of turning a blind eye to what they say are increasing violations of freedoms by Sisi’s government as the 2018 presidential elections approach.

“I believe in the sovereignty of states, and therefore, just as I don’t accept being lectured on how to govern my country, I don’t lecture others,” Macron said at a joint news conference with Sisi in Paris following talks.

“My deeply held conviction is that it’s in President Sisi’s interest to accompany the defense and consolidation of human rights by the Egyptian state, in the context that only he can be the judge of,” the French president said.

During their 50-minute meeting, Macron brought up the issue of a dozen cases of alleged abuses of freedoms, in particular relating to Egyptian journalists and human rights activists, sources close to Macron said.

Sisi, replying to journalists’ questions, said he was responsible for 100 million Egyptians who lived in turbulent times and alongside people who followed “extremist thought” and did not like to co-exist in peace.

“When it comes to human rights, we’re not evading an answer but I hope that we understand it in its true context of a country in Egypt’s situation. We are not in Europe, with its intellectual, cultural, civilization and human advancement. We’re in a different region.”

In a report in September, Human Rights Watch (HRW) denounced “widespread and systematic” use of torture by Egyptian security forces. The United Nations on Oct. 13 condemned an anti-gay crackdown in Egypt.

It also slammed French “indulgence” towards repression in Egypt.

Rights’ groups accuse France of abandoning principles in favor of economic and security interests.

They are particularly critical of the relationship between Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian who in his previous role as defense minister developed a personal relationship with Sisi.

French officials dismiss the criticism and say the new administration is following a policy of not openly criticizing countries over human rights so as to be more effective in private and work on a case by case basis.

Reacting to a lack of progress in respecting human rights and on democratic standards, the United States decided in August to freeze the payment of $195 million in military aid to Egypt.

Under the previous government, France concluded several major military agreements with Egypt, including the sale of 24 Rafale combat aircraft, a multi-mission frigate and two Mistral warships in contracts worth some six billion euros.

France will discuss the possible sale of more Rafale aircrafts with Sisi, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said earlier on Tuesday.","Macron avoids 'lecturing' Egypt on rights, Sisi defends his record",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CU0O5-OZATP

The comment by Scott Jones, an assistant deputy minister at Canada’s Communications Security Establishment intelligence agency, follows a warning on Friday from the United States that sophisticated hackers are targeting U.S. infrastructure, including nuclear, energy, aviation, water and manufacturing industries.

“Targeted attacks on Canadian infrastructure is something we are really worried about,” Jones said in an interview at the Reuters Cyber Security Summit in Toronto.

“Do we think something’s going to happen tomorrow? No,” Jones said. “Is it technically possible? Yes, and that’s what we’re worried about.”

Jones said Canada had seen a level of hacking activity that was “comparable” to what had been reported in the United States.

Jones said the government rarely goes public when it uncovers hacking activity because that would let attackers know they had been caught. Instead, it quietly reaches out to targeted firms.

“We try to do it very quietly to help the company become more resilient,” he said. “We’d like to try to give the defenders as much advantage as we can.”

“We’ve yet to suffer a massive critical infrastructure attack and we’ve yet to suffer a massive loss of capability,” he said, explaining why many firms have not invested in boosting cyber defenses.

He warned that some 60 nations currently have the ability to conduct offensive cyber warfare operations, including ones that could harm the grid and other infrastructure.

Five years ago, only about five nations had that capability, he added.

CSE’s Jones said the potential for cyber attacks to harm critical infrastructure has diminished over the past two years because private companies now take the threat much more seriously.

After years of investing in hydrogen fuel cells and electric-gasoline hybrids, Japanese manufacturers are talking up all-battery electric vehicles (EVs) at the annual gathering.

Many are looking to catch up with global rivals amid rapidly tightening global emissions regulations and improving technology that may make EV batteries a price-competitive option to gasoline engines in the coming years.

“As far as green cars go, vehicle powertrain electrification is a must,” said Soichiro Okudaira, president of Daihatsu Motor Co, a fully owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp, which showed its concept of the “Pro Cargo” multi-use mini electric van at the show’s first media day on Wednesday .

“EV (technology) is a great match with small cars people use everyday to commute, go shopping, because it’s easy to charge and maintain.”

Even Toyota, the country’s largest automaker which set up an EV development team just a year ago, said pure EVs would be one of the “key solutions” for cleaner vehicles in the near future.

Still, the maker of the Mirai fuel cell vehicle (FCV) is sticking to its view that the hydrogen fuel cell is the ultimate “green car” technology.

Analysts say FCVs can refuel faster than an EV can recharge and can travel longer distances, making them a potentially attractive option for larger vehicles - though the cost and limited refuelling infrastructure pose challenges.

Underlining its point, Toyota introduced two new FCVs at the show: the six-seater “Fine-Comfort Ride” concept car, and the “Sora” fuel-cell bus, which will be launched next year.

TIPPING POINT

Honda Motor Co on Wednesday announced it would launch a compact EV in Japan in 2020, following Nissan Motor Co, long a proponent of EVs and maker of the Leaf, the world’s best-selling battery electric car launched in 2010.

Slideshow (7 Images)

As advances in lithium ion battery technology improve charging times and lower production costs, some automakers and suppliers expect increased demand will boost EV sales within the next decade, lowering their price towards gasoline vehicles.

“We see this tipping point happening around 2025. By then for the customer to buy petrol or EV it will be practically same cost,” Nissan Executive Vice President Daniele Schillaci said.

“And then ... if you have the same price for EVs and petrol why would you buy traditional technology?”

While global automakers acknowledge the internal combustion engine may become obsolete in the coming decades, smaller automaker Mazda Motor Corp continues to squeeze more efficiency out of gasoline engines, developing its spark-ignition compression engine which it says could improve fuel economy by as much as 30 percent.

Others argue that reports of the death of the gasoline engine have been greatly exaggerated.

“Many in the media appear to be saying that EVs are going to take over the world, but given ongoing technology and cost limitations, it will be difficult for that to happen anytime soon,” Subaru Corp CEO Yasuyuki Yoshinaga said.","Japanese carmakers warm to EVs, but still see role for hydrogen",https://in.reuters.com/article/us-autoshow-tokyo-ev/japanese-carmakers-warm-to-evs-but-still-see-role-for-hydrogen-idINKBN1CU1XN

U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California issued her order late on Sunday, 10 months after the U.S. Supreme Court set aside a $399 million award against Samsung, whose devices include the Galaxy.

The three Apple patents covered design elements of the iPhone such as its black rectangular front face, rounded corners, and colorful grid of icons for programs and apps.

Koh’s order is a setback for Apple, which called a retrial unnecessary and said the award should be confirmed. The Cupertino, California-based company did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment.

Silicon Valley has closely followed the 6-1/2-year-old case.

Companies such as Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google have said an Apple win would encourage owners of design patents to sue for huge, unfair awards on products containing hundreds of features that are costly to develop.

The $399 million represented profit from Samsung’s sales of infringing smartphones, though the South Korean company has said it deserved reimbursement if it prevailed in the litigation.

It was part of a $548 million payment that Samsung made to Apple in December 2015.

The legal dispute concerned whether the “article of manufacture” for which Samsung owed damages included its entire smartphones, or only parts that infringed Apple patents.

Without deciding that question, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the Supreme Court last Dec. 6 that “the term ‘article of manufacture’ is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product.”

In Sunday’s order, Koh said the jury instructions at the original 2012 trial inaccurately stated the law on that issue.

She said Samsung may have been prejudiced if jurors were prevented from considering whether any infringement covered “something other than the entire phone.”

Apple contended that the jury instructions were “not erroneous,” and said it had proved that Samsung applied its patented designs to its “entire phones.”

Jurors initially awarded $1.05 billion to Apple, which was later reduced.

Samsung, in a statement, welcomed a new trial, calling it “a historic opportunity to determine how the U.S. Supreme Court’s guidance on design patent damages will be implemented.”

I want to say to everyone that's out there, to never give up, never stop fighting, no matter what you're going through in your personal life - everybody has struggles, and there's someone in the world that can relate to you just so you're not alone, just know that the more you talk about your issues and the things that you've gone through the more you can help others and that's what's really important is sharing life experiences with other people on this planet"" the singer said.

“O presidente da República foi submetido a uma sondagem vesical de alívio por vídeo e está em repouso”, informou em nota o Palácio do Planalto, acrescentando que Temer passa bem e deverá ter alta ainda nesta quarta-feira.

Temer, 77 anos, teve um desconforto no fim desta manhã e se consultou com o médico do Planalto. O médico recomendou que o presidente fosse avaliado no hospital, segundo nota divulgada mais cedo.

De acordo com fontes ouvidas pela Reuters, Temer vinha sentindo um desconforto para urinar há alguns dias e nesta manhã essa dificuldade aumentou. Depois de receber alguns parlamentares, o próprio presidente decidiu procurar o serviço médico do Planalto.

“Ele estava bem, foi caminhando. O médico do Planalto decidiu encaminhá-lo para o hospital por não ter condições de fazer os exames apropriados aqui”, disse uma das fontes.

Temer ainda estaria sendo submetido a exames e a equipe médica do Hospital do Wxército, em Brasília, está em contato com Roberto Kalil Filho, médico do presidente, em São Paulo.

“Está se analisado se será necessário o doutor Kalil vir a Brasília ou se o presidente pode ir a São Paulo. Está sendo avaliado se será preciso ou não um procedimento cirúrgico ou não, a depender do resultado dos exames”, disse a fonte.

Uma outra fonte palaciana explicou que Temer teve uma obstrução na uretra, possivelmente causada por um inchaço da próstata -o mesmo que aconteceu com o ministro da Casa Civil, Eliseu Padilha, que passou por cirurgia em fevereiro deste ano.

A assessoria de imprensa do Planalto disse a jornalistas no Hospital do Exército que Temer chegou ao local por volta das 12h50 e deve deixar a unidade assim que terminarem os exames.

Temer chegou ao Palácio do Planalto antes das 9h e começou uma agenda extensa de contato com parlamentares e ministros. De acordo com a agenda oficial, o presidente estava com o ministro do Gabinete de Segurança Institucional, Sergio Etchegoyen, quando decidiu procurar o serviço médico.

Na noite anterior, depois de um dia em que recebeu quase duas dezenas de parlamentares, Temer foi a um jantar na casa do vice-presidente da Câmara dos Deputados, Fábio Ramalho (PMDB-MG), e cerca de uma centena de deputados, de onde saiu perto da meia-noite.

Apesar do problema médico do presidente, a ordem no Planalto é continuar a negociação para conseguir quórum e manter a votação da denúncia.

Por falta de quórum a sessão acabou sendo suspensa no início da tarde. Os governistas não conseguiram alcançar o registro mínimo de presença de 342 deputados para iniciar a fase de votação da denúncia. Outra sessão foi aberta, mas ainda não atingiu também o quórum para votação.

Wozniacki had started her fifth appearance at the season-ending tournament with a 6-2 6-0 victory over Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina and Romania’s Halep appeared equally as powerless against the 27-year-old former number one.

The Dane’s victory margin assured her of a last-four berth after the loss of four games in two matches while Halep lives to fight another day with her opening straight-sets win over Caroline Garcia giving her a 1-1 record in the Red Group.

Frenchwoman Garcia recovered from her opening loss to rally past Svitolina with an epic 6-7(7) 6-3 7-5 victory later in the day, a result that leaves the other three women in the group all with a chance of joining Wozniacki in the semis.

Wozniacki has been the form player on the WTA Tour this season, winning 58 matches, reaching seven finals and claiming one tournament victory in Tokyo last month.

The rankings show Halep as the world leader and Wozniacki in sixth but the Romanian was utterly outclassed as her opponent raced through the first set in 23 minutes on the back of a 94 percent first serve success rate.

“I think I played really well today and stayed aggressive throughout. I didn’t expect to be leading by that much in the first set and I started to think ‘what’s happening? Am I really playing that well?',” Wozniacki said in a courtside interview.

Halep had been as much a spectator as the stunned crowd packed into the Singapore Indoor Stadium and although she tried to rouse herself after getting to 30-30 in the first game of the second set, Wozniacki held firm for a 1-0 lead.

FLEETING RESPITE

The Dane had won 17 games in a row across her last two matches before Halep finally got on the scoreboard after 34 minutes when she held to love.

The respite was fleeting, however, as Wozniacki continued to punish Halep’s scrappy forehand to break for a 3-1 lead and an ace snuffed out the only break point the Dane faced all match as she moved within two games of victory.

Slideshow (3 Images)

Another forehand error handed Wozniacki a match point after a little more than an hour, which she duly converted with a forehand winner.

“I just stayed positive, took the ball early and went for my shots,” the Dane added. “It’s a great court for me as I was putting spin on the ball to get in position for my shots and wait for the right opportunities to hit my winners.”

Garcia was the more aggressive of two well-matched players, even forging a pair of set points in the opening tiebreak, but sloppy forehand errors handed Svitolina the initiative as she edged the tightest of first sets.

Svitolina broke early in the second to assume control until Garcia threw caution to the wind, after shedding a few tears following a pep-talk from her father and coach Louis-Paul, and reeled off five of the next six games to level the match.

The decider followed a similar pattern to the second set with Svitolina keeping her nose ahead until Garcia fought back through a barrage of winners to reel off the last four games and seal her first WTA Finals victory.

Halep will hope to advance with a win over Svitolina on Friday, while Garcia faces the unenviable task of taking on Wozniacki with the world number eight needing a victory to stand any chance of reaching the last four.",Wozniacki swats aside Halep to reach Singapore semis,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-tennis-wtafinals/wozniacki-swats-aside-halep-to-reach-singapore-semis-idUKKBN1CU20O

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday at the Superior Court in San Francisco, follows a widely read blog post in February from another female engineer that described Uber’s work environment as one that tolerated and fostered sexual harassment.

The lawsuit filed by Ingrid Avendano, Roxana del Toro Lopez and Ana Medina, who described themselves as Latina software engineers, says that Uber’s compensation and other practices discriminate against women and people of color. As a result, the three women have lost out on earnings, promotions and benefits, the lawsuit says.

Avendano and Toro Lopez left Uber this summer after more than two years with the company. Medina is still employed there, according to the lawsuit.

Uber spokesman Matthew Wing declined to comment.

The lawsuit describes an employee ranking system that is “not based on valid and reliable performance measures” and favors men and white or Asian employees. Women, Latino, American Indian and African American employees are given lower performance scores, making it more difficult for them to advance professionally and confining them to more menial tasks, according to the lawsuit.

“In this system, female employees and employees of color are systematically undervalued compared to their male and white or Asian American peers,” the lawsuit says.

Women, black and Latino employees also lose out on pay raises, bonuses, stock options, benefits and other wages because of the company’s discriminatory practices, the lawsuit alleges.

“These three engineers are seeking to ensure that Uber pays women and people of color equally for the hard work they’ve done – and will continue to do – to help make Uber successful,” said lawyer Jahan Sagafi of Outten & Golden which is representing the plaintiffs.

Outten & Golden have also represented employees in gender discrimination lawsuits against Goldman Sachs and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

Avendano and Toro Lopez brought their complaints to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency this summer, an administrative step that precedes a public lawsuit. News site The Information reported on the complaint Tuesday.

In August, Uber made a series of changes to address pay equity, including increasing pay of employees who were paid below the median salary for their job and providing an annual 2.5 percent raise.","Three women sue Uber in San Francisco claiming unequal pay, benefits",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-lawsuit/three-women-sue-uber-in-san-francisco-claiming-unequal-pay-benefits-idUSKBN1CU2Z1?il=0

Puigdemont spurned an invitation to explain his position to the Senate in Madrid on Thursday – an indication of the rigid stands taken by both sides in Spain’s gravest political crisis since the end of the Franco dictatorship in 1975.

He also kept his silence on whether to call for a new regional election, a move which might prompt the Madrid government to postpone its plan to take over Catalonia’s institutions and police.

The next few days could prove crucial in the battle of wills that has followed an independence referendum on Oct. 1, which Madrid declared illegal and the Catalan government said endorsed its claim to statehood.

While it is not clear how the central government will take over in practical terms, nor how Catalan civil servants and police will react, some independence supporters have threatened a campaign of civil disobedience, raising the possibility of ugly confrontations.

The Catalan secessionist drive is the most serious existential challenge to a Western European country since the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, when voters in the end decided to stay part of the United Kingdom.

It has caused deep resentment elsewhere in Spain, caused a flight of business from the wealthy region, and worried other European leaders who see it as fanning separatist sentiment elsewhere on the continent.

Madrid has rejected Puigdemont’s calls for dialogue to resolve the situation, saying he first must withdraw an ambiguous declaration of independence made earlier this month. But it did invite to him address the Senate on Thursday.

However, late on Wednesday the Catalan leader turned down the offer, a spokesman for the regional government said, on the grounds that Madrid had already announced its plans to impose direct control on the autonomous region.

The Senate is expected to give the green light for that on Friday morning.

It was still unclear if Puigdemont would make a unilateral declaration of independence, which, given the opposition from the Madrid government as well as European leaders, would be merely symbolic.

ROCK AND HARD PLACE

Also up in the air was whether he would call a snap regional election, something a senior Catalan politician said on Tuesday was being considered. He could still do this on Friday before the Senate strips him of his powers and imposes direct rule.

Some Spanish political and business leaders, along with most Catalan newspapers, have backed the idea as a snap election could forestall direct rule and help break the deadlock.

Slideshow (6 Images)

Calling an election could also either strengthen Puigdemont’s mandate if pro-independence parties won, or allow him a graceful exit if they did not.

An opinion poll published by the El Periodico newspaper on Sunday showed a snap election would probably have results similar to the last ballot, in 2015, when a coalition of pro-independence parties formed a minority government.

The actual steps to enforce direct rule could be taken gradually in order not to inflame the situation. Catalonia said on Monday it was confident its officials, including the police, would defy attempts by Madrid to take over institutions.

Analyst Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence said Puigdemont was caught between radicals and moderates in the Catalan establishment.

Radical elements want him to make the Catalan parliament declare independence unilaterally on Thursday or Friday. This would provoke a tough government reaction, playing into their hands, he said.

More moderate voices have said that if he calls an early election, he could stop the imposition of direct rule.

The stock was the top gainer on the Dow on a day when the broader market was down.

Nike Chief Executive Mark Parker said at an investor conference that he expects digital revenues to grow from 15 to 30 percent over five years, while revenue growth would be up in the high-single digits over the same period.

The company has already set a target of $50 billion in annual sales by 2020.

The sports-wear giant said at the conference it expects about 50 percent of its future sales growth to come from new categories and about 75 percent growth from outside the U.S.

Nike posted its weakest quarterly sales growth in nearly seven years in September as it fights to retain market share from rivals like Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE).

Analysts have remained upbeat on the company’s plans to invest in a variety of different distribution channels but have cautioned that it may come too late as the company struggles with declining revenue in North America.","Nike gives upbeat forecast at investor conference, shares rise",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nike-outlook/nike-gives-upbeat-forecast-at-investor-conference-shares-rise-idUSKBN1CU2XW?il=0

The Greens, seen as closest to Macron on economic policy and Europe, appeared to have caved in to demands by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Free Democrats (FDP) that a new government continue down a path of fiscal discipline.

Merkel, whose conservatives placed first but lost seats in an election last month, is trying to forge a coalition with the pro-business FDP and the Greens, which requires bridging disagreements on taxes, immigration and foreign policy.

In a joint paper agreed after late-night talks on Tuesday, the parties said they all supported a balanced budget. A senior Greens politician who participated in the talks also told Reuters that the parties were united in opposing Macron’s idea for a euro zone budget.

“None of the participating parties support a euro zone budget,” said Reinhard Buetikofer, a member of the European Parliament.

The parties are expected to reconvene on Thursday to finalize a joint paper on Europe, after agreeing a rough blueprint for fiscal policy late on Tuesday.

That blueprint included a pledge to respect “debt brake” legislation enshrined in the constitution since 2009, which forces the federal government to virtually eliminate structural budget deficits, limiting them to 0.35 percent of GDP.

It also contained a commitment to provide relief to lower and middle income earners, dismantle the “solidarity tax” for poor eastern states and provide financial incentives to make German homes more energy efficient.

Cem Ozdemir, a leader of the Greens who is seen as a possible foreign minister in the new government, highlighted a decision to re-examine plans to raise defence spending by the outgoing “grand coalition” of Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD), who are moving into opposition.

Tax relief and investment needs would be finalised once more details on tax revenues become available next month, Ozdemir said, suggesting that the balanced budget commitment was not final.

“CAVE IN”

The Greens politician also said that a new coalition would have to provide a “pro-European” answer to proposals from Macron and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker for closer cooperation in fiscal matters, defence and migration.

“There are a lot of differences to overcome. But I am hoping for a clear commitment to Europe,” said Ozdemir in a video posted on the Greens website.

Buetikofer said the Greens supported the idea of boosting investment within the framework of the existing EU budget.

But their rejection of Macron’s idea for a separate budget for the euro zone at such an early stage of the coalition talks was seen by some members of the party as an unnecessary “cave in” to Merkel’s conservatives and the FDP.

Macron has called for the creation of a euro zone budget of several hundred billions of euros to help the single currency bloc cope with economic shocks.

One FDP participant who requested anonymity suggested that the Greens may have given away too much in the talks on Tuesday night and expressed concern that the leadership of the party could be forced to change tack in the days ahead by angry grass roots members.

Former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat who ruled with the Greens for seven years, accused the environmentalist party of “preparing Frau Merkel’s bed” in a desperate attempt to re-enter government.

Immigration could also be a contentious issue in the coalition talks as Merkel’s conservatives row back on the open-door policy towards refugees that she adopted in 2015.

If approved at the FCC’s November meeting, the move would be a win for newspapers and broadcasters that have pushed for the change for decades, but was criticized by Democrats who said it could usher in a new era of media consolidation.

The FCC in 1975 banned cross-ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market, unless it granted a waiver, to ensure a diversity of opinions. The rule was made before the explosion of internet and cable news and Republican President Donald Trump and Pai have vowed to reduce government regulation.

“We must stop the federal government from intervening in the news business,” Pai told a congressional panel, noting that many newspapers have closed and many radio and TV stations are struggling. Pai moved earlier this year to make it easier for some companies to own a larger number of local stations.

Pai said the marketplace no longer justifies the rules, citing Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) dominance of internet advertising.

“Online competition for the collection and distribution of news is greater than ever. And just two internet companies claim 100 percent of recent online advertising growth; indeed, their digital ad revenue this year alone will be greater than the market cap of the entire broadcasting industry,” Pai said.

FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said at the hearing Wednesday the move would lead to further consolidation in the media business and should be opposed. There are three Republicans and two Democrats on the panel.

Pai also proposes to make it easier for companies to own multiple TV and radio stations in the same market and he would allow two local stations among the top four in a market to petition the FCC to merge.

The National Association of Broadcasters said it backs Pai’s plan, noting that policymakers have approved numerous “mega-mergers” among phone, cable and satellite programmers “while at the same time blocking broadcast/newspaper or radio/TV combinations in single markets.”

The group added “this nonsensical regulatory approach has harmed the economic underpinning of newspapers, reduced local journalism jobs, and punished free and local broadcasters at the expense of our pay TV and radio competitors.”

Free Press, an advocacy group, said the proposal would make it easier for Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc (SBGI.O) to complete its $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co (TRCO.N) with fewer divestitures.

The “disastrous proposal is tailor-made for Sinclair and other giant broadcast chains that push often slanted or cookie-cutter content over the public airwaves,” the group said.","FCC to loosen TV, newspaper ownership rules",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fcc-media/u-s-fcc-to-loosen-tv-newspaper-ownership-rules-idINKBN1CU2WC?il=0

We need to feel guilty because the poisoned bequest we are leaving behind us stems from our own neglect. We can blame politicians, who are usually in the crosshairs when things go wrong. And some – not all – should take some of the rap. But the charge of neglect can’t come to rest only on them. The relative ease of living for post-war generations in affluent democracies has been the outcome of an implicit collective agreement not to disturb conditions in which living standards increased, choice widened, societies became more permissive, security was guaranteed by U.S. hegemony and state benefits became, mostly, more generous.

The list of our negative bequests is a melancholy and frightening one, usually put aside with a sigh and a passing frisson of dread. That frisson has lingered recently because one element in the legacy, security guaranteed by nuclear weapons, feels less secure given reports that North Korea is now developing nuclear missiles that can strike the United States and much of Europe - as well, of course, as the U.S. allies of South Korea and Japan.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is the culprit here, but Donald Trump’s threat to wipe North Korea off the map has no obvious purpose except to apparently increase Kim’s determination to ramp up the threat.

Deterrence hasn’t worked and there seem to be few viable options. One plan, put forward by the legal scholar and former director of strategy in the National Security Council Philip Bobbitt, would persuade the Chinese to offer North Korea a “nuclear guarantee,” effectively extending Beijing’s nuclear defense to North Korea on condition the latter mothballed its own program. Encouraging a potentially hostile state to enlarge its nuclear capacity is a desperate measure, but one made thinkable by the futility or horror of the alternatives.

Nor is North Korea the only nuclear danger. In an alarming commentary, former U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry wrote that Russia is “well underway” in its nuclear rebuilding program and that the threat of nuclear catastrophe is greater than during the Cold War. “Our public is blissfully unaware of the new nuclear dangers they face,” he wrote.

Nuclear annihilation is the largest of the malignant possibilities we have failed to address. Government debt is less dramatic, but steadily narrows the future economic choices available. To give the citizens in countries covered by welfare states the ability to buy cars, engage in travel and indulge in other leisure pursuits along with the necessities of life, most Western states have taken on huge public debts. That of the United States topped $20 trillion for the first time earlier this year, about $170,000 for each taxpayer. So far, it can afford it: some countries with higher debt relative to GDP can’t. Italy has the highest level of debt in Europe after struggling Greece, and had its credit rating cut from BBB+ to BBB by the Fitch rating agency in April.

Wolfgang Schauble, the controversial outgoing German Finance Minister widely seen as the architect of austerity in the European Union, has warned that “the growth of public and private debt” constituted a very large risk – a fear echoed by the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. The global economy is growing at present, but a collapse through debt could spark another recession, this time with even more serious social and political turbulence in its wake.

The world’s ecology gets no better, and may get worse – as President Trump announced a withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change in June. The move, apparently unpopular with most Americans, including Republicans, is important not so much for the further ecological damage it will do (though it will do some) but as a sign to others that the nation which set itself as an example to follow of care for the environment is now one giving an entirely opposite message.

A study from MIT in August warned of “deadly heat waves” hitting India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, causing “devastation” within a few decades, if carbon emissions are not reduced. That would unleash a flight of refugees that would make the present one pale in comparison.

We’ve become used to learning of breakthroughs in the treatment of disease and chronic conditions, and the eradication, or substantial diminution, of feared diseases like polio. But new infectious diseases are erupting more frequently, spreading more quickly, and evading treatment more efficiently, raising fears of global pandemics starting in sprawling, overcrowded developing world cities, carried worldwide by aircraft. And another modern “plague” – obesity – the result of relative plenty, is rocketing upwards. A study in the medical journal The Lancet showed that among children worldwide, obesity has increased tenfold in the past four decades. Obesity in children and adults is now a major drag on health systems in rich and poor countries alike, prompting heart conditions, diabetes and diseases of the bones and joints.

These and other fundamental threats demand strong government responses, but governments, especially in democracies, are weaker. The Global Economic Forum reports that “there has been an erosion of trust in political institutions and processes” and that “there is a fundamental disconnect between citizens around the world and the elected officials that supposedly represent them.” In other words, the crises are growing as the effectiveness of governments shrinks.

Post-war generations, especially the “boomers” (my own) have let the good times roll for too long. If that sounds unduly pessimistic in the face of continuing advances in many fields, neglectful of the fact that bad stuff always happens but the world continues, then reflect on the triggers – the list could be expanded - whose pulling could precipitate disaster. These concerns are no longer the subject of academic discussion or obscure papers from the World Bank or the United Nations. They are real, present and above all known to us.

Trump told reporters he wants to protect the popular tax-deferred savings program, but said it was possible it could be part of congressional negotiations over tax cuts.

“Maybe we’ll use it as negotiating, but trust me ... there are certain kinds of deals you don’t want to negotiate with,” Trump said on the White House South Lawn as he prepared to depart on a trip to Dallas.

On Capitol Hill, Representative Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means committee, said Trump and lawmakers were discussing how to handle 401(k) plans. The employer-administered plans have been used for four decades by millions of workers to save for retirement.

”No decision’s yet been made on if there will be any changes,“ Brady told reporters. ”We’re simply considering ideas to help people save more and save early in life.

“If we can reach consensus on that, including with the president, in a good way, we’ll move forward - but if not, we will keep things as they are,” Brady said. “All the focus is on can we help people save more.”

Currently, employees may contribute up to $18,000 a year to the tax-deferred accounts, with those 50 and older able to contribute up to $24,000. Savings are typically invested in mutual funds.

Brady was expected to introduce tax overhaul legislation next week, as Trump has long promised. Republican leaders want Congress to approve the measure by the end of this year. It includes a sharp cut in the corporate tax rate.

But many details are still being worked out, including how to offset revenue that would be lost to tax cuts. One way to do that might be to limit pre-tax 401(k) contributions, which would help the government realize more revenue in the near term but would result in a decline in revenue generation down the road.

Earlier this week, after The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported that Republicans were considering capping annual contributions at $2,400, Trump wrote on Twitter: “There will be NO change to your 401(k)”.

Tampering with 401(k) plans, which have largely replaced defined benefit pensions in the United States, would risk alienating tens of millions of workers, as well as the mutual fund operators which rely on the plans for much of their business. Many companies match a percentage of their employees’ 401(k) contributions.

Changes to the tax-deferred savings program could also provide ammunition to Democrats, who have painted Trump’s plan, with its $6 trillion in tax cuts, as a gift to the rich and corporate America that would balloon the federal deficit.",Trump and U.S. House tax lawmaker reopen door to 401(k) changes,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-taxes/trump-and-u-s-house-tax-lawmaker-reopen-door-to-401-changes-idUSKBN1CU2MI?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Sie bot am Mittwoch einen sofortigen Waffenstillstand an sowie aus dem Ergebnis des Unabhängigkeitsreferendums vom September zunächst keine weiteren Maßnahmen abzuleiten. Außerdem solle “ein offener Dialog mit der Bundesregierung auf der Grundlage der Verfassung begonnen werden”. Ministerpräsident Haider al-Abadi hatte als Bedingung für Verhandlungen verlangt, dass das Referendum für ungültig erklärt wird. Ein Sprecher des Militärs signalisierte in den sozialen Medien, dass die Aktionen der Armee in der Kurdenregion zunächst weitergingen. “Militäroperationen haben nichts mit Politik zu tun”, erklärte er.

ARMEE SOLL GRENZÜBERGÄNGE IM KURDENGEBIET KONTROLLIEREN

Bei dem Referendum hatten die Kurden für die Unabhängigkeit von der Zentralregierung in Bagdad gestimmt. Die Regierung schickte daraufhin die Armee in die Gebiete um Mossul und Kirkuk. Diese liegen nicht in der autonomen Kurdenregion, wurden aber von der kurdischen Peschmerga-Truppe im Kampf gegen die Extremistenmiliz Islamischer Staat (IS) erobert. In der Zwischenzeit zogen sich die Peschmerga-Kämpfer von dort weitgehend zurück. Abadi befahl der Armee aber auch, die Grenzübergänge zur Türkei unter ihre Kontrolle zu bringen. Sie liegen alle im kurdischen Autonomiegebiet.

Am Dienstag hatte das kurdische Regionalparlament bereits mitgeteilt, dass die für den 1. November geplanten Parlaments- und Präsidentenwahlen in der autonomen Kurdenregion im Nordirak um acht Monate verschoben würden.

Chris Hemsworth em lançamento do filme ""Thor: Ragnarok"" em Los Angeles 11/10/2017 REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni

“THOR: RAGNAROK”

- Nesta terceira aventura protagonizada pelo personagem – depois de “Thor” (2011) e “Thor: O Mundo Sombrio” (2013) -, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), mais uma vez, comprova não ter nenhuma sorte com seus irmãos. Desta vez, o problema nem é o traiçoeiro Loki (Tom Hiddleston) – que reaparece -, e sim uma irmã, Hela (Cate Blanchett), com poderes e uma agenda destinados à total destruição do reino da família, Asgard.

Thor começa o filme sem seu famoso martelo, passando por muitas peripécias até poder voltar para casa e ver se resolve a parada com a irmã. Antes disso, enfrenta maus bocados num planeta dominado por uma figura bizarra, o Grão-Mestre (Jeff Goldblum). O líder o coloca numa arena para lutar contra seu grande campeão, que não é ninguém menos do que Hulk (Mark Ruffalo).

Enquanto Thor tenta sobreviver a esse encontro com o gigante verde, procurando fazê-lo voltar à identidade do cientista Bruce Banner, em Asgard Heimdall (Idris Elba) tenta proteger os cidadãos da crueldade de Hela, enquanto o irmão não chega para disputar o trono. O diretor neozelandês Taika Waititi infiltra algumas doses de humor enquanto a destruição corre solta.

“MARK FELT – O HOMEM QUE DERRUBOU A CASA BRANCA”

- A proposta do filme de Peter Landesman é contar um fato já conhecido, e tema de um filme famoso, sob outro prisma. Trata-se do escândalo de Watergate, que culminou com a renúncia do presidente norte-americano Richard Nixon, em 1974, e já retratado no filme “Todos os Homens do Presidente”.

Aqui, conta-se mais ou menos a mesma história, sob o ponto de vista de Mark Felt (Liam Neeson) vice-presidente do FBI que revelou informações confidenciais a dois jornalistas usando o codinome “Garganta Profunda”.

Baseado num livro de memórias do próprio Felt, que morreu em 2008, o longa transita entre o trabalho e a vida pessoal do personagem, sem nunca encontrar uma dimensão real desta figura tão complexa quanto emblemática. O resultado é uma tentativa de suspense político morno que nunca convence – tal como a peruca que Neeson usa ao longo do filme.

- Oscarizado por “O Artista”, o francês Michel Hazanavicius novamente volta suas câmeras para um momento da história do cinema. Agora, para os anos de 1960, quando o diretor Jean-Luc Godard (Louis Garrel) finaliza seu “A Chinesa” e acaba se casando com a atriz do filme, Anne Wiazemsky (Stacy Martin).

“O Formidável” é uma comédia um tanto mal-resolvida sobre o bifurcamento entre a vida e a arte engajada. O que salva o filme é a performance de Garrel. Com o fracasso comercial de seu longa, Godard começa a questionar o seu papel como artista e o alcance da arte enquanto ferramenta de transformação.

Baseado na autobiografia de Anne, que morreu no último dia 5, o filme tem como cenário um momento de efervescência política e cultural. Mas Hazanavicius se contenta em explorar os clichês sobre maio de 1968, desperdiçando um bom tema e personagem que teriam muito a dizer.

“PELÉ – O NASCIMENTO DE UMA LENDA”

- A infância e adolescência de Edson Arantes do Nascimento, o Pelé, são a inspiração do filme dos norte-americanos Jeff e Michael Zimbalist – que, apesar do fascínio da história de um menino pobre que se tornou o maior jogador de futebol do mundo, termina refém de uma fórmula com evidente apelo “macumba para turista”.

A distribuidora Europa garante que a maior parte das cópias do lançamento brasileiro serão as dubladas em português, o que atenua mas não resolve o artificialismo de filmagens feitas em inglês (a imprensa assistiu a essa cópia original em inglês, em que todo mundo tem sotaque, inclusive o ator-norte americano Vincent D’Onofrio, que interpreta o técnico Feola).

O enredo acompanha o Pelé menino (Leonardo Lima) quando ele começa a despontar, até mais tarde, já adolescente (agora Kevin de Paula), ser apadrinhado pelo olheiro Waldemar de Brito (Milton Gonçalves). Um episódio central é a convocação de Pelé, com apenas 17 anos, para a Copa do Mundo de 1958 na Suécia, onde, como todos sabem, sua estrela começou a brilhar. No elenco, Seu Jorge e Mariana Nunes, como seus pais, Dondinho e Celeste.

“MANIFESTO”

- Uma série de manifestos de arte, como o futurista, o dadaísta, da Pop Art, do Fluxus e o Dogma, entre outros, são as fontes de inspiração deste peculiar filme do diretor Julian Rosefeldt, oferecendo à talentosa atriz Cate Blanchett a oportunidade de interpretar 13 papéis.

Ela é vista, por exemplo, como uma mendiga arrastando seu carrinho e um cachorro por entre ruínas de um complexo industrial, defendendo em altos brados a arte revolucionária. Num outro quadro, dos mais divertidos, ela é uma mãe de família cuja oração antes da refeição à mesa discorre sobre a necessidade da liberdade de expressão da arte – uma prece longa demais, para desespero dos filhos, loucos para devorar sua comida.

Noutra sequência, ela é uma operária vestida de branco, num ambiente antisséptico onde se desenvolve arte de alta tecnologia. Mas o segmento mais engraçado é mesmo aquele em que Cate interpreta uma professora primária, apontando aos pequenos alunos cada um dos postulados do Dogma 95, que tornou famosos diretores como Lars von Trier e Thomas Vinterberg.

Over 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar since Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response by the Myanmar army that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.

At a meeting in Myanmar’s capital Naypyitaw, attended by Myanmar’s home affairs minister lieutenant general Kyaw Swe and his Bangladeshi counterpart Asaduzzaman Khan, the countries signed two agreements covering security and border cooperation.

The two sides have also agreed to “to halt the outflow of Myanmar residents to Bangladesh,” and “to form a joint working group,” Tin Myint, permanent secretary from Myanmar’s home affairs ministry told reporters after the meetings.

“After joint working group, the verification, (the) two countries have agreed to arrange different steps so that these people can return to their homeland safely and honourably and in secure conditions,” said Mostafa Kamal Uddin, secretary from Bangladeshi home affairs ministry.

The officials did not elaborate on the specific steps the authorities would take for the repatriation, adding that the bulk of discussions was dedicated to border and security cooperation agreements which have been long in the making.

Tin Myint said the two countries agreed “to restore normalcy in Rakhine to enable displaced Myanmar residents to return from Bangladesh at the earliest opportunity.”

He also said Myanmar had sent a list of suspects who had fled to Bangladesh and requested the authorities there to investigate and return them to Myanmar.

Thousands of refugees have continued to arrived cross the Naf river separating Myanmar’s western Rakhine state and Bangladesh in recent days, even though Myanmar says military operations ceased on Sept. 5.

The United States said on Monday it was considering a range of further actions over Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority.

While on Tuesday the officials said the talks were friendly, tensions are still high between the two countries. Bangladesh last month accused Myanmar of repeatedly violating its air space and warned that any more “provocative acts” could have “unwarranted consequences”.

On border and security, the two sides decided to establish border liaison offices, carry out regular meetings between two security forces, jointly combat drug trafficking across the border and set up a mechanism to communicate directly.

Bangladesh has for decades faced influxes of Rohingya fleeing persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where the Rohingya are seen as illegal migrants. It was already home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya before the latest crisis.

Though Rohingya families have lived in Myanmar for generations, they are denied citizenship and access to basic civil rights such as freedom of movement, decent education and healthcare.

Hundreds in Rakhine on Sunday protested to urge Myanmar’s government not to repatriate the Rohingya.","Myanmar, Bangladesh agree to cooperate on Rohingya refugee repatriation",https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya/myanmar-bangladesh-agree-to-cooperate-on-rohingya-refugee-repatriation-idINKBN1CT29G

Former Southampton boss Puel replaced Craig Shakespeare who was sacked last week with Leicester, the 2016 English champions, third-bottom of the table.

“It’s a great privilege to become the new manager of Leicester City – a club whose values and ambitions are closely aligned to my own,” the 56-year-old Puel said on Leicester’s website.

”The opportunity to help the club build on its remarkable recent achievements is a truly exciting one and I’m looking forward to working with the owners, players, staff and supporters to deliver further lasting success.”

Leicester, who followed their title-winning campaign with a 12th-place finish last season, said assistant manager Michael Appleton, who has stood in for two games since Shakespeare’s sacking and won both, would remain in his role.

Vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha described Puel as “a perfect fit”.

“Upon meeting Claude, his attention to detail, knowledge of our squad, understanding of our potential and his vision to help us realise it were extremely impressive,” he said.

”He quickly emerged as the outstanding candidate and I am delighted we will have the opportunity to reinforce our long-term vision, aided significantly by his expertise.”

Puel, who previously managed AS Monaco, Lille, Olympique Lyonnais and Nice, led Southampton to eighth in the Premier League last season, despite losing a number of key players in high-profile transfers.

He also guided them to the League Cup final where they lost 3-2 to Manchester United but he was sacked after a poor finish to a campaign during which Southampton scored only 41 goals in 38 league games.

The world’s largest online retailer on Wednesday announced Amazon Key, a lock and camera system that users control remotely to let delivery associates slip goods into their houses. Customers can create temporary passcodes for friends and other services professionals to enter as well.

The move, in the works for more than a year, may help Amazon capture sales from shoppers who could not make it home to receive an order in person, and did not want the package stolen from their doorstep. It also signals Amazon’s ambitions in the growing market for home security devices, where Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Nest Labs competes.

“This is not an experiment for us,” said Peter Larsen, Amazon vice president of delivery technology, in an interview. “This is a core part of the Amazon shopping experience from this point forward.”

Members of Amazon’s Prime shopping club can pay $249.99 and up for a cloud-controlled camera and lock that the company offers to install. Delivery associates are told to ring a doorbell or knock when they arrive at someone’s house. If no one greets them, they press ‘unlock’ in a mobile app, and Amazon checks its systems in an instant to make sure the right associate and package are present.

The camera then streams video to the customer who remotely can watch the in-home delivery take place. The associate cannot proceed with other trips until the home is again locked.

It is unclear if such protections will persuade customers that the service is safe to use.

Larsen said theft was “not something that happens in practice,” based on early tests of the Amazon Key program.

He added that if a problem arises, “You can call customer service, file a claim and Amazon will work with you to make sure it’s right,” reimbursing customers in some cases.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Amazon’s biggest retail rival, has similar plans. It said last month it would test delivering grocery items “straight into your fridge” with August Home, a smart lock business that Assa Abloy AB (ASSAb.ST) said it will acquire.

The change last year to a Department of Defense manual on procedures governing its intelligence activities was made possible by a decades-old presidential executive order, bypassing congressional and court review.

The new manual, released in August 2016, now permits the collection of information about Americans for counterintelligence purposes “when no specific connection to foreign terrorist(s) has been established,” according to training slides created last year by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI).

The slides were obtained by Human Rights Watch through a Freedom of Information Act request about the use of federal surveillance laws for counter-drug or immigration purposes and shared exclusively with Reuters.

The Air Force and the Department of Defense told Reuters that the documents are authentic.

The slides list the shooting attacks in San Bernardino, California, in December 2015 and Orlando, Florida, in June 2016 as examples that would fall under the ""homegrown violent extremist"" category. The shooters had declared fealty to Islamic State shortly before or during the attacks, but investigators found no actual links to the organization that has carried out shootings and bombings of civilians worldwide.

Michael Mahar, the Department of Defense’s senior intelligence oversight official, said in an interview that AFOSI and other military counterintelligence agencies are allowed to investigate both active duty and U.S. civilian personnel as long as there is a potential case connected to the military. Investigations of civilians are carried out cooperatively with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mahar said.

Executive order 12333, signed by former President Ronald Reagan in 1981 and later modified by former President George W. Bush, establishes how U.S. intelligence agencies such as the CIA are allowed to pursue foreign intelligence investigations. The order also allows surveillance of U.S. citizens in certain cases, including for activities defined as counterintelligence.

Under the previous Defense Department manual’s definition of counterintelligence activity, which was published in 1982, the U.S. government was required to demonstrate a target was working on behalf of the goals of a foreign power or terrorist group.

It was not clear what practical effect the expanded definition might have on how the U.S. government gathers intelligence. One of the Air Force slides described the updated interpretation as among several “key changes.”

‘CLOAK OF DARKNESS’

However, some former U.S. national security officials, who generally support giving agents more counterterrorism tools but declined to be quoted, said the change appeared to be a minor adjustment that was unlikely to significantly impact intelligence gathering.

Some privacy and civil liberties advocates who have seen the training slides disagreed, saying they were alarmed by the change because it could increase the number of U.S. citizens who can be monitored under an executive order that lacks sufficient oversight.

“What happens under 12333 takes place under a cloak of darkness,” said Sarah St. Vincent, a surveillance researcher with Human Rights Watch who first obtained the documents. “We have enormous programs potentially affecting people in the United States and abroad, and we would never know about these changes” without the documents, she said.

The National Security Act, a federal law adopted 70 years ago, states that Congress must be kept informed about significant intelligence activities. But the law leaves the interpretation of that to the executive branch.

The updated interpretation was motivated by recognition that some people who may pose a security threat do not have specific ties to a group such as Islamic State or Boko Haram, Mahar at the Defense Department said.

“The internet and social media has made it easier for terrorist groups to radicalize followers without establishing direct contact,” Mahar said.

“We felt that we needed the flexibility to target those individuals,” he said.

In August 2016, during the final months of former President Barack Obama’s administration, a Pentagon press release announced that the department had updated its intelligence collecting procedures but it made no specific reference to “homegrown violent extremists.”

The revision was signed off by the Department of Justice’s senior leadership, including the attorney general, and reviewed by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a government privacy watchdog.

Mahar said that “homegrown violent extremist,” while listed in the Air Force training slide, is not an official phrase used by the Defense Department. It does not have a specific list of traits or behaviors that would qualify someone for monitoring under the new definition, Mahar said.

Hunches or intuition are not enough to trigger intelligence gathering, Mahar said, adding that a “reasonable belief” that a target may be advancing the goals of an international terrorist group to harm the United States is required.

The updated Defense Department manual refers to any target “reasonably believed to be acting for, or in furtherance of, the goals or objectives of an international terrorist or international terrorist organization, for purposes harmful to the national security of the United States.”

Mahar said that in counterterrorism investigations, federal surveillance laws, including the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, continue to govern electronic surveillance in addition to the limitations detailed in his department’s manual.",Exclusive: U.S. widens surveillance to include 'homegrown violent extremists' - documents,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CU1H6-OCATC

U.S. Transportation Security Administration officials are giving some airlines or airports additional time to comply with the new interviews as long the U.S. government has approved security plans by Thursday.

“TSA will continue to work closely with our aviation partners and verify that all security enhancements are accurately implemented,” TSA spokeswoman Lucy Martinez said in a statement Wednesday.

The United States announced the new rules in June to end its restrictions on carry-on electronic devices on planes coming from 10 airports in eight countries in the Middle East and North Africa in response to concerns that explosives could be hidden in electronic devices.

Those restrictions were lifted in July, but the Trump administration said it could reimpose measures on a case by case basis if airlines and airports did not boost security.

European and U.S. officials said at the time that airlines had 120 days to comply with the measures, including increased passenger screening. The 120-day deadline is Thursday. Airlines had until late July to expand explosive trace detection testing.

“We see this as a big issue for China Airlines,” Steve Chang, senior vice president of the Taiwanese firm told reporters on Wednesday, adding the airline was trying to consult with the American Institute in the country over the issue.

Korean Airlines, South Korea’s flagship carrier, also said it had a lot of concerns with the new measures.

“We are asking customers to show up at the airport early ... It’s just inconvenient for the passengers,” President and Chief Operating Officer Walter Cho told Reuters in Taipei.

Lufthansa Group said on Tuesday the measures would be in place by Thursday and travelers could face short interviews at check-in or at the gate.

Economy passengers on Lufthansa’s Swiss airline have been asked to check in at least 90 minutes before departure.

Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said it would suspend in-town check-in and self bag-drop services for passengers booked on direct flights to the United States. The airline said passengers would also have short security interviews and it has advised travelers to arrive three hours before departure.

Singapore Airlines Ltd said the security checks could include inspections of personal electronic devices as well as security questioning during check-in and boarding.

Airlines for America, a U.S. trade group, said the changes “are complex security measures” but praised U.S. officials for giving airlines flexibility in meeting the new rules.

Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said the industry understood security threats to aviation were made regularly but in this case the U.S. government had not shared any specific dangers before changing the rules.

“What we have seen is very strange,” he told reporters in Taipei. “Unilateral measures announced without any prior consultation... That is something that is very concerning and disturbing.”

At their annual meeting in Taipei, Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) members passed a resolution calling for security measures to be risk-based, outcome-focused and proportionate to the probable threat.

“Unilateral actions taken by individual governments reacting to emerging threats may result in unnecessary disruption or lead to unintended safety consequences,” said the members.

AAPA includes most large Asian airlines but not mainland Chinese carriers.

“The risk is other countries make similar demands,” AAPA Director General Andrew Herdman said.

U.S. authorities in June also ordered increased security around aircraft and in passenger areas, and other places where travelers can be cleared by U.S. officials before they depart and ordered enhanced screening of personal electronic devices. Some of those new requirements take effect this week as well.

The TSA said in July it was imposing new security rules requiring U.S. domestic airline travelers to remove all electronic items larger than mobile phones such as tablets, e-readers and video game consoles from carry-on baggage for screening.",Airlines get ready for new U.S. security rules from Thursday,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-airlines-security/airlines-get-ready-for-new-u-s-security-rules-from-thursday-idUSKBN1CT2GE?il=0

If approved at the FCC’s November meeting, the move would be a win for newspapers and broadcasters that have pushed for the change for decades, but was criticized by Democrats who said it could usher in a new era of media consolidation.

The FCC in 1975 banned cross-ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market, unless it granted a waiver, to ensure a diversity of opinions. The rule was made before the explosion of internet and cable news and Republican President Donald Trump and Pai have vowed to reduce government regulation.

“We must stop the federal government from intervening in the news business,” Pai told a congressional panel, noting that many newspapers have closed and many radio and TV stations are struggling. Pai moved earlier this year to make it easier for some companies to own a larger number of local stations.

Pai said the marketplace no longer justifies the rules, citing Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) dominance of internet advertising.

“Online competition for the collection and distribution of news is greater than ever. And just two internet companies claim 100 percent of recent online advertising growth; indeed, their digital ad revenue this year alone will be greater than the market cap of the entire broadcasting industry,” Pai said.

FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said at the hearing Wednesday the move would lead to further consolidation in the media business and should be opposed. There are three Republicans and two Democrats on the panel.

Pai also proposes to make it easier for companies to own multiple TV and radio stations in the same market and he would allow two local stations among the top four in a market to petition the FCC to merge.

The National Association of Broadcasters said it backs Pai’s plan, noting that policymakers have approved numerous “mega-mergers” among phone, cable and satellite programmers “while at the same time blocking broadcast/newspaper or radio/TV combinations in single markets.”

The group added “this nonsensical regulatory approach has harmed the economic underpinning of newspapers, reduced local journalism jobs, and punished free and local broadcasters at the expense of our pay TV and radio competitors.”

Free Press, an advocacy group, said the proposal would make it easier for Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc (SBGI.O) to complete its $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co (TRCO.N) with fewer divestitures.

The “disastrous proposal is tailor-made for Sinclair and other giant broadcast chains that push often slanted or cookie-cutter content over the public airwaves,” the group said.","FCC to loosen TV, newspaper ownership rules",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fcc-media/fcc-to-loosen-tv-newspaper-ownership-rules-idUSKBN1CU2TD?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

The settlement with the German bank was announced on Wednesday by the attorneys general of New York and California, Eric Schneiderman and Xavier Becerra, who led the probe by 44 U.S. states and Washington, D.C.

Deutsche Bank is the second bank to settle the multistate probe, following a $100 million settlement by Britain’s Barclays Plc (BARC.L) in August 2016.

Both banks agreed to cooperate in the probe into several other banks, which is continuing.

Wednesday’s settlement came 2-1/2 years after Deutsche Bank agreed in April 2015 to pay $2.5 billion to settle rate-rigging probes by U.S. and British regulators, and a London-based unit pleaded guilty to criminal wire fraud.

The bank has also reached multiple rate-rigging settlements in private U.S. investor lawsuits.

“This settlement resolves the bank’s final pending U.S. regulatory inquiry related to Libor,” Deutsche Bank spokesman Troy Gravitt said in a statement about Wednesday’s accord.

Banks use Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, to set rates on roughly $350 trillion of credit card, mortgage, student loan and other transactions, and to determine the cost of borrowing from one another.

Deutsche Bank admitted to allegations that from 2005 to 2009, it made false or misleading Libor submissions, tried to influence other banks’ submissions to benefit its own trading positions, and concealed its deception from customers.

The settlement agreement included emails and instant messages detailing the alleged manipulation, including one in which a Libor submitter told a trader who sought a particular quote: “Ok will try to give you a belated Christmas present.”

Schneiderman said such conduct can interfere with or undermine confidence in financial markets.

“Large financial institutions, like all other market participants, have to abide by the rules,” he said in a statement.

Banks have paid roughly $9 billion to settle Libor-rigging probes worldwide.

In July, Andrew Bailey, head of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, said that regulator will phase out Libor by the end of 2021, citing a lack of data underpinning it.

“O presidente da República foi submetido a uma sondagem vesical de alívio por vídeo e está em repouso”, informou em nota o Palácio do Planalto, acrescentando que Temer passa bem e deverá ter alta ainda nesta quarta-feira.

Temer, 77 anos, teve um desconforto no fim desta manhã e se consultou com o médico do Planalto. O médico recomendou que o presidente fosse avaliado no hospital, segundo nota divulgada mais cedo.

De acordo com fontes ouvidas pela Reuters, Temer vinha sentindo um desconforto para urinar há alguns dias e nesta manhã essa dificuldade aumentou. Depois de receber alguns parlamentares, o próprio presidente decidiu procurar o serviço médico do Planalto.

“Ele estava bem, foi caminhando. O médico do Planalto decidiu encaminhá-lo para o hospital por não ter condições de fazer os exames apropriados aqui”, disse uma das fontes.

Temer ainda estaria sendo submetido a exames e a equipe médica do Hospital do Wxército, em Brasília, está em contato com Roberto Kalil Filho, médico do presidente, em São Paulo.

“Está se analisado se será necessário o doutor Kalil vir a Brasília ou se o presidente pode ir a São Paulo. Está sendo avaliado se será preciso ou não um procedimento cirúrgico ou não, a depender do resultado dos exames”, disse a fonte.

Uma outra fonte palaciana explicou que Temer teve uma obstrução na uretra, possivelmente causada por um inchaço da próstata -o mesmo que aconteceu com o ministro da Casa Civil, Eliseu Padilha, que passou por cirurgia em fevereiro deste ano.

A assessoria de imprensa do Planalto disse a jornalistas no Hospital do Exército que Temer chegou ao local por volta das 12h50 e deve deixar a unidade assim que terminarem os exames.

Temer chegou ao Palácio do Planalto antes das 9h e começou uma agenda extensa de contato com parlamentares e ministros. De acordo com a agenda oficial, o presidente estava com o ministro do Gabinete de Segurança Institucional, Sergio Etchegoyen, quando decidiu procurar o serviço médico.

Na noite anterior, depois de um dia em que recebeu quase duas dezenas de parlamentares, Temer foi a um jantar na casa do vice-presidente da Câmara dos Deputados, Fábio Ramalho (PMDB-MG), e cerca de uma centena de deputados, de onde saiu perto da meia-noite.

Apesar do problema médico do presidente, a ordem no Planalto é continuar a negociação para conseguir quórum e manter a votação da denúncia.

Por falta de quórum a sessão acabou sendo suspensa no início da tarde. Os governistas não conseguiram alcançar o registro mínimo de presença de 342 deputados para iniciar a fase de votação da denúncia. Outra sessão foi aberta, mas ainda não atingiu também o quórum para votação.

Researchers said on Wednesday that new examinations of the sediments where the 6,000-year-old skull was found detected hallmarks of a tsunami, with a composition remarkably similar to the remnants of a deadly 1998 tsunami that lashed the same area.

The skull was discovered near the town of Aitape, about 7 miles (12 km) inland from Papua New Guinea’s northern coast. It is one of the earliest human remains from the island of New Guinea, and initially was mistaken for a species called Homo erectus that died out about 140,000 years ago. Later scientific dating revealed it was actually 6,000 years old.

“As probably the oldest-known tsunami victim in the world, the Aitape skull speaks volumes about the long-term exposure of human populations along the world’s coastlines and how such events in the past will have undoubtedly had fundamental effects on human migration, settlement and culture,” said tsunami expert James Goff of the University of New South Wales in Australia.

The scientists examined geological deposits at the river-bed site where the skull was found, identifying clear signs of tsunami activity. They spotted microscopic organisms from the ocean in the sediment, similar to those found in soil after the 1998 tsunami.

“We also employed chemistry and examined the size of sediment grains,” finding they were indicative of a tsunami, said anthropologist-archaeologist Mark Golitko of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana and the Field Museum in Chicago.

Tsunamis, giant waves typically caused by underwater earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, are particularly dangerous natural disasters. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, caused by a massive earthquake off Sumatra, killed more than 230,000 people.

The 1998 Papua New Guinea tsunami killed more than 2,000 people, wiped out villages, destroyed crops and forced many survivors to relocate. The tsunami 6,000 years ago apparently was similar.

“Much like the 1998 tsunami, we suspect that one or more large waves very suddenly impacted the coast, washing near-shore villages and anyone living there further back into swamps and lagoons that dot the coast,” Golitko said.

The skull was found without other bones. The researchers noted that in the 1998 tsunami, many victims were washed into lagoons and their bodies scavenged by crocodiles.

Judge Tanya Chutkan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia late on Tuesday temporarily extended the deadline for complying with the subpoena, according to court records seen on Wednesday.

Republicans on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee earlier this month subpoenaed an unidentified bank for the last two years of records of the accounts of Fusion GPS.

Congressional investigators and Special Counsel Robert Mueller are pursuing allegations in the dossier assembled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele of connections between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia.

It has been widely reported that supporters of Republican Jeb Bush, one of Trump’s opponents for the party’s presidential nomination, initially paid for research that was later picked up by supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

A letter sent on Tuesday to Fusion’s lawyers by Perkins Coie, a law firm which represented both the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s campaign, confirmed that Perkins Coie had hired Fusion GPS in April 2016 to conduct election related research. A source familiar with the matter said Fusion GPS did not hire Steele until late May 2016.

President Trump, who disputes he and his associates colluded with Moscow officials and has called the investigations a “witch hunt,” raised the issue again on Wednesday.

“The whole Russia thing is what it’s turned out to be. This was the Democrats coming up with an excuse for losing an election,” Trump told reporters as he was leaving for Dallas.

Fusion last week sued the bank and asked the court to issue an injunction ordering the bank not to comply with the subpoena. Lawyers for Fusion argued that the subpoena, signed by House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes, was “exceedingly broad.”

The lawyers also argued that Nunes issuing the subpoena was “not a legitimate legislative activity” because Nunes had “served on President Donald Trump’s campaign” and had “recused himself” from the panel’s probe into allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 campaign to help Trump. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations.

In a court filing on behalf of the committee, lawyers for the House of Representatives asked the judge to reject Fusion’s request to block the subpoena. A footnote said the top two Democrats in the House did not endorse the request.

On Wednesday, Trump also echoed unsubstantiated allegations revived on Tuesday by Republicans that when Clinton was secretary of state she approved a sale of U.S. uranium to Russia in exchange for contributions to her husband’s charity.

“I think the uranium sales to Russia and the way it was done, so underhanded, with tremendous amounts of money being passed, I actually think that’s Watergate modern age,” Trump said.",Judge gives research firm in Trump-Russia probe more time to answer subpoena,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-house/judge-gives-research-firm-in-trump-russia-probe-more-time-to-answer-subpoena-idUSKBN1CU301?il=0

Later this week, Apple is set to begin taking pre-orders for its new smartphone, the iPhone X – which starts at $999 and uses artificial intelligence (AI) features embedded in the company’s latest A11 chips.

The phone promises new facial recognition features such as Face ID that uses a mathematical model of a person’s face to allow the user to sign on to their phones or pay for goods with a steady glance at their phones.

“We think that the frameworks that we’ve got, the ‘neural engines’ we’ve put in the phone, in the watch ... we do view that as a huge piece of the future, we believe these frameworks will allow developers to create apps that will do more and more in this space, so we think the phone is a major platform,” Williams said.

He was speaking at top chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (2330.TW) 30th anniversary celebration in Taipei, which was attended by global tech executives.

Williams said technological innovations, especially involving the cloud and on-device processing, will improve life without sacrificing privacy or security.

“I think we’re at an inflection point, with on-device computing, coupled with the potential of AI, to really change the world,” he said.

He said AI could be used to change the way healthcare is delivered, an industry he sees as “ripe” for change.

Williams said Apple’s integration of artificial intelligence wouldn’t be just limited to mobile phones.

“Some pieces will be done in data centers, some will be on the device, but we are already doing AI in the broader sense of the word, not the ‘machines thinking for themselves’ version of AI,” he said referring to the work of Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), a leader in AI.

Global tech firms such as Facebook (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon, and China’s Huawei are spending heavily to develop and offer AI-powered services and products in search of new growth drivers.

Softbank Group Corp (9984.T), which has significantly invested in artificial intelligence, plans a second Vision Fund that could be about $200 billion in size, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.

At Monday’s event, TSMC Chairman Morris Chang described his company’s relationship with Apple as “intense.”

Williams said the relationship started in 2010, the year Apple launched the iPhone 4, with both parties taking on substantial risk.

He credited Chang for TSMC’s “huge” capital investment to ramp up faster than the pace the industry was used to at the time. Apple decided to have 100 percent of its new iPhone and new iPad chips for application processors sourced at TSMC, and TSMC invested $9 billion to bring up its Tainan fab in a record 11 months, he said.",Apple sees its mobile devices as platform for artificial intelligence,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-taiwan-tsmc/apple-sees-its-mobile-devices-as-platform-for-artificial-intelligence-idUSKBN1CS1TZ

La division de santé grand public de Pfizer, où l‘on retrouve notamment l‘anti-inflammatoire Advil, le baume à lèvres Chapstick et les multivitamines Centrum, a réalisé un chiffre d‘affaires d‘environ 3,4 milliards de dollars en 2016.

Le laboratoire a annoncé le 10 octobre qu‘il envisageait de scinder ou de vendre cette activité.

Les actifs pourraient intéresser des grands noms du secteur comme Reckitt Benckiser ou GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).

Des discussions préliminaires avec des candidats, dont Reckitt, ont déjà eu lieu, a dit une des sources, ajoutant que Pfizer veut faire avancer le processus avant la fin de l‘année.

Le directrice générale de GSK, Emma Walmsley, a confirmé mercredi qu‘elle regarderait “attentivement” cette opération.

Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi et Nestlé figurent également dans la liste des candidats potentiels, selon plusieurs sources.

Pfizer a l‘intention d‘envoyer des données financières sur son pôle santé grand public aux participants à l‘appel d‘offres dans environ trois semaines, a précisé l‘une des sources.

Le processus devrait s‘accélérer au début de l‘année prochaine avec la présentation des offres, et un accord pourrait être signé autour de mi-2018, a-t-elle ajouté.

Le laboratoire allemand Merck KGaA cherche lui aussi à se désengager de ses produits en vente libre, valorisé autour de 4,5 milliards de dollars. Certaines sources bancaires et industrielles jugent que Merck pourrait suspendre le projet, à qui la cession du pôle de Pfizer risque de faire de l‘ombre.

L‘une des sources a rapporté que Pfizer espérait que le grand nombre de candidats au rachat pourrait faire monter le prix de cette activité au moins à 20 milliards de dollars.

Avec une demande portée par le vieillissement de la population et une plus grande sensibilité des consommateurs aux questions médicales, le marché fragmenté de l‘auto-médication est devenu un terrain fertile pour les fusions et acquisitions ces dernières années. Les produits vendus sans ordonnance génèrent en général des marges inférieures aux médicaments de prescription mais ce sont souvent des marques durablement établies avec des clients fidèles.

Le directeur général de Pfizer, Ian Read, a déclaré lors de l‘annonce du projet que les produits grand public pouvaient être mieux valorisés en dehors du périmètre du groupe.

GSK a adopté une tout autre stratégie, préférant conserver un portefeuille diversifié, avec une branche grand public pour amortir les performances plus volatiles des médicaments sur ordonnance.

Pour Reckitt en revanche, les produits de santé ont des marges en plus forte croissance que ses produits pour la maison. Le groupe britannique, qui va se scinder en deux - santé d‘un côté et hygiène/entretien de l‘autre - a reconnu être intéressé par les produits grand public de Pfizer.

The rise of e-commerce and online retailers like Amazon (AMZN.O) has posed challenges for the shipping industry. The costs associated with delivering packages to residential addresses are higher than to businesses, which receive more packages and so bring more revenue per stop. Shipping firms are scrambling to reduce that extra cost.

UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, said its 4.9 percent increase would go into effect on Dec. 24 and apply to UPS Ground, UPS Air and International services, plus UPS Air Freight Rates in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.

The company’s main rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) said last month that rates at its FedEx Express unit will go up by an average of 4.9 percent for U.S. domestic, export and import services as of Jan. 1.

Atlanta-based UPS also said it would raise surcharges for most residential packages for the 2018 peak season - the busy season leading up to the holidays in December - “by a few pennies.”

For instance, the surcharge for UPS Next Day Air packages will rise to 84 cents in 2018 from 81 cents this year, while the peak surcharge for UPS Ground packages will increase to 28 cents from 27 cents.

As of July 8 2018 the company will also raise the additional handling cost for packages weighing over 70 pounds (32 kg) to $19 from $12 and raise the additional handling charge for large packages delivered to a residential address to $90 from $80.

Judge Tanya Chutkan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia late on Tuesday temporarily extended the deadline for complying with the subpoena, according to court records seen on Wednesday.

Republicans on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee earlier this month subpoenaed an unidentified bank for the last two years of records of the accounts of Fusion GPS.

Congressional investigators and Special Counsel Robert Mueller are pursuing allegations in the dossier assembled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele of connections between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia.

It has been widely reported that supporters of Republican Jeb Bush, one of Trump’s opponents for the party’s presidential nomination, initially paid for research that was later picked up by supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

A letter sent on Tuesday to Fusion’s lawyers by Perkins Coie, a law firm which represented both the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s campaign, confirmed that Perkins Coie had hired Fusion GPS in April 2016 to conduct election related research. A source familiar with the matter said Fusion GPS did not hire Steele until late May 2016.

President Trump, who disputes he and his associates colluded with Moscow officials and has called the investigations a “witch hunt,” raised the issue again on Wednesday.

“The whole Russia thing is what it’s turned out to be. This was the Democrats coming up with an excuse for losing an election,” Trump told reporters as he was leaving for Dallas.

Fusion last week sued the bank and asked the court to issue an injunction ordering the bank not to comply with the subpoena. Lawyers for Fusion argued that the subpoena, signed by House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes, was “exceedingly broad.”

The lawyers also argued that Nunes issuing the subpoena was “not a legitimate legislative activity” because Nunes had “served on President Donald Trump’s campaign” and had “recused himself” from the panel’s probe into allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 campaign to help Trump. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations.

In a court filing on behalf of the committee, lawyers for the House of Representatives asked the judge to reject Fusion’s request to block the subpoena. A footnote said the top two Democrats in the House did not endorse the request.

On Wednesday, Trump also echoed unsubstantiated allegations revived on Tuesday by Republicans that when Clinton was secretary of state she approved a sale of U.S. uranium to Russia in exchange for contributions to her husband’s charity.

“I think the uranium sales to Russia and the way it was done, so underhanded, with tremendous amounts of money being passed, I actually think that’s Watergate modern age,” Trump said.",Judge gives research firm in Trump-Russia probe more time to answer subpoena,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-house/judge-gives-research-firm-in-trump-russia-probe-more-time-to-answer-subpoena-idUSKBN1CU301

Other data on Wednesday showed new single-family home sales vaulting to a near 10-year high last month. The signs of strong business investment on equipment in the third quarter and a pick-up in the housing market supported views the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates in December.

“The positive reports keep the economy’s wheels turning, and the Fed on track for another rate hike this year,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “Businesses don’t invest in the future if they don’t think consumers will be there to buy their goods and services.”

The Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 1.3 percent last month after an upwardly revised 1.3 percent increase in August.

Economists had forecast orders of these so-called core capital goods increasing 0.5 percent last month after a previously reported 1.1 percent jump in August. Core capital goods orders advanced 3.8 percent year-on-year.

Shipments of core capital goods climbed 0.7 percent after soaring 1.2 percent in August. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government’s gross domestic product measurement.

Core capital goods shipments have now increased for eight straight months. Business investment on equipment stumbled in late 2015 and much of last year as declining oil prices hurt profits. Spending is in part being supported by a weakening dollar, strengthening global growth and steady oil prices.

The dollar briefly rose against a basket of currencies after the data as traders anticipated an interest rate hike in December, which would be the third this year.

Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rising to a seven-month high. U.S. stocks were trading slightly lower after lackluster earnings reports from AT&T and Boeing.

Business spending on equipment probably contributed to economic growth in the third quarter, which could help to cushion the blow on GDP from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

Economists estimate that Harvey and Irma, which devastated parts of Texas and Florida, sliced off as much as one percentage point from third-quarter GDP.

UPSIDE RISK TO THIRD-QUARTER GDP ESTIMATE

The government is due to publish its advance GDP estimate for the July-September quarter on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the economy probably grew at a 2.5 percent annualized rate in the July-September period, slowing down from the second quarter’s brisk 3.1 percent pace.

But the Commerce Department report, which also showed inventories increasing 0.6 percent in September, the largest gain since June 2015, suggested third-quarter economic growth could surprise on the upside.

The economy’s improving prospects were also underscored by a second report from the Commerce Department showing new home sales surged 18.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000 units last month amid an increase in all four regions.

That was the highest level since October 2007 and the percent gain was the largest since January 1992. New home sales are, however, volatile month-to-month and last month’s jump likely exaggerates the health of the housing market, which has struggled for much of this year.

“There are several reasons...to be reluctant to believe the upbeat message from today’s home sales report,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “This recent surge in activity has not been evident in a number of the other housing indicators that we track.”

Strong business spending on equipment is helping to support manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, shot up 2.2 percent last month amid a 5.1 percent rise in demand for transportation equipment.

The storm left at least 16 dead and the entire island without power; most people won’t get their lights back on anytime soon. The cascading effects have been devastating. More than half of residents remain without drinking water. Hospitals cannot function. Supermarket shelves are empty and few gas stations are open. Communication networks are crippled, and first responders are struggling to make contact with residents in remote or heavily affected areas. Credit cards are useless, and ATMs are out of service.

We know how to do better and we can do better. Nobody should die because the power went out.

We need a dedicated national effort to fortify our electrical grids so that they can get back online much more quickly after inevitable, and increasingly severe, extreme weather events. Natural disasters happen, but often the catastrophes that follow are man-made. And when it comes to the electricity system—the lynchpin upon which so much of our society relies—widespread, long-lasting power outages can quickly devolve into nightmares all their own. Just a few weeks ago, 11 senior citizens died in Florida following prolonged heat exposure due to power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Similar catastrophes were suffered in the wakes of many other earlier storms, including Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.

The centralized electricity grid is widely vulnerable to threats, both natural and manmade. Flooding can submerge and damage equipment, as it did throughout the Northeast during Sandy; heavy winds can rip down trees and power lines, as was seen throughout Florida from Irma; and extreme heat and forest fires can wreak havoc on transmission lines. Climate change stands to escalate these threats, by contributing to higher seas, more intense storms, worsening wildfires and extended heat waves.

That’s why the focus must be on electricity grid resilience. It’s impractical and impossible to stop all outages from occurring. But it is possible to design the system such that when the power does inevitably fail, fewer people are affected from the outset and power is restored more quickly for the rest.

In Florida, policymakers directed the state’s utilities to “storm harden” their systems following the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. One decade and several billion ratepayer dollars later, Irma gave people a chance to see their increased utility bills at work.

Workers repair electrical installations after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in San Juan, Puerto Rico, September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez

The result: an astounding 6.7 million customers—or nearly two out of every three in the state—were plunged into darkness. Surely evidence of a failed approach, right?

Not quite. When it comes to the cascading failures arising from widespread outages, length of the blackout is a key factor in the severity of the impact. Even though all those Floridians lost power after, the utilities were able to get over one million back online overnight, and millions more restored within a few days with help from crews from across America.

In Florida, that pivot toward improving recovery times has meant, for one, simple upgrades, like replacing thousands of wooden utility poles with concrete that can better withstand hurricane-force winds. In the aftermath of Irma, even though crashing trees and flying debris ripped down power lines, restoration times were vastly improved by a reduced need to replace fallen poles.

Other initiatives can be more technologically complex. For example, by installing sensors and grid automation throughout the system, utilities can pinpoint when and where an outage has occurred, and re-route systems to reduce the number of people without power. Similarly, flood monitoring equipment can alert a utility when critical infrastructure is at risk of inundation, allowing the equipment to be pre-emptively turned off to improve post-storm repair times.

Debris and destruction left by Hurricane Maria in Canovanas, Puerto Rico September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins

Tackling a problem this big, however, is impossible for each utility to do alone. Complicating the push for a more resilient electricity system is the fact that proposed interventions can be expensive, and investment dollars are limited. Additionally, the federal government has offered insufficient assistance, leaving states, cities and territories to largely fend for themselves, even though investing in a more resilient system now can reduce the costs of future relief and recovery efforts.

Utilities’ limited funds mean there are trade-offs, so opportunities must be carefully weighed against one another. But the costs of prolonged outages are far-reaching and challenging to quantify, and resiliency metrics are hard to define and even harder to compare. Efforts must also align with other priorities, especially as the power sector undergoes an unparalleled transition to clean and distributed renewable resources.

The fact also remains that some services are far too critical—drinking water, first responders, communications—and some populations, such as the elderly, disabled, or low-income, to tolerate even a day without power. For these people and services, a resilient grid is not enough.

Diesel generators, which have long-served a backup role when disasters hit, are expensive, heavily polluting, and prone to failure due to infrequent use. And as the long and frustrating lines following recent storms have made clear, maintaining steady access to fuel in the aftermath of a severe storm can be challenging, if not impossible. Microgrids powered by solar and storage, on the other hand, are more reliable during times of crisis, better for health and the environment, and increasingly affordable. This is thanks to lower costs of solar and storage technologies, as well as the fact that these systems can provide onsite power, generating benefits all year, not just during extreme weather events.

So what does this mean for Puerto Rico? Reports suggest parts of the island could remain without power for months, potentially impacting millions of people. This is unacceptable.

Now, as a country, we must pool together resources for a swift response to curtail the devastating crisis at hand. But we must also ensure that as the decimated power grid is pieced back together, this catastrophe—and the far too many that preceded it—were not suffered in vain. The electricity system must be rebuilt for a climate-resilient, clean-energy supporting future, not as a replica of its brittle and underinvested past.",Commentary: How we could have prevented some of Puerto Rico’s misery,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcnamara-electricity-commentary/commentary-how-we-could-have-prevented-some-of-puerto-ricos-misery-idUSKCN1C42ER

“Being licensed and available for purchase, and having taken advice from our suppliers, the party believed the purchase was legal,” National Party President Peter Goodfellow said in a statement.

“The party is now considering the implications of the judgment and the next steps. We already have a claim against the suppliers and licensors of the track.”

The court found Eight Mile Style was entitled to damages of NZ$600,000 ($413,000) with interest from June 28, 2014.

“We anticipate that all the defendants will meet to discuss the implications of the decision in the very near future,” copyright body AMCOS said in an email, hailing the decision as an important first step towards resolution of the matter.

The publisher had exclusive control over the song, and rarely gave permission for its use in advertising, the court said.

“It was no coincidence that the works sounded the same and the undeniable inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the composer of ‘Eminem Esque’ had ‘Lose Yourself’ in front of him at the time of composition,” it added.",U.S. rapper Eminem wins copyright case against NZ political ads,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CU0SP-OCAEN

“There’s a long-term detrimental impact on respect for ... First Amendment values, which are also human rights,” said David Kaye, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression.

The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and of the press.

U.S. President Donald Trump has called the press the enemy of the American people. He uses the term “fake news” to cast doubt on news reports critical of his administration, often without providing evidence to support his case.

Speaking to journalists at the United Nations, Kaye accused the administration of limiting access to information about the environment and climate change. Trump has called global warming a hoax.

Kaye called for greater media access to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and voiced concern about the pressure on journalists he said had emerged from “the very clear agenda” of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the Justice or State departments.

Odinga, however, backed away from previous promises to hold large-scale protests on election day.

“We advise Kenyans who value democracy and justice to hold vigil and prayers away from polling stations, or just stay at home,” he told a cheering crowd of thousands of people on Wednesday in Uhuru Park, in the capital Nairobi.

“Convince your friends, neighbors and everyone else not participate,” he said, but if they support the president, he cautioned “do not insult or assault them. Instead, seek to open their eyes.”

Odinga is refusing to participate because he said that the election commission has failed to implement reforms to prevent another failed poll.

The Supreme Court was due to hear cases seeking to delay the polls but was unable to do so after five out of seven judges had failed to turn up, preventing a quorum.

Minutes after Chief Justice David Maraga said the case could not be heard, hundreds of supporters took to the streets of Kisumu, Odinga’s main stronghold.

Riot police used teargas to disperse them. Two protesters had gunshot wounds, a Reuters witness said.

“If the government subverts the sovereign will of the people ... then people are entitled to rebel against this government,” Kisumu governor Anyang Nyong‘o, a hardline Odinga supporter, told reporters in Kisumu.

Such comments seem certain to fuel fears of a major confrontation with security forces, already blamed for killing nearly 50 people in Kisumu and Nairobi slums after the canceled August vote.

The company has yet to announce a date for its third-quarter earnings and management's first conference call with Wall Street analysts since it disclosed the breach last month. That is a departure from its normal practice of scheduling earnings by mid-October.

Equifax has until Nov. 9 to release its results or seek an extension from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which gives large companies 40 days after the close of a quarter to report their financials to investors.

Company representatives declined to say when the results will be issued.

Equifax is struggling to recover from one of the worst cyber attacks in history. Its shares are down about 24 percent from Sept. 7, when it announced the breach, which prompted outrage from U.S. lawmakers and consumers and the departure of its chief executive. State and federal probes into the incident are underway.

“A significant amount of uncertainty remains regarding the financial and operational impacts from Equifax’s breach,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Gary Bisbee said in a note on Monday, as he cut his recommendation on the stock to “hold” from “buy.”

Lingering questions include how the incident might hurt earnings of the Atlanta-based company, the impact on Equifax’s market share and the likelihood of the U.S. government tightening regulation of the credit reporting industry, Bisbee said.

Equifax’s shares were down 0.8 percent at $107.90 on Wednesday, having rebounded from a more than two-and-a-half-year low of $89.59 on Sept. 14.

The average analyst price target on the stock is now $124.62, down from $153.25 before the breach, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Still, 11 of the 15 analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters who cover the company have a “buy” or “strong buy” recommendation on the stock. Four others have hold ratings.

Equifax, one of the big three credit reporting bureaus along with Experian Plc (EXPN.L) and TransUnion (TRU.N), is expected to report earnings of $1.49 per share, not including one-time items, for the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That has dropped 2.1 percent over the past month, but is still above the $1.44 the company reported for the same period last year.

SEEKING CLARITY

The chief near-term risk for Equifax is how the breach will weigh on its workforce solutions unit, which provides payroll and human-resources services to companies, said Morningstar analyst Brett Horn. That unit made up about 20 percent of Equifax’s $3.1 billion in total revenue last year.

The breach may cause businesses to question whether they should provide sensitive employee information to Equifax, Horn said.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service temporarily suspended a contract worth more than $7 million it recently awarded to Equifax following another security issue with Equifax’s website.

Horn said Equifax may not be ready to provide investors with financial details about how much the incident will cost to clean up and how it will affect future earnings.

That may depend on how much of the post-breach expenses will be paid by insurers and how much the free credit monitoring and identity theft services the company is offering consumers as a result of the breach will ultimately cost.

When it finally does report earnings and talk to analysts, investors are eager for an update on the company’s search for a new chief executive, new chief security officer and new chief information officer to replace executives who departed after the hack.

Rich Sichel, senior investment strategist at The Philadelphia Trust Co, said he wants answers to some of those questions before he considers investing in the stock.

“Too much is unknown,” Sichel said. “I wouldn’t be in a bighurry to get in.”","Equifax, reeling from hack, still has no earnings report date",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-equifax-cyber-results/equifax-reeling-from-hack-still-has-no-earnings-report-date-idUSKBN1CU2R1

If approved at the FCC’s November meeting, the move would be a win for newspapers and broadcasters that have pushed for the change for decades, but was criticized by Democrats who said it could usher in a new era of media consolidation.

The FCC in 1975 banned cross-ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market, unless it granted a waiver, to ensure a diversity of opinions. The rule was made before the explosion of internet and cable news and Republican President Donald Trump and Pai have vowed to reduce government regulation.

“We must stop the federal government from intervening in the news business,” Pai told a congressional panel, noting that many newspapers have closed and many radio and TV stations are struggling. Pai moved earlier this year to make it easier for some companies to own a larger number of local stations.

Pai said the marketplace no longer justifies the rules, citing Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) dominance of internet advertising.

“Online competition for the collection and distribution of news is greater than ever. And just two internet companies claim 100 percent of recent online advertising growth; indeed, their digital ad revenue this year alone will be greater than the market cap of the entire broadcasting industry,” Pai said.

FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said at the hearing Wednesday the move would lead to further consolidation in the media business and should be opposed. There are three Republicans and two Democrats on the panel.

Pai also proposes to make it easier for companies to own multiple TV and radio stations in the same market and he would allow two local stations among the top four in a market to petition the FCC to merge.

The National Association of Broadcasters said it backs Pai’s plan, noting that policymakers have approved numerous “mega-mergers” among phone, cable and satellite programmers “while at the same time blocking broadcast/newspaper or radio/TV combinations in single markets.”

The group added “this nonsensical regulatory approach has harmed the economic underpinning of newspapers, reduced local journalism jobs, and punished free and local broadcasters at the expense of our pay TV and radio competitors.”

Free Press, an advocacy group, said the proposal would make it easier for Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc (SBGI.O) to complete its $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co (TRCO.N) with fewer divestitures.

The “disastrous proposal is tailor-made for Sinclair and other giant broadcast chains that push often slanted or cookie-cutter content over the public airwaves,” the group said.","FCC to loosen TV, newspaper ownership rules",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-fcc-media/u-s-fcc-to-loosen-tv-newspaper-ownership-rules-idUKKBN1CU2TN?il=0

Haley was the first senior member of President Donald Trump’s administration to visit South Sudan, which spiraled into civil war in 2013, just two years after gaining independence from Sudan. She met one on one with Kiir for some 45 minutes.

“I let him know that the United States was at a crossroads and that every decision going forward was going to be based on his actions,” Haley told reporters after the meeting in the capital Juba.

The United Nations has warned that the violence in South Sudan, which has forced some 4 million people to flee their homes, was providing “fertile ground” for a genocide. Kiir’s government has denied U.N. allegations of ethnic cleansing.

Haley had to cut short a visit to a camp for South Sudanese displaced by the violence amid rowdy anti-Kiir protests.

“He understood that Americans were disappointed in his leadership in South Sudan, I made that very clear. And he understood that all the aid or help that he hopes will go forward is not a given,” she said.

Haley did not elaborate on what further action Washington could take, but said that Kiir “got what I was trying to say.” On Monday she said Washington was considering how to pressure Kiir into peace, though noted that withdrawing aid may not work.

The Trump administration last month imposed sanctions on two senior South Sudanese officials and the former army chief.

“We have lost trust in the government and we now need to regain that trust and the only way to regain that trust is through the actions of taking care of all of the people,” Haley told South Sudan’s Eye Radio.

PROTEST CUTS SHORT CAMP VISIT

She demanded that Kiir allow full and consistent humanitarian aid access and bring peace and stability to the country. She said she pushed a timeline for Kiir to act, but declined to elaborate.

Nhial Deng Nihal, a senior adviser to Kiir, said the president told Haley his government and a U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan had established “mechanisms that work jointly to improve and address the humanitarian problems.”

Slideshow (7 Images)

He also told reporters that Kiir said government troops “will also be observing a cessation of hostilities in order to create an atmosphere for dialogue.”

The civil war was sparked by a feud between Kiir, a Dinka, and his former deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer. It has plunged parts of the world’s youngest nation into famine.

A fragile peace deal broke down last year and Machar fled the country. He is being held in South Africa to stop him stirring up trouble, sources told Reuters in December.

Haley had to cut short a visit to a camp in Juba, where U.N. peacekeepers are protecting some 30,000 displaced people, after hundreds of rowdy pro-Machar protesters blocked nearby roads, yelling “Salva Kiir is a killer” and “Welcome USA.”

Protesters held a large sign that read “South Sudan IDPs (internally displaced people) and refugees love President Trump, the peacemaker and supporter of human rights.”

A spokeswoman for the U.N. mission said the protest “started to gain momentum after (Haley) left, IDPs became upset that she was not able to meet with them.” Haley was meeting with a displaced family when she had to leave early due to security concerns.

Benchmark U.S. 10-year note US10YT=RR yields hit a seven-month high of 2.475 percent, buoyed by economic data, recent optimism over progress on tax reform by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and anticipation of a nominee to head the Federal Reserve.

Equities pared losses as yields retreated, following a Fox Business interview with Trump in which he said he was still considering keeping current Fed Chair Janet Yellen in the position. The 10-year last fell 9/32 in price to yield 2.4371 percent.

“It is possible the market may be taking some solace that Yellen is still in the mix,” said Mike Beale, senior managing director at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.

“The market may be saying, maybe one of the more hawkish, (John) Taylor or (Kevin) Warsh, is off the table.”

Low interest rates have been a driving factor in the 8-year bull market, with investors pushed into equities as other lesser-yielding instruments are viewed as unattractive by comparison.

Earnings season so far has been largely positive, with 72.1 percent of the 165 S&P 500 companies that have reported to date topping expectations, matching the average for the past four quarters.

The Trump administration has launched a new U.S. effort to deepen military and economic ties with India as a way to balance China’s assertive posture across Asia.

At the talks with Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, both sides pledged to strengthen anti-terrorism cooperation and Tillerson said Washington stood ready to provide India with advanced military technology.

“The United States supports India’s emergence as a leading power and will continue to contribute to Indian capabilities to provide security throughout the region,” Tillerson told a joint news conference with Swaraj.

But the talks also touched on India’s diplomatic ties with North Korea, Swaraj said, at a time when the United States has stepped up efforts to isolate Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs.

Swaraj said she told the top U.S. diplomat that some level of diplomatic presence was necessary to keep open channels of communication.

“As far as the question of embassy goes, our embassy there is very small, but there is in fact an embassy,” she said.

“I told Secretary Tillerson that some of their friendly countries should maintain embassies there so that some channels of communication are kept open.”

India and North Korea maintain diplomatic offices in each other’s capitals, though New Delhi recently banned trade of most goods with the country, except food and medicine. Trade was minimal, Swaraj said.

The focus on North Korea comes as U.S. President Donald Trump heads to China next month, where he is expected to urge President Xi Jinping to make good on his commitments to try to rein in North Korea.

Tillerson, who flew in from Pakistan which he called an important U.S. ally in the restive region, also held talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is driving closer ties with the United States.

But India, a former leading light of the Non-Aligned Movement and which was on the opposite side of the United States during the Cold War, still remains wary of any alliances with major powers lest it affect its autonomy.

India has also maintained ties with Iran which is being targeted by the Trump administration for its alleged military support of extremist groups in the Middle East and for its ballistic missile programme.

India has long sourced its oil from Iran, but in recent years the two sides have been also collaborating on key infrastructure projects.

New Delhi is pushing hard for the development of Chabahar port on the Iranian coast as a hub for its trade links to the resource-rich countries of central Asia and Afghanistan but the Trump administration’s tough stance has raised new concerns over the future of that project.

But Tillerson struck a conciliatory stance on India’s ties with Iran, saying it wouldn’t come in the way of countries doing legitimate business there.

“It is not our objective to harm the Iranian people nor is it our objective to interfere with legitimate business activities that are going on with other businesses, whether they be from Europe, India or agreements that are in place or promote economic development and activity to the benefit of our friends and allies,” he said.

America’s disagreements were with the Iranian regime, and in particular the Iran Revolutionary Guard, he said.

India is especially keen on the Chabahar port as a way to bypass long-time foe Pakistan which does not allow easy trade and transit arrangements to Afghanistan and beyond.

PAKISTAN

Tillerson said the U.S. stood should-to-shoulder with India in the fight against terrorism which New Delhi has long said is centered in militant groups operating from inside Pakistan.

He said militant groups were a threat to everyone in the region, including Pakistan itself.

“Quite frankly my view - and I expressed this to the leadership of Pakistan - is we also are concerned about the stability and security of Pakistan’s government as well.”

The United States has been urging Pakistan to act against the groups that operate in Afghanistan, India and inside Pakistan itself. “Terrorist safe havens will not be tolerated,” Tillerson said.

Industry lobbying paid off when the Senate overturned a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule on Tuesday night. The measure was proposed by Richard Cordray, the head of the CFPB appointed by former President Barack Obama, who argued consumers need protection from fine print forcing them to rely on private arbitration, which often favors the firms, when they feel they have been wronged. Banks said the CFPB rule would increase costs for consumers.

Their celebration could be short lived. Credit-scoring agency Equifax had to drop its arbitration clause for 145.5 million consumers affected by a data breach disclosed in September, after public pressure and threats from state attorneys general. And after U.S. lender Wells Fargo opened 3.5 million unauthorized accounts for customers, a bipartisan group of lawmakers slammed the bank for wanting to settle disputes through arbitration.

Before the vote, the industry had been largely enjoying a respite from the wrath of Democrats and other critics in Washington. Wall Street wasn’t even mentioned in the Democratic platform for the 2018 midterm elections. Instead, the party focused on big tech companies like Facebook, questioning whether they need further antitrust regulations.

The 63-year-old Dutchman, who was born in Ethiopia, is accused of the incarceration, torture and murder of opponents of former Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in the late ‘70s.

As Mengistu’s representative in the Ethiopian province of Gojjam, the man is accused of ordering the killing of 75 young prisoners in 1978 and of being responsible for the incarceration and inhumane treatment of more than 200 people.

An Ethiopian court has sentenced the man to death, in absentia, for his role in what was called the “red terror”, which the communist military junta of Mengistu conducted after the ouster of the Ethiopian emperor, Haile Selassie, in 1974.

Yet one group is chronically under-represented among the political elite: women.

The founding father of communist China, Mao Zedong, may have once said that women “hold up half the sky” but when the twice-a-decade party congress selected a new batch of top leaders this week, females weren’t holding up much at all.

No women made it onto the elite Politburo Standing Committee, the group of seven men at the pinnacle of the party. None ever have.

In the new Politburo, only one of its 25 members is a woman -- Sun Chunlan, head of the party body charged with outreach to non-Communists. It is her second term and she is likely to retire in five years. On the previous Politburo, there were two women, Sun and Vice Premier Liu Yandong - who is past retirement age and has stepped down from the Politburo.

One rung down, just 4.9 percent of the new Central Committee, a mere 10 of the body’s 204 members, are women. That number was unchanged from the outgoing Central Committee, which presided for five years, but lower than in 2007-2012 when there were 13.

(For a graphic on 'Women in China's Communist Party' click tmsnrt.rs/2lcfg0w)

The State Council Information Office, which doubles as the party’s propaganda department, did not respond to faxed questions for comment on why there are so few women in senior party positions.

By way of comparison, five members of U.S. President Donald Trump’s 24-member cabinet are women, and about 20 percent of the U.S. Congress are female. In Japan, two out of 20 members of the cabinet are women as are about 10 percent of the lower house lawmakers newly elected on Sunday.

ASTRONAUTS AND HOUSEKEEPERS

At the Chinese party congress itself, the overall numbers were stronger: about a quarter of its 2,287 delegates were women - roughly commensurate with the proportion in the roughly 90 million-member party.

But with most senior leadership posts in the hands of men, activist Xiong Jing, an NGO project manager who edits a feminist social media site, said many of the women delegates to the party congress were there merely as “decoration”.

“This problem is a cliché,” she said. “With the political system as it is now, I think even if more women were involved, whether as party congress delegates or in government, they may be very limited in what they can do.”

The party takes the appearance of representativeness seriously when it comes to some groups.

At party congresses and annual sessions of parliament, there are delegates from China’s 56 different ethnic groups, every branch of the military and police, private businesses, the state sector and, of course, the government.

The party congress this year featured delegates who were astronauts, athletes, actors, judges, farmers and more. There was even a delegate representing housekeepers, who showed up in her apron and maid’s cap.

“PARTY OF THE PEOPLE”

For women in general in China, political empowerment is lacking. China ranked 74th in political empowerment of women out of 144 countries in the World Economic Forum’s global Gender Gap Report last year. In 2006, it was no. 52 out of 115.

Leta Hong Fincher, a New York-based sociologist and author of the forthcoming book “Betraying Big Brother: The Rise of China’s Feminist Resistance”, says women in China are losing ground amid a resurgence of traditional gender norms.

“It’s my impression that the Communist Party is fundamentally not interested in having women at the senior levels at all,” she said.

In China’s pre-reform command economy under Mao, women were drafted into the workforce and recruited into nation-building.

The most powerful woman since the communist takeover in 1949 was Mao’s third wife, Jiang Qing. She and members of her “Gang of Four” were arrested after Mao’s death in 1976 and blamed for the excesses of the chaotic Cultural Revolution.

More recently, Hong Fincher says, the party has been spooked by China’s demographic challenges - an aging population, shrinking labour force and falling birth rates - and has aggressively promoted the idea that women should be getting married and having babies.

To be sure, in Chinese business there are some prominent female chief executives, such as Zhang Xin at real estate developer Soho China (0410.HK) and Zhou Qunfei, the billionaire founder of Lens Technology 399433.SZ.

And the party and government pay lip service to gender equality. The state constitution guarantees women the same rights as men.

“The government ... wants to appear to be taking gender equality seriously, when in reality it is not. It is actually in full retreat with regard to gender equality,” Hong Fincher said.

The election process for party congress delegates is tightly controlled, with candidates vetted for their loyalty to the party and leadership.

But congress delegate Tang Jialing, who is a crew member on a deep-sea research submersible, suggested that the lack of women reflected the will of the people.

“We are the party of the people. It’s the people who voted in more men than women. It’s the people’s choice,” she said.",Women fail to crack China's glass ceiling as party picks new leaders,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress-women/women-fail-to-crack-chinas-glass-ceiling-as-party-picks-new-leaders-idUSKBN1CU19I

But an Iraqi military spokesman suggested an offensive - launched to wrest back territory after Kurds voted overwhelmingly for independence in a referendum in September - would continue regardless.

The Iraqi government has transformed the balance of power in the north of the country since launching its campaign last week against the Kurds, who govern an autonomous region of three northern provinces and had held a swathe of other territory.

“The fighting between the two sides will not produce a victory for any, it will take the country to total destruction,” the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) said in a statement.

The KRG proposed an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and “starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi Constitution”.

Baghdad has always considered the Kurdish secession referendum illegal. It responded last week by seizing back the city of Kirkuk, the oil-producing areas around it and other territory that the Kurds had captured from militant group Islamic State.

In a brief social media comment hinting that the campaign would continue, an Iraqi military spokesman said: “Military operations are not connected to politics.”

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has said the KRG should cancel the vote’s outcome as a pre-condition for talks. Several Shi‘ite members of parliament on Wednesday asked him to stick to his position and not to accept just a freeze of the referendum.

On Wednesday, Abadi began an official visit to neighboring Turkey and Iran. Turkey and Iran both have Kurdish populations of their own and have supported Baghdad taking a hard line on the referendum.

Now that the Kurds have swiftly yielded most of their territory outside of their autonomous region to the advancing Iraqi forces, there are signs of pressure easing. Iran announced the reopening of one of the border crossings with the Kurdistan region, which it had closed earlier this month in support of the Iraqi government.

In Ankara, President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was ready to give all support to Baghdad as it seeks to reopen a crude oil pipeline from the Kirkuk oilfields to Turkey. The pipeline goes through the Kurdish autonomous region. Iraq had stopped shipping oil through it when the Kurds took Kirkuk in 2014.

In a statement to media after meeting Abadi, Erdogan said they discussed what political, military and economic steps they could take after what he called the “illegitimate” Iraqi Kurdish referendum last month.

STRATEGICALLY VITAL

Abadi has ordered his army to recapture all disputed territory and has demanded central control of Iraq’s border crossings with Turkey, which are all located inside the Kurdish autonomous region.

Kurdish Peshmerga forces beat back an advance by Iranian-backed pro-government paramilitaries on Tuesday in the region of Rabi‘a, 40 km (25 miles) south of the Fish-Khabur border area with Turkey and Syria, Kurdish officials said.

Fish-Khabur is strategically vital because oil from both Kurdish and government-held parts of northern Iraq crosses via a pipeline there into Turkey, the main route out of the area for the exports that are crucial to any Kurdish independence bid.

The fighting so far has taken place outside the Kurdish autonomous region, but Fish-Khabur is inside it.

The fighting between the central government and the Kurds is particularly tricky for the United States which is a close ally of both sides, arming and training both the Kurds and the central government’s army to fight Islamic State.

U.S. Ambassador Douglas Silliman “worked with Iraqi security forces and Kurdish Peshmerga to end clashes endangering a Christian community and other civilians” north of Mosul, Washington’s Baghdad embassy said on its Twitter account.

The Iraqi government’s advance over the past week has been achieved with comparatively little violence, with Kurds mostly withdrawing without a fight.

But it caused Kurds to flee en masse from Tuz Khurmato, a multi-ethnic city south of Kirkuk where sectarian tension flared after Iraqi forces took control, humanitarian organizations said.Most of those displaced, estimated at nearly 30,000, are in need of urgent aid and staying in open shelters, officials from two international humanitarian organizations told Reuters.

Abadi pledged in an interview to the Wall Street Journal to disarm Shiite militias that refuse to come under his control after Islamic State’s defeat.

Iraqi forces are preparing in parallel an offensive to recapture the last patch of Iraqi territory still in the hands of Islamic State, on the border with Syria, the military said on Wednesday.

The militant group also holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is also shrinking there as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi‘ite militias backed by Iran and Russia.","Kurds offer to suspend independence drive, seek talks with Baghdad",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds-referendum/kurds-offer-to-suspend-independence-drive-seek-talks-with-baghdad-idUSKBN1CT37M

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots.
On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.
Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

The rise of e-commerce and online retailers like Amazon (AMZN.O) has posed challenges for the shipping industry. The costs associated with delivering packages to residential addresses are higher than to businesses, which receive more packages and so bring more revenue per stop. Shipping firms are scrambling to reduce that extra cost.

UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, said its 4.9 percent increase would go into effect on Dec. 24 and apply to UPS Ground, UPS Air and International services, plus UPS Air Freight Rates in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.

The company’s main rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) said last month that rates at its FedEx Express unit will go up by an average of 4.9 percent for U.S. domestic, export and import services as of Jan. 1.

Atlanta-based UPS also said it would raise surcharges for most residential packages for the 2018 peak season - the busy season leading up to the holidays in December - “by a few pennies.”

For instance, the surcharge for UPS Next Day Air packages will rise to 84 cents in 2018 from 81 cents this year, while the peak surcharge for UPS Ground packages will increase to 28 cents from 27 cents.

Investors have expressed frustration that UPS and FedEx have had to invest heavily in network expansion to handle soaring lower margin e-commerce volumes.

UPS has unveiled a number of new surcharges in recent years, which are seen as a way not only to manage the higher costs associated with e-commerce but also to encourage retailers that ship excessively large, heavy or unwieldy packages to seek alternative shipping methods.","UPS announces U.S. rate hikes, new peak surcharges for 2018",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-prices/ups-announces-u-s-rate-hikes-new-peak-surcharges-for-2018-idUSKBN1CU30I?il=0

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

Benchmark U.S. 10-year note US10YT=RR yields hit a seven-month high of 2.475 percent, buoyed by economic data, recent optimism over progress on tax reform by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and anticipation of a nominee to head the Federal Reserve.

Equities pared losses as yields retreated, following a Fox Business interview with Trump in which he said he was still considering keeping current Fed Chair Janet Yellen in the position. The 10-year last fell 9/32 in price to yield 2.4371 percent.

“It is possible the market may be taking some solace that Yellen is still in the mix,” said Mike Beale, senior managing director at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.

“The market may be saying, maybe one of the more hawkish, (John) Taylor or (Kevin) Warsh, is off the table.”

Low interest rates have been a driving factor in the 8-year bull market, with investors pushed into equities as other lesser-yielding instruments are viewed as unattractive by comparison.

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

The stock was the top gainer on the Dow on a day when the broader market was down.

Nike Chief Executive Mark Parker said at an investor conference that he expects digital revenues to grow from 15 to 30 percent over five years, while revenue growth would be up in the high-single digits over the same period.

The company has already set a target of $50 billion in annual sales by 2020.

The sports-wear giant said at the conference it expects about 50 percent of its future sales growth to come from new categories and about 75 percent growth from outside the U.S.

Nike posted its weakest quarterly sales growth in nearly seven years in September as it fights to retain market share from rivals like Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE).

Analysts have remained upbeat on the company’s plans to invest in a variety of different distribution channels but have cautioned that it may come too late as the company struggles with declining revenue in North America.","Nike gives upbeat forecast at investor conference, shares rise",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nike-outlook/nike-gives-upbeat-forecast-at-investor-conference-shares-rise-idUSKBN1CU2XW?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

The Republican plan would cut taxes for businesses and people by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, according to independent analysts.
Ryan has previously said he wants the House to pass the tax bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.
He predicted on Wednesday that some Democratic lawmakers would back the tax plan.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday that a sweeping Republican tax-cut plan is entering its toughest phase yet as lobbyists swarm Congress to try to protect valuable tax breaks.

Urging lawmakers to move quickly on the plan, Ryan said in an interview with Reuters that speedy action would prevent the legislation getting bogged down and deliver sooner the economic growth that Republicans expect from it.

“K Street,” as Washington’s lobbying industry is known after the downtown street where much of it is based, will soon descend on Capitol Hill to defend tax benefits for companies and other special interests, said Ryan, the top Republican in Congress.

”When the details come, that is when you’re going to see K Street coming to Congress. And that’s why this hasn’t been done for 31 years,” said Ryan, looking back to the country’s last major tax code overhaul under President Ronald Reagan in 1986.

While the broad parameters of the Republican plan, backed by President Donald Trump, have been made public, detailed legislation is not expected to be revealed until next week.

Securing passage by Congress of the tax plan would give Trump his first major legislative win since he took office in January. Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress and are under pressure to deliver on their election campaign promises. Final action on taxes is at least weeks away.

The Republican plan would cut taxes for businesses and people by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, according to independent analysts.

It calls for reducing the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and setting a lower rate for smaller businesses, as well as cutting taxes for individuals and allowing larger deductions for families.

Democrats have called it a gift to the rich and to corporate America that would cause the federal deficit to balloon and add to the $20 trillion U.S. national debt.

CHOPPY WATERS

Ryan referred to white-water rafting to describe how the tax overhaul effort is entering its toughest phase.

“We’ve been going through Class 3 rapids, which is a pleasant ride. It’s nice. Everybody pretty much stays in the boat and it’s pretty good. But we’re about to go through Class 5 rapids, which is the biggest rapid you can go through,” he said.

He called on Republicans to hold tight as details are hammered out. “We’ve got to make sure that everybody stays in the boat and we get the boat down the river,” Ryan said.

He dismissed concerns that tax cuts could expand the federal deficit. “We don’t anticipate a big deficit effect from this tax reform because we will broaden the base and lower the rates, plug loopholes and get faster economic growth.”

Republicans intend to pay for their proposed cuts in part by broadening the tax base. That would require discarding trillions of dollars of tax deductions, loopholes and other breaks, each one protected by powerful interests.

If lobbyists succeed in protecting such tax breaks, lawmakers would be looking at less revenue to offset the tax cuts, raising the risk of higher deficits and debt that could undermine long-term economic growth.

DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT?

Ryan has previously said he wants the House to pass the tax bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. He predicted on Wednesday that some Democratic lawmakers would back the tax plan.

“At the end of the day, I do believe some Democrats will end up voting for this thing,” Ryan said. “It’s hard for me to see why - no matter what party you’re from - you’d want to vote against this.”

Slideshow (3 Images)

At least some Democratic support could end up being needed in the Senate, where Republicans hold only a 52-48 majority. Party dissent in the Senate led to Republicans’ failure this summer to push through an overhaul of the healthcare system that Trump and the party leadership had pushed for.

Ryan, from Wisconsin, blamed Democrats for the lack of bipartisanship in Washington. Republicans are drafting the tax legislation on their own.

“I so wish we had Bill Bradley Democrats around these days. We do not have Bill Bradley Democrats. Believe me, I really, really wish we did,” Ryan said, referring to Democratic former Senator Bill Bradley, who played a key bipartisan role in the Reagan tax reform.

Among Republicans, skirmishes around the tax breaks have already begun.

Some Republican lawmakers are resisting a proposal to eliminate a popular deduction for state and local tax payments, which would hit middle-class voters in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.

“You do have to broaden the base in order to lower the rates. And that is what reform is,” Ryan said. “With respect to state and local, I think there’s a way of addressing the concerns that our members have for middle income taxpayers … so that they are net winners in tax reform as well.”

Ryan also said Republican lawmakers will not take up a bipartisan plan to stabilize Obamacare insurance markets or try again this year to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

The House speaker said he wants Congress to pass legislation to protect illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children but offered no timetable.

Asked about strong denunciations of Trump this week by two Republican senators, Ryan said people should “settle their differences personally” rather than in public.

He also urged the Department of Justice to immediately give Congress documents related to the funding of a dossier on Trump during the presidential campaign.",Ryan says Republican tax plan must speed through choppy waters: Reuters interview,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tax-ryan/u-s-house-speaker-says-tax-plan-entering-most-difficult-phase-reuters-interview-idUSKBN1CU1T0

Expectativas de que a recuperação econômica impulsione os lucros das empresas levaram o Ibovespa a novos recordes neste mês. O dólar vem oscilando entre 3,10 e 3,25 reais desde meados de julho, apoiado também em alguma confiança sobre o programa proposto pelo presidente Michel Temer.

Mas escândalos de corrupção e o desemprego elevado vêm gerando ressentimento sobre a classe política brasileira, levantando a possibilidade de um candidato anti-establishment, ou que se opõe às reformas, emergir vitorioso no ano que vem.

A eleição ainda está relativamente distante e, neste momento, pesquisas não costumam gerar previsões muito precisas. Ainda assim, o ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, que tem criticado fortemente a austeridade, vem liderando os levantamentos de intenção de voto.

Sua campanha pode ser barrada se sua condenação por corrupção for confirmada por um tribunal de segunda instância. As pesquisas sugerem que, nesse cenário, parte de seu apoio passaria a Ciro Gomes, outro crítico do programa de Temer.

O deputado ultradireitista Jair Bolsonaro, cujas declarações sobre política econômica vêm apontando em direções contrastantes, vem mostrando bom desempenho nas pesquisas. Ele já questionou o uso de juros para controlar a inflação e defendeu a política desenvolvimentista do regime militar, mas recentemente deu alguns passos na direção do empresariado.

O apoio a agendas mais favoráveis ao mercado vem se dividindo entre o governador de São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, o prefeito de São Paulo, João Dória, e o ministro da Fazenda, Henrique Meirelles. Com um campo tão fragmentado, é difícil prever o resultado de um provável segundo turno.

NERVOSISMO

A incerteza no Brasil soma-se aos questionamentos políticos que devem varrer a América Latina no ano que vem, quando eleições no México e na Colômbia devem testar a recente guinada da região em direção à ortodoxia econômica.

A inclinação da curva de juros do Brasil pode ser a primeira evidência do nervosismo dos investidores sobre esses riscos políticos.

Embora a redução da taxa básica de juros -- que soma 6 pontos percentuais desde outubro e deve levar a Selic à mínima histórica -- pode explicar parte da inclinação, o movimento é forte demais para refletir apenas a política monetária.

Os juros de longo prazo são consistentes com apostas de que o Banco Central eleve os juros a até 11 por cento em 2021, de acordo com cálculos de gestores da Flag Asset Management, bem acima da projeção de 8 por cento no Focus, pesquisa do BC com economistas.

Além disso, indicações recentes de que o BC pode desacelerar o corte de juros não chegaram a reduzir a inclinação da curva, como se esperaria.

Gestores dizem que a alta dos juros de longo prazo também reflete temores de que Temer não será capaz de implementar reformas prometidas até as eleições, particularmente a da Previdência.

Alguns esperam que o câmbio e as ações logo passem a deteriorar, alinhando-se com o mercado de juros. Outros esperam que os juros de longo prazo recuem à medida que a incerteza política se assenta.

A gestora de fundos Vintage Investimentos aposta no meio-termo e combinou posições que se beneficiam de uma inclinação menor da curva de juros com investimentos em NTN-Bs.

Em carta mensal a investidores, gestores da Vintage reconheceram que os riscos fiscais e eleitorais devem se traduzir em juros de longo-prazo elevados, mas disseram que os níveis atuais são “excessivos”.

O economista do ING Gustavo Rangel disse que operações como essa devem se tornar cada vez mais comuns conforme as eleições se aproximam, mas deve demorar para os preços incorporarem a incerteza definitivamente.

“O ruído eleitoral vai afetar os ativos locais no ano que vem, mas o risco político nãos erá precificado até o fim do primeiro trimestre”, escreveu Rangel em relatório.",ANÁLISE - Curva de juros aponta primeiros sinais de ansiedade eleitoral,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1CU278-OBRTP

Asia’s third-largest economy will grow at 6.7 percent in the fiscal year ending March 2018, the slowest since the new methodology of measuring gross domestic product (GDP) was introduced in the 2014-15 fiscal year, according to the latest poll of 30 economists.

The poll was taken on Oct. 12-24, closing just before India announced a $32.43 billion plan to recapitalise state banks, a bid to tackle a major drag on the economy.

While the latest poll’s number for this year matches the International Monetary Fund’s toned-down forecast - that was 7.2 percent earlier - it is a sharp decline from 7.3 percent the July Reuters poll showed.

But despite the broad and marked slowdown expected in economic activity, India’s projected growth rate will be second to the world’s fastest growing major economy - China - if predictions are met.

A majority of economists said the risk to their already lower outlook for Indian growth this fiscal year is skewed further to the downside as stressed corporate balance sheets prevent a recovery in private capital spending and mounting bad loans at Indian banks remain a burden.

All but three of 23 respondents who answered an extra question said the government had imposed too many sweeping changes for the economy in a short period of time, referring to demonetisation and the GST, and that has lowered growth expectations.

“Demonetisation was unnecessary and had a huge disruptive effect. Even before the economy could recover from that shock, came (the) GST,” said Kunal Kundu, vice president and India economist at Societe Generale.

“More importantly, the government was not prepared adequately enough, thereby transmitting further shock to the slowing economy.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision last November to scrap high-value old banknotes wiped out about 86 percent of currency in circulation virtually overnight in an economy which is largely cash-based.

That has hurt consumer spending, which powers more than half of the $2 trillion economy.

But just when some improvement in data raised hopes that the impact of the cash clampdown had been absorbed, confusion among businesses on pricing goods and services after the July 1 implementation of GST has impacted activity.

The economy grew at 5.7 percent annually in the April-June quarter, its lowest level in more than three years and well below expectations.

However, nearly three-fourths of 23 respondents who answered an extra question said India does not need a stimulus package and instead should focus on fiscal discipline which is vital for investment from outside the country to flow in.

“There is limited scope for any stimulus when the budget fiscal deficit projections will anyways be breached on account of revenue shortfall,” said Abhishek Upadhyay, economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership.

Despite bleak growth expectations, the Reserve Bank of India is forecast to keep key policy rates on hold through mid-2019, focusing on anchoring inflation.

The latest Reuters poll predicted retail inflation to average 3.5 percent this fiscal year, unchanged from the July median but below the RBI’s medium-term target of 4.0 percent.

Inflation was expected to average 4.5 percent in 2018-2019, compared to 4.3 percent in the previous poll.

“With inflation trending up directionally and RBI’s insistence on 4 percent target on a durable basis, a convincing case for a rate cut appears less plausible,” said Madhavi Arora, economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank.

“Going out of that gate with this ballot box is like a suicide mission,” 26-year-old Evans said on Wednesday.

The young man, too frightened to give his last name, is meant to be in charge of one of the constituency’s polling stations. But only 19 of his 400 colleagues reported for duty at the Lions Club High School. Drivers meant to transport them to polling stations were too scared to show up.

Kisumu is the heartland of support for Odinga, who is boycotting Thursday’s vote because he said the election board has failed to push through reforms.

The repeat vote, meant to pit Odinga against President Uhuru Kenyatta, was ordered by the Supreme Court after it nullified Kenyatta’s win in an Aug. 8 presidential poll on procedural grounds.

Odinga’s boycott leaves Kenyatta as the only serious contender. None of the other five candidates gained more than one percent in August, virtually guaranteeing Kenyatta a second five-year term. At a rally on Wednesday, Odinga dismissed the five as “flower girls” at Kenyatta’s wedding.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court was due to hear a petition seeking to delay the poll, but was unable to do so after five out of seven judges failed to show up. [nL8N1N01SQ]

Minutes after the court announced it could not hear the case, hundreds of Odinga supporters poured onto Kisumu streets, blocking roads with logs and stones and lighting tyres. Most election staff decided to stay home.

”I’m afraid because it’s getting late,“ returning officer John Ngutai told Reuters late on Wednesday afternoon. “My staff fear to come.”

The officials sitting with Ngutai said they had been attacked twice by Odinga supporters, who targeted training sessions by election officials last week.

Police struggled to save presiding officer Diana Odhiambo, 44, from a stick-wielding crowd of men. Ngutai played video of the incident on his phone, as Odhiambo said: “I love my job, but my family is very nervous.”

Ngutai said preparations were far behind schedule, and it wasn’t clear if the election could be held. Polling stations are supposed to open at 6 a.m.

“The roads are blocked, we can’t access the polling stations, the owners of the vehicles to transport my staff are scared,” he sighed, as his phone rang incessantly.

But 26-year-old Evans, burrowed into a deep blue hooded sweater, said he would stick around a little longer because he still believed in the elections.

“Our lives are in danger,” he said. But “I‘m determined to make Kenya better. I believe that following a constitutional process is better.”","In Kenya opposition stronghold, a repeat presidential vote looks unlikely",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CU2MM-OZATP

Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni called the five confidence motions to get the package approved quickly despite furious opposition from the anti-system 5-Star Movement and small leftist groups.

All five of the motions, on different articles of the law, garnered comfortable majorities, even though many leftist allies had deserted coalition ranks. The bill has already passed through the lower house. A sixth vote on another article, but which was not the subject of a confidence motion, also passed.

A final vote on the law is scheduled for Thursday morning.

The proposed voting system favors parties that form pre-election coalitions and is backed by the largest parties within Italy’s main centre-left and centre-right blocs. It will penalize groups that want to go it alone, such as 5-Star.

However, opinion polls indicate that the system, which is a mix of proportional representation and first-past-the-post, will not throw up an obvious winner, with the vote split three ways between the left, right and 5-Star.

A YouTrend survey for AGI newsagency said on Wednesday that none of the three main groups would get “anywhere near an absolute majority of seats”.

It said the only way for this to happen would be for one bloc to win more than 40 percent of the vote, adding this would trigger a landslide. At present, none of the three political groups are seen winning support of more than 33 percent.

Five-Star has denounced the reform as “an institutional coup d‘etat” and senators from the group closed their eyes, or put on a blindfold as they voted “no” in the Senate.

Hundreds of their supporters filled a central Rome square to denounce the bill, chanting “honesty” and waving party flags.

“This is a fraudulent law for people here. It ignores voting rights and instead favors amalgamations and hookups,” said Rossano Cioccolini, 56, a worker from the northern city of Milan who took a day of holiday to join the Rome rally.

“The largest party in Italy, 5-Star, will not get a look in because it doesn’t accept alliances,” he added.

The use of multiple confidence motions first in the lower house and now in the Senate has allowed the ruling centre-left coalition to truncate discussion on the bill and sidestep dozens of secret votes that could have allowed disillusioned lawmakers to betray their camp and ambush the bill.

The government says the new law is needed to harmonize the electoral system for the upper and lower houses and reduce the risk of different majorities materializing in the two chambers. Previous attempts at reform this past year have all failed.

The Public Investment Fund (PIF) announced the assets-under-management goal at a conference showcasing a program to turn the strictly conservative country into a high-tech business hub with a lifestyle free of hardline Islamism.

PIF published its first comprehensive business program, outlining targets for investments and returns for 2018-2020, under reforms to boost private-sector growth and wean the largest Arab economy off oil export dependence.

Expected to receive proceeds from the planned sale of 5 percent of state oil giant Saudi Aramco’s IPO-ARMO.SE shares, PIF has around $230 billion worth of assets under management now.

The IPO is the centerpiece of Vision 2030, a reform plan to diversify the economy of the world’s largest oil exporter beyond petroleum, championed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.

The crown prince underscored the social side of the reforms on Tuesday when he said he wanted a moderate Islam in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy which practices an austere version of the religion, and would eradicate extremism.

That theme was echoed on Wednesday by Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan.

OPEN FOR BUSINESS

“Islam is not radical or extremist. Islam is moderate. As Saudis, we are welcoming and open for business,” he said, when asked to elaborate on Prince Mohammed’s remarks.

Event organizers projected a open image of the kingdom. Men and women mixed freely at non-alcoholic “networking cocktails” in the ornate lobby of the Ritz Carlton, including the crown prince himself, who took selfies with attendees.

Women were told in official program materials that they did not need to wear the normally obligatory long abaya robe and headscarf whilst inside the event and could opt for formal business attire, like men.

PIF Investments will be in sectors such as real estate and infrastructure as well as in new areas of activity in the Saudi economy through the establishment of companies such as the Saudi Arabian Military Industries company and the Saudi Real Estate Refinancing Company.

One of the biggest tasks facings PIF will be the delivery of a $500 billion plan to build a business and industrial zone extending into Jordan and Egypt, announced at the start of the conference on Tuesday.

PIF also set a new target to increase total shareholder return to 4-5 percent between now and 2020 from 3 percent, it said on Wednesday.

The 96-page program said PIF will structure its investments in six areas: Saudi equity holdings, sector development, real estate and infrastructure, mega projects, international strategic investments and a “diversified pool” across global asset classes.

It said “long-term” average annual return from these areas would be between 6.5 to 9 percent.

Outside of Saudi Arabia, PIF’s investments will be in a number of assets such as fixed-income, public equity, private equity and debt, real estate, infrastructure and alternative investments such as hedge funds, the fund said.

PIF Managing Director Yasir Al Rumayyan said the fund was open to investing in more big ticket items such as U.S. ride services company Uber [UBER.UL].

It also outlined its four major sources of funding to include capital injections from the government, government asset transfers, loans and debt instruments as well as retained earnings from investments.

Rumayyan told Reuters the fund would be a conservative borrower when it enters international debt markets to obtain leverage for its expansion.",Saudi Arabia reform push targets wealth fund doubling assets,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-economy/saudi-arabia-reform-push-targets-wealth-fund-doubling-assets-idINKBN1CU2OT?il=0

Brent crude edged up after top exporter Saudi Arabia reiterated its determination to end a three-year supply glut.

The deep draw in gasoline inventories came even as refining output rose, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This suggested demand remained strong after the peak U.S. driving season.

Crude inventories rose by 856,000 barrels in the week to Oct. 20, the EIA said. Analysts had expected a decrease of 2.6 million barrels. Production rebounded from a falloff due to Hurricane Nate, and imports rose.

Brent crude futures settled up 11 cents at $58.44 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 29 cents to $52.18.

The EIA data showed gasoline and distillate inventories both fell by more than 5 million barrels, and refinery utilization rates rose 3.3 percentage points.

RBOB futures rose 1.1 percent to $1.7341 a gallon. Heating oil futures got a brief boost but settled slightly lower.

“Demand has been a little stronger than some people might have anticipated as we pushed out of the driving season, and that’s where today’s strength is coming from,” said Gene McGillian, manager of research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn.

On Tuesday, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih on Tuesday raised the prospect of prolonged output restraint even after the end of an OPEC-led pact to cut supplies.

Even as global inventory levels are falling, Brent has remained below $60 a barrel, partly on concern the crude glut may grow again after March 2018, when the output reduction deal is due to end.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers have cut oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). OPEC’s next meeting is on Nov. 7 in Vienna, Austria, when they will consider extending the deal.

While other producers cut output, U.S. production rebounded to 9.5 million bpd in the latest week. U.S. crude exports have averaged 1.7 million barrels a day over the past four weeks, the highest ever.

“Saudi Arabia’s determination to rebalance the market, together with ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, will remain supportive of oil prices,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.

“However, rising oil production in the U.S. and persistently high exports from the country will be the key bearish factors.”

Disruptions to exports from Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer, have supported oil. Kurdish authorities on Wednesday offered to suspend their independence drive, but Baghdad said it would continue its offensive to retake Kurdish territory.","U.S. crude slips on inventory build, gasoline rallies",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/u-s-crude-slips-on-inventory-build-gasoline-rallies-idUSKBN1CU040

For the first time since his elevation as heir to the kingdom, he will play host to a Davos-like gathering of the global investing elite. Heavyweights from SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are rolling into Riyadh to see at first hand his plans to make the city a regional financial powerhouse. Hanging over the affairs will be the up-in-the-air status of the biggest deal in capital-markets history.

A view shows Saudi Aramco's Manifa oilfield, Saudi Arabia January 22, 2015. Picture taken January 22, 2015. Saudi Aramco/Handout via REUTERS

Since the so-called Future Investment Initiative came together a few months ago under the auspices of Saudi’s massive Public Investment Fund, questions about the viability of a planned $100 billion initial public offering of stock in Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, have intensified. Chief among them is the difficulty of reaching the $2 trillion valuation for the group that the ruling family wants, according to news stories. Last week Reuters reported that China offered to buy 5 percent of Aramco in a deal that could circumvent an IPO.

The snag with the Chinese option is that Saudi Arabia has other objectives beyond raising cash to fatten the kingdom’s finances and fund social welfare. The Aramco offering is a key step towards making Riyadh a regional, if not international, capital for capital. It is part of the crown prince’s blueprint for reducing Saudi Arabia’s reliance on oil – a feat never fully achieved by a major resource economy in the modern era.

As noted in a report by State Street Global Advisors on the eve of the FII confab, which kicks off on Tuesday, “the Saudi Aramco transaction should be leveraged in a much more significant way to change the relationship between the Saudi kingdom, the stewards of the economy, its citizens and the international investment community.”

The crown prince is banking on Riyadh’s appeal as a financial hub to meet the extraordinary ambitions of his Vision 2030 plan to move away from hydrocarbons – wise given the accelerating adoption of electric vehicles – towards other industries, including financial services. Transforming the $700 billion economy and better sharing the wealth with 33 million subjects, two-thirds of whom are under the age of 30, is of existential importance for the Saudi monarchy.

Market authorities have taken strides to make the Tadawul, the Saudi bourse, an easier place for foreigners to buy shares and even short them. As a result, Saudi stocks are being considered for inclusion in indexes widely followed by investment professionals. The FTSE Russell is mulling whether to upgrade Saudi Arabia to emerging-market status. So is MSCI, which will decide by next June whether to include Saudi shares in its MSCI Emerging Markets Index. If it does, the country’s weighting, at around 2.4 percent according to State Street, could lead to inflows of around $38 billion.

But the big numbers are those associated with privatizations, with Aramco top of the list. Speaking to Reuters, Vice Minister for Economy and Planning Mohammed al-Tuwaijri estimated there could be $200 billion forthcoming from the sale of various assets ranging from housing and water to telecommunications and even religious-tourism services.

Beyond bringing in foreign direct investment, selling shares to the Saudi public could tighten the monarchy’s grip on the hearts, minds and wallets of its people. As State Street observes in its paper, such deals could involve a “National Privatization Fund”, which like a mutual fund could be offered to citizens at a discount, minimizing “public controversies over the sale of public assets”. In effect it might foster a sense of inclusive capitalism, neutralizing criticism of the royal family’s excesses, like the $500 million Italian yacht the crown prince acquired, according to news reports.

Other innovations could include increased transparency about the ownership of assets that are, effectively, the state’s patrimony. If Aramco incorporates good governance into its bylaws that, too, could help nurture an ownership culture among Saudis and reduce any mistrust of the ruling family. From this could follow other benefits, like the creation of a fixed-income market, albeit one compliant with sharia standards on lending and usury. That in turn would let banks off the hook for much of the risk while channeling capital to small and medium-sized enterprises, and away from state juggernauts.

The FII kicks off with a welcome from the crown prince followed by a panel that includes Aramco Chief Executive Amir Nasser. They need to sound convincing that the IPO of the biggest company ever to go public is on track. If the sale of the oil group is delayed or diverted, it would make the rest of Saudi’s Vision 2030 looks increasingly cloudy, too.",Breakingviews - Cox: Aramco clouds Saudi's coming-out party,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-aramco-ipo-breakingviews/breakingviews-cox-aramco-clouds-saudis-coming-out-party-idUSKBN1CT0CP

The bemused bovine and camera-wielding humans stared at each other through a chain-link fence for several minutes, according to live news video.

Officers used soccer goals to fence the animal in on a baseball diamond, but the cow barreled through one of the nets, knocking down a police officer.

Police eventually trapped the cow between two vehicles parked on either side of baseball field’s bench area after an officer appeared to fire a tranquilizer dart at it.

Officers then seemed content to let the cow roam between cars, waiting for the drug to take effect before they were able to rope the beast and load it into an NYPD horse trailer.

It was not clear where the beast came from or how it got lost. Police said they would turn it over to the animal control department after they caught it.

The chase drew torrents of posts on social media, many featuring groan-inducing puns.

For the moment, there seems to be an easing in the historic tensions between the two main – and often warring – branches of Islam. Religious differences are not the focus; this is a classic geopolitical power struggle for control of Iraq, Syria, and Kurdistan, and for expanding diplomatic and strategic reach throughout the region.

Iran is lined up to be the big winner in Syria. Islamic State's defeat will significantly lessen Sunni influence, and Tehran’s role as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's protector will only increase now that it appears Assad will remain in control of some portion of the country. Iran will have pieced together a land corridor to the Mediterranean. The Saudis will be left with little influence.

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

The same goes for the United States. American forces have been largely relegated to playing traffic cop among various on-again off-again allies such as the Turks and Kurds, each with its own agenda in Syria. Any influence Washington thinks it still has is further diluted by the presence of the Russians, who are there to support Assad while maintaining a permanent presence in the heart of the Middle East. American efforts may wind up as little more than fumbling around to keep Israel and Jordan from overreacting to the increased Iranian influence on their borders.

In Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, Riyadh appears to be pivoting towards warmer relations with the Shi’ite government in Baghdad. That a Saudi airline is announcing the first return of direct service between the two countries since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 is no coincidence, nor is it an isolated event.

The Saudis also appear ready to take advantage of a looming intra-Shi’ite power struggle in Baghdad among Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, and Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Sadr, the most religiously zealous of the group, has always been something of a nationalist and is wary of Iranian influence. It is thus not surprising he made friendly trips under official invitation to Sunni Riyadh, and the United Arab Emirates, in recent months.

Sadr is an interesting choice for the Saudis to use to gain influence in Baghdad. Real progress for Riyadh means untangling years of close Iranian cooperation in Iraq, to include limiting the power of the Iranian-backed militias. Sadr has significant influence in that respect, and can use his popularity and credibility to sell Saudi cooperation to his followers who remember Saudi funding of al Qaeda in Iraq and Islamic State over the years. Enhancing Sadr's Shi’ite religious status can further Sunni Saudi goals. During his visit, the Saudis gifted Sadr with $10 million for “rebuilding,” and also astutely threw in some visas for this year’s Hajj pilgrimage for Sadr to distribute.

The Saudis otherwise have little to work with in Iraq compared to Iran. Tehran’s ties to officials in Baghdad are just a tiny part of a deep relationship forged in the bloody fight against the American occupiers and the ousting of Islamic State. Iranian money continues to support Iraq, and the Shi’ite militias are still mostly under Iranian influence.

Iran is also probably the most stable Muslim nation in the Middle East. It has existed more or less within its current borders for thousands of years, and is largely religiously, culturally, and linguistically homogeneous (though keep an eye on the Kurdish minority.) While governed in significant part by its clerics, the country has held a series of increasingly democratic elections. And unlike the Saudi monarchs, Iran’s leaders do not rule in fear of an Islamic revolution. They already had one.

Power struggles create flashpoints, and the Saudi-Iranian fight post-Islamic State is no exception. The Saudi-Iranian proxy war in Yemen has settled into a version of World War One-style trench warfare, with neither side strong enough to win nor weak enough to lose. In an ugly form of stasis, the conflict seems likely to stay within its present borders.

The powder keg is Kurdistan. Though arguably a de facto state since 2003, after the Kurds voted formally voted for independence in a Sept. 25 referendum, Iran and the Iranian-backed government in Baghdad were pressed to make clear they will not tolerate an actual Kurdish nation. With Islamic State nearly defeated and combat-tested Shi’ite militias ready for their next tasks, Tehran and Baghdad no longer need to keep the Kurds on their side. Fighting has already broken out around Kirkuk, an oil-rich city in Iraqi Kurdistan, between forces supported by Baghdad/Tehran and Kurdish fighters – leaving a gap for the Saudis to offer financial or covert support to the Iraqi Kurds.

Saudi involvement could morph an Iraqi civil war into a new proxy struggle right on Iran’s own western border, with the possible complication of further unrest inside Iran by its Kurdish minority.

While it may seem odd to write about the changing balance of power in the Middle East largely leaving out the United States, that may well describe America’s range of options post-Islamic State.

Washington’s influence in Baghdad is limited and relations with Iran are in shambles under the Trump administration. It is highly unlikely America will join Iran to fight against Kurdish allies who helped defeat Islamic State. Nor are American troops likely to battle Iranian-led militias in support of Kurdish independence that Washington says it doesn’t really support right now.

That leaves the United States sidelined, with few options other than perhaps supporting the Saudis from afar in whatever anti-Iranian meddling they do in Iraq. A long fall from the heady days of 2003 when America was going to remake the Middle East. The victor after some 14 years of overlapping struggles?

If approved at the FCC’s November meeting, the move would be a win for newspapers and broadcasters that have pushed for the change for decades, but was criticized by Democrats who said it could usher in a new era of media consolidation.

The FCC in 1975 banned cross-ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market, unless it granted a waiver, to ensure a diversity of opinions. The rule was made before the explosion of internet and cable news and Republican President Donald Trump and Pai have vowed to reduce government regulation.

“We must stop the federal government from intervening in the news business,” Pai told a congressional panel, noting that many newspapers have closed and many radio and TV stations are struggling. Pai moved earlier this year to make it easier for some companies to own a larger number of local stations.

Pai said the marketplace no longer justifies the rules, citing Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) dominance of internet advertising.

“Online competition for the collection and distribution of news is greater than ever. And just two internet companies claim 100 percent of recent online advertising growth; indeed, their digital ad revenue this year alone will be greater than the market cap of the entire broadcasting industry,” Pai said.

FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said at the hearing Wednesday the move would lead to further consolidation in the media business and should be opposed. There are three Republicans and two Democrats on the panel.

Pai also proposes to make it easier for companies to own multiple TV and radio stations in the same market and he would allow two local stations among the top four in a market to petition the FCC to merge.

The National Association of Broadcasters said it backs Pai’s plan, noting that policymakers have approved numerous “mega-mergers” among phone, cable and satellite programmers “while at the same time blocking broadcast/newspaper or radio/TV combinations in single markets.”

The group added “this nonsensical regulatory approach has harmed the economic underpinning of newspapers, reduced local journalism jobs, and punished free and local broadcasters at the expense of our pay TV and radio competitors.”

Free Press, an advocacy group, said the proposal would make it easier for Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc (SBGI.O) to complete its $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co (TRCO.N) with fewer divestitures.

The “disastrous proposal is tailor-made for Sinclair and other giant broadcast chains that push often slanted or cookie-cutter content over the public airwaves,” the group said.","FCC to loosen TV, newspaper ownership rules",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fcc-media/fcc-to-loosen-tv-newspaper-ownership-rules-idUSKBN1CU2TD

The world’s largest online retailer on Wednesday announced Amazon Key, a lock and camera system that users control remotely to let delivery associates slip goods into their houses. Customers can create temporary passcodes for friends and other services professionals to enter as well.

The move, in the works for more than a year, may help Amazon capture sales from shoppers who could not make it home to receive an order in person, and did not want the package stolen from their doorstep. It also signals Amazon’s ambitions in the growing market for home security devices, where Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Nest Labs competes.

“This is not an experiment for us,” said Peter Larsen, Amazon vice president of delivery technology, in an interview. “This is a core part of the Amazon shopping experience from this point forward.”

Members of Amazon’s Prime shopping club can pay $249.99 and up for a cloud-controlled camera and lock that the company offers to install. Delivery associates are told to ring a doorbell or knock when they arrive at someone’s house. If no one greets them, they press ‘unlock’ in a mobile app, and Amazon checks its systems in an instant to make sure the right associate and package are present.

The camera then streams video to the customer who remotely can watch the in-home delivery take place. The associate cannot proceed with other trips until the home is again locked.

It is unclear if such protections will persuade customers that the service is safe to use.

Larsen said theft was “not something that happens in practice,” based on early tests of the Amazon Key program.

He added that if a problem arises, “You can call customer service, file a claim and Amazon will work with you to make sure it’s right,” reimbursing customers in some cases.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Amazon’s biggest retail rival, has similar plans. It said last month it would test delivering grocery items “straight into your fridge” with August Home, a smart lock business that Assa Abloy AB (ASSAb.ST) said it will acquire.

With the Republican-controlled Congress’s attempts to roll back laws introduced in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis largely stalled, banks are looking to regulators, particularly the U.S. central bank, to loosen the reins through rule tweaks and more lenient supervision.

Quarles, a former Wall Street lawyer and private equity investor nominated to the Fed by Trump last summer and sworn in this month, will have the most influence in such efforts due to the central bank’s extensive financial oversight powers.

“Normally, when you get a new governor at the Fed, you don’t see anything for a few months,” said Wayne Abernathy, executive vice president at the American Bankers Association and a former colleague of Quarles at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush.

“I think the expectations for Quarles are higher, because there was so much fanfare about the position. He’s going to feel some kind of pressure to show something.”

The Fed declined to comment.

With Quarles on board, banks and analysts expect the Fed to ease aspects of everyday examination and supervision, in particular reducing the number of post-inspection notices demanding fixes to technical compliance issues, ranging from sales practices to outsourcing contracts.

These ‘Matters Requiring Attention’ notices were originally conceived to raise specific concerns but are increasingly being used by watchdogs to police hundreds of activities, bogging down boards and senior managers in paperwork.

The Treasury has also identified several areas where the Fed has unilateral power to ease the liquidity and capital requirements on foreign banks operating in the United States, in some cases by simply deferring to their home rules.

The Fed’s annual stress tests analyzing how a bank would cope with market shocks - known as CCAR - are another key area where Quarles is likely to quickly make his mark.

“Now that Randal Quarles is in place, what we expect is that in fairly short order there will be some modifications to the way the CCAR works, because that is something that can largely be done at the behest of supervision,” Guy Moszkowski, managing partner at financial analyst firm Autonomous Research, told a conference on Tuesday.

STRESS TEST OVERHAUL

Quarles, who turned 60 last month, will be the first vice chair of banking supervision, a role created after the financial crisis but never filled during President Barack Obama’s administration. He will also serve as a Fed governor.

Former Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo effectively ran banking supervision until he stepped down in February, overseeing a strict implementation of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and administering rigorous “stress tests.”

Banks have complained that the testing process, which combines both quantitative and qualitative information, is too opaque, based on overly-conservative assumptions, and insensitive to different business models.

The Fed has indicated it is willing to refine stress tests, but Quarles is expected to push ahead with an overhaul - making the assumptions more generous, giving banks more information on the models, or moving to a less onerous two-year cycle. He is also likely to phase-out the qualitative aspect of the tests which gives the Fed wide-ranging discretion to fail lenders, bank lobbyists said.

The effort will be no cakewalk.

Quarles will be closely scrutinized by Democrats and consumer advocacy groups who are worried that deregulation will allow banks to return to their pre-crisis risky behavior.

Dodd-Frank does not give Quarles extensive unilateral powers, and he will have to get approval from the Fed board for any major changes, such as easing capital rules.

Trump is also expected to name a new Fed chief in the next couple of weeks. The front-runners, current Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford University economist John Taylor, have both said there is a need to reduce the regulatory burden on banks and are expected to support Quarles’ efforts.

But for other measures, including relaxing the Volcker rule, which restricted banks’ ability to trade with their own cash, other regulators will also need to agree.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), currently headed by an Obama-era appointee who has generally opposed rolling back rules, is expected to be a drag on the inter-agency process until a Trump pick is named and confirmed as a replacement, likely this spring. Reaching an agreement even then will be tough, say lawyers, due to the complexity of the rule, which is hundreds of pages long.

Still, those who know Quarles believe he is well-suited in terms of experience and personality to navigate the Fed’s halls of power. They point to his success in helping to negotiate trade deals during his time at the Treasury.

“He isn’t the kind of person that bows to consensus,” said the ABA’s Abernathy. “He’s the type of person who makes consensus.”",Banks rest hopes for lighter regulatory burden on Fed's Quarles,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-quarles/banks-rest-hopes-for-lighter-regulatory-burden-on-feds-quarles-idUSKBN1CU30M?il=0

The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York launched the probe in conjunction with federal special counsel Robert Mueller, the Wall Street Journal reported late on Tuesday. Bloomberg separately reported that subpoenas had been issued in the case.

Representatives for Manafort did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reports. The Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office, led by acting U.S. attorney Joon Kim, had no comment.

The probe marks the latest investigation of Manafort that comes amid the ongoing larger examination of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential race and possible collusion by the Trump campaign and associates.

Separate investigations into Manafort’s financial transactions have been launched by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, including scrutiny of Manafort’s real estate deals.

U.S. investigators examining Manafort’s financial transactions are seeking to push him into cooperating with their probe into the possible collusion, two sources with direct knowledge of the investigation have said.

Manafort, who headed the Trump campaign for several months before resigning, has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

Mueller’s team and congressional investigators are also probing Manafort, whose Virginia apartment was raided by agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in July.

Russia has denied any meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign and has condemned the investigation as a political witch hunt.

Reports of the latest probe come as Trump is poised to appoint dozens of new U.S. attorneys across the United States, including in New York after seeking mass resignations earlier this year.

Kim took over as the Manhattan U.S. attorney when Trump fired Preet Bharara as part of the wave of resignations in March.

Earlier this month, Politico reported that Trump personally interviewed at least two candidates for the positions in Manhattan and Brooklyn, an unusual move that raised some questions given Trump’s business roots in New York.

The Brooklyn U.S. attorney’s office is examining Kushner Cos, the company owned by the family of Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner, according to the Journal.

Judge Tanya Chutkan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia late on Tuesday temporarily extended the deadline for complying with the subpoena, according to court records seen on Wednesday.

Republicans on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee earlier this month subpoenaed an unidentified bank for the last two years of records of the accounts of Fusion GPS.

Congressional investigators and Special Counsel Robert Mueller are pursuing allegations in the dossier assembled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele of connections between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia.

It has been widely reported that supporters of Republican Jeb Bush, one of Trump’s opponents for the party’s presidential nomination, initially paid for research that was later picked up by supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

A letter sent on Tuesday to Fusion’s lawyers by Perkins Coie, a law firm which represented both the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s campaign, confirmed that Perkins Coie had hired Fusion GPS in April 2016 to conduct election related research. A source familiar with the matter said Fusion GPS did not hire Steele until late May 2016.

President Trump, who disputes he and his associates colluded with Moscow officials and has called the investigations a “witch hunt,” raised the issue again on Wednesday.

“The whole Russia thing is what it’s turned out to be. This was the Democrats coming up with an excuse for losing an election,” Trump told reporters as he was leaving for Dallas.

Fusion last week sued the bank and asked the court to issue an injunction ordering the bank not to comply with the subpoena. Lawyers for Fusion argued that the subpoena, signed by House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes, was “exceedingly broad.”

The lawyers also argued that Nunes issuing the subpoena was “not a legitimate legislative activity” because Nunes had “served on President Donald Trump’s campaign” and had “recused himself” from the panel’s probe into allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 campaign to help Trump. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations.

In a court filing on behalf of the committee, lawyers for the House of Representatives asked the judge to reject Fusion’s request to block the subpoena. A footnote said the top two Democrats in the House did not endorse the request.

On Wednesday, Trump also echoed unsubstantiated allegations revived on Tuesday by Republicans that when Clinton was secretary of state she approved a sale of U.S. uranium to Russia in exchange for contributions to her husband’s charity.

“I think the uranium sales to Russia and the way it was done, so underhanded, with tremendous amounts of money being passed, I actually think that’s Watergate modern age,” Trump said.",Judge gives research firm in Trump-Russia probe more time to answer subpoena,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-russia-house/judge-gives-research-firm-in-trump-russia-probe-more-time-to-answer-subpoena-idINKBN1CU306?il=0

Odinga, however, backed away from previous promises to hold large-scale protests on election day.

“We advise Kenyans who value democracy and justice to hold vigil and prayers away from polling stations, or just stay at home,” he told a cheering crowd of thousands of people on Wednesday in Uhuru Park, in the capital Nairobi.

“Convince your friends, neighbors and everyone else not participate,” he said, but if they support the president, he cautioned “do not insult or assault them. Instead, seek to open their eyes.”

Odinga is refusing to participate because he said that the election commission has failed to implement reforms to prevent another failed poll.

The Supreme Court was due to hear cases seeking to delay the polls but was unable to do so after five out of seven judges had failed to turn up, preventing a quorum.

Minutes after Chief Justice David Maraga said the case could not be heard, hundreds of supporters took to the streets of Kisumu, Odinga’s main stronghold.

Riot police used teargas to disperse them. Two protesters had gunshot wounds, a Reuters witness said.

“If the government subverts the sovereign will of the people ... then people are entitled to rebel against this government,” Kisumu governor Anyang Nyong‘o, a hardline Odinga supporter, told reporters in Kisumu.

Such comments seem certain to fuel fears of a major confrontation with security forces, already blamed for killing nearly 50 people in Kisumu and Nairobi slums after the canceled August vote.

For some in East Africa’s economic powerhouse, the instability has rekindled memories of large-scale ethnic violence that killed 1,200 people following a disputed election in 2007.","Kenya opposition leader urges vote boycott, civil disobedience",https://www.reuters.com/article/kenya-election/kenya-opposition-leader-urges-vote-boycott-civil-disobedience-idINKBN1CU10F

Etisalat Nigeria took out a $1.2 billion syndicated loan from a group of 13 local banks four years ago but has defaulted on repayments this year due to a currency crisis and recession in Nigeria.

A banking source told Reuters last week that the central bank had asked lenders involved in the loan to take a 5 percent provision as part of their third-quarter results.

Okonkwo said Fidelity Bank was also raising provisions across its loan book. “We are revising (the non-performing loan ratio) from sub-5 percent to sub-6 percent by end of the year, due to currency conversion and some risk on the oil and gas book,” he told an analysts call held to discuss its nine-month results.

“We have seen some improvements in the transport sector and the consumer book.”

Net loans stood at 753.8 billion naira as of September, up 4.9 percent from a year earlier. The bank was targeting 7.5 percent loan growth this year, Okonkwo said.

Fidelity Bank on Monday posted a pretax profit of 16.24 billion naira for the nine months through September, up from 9.83 billion a year ago.

The Nigerian Senate on Tuesday voted in favour of launching an investigation into the default of Etisalat Nigeria and into how its funds were used.

Nigerian lenders have picked Barclays to try to find new investors for 9mobile, two banking sources told Reuters last week.

Okonkwo also said the bank had submitted details of personal and business accounts that lacked complete identification to the central bank following a court order. He declined to say how many accounts were involved.

A court has ordered a temporary freeze on millions of bank accounts with incomplete identification documents and the forfeiture of funds in those accounts as the government seeks to ensure compliance with money laundering rules.

The bank said it had notified customers about the court ruling and advised them to regularize their accounts.

Shares in Fidelity, which has gained 85 percent so far this year, rose 4.5 percent on Wednesday to 1.62 naira.

Puigdemont spurned an invitation to explain his position to the Senate in Madrid on Thursday – an indication of the rigid stands taken by both sides in Spain’s gravest political crisis since the end of the Franco dictatorship in 1975.

He also kept his silence on whether to call for a new regional election, a move which might prompt the Madrid government to postpone its plan to take over Catalonia’s institutions and police.

The next few days could prove crucial in the battle of wills that has followed an independence referendum on Oct. 1, which Madrid declared illegal and the Catalan government said endorsed its claim to statehood.

While it is not clear how the central government will take over in practical terms, nor how Catalan civil servants and police will react, some independence supporters have threatened a campaign of civil disobedience, raising the possibility of ugly confrontations.

The Catalan secessionist drive is the most serious existential challenge to a Western European country since the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, when voters in the end decided to stay part of the United Kingdom.

It has caused deep resentment elsewhere in Spain, caused a flight of business from the wealthy region, and worried other European leaders who see it as fanning separatist sentiment elsewhere on the continent.

Madrid has rejected Puigdemont’s calls for dialogue to resolve the situation, saying he first must withdraw an ambiguous declaration of independence made earlier this month. But it did invite to him address the Senate on Thursday.

However, late on Wednesday the Catalan leader turned down the offer, a spokesman for the regional government said, on the grounds that Madrid had already announced its plans to impose direct control on the autonomous region.

The Senate is expected to give the green light for that on Friday morning.

It was still unclear if Puigdemont would make a unilateral declaration of independence, which, given the opposition from the Madrid government as well as European leaders, would be merely symbolic.

ROCK AND HARD PLACE

Also up in the air was whether he would call a snap regional election, something a senior Catalan politician said on Tuesday was being considered. He could still do this on Friday before the Senate strips him of his powers and imposes direct rule.

Some Spanish political and business leaders, along with most Catalan newspapers, have backed the idea as a snap election could forestall direct rule and help break the deadlock.

Calling an election could also either strengthen Puigdemont’s mandate if pro-independence parties won, or allow him a graceful exit if they did not.

An opinion poll published by the El Periodico newspaper on Sunday showed a snap election would probably have results similar to the last ballot, in 2015, when a coalition of pro-independence parties formed a minority government.

The actual steps to enforce direct rule could be taken gradually in order not to inflame the situation. Catalonia said on Monday it was confident its officials, including the police, would defy attempts by Madrid to take over institutions.

Analyst Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence said Puigdemont was caught between radicals and moderates in the Catalan establishment.

Radical elements want him to make the Catalan parliament declare independence unilaterally on Thursday or Friday. This would provoke a tough government reaction, playing into their hands, he said.

More moderate voices have said that if he calls an early election, he could stop the imposition of direct rule.

Their plan to overhaul what they call a broken tax code leaves out many key details. But one point gets hammered home: Republicans say they want to make filing taxes easier. The first principle for President Trump’s tax plan, their outline states, is to “make the tax code simple, fair and easy to understand.” There are a dozen more references to simplification throughout the rest of the document.

The Republican promise is that they want to make filing taxes as easy as mailing a postcard. But their plan doesn’t get anywhere close to that, while overlooking a straightforward reform that would. Instead of reducing complexity, the GOP plan mostly lowers and flattens rates. For example, it reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three.

However, the effort of filing taxes has nothing to do with how many brackets there are -- figuring out which bracket you fall in is the easy part. What makes doing taxes complicated is figuring out which deductions, credits, and loopholes to claim. Republicans would close some loopholes, but they would open others -- including a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses that will entice rich people with the right accounting team to get creative in order to reap the rewards. (Tycoons with family-owned businesses, such as Donald Trump, especially stand to benefit from this change, which would allow law firms, hedge funds, and real estate brokerages to file under a much lower rate.) Such loopholes make the code more complex to navigate, not less.

Simple tax filing isn’t a hopeless goal, however. There’s something Congress could do that would radically simplify the process of filing taxes for the vast majority of U.S. taxpayers.

It’s called return-free filing. In countries such as Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Spain, the government basically prepares tax returns for its citizens. It already has most of the information it needs: Employers have to tell tax authorities how much they pay their employees, while forms like W-2s and 1099s provide other necessary details. In Japan, for example, the country’s tax agency sends everyone a document with how much they earned, how much was withheld, and how much they owe or are owed in taxes.

If Washington adopted this policy, the government would fill out a return for every resident with the information it already keeps on file. Taxpayers who wanted to itemize their returns or dispute the numbers would be free to do so, but otherwise they could simply sign off on the government’s math. In some countries, merely taking no action constitutes an approval and therefore counts as doing your taxes.

Instead, in the United States it’s up to every taxpayer to gather their forms, enter all the numbers into a long document, ensure that everything has been calculated accurately, and send it all in. It takes a collective 2.6 billion hours to get this done. Americans pay an average $200 each for the pleasure of doing their taxes, or around 10 percent of the average federal tax refund.

Return-free filing, on the other hand, could save an estimated collective 225 million hours of tax filing work and $2 billion in costs. Up to 60 million households would no longer have to file any returns.

The concept is not entirely foreign to the United States. President Ronald Reagan called for something just like it in his 1985 Tax Reform Act, arguing that Americans should “not even have to fill out a return.” Since then, Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken up the crusade, introducing legislation two years in a row that would instruct the IRS to develop a free, online return-free filing option, allowing taxpayers to download their information straight from the government and into a form. The idea is even supported by conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.

But it hasn’t moved forward; last year, Warren’s bill didn’t even make it out of committee.

That’s because some deep-pocketed companies have worked tirelessly to bury it. If most Americans no longer needed help doing their taxes, business would dry up for tax preparers such as H&R Block and TurboTax. More than half of all individual tax returns filed in 2014 were prepared by a tax professional, while about 80 percent of Americans use either software or a preparer.

These companies have said as much publicly. Intuit, the software company that makes TurboTax, has said in filings that it “opposes IRS government tax preparation” and that such legislation “may present a continued competitive threat to our business in the foreseeable future.” Liberty Tax Service stated in 2015 that “demand for our products is related to the complexity of tax return preparation.”

So they’ve spent heavily to campaign against return-free filing. H&R Block, which ProPublica says spent $3 million on lobbying last year, fought hard against Warren’s bill. Intuit spent $2 million in the same year, much of it in favor of legislation that would block the government from offering return-free filing. The firm has lobbied in favor of a number of similar past bills.

Republicans have long claimed that they want to make taxes simpler, yet their proposals never live up to such promises. It’s not impossible, though; the answer is staring us right in the face. It would just require the government to put the interests of everyday taxpayers over big-spending corporate lobbyists.

Gabe Kadosh, vice president at real estate firm Colliers International, said Amazon and Whole Foods “want to have freedom to do whatever they want.","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market met a new foe this summer during talks to lease a top retail space in a San Francisco mall: the Target next door.

As City Center mall’s largest tenant, Target Corp had a say over changes to the property. According to people familiar with the lease discussions, Target balked at sharing the mall with Whole Foods because it feared competition from the grocery chain’s new owner, Amazon.com Inc.

Early attempts to persuade Target failed, and Whole Foods may now have to concede certain Amazon initiatives - such as lockers where customers can pick up goods ordered online - if it wants the location, the people said. Talks are ongoing.

A Reuters examination of real estate agreements and interviews with 20 retail landlords, lawyers and brokers show that the strings attached to operating in malls like City Center present an emerging and little-scrutinized challenge to Amazon’s quest to re-shape Whole Foods.

Across the United States, large retailers including Target, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc and Best Buy Co Inc have legal rights in many lease agreements that allow them to limit what Amazon can do with nearby Whole Foods stores, and where it can open new ones.

Documents reviewed by Reuters show bans on Amazon lockers and delivery operations near a Target store in Illinois and also in Florida, where a new Whole Foods is set to open. Lockers for retrieving online orders are a way for Amazon to spur sales through the grocery chain.

In Manhattan and other locations, the leases of Whole Foods’ big box neighbors bar it from selling a range of goods that Amazon has in its massive online inventory, from electronics to toys and linens.

Even Whole Foods stores that do not share space with major rivals can face constraints imposed by local governments. A city council resolution in White Plains, New York, restricted the hours when Whole Foods can use a loading dock prior to the grocer locating in the mall.

Amazon declined to answer questions about how these restrictions across the country impact its plans.

In a statement, Target said it is “focused on what’s best for the company and delivering on the reasons our guests love Target. Our more than 1,800 stores across the country are a strategic asset and a vital part of Target’s future.”

The company did not discuss details of the restrictions reported by Reuters, but said, “It’s inaccurate to characterize lease agreements as our corporate strategy.”

Reuters could not determine the full extent of limits on Whole Foods stores because lease deals vary from mall to mall, and many are not public. While restricting how neighbors operate is a standard practice in retail, Amazon is new to feeling the heat.

Some mall owners and real estate brokers say Whole Foods will still find landlords who are eager to have the high-profile tenant driving traffic in their malls, and see rivals trying to keep Whole Foods out as short-sighted.

But with nearly all of Whole Foods’ 473 stores subject to lease agreements and plans to add up to 85 stores, according to regulatory filings, Amazon has launched into brick-and-mortar with more constraints and entrenched enemies than in the online world it dominates.

“Many people assume this big, 800-pound gorilla is going to come and beat up all of these retailers,” said Terrison Quinn, a senior vice president at brokerage SRS Real Estate Partners. “I just don’t think that’s going to be the case.”

DOZENS OF RESTRICTIONS

Amazon wasted no time in making changes when the $13.7 billion Whole Foods deal closed in August. The world’s largest online retailer cut grocery prices, started selling its Echo home speaker in stores and disclosed plans to add lockers to some locations and Whole Foods items to Prime Now, its two-hour delivery program.

Analysts expect such moves will boost online orders and revenue for Amazon. But big box rivals have a number of ways to fight back.

Retailers routinely negotiate guarantees that their landlords will not alter malls in a way that hurts sales, whether leasing to a strip club or starting construction projects without approval, real estate lawyers said.

These leases, which often last 10 to 20 years with options to renew, may even name competitors barred from opening a store.

A 16-page memo in July detailing the lease restrictions governing Miami’s Pinecrest Place mall, obtained by Reuters, offers a glimpse of the legal protections retailers are securing.

Target required an affiliate of national landlord Regency Centers Corp to bar “Any lockers, lock-boxes or other type of storage system that is used to receive or store merchandise from a catalog or online retailer.”

The document then specifies more than a dozen other restrictions for the mall, from leasing space to a pet shop or toy store to operating “a fulfillment center in connection with receiving, storing or distributing merchandise from a catalog or online retailer.”

Regency announced in April that Whole Foods will open in the center, meaning the store cannot have Amazon lockers or fulfill orders for Prime Now.

A May memo of lease for a Target in Evanston, Illinois, obtained by Reuters, contains similar prohibitions against lockers and online fulfillment.

In another case, Target raised similar concerns about Amazon for a prospective Whole Foods location at the Stonestown Galleria in San Francisco, people familiar with the matter said.

A Reuters analysis showed that 7 percent of existing Whole Foods' U.S. stores are within a quarter mile, or roughly five-minute walk, of a Target.

OPPOSITION ABOUNDS

Target is not alone in placing limits on Amazon.

Lidl, a German grocery chain expanding in the United States, said in a deal this year it would “prohibit the operation of pickup facilities” by rivals such as “Wal-Mart and Amazon... that sell grocery items” near a planned store on Long Island in New York, according to a person familiar with the matter. The language is becoming common, the person said.

Will Harwood, a spokesman for Lidl, said, “We adhere to industry norms and standard real estate practices when securing sites.”

A Bed Bath & Beyond store in lower Manhattan bars its next-door tenant - Whole Foods - from selling linens, bathroom items, housewares and frames, its memo of lease said. The company declined to comment.

And a Best Buy store just north of Miami has the exclusive right in its shopping center to sell electronics. A lease carve-out, which states other tenants can sell gadgets on less than 250 square feet of floor space, allowed for the mall’s Whole Foods to display the Echo speaker, according to a memo seen by Reuters and a reporter who visited the location.

“It is pretty standard for anchor tenants of a shopping center to reserve the right in their leases to prohibit improvements to a center - including the addition of new tenants - without approval and consent,” said Jeff Shelman, spokesman for Best Buy.

Gabe Kadosh, vice president at real estate firm Colliers International, said Amazon and Whole Foods “want to have freedom to do whatever they want.

Three large regional banks - Dallas-based Comerica Inc (CMA.N), Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N), and Cleveland-based KeyCorp (KEY.N) - together earned $2.93 billion in net interest income in the July-September period, an increase of 15 percent from a year earlier.

Wall Street analysts had reckoned that these banks would earn $2.95 billion among them, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Third-quarter net interest margins, the difference between interest paid and earned, and a key indicator of profitability, increased by 6 basis points on average across most banks, from the second quarter, according to Instinet.

Net interest margins have benefited from the three interest rate increases since the second quarter of last year.

The Fed is expected to raise rates again in December. The odds of a December move stand at 96.7 percent, compared with 87.8 percent a week ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.

If there is no rate hike in December, it will have “some negative impact” on margin outlook for 2018, D.A. Davidson analyst Gary Tenner said.

But higher interest rates cut both ways: boosting profits even as they push up borrowing costs, capping loan growth.

KeyCorp on Thursday cut its fourth-quarter loan-growth forecast to the lower-end of its previously given range of $87 billion to $88 billion range. PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) said on Oct 13 it expects modest loan growth in the current quarter, compared with the third quarter when it reported a 1 percent growth.

“Banks have been operating in a slow growth/low interest rate environment for a long time and have spent time bringing down expenses. Control what you can control has been the message,” Stephens analyst Terry McEvoy said.

“I think that will continue to be the case if we don’t get more rate hikes.”

SunTrust said on Friday that third-quarter non-interest expenses, which include most operating and overhead costs, declined 1.3 percent to $1.39 billion. Comerica’s non-interest expense fell 6.1 percent in the same period, the company said on Oct 17.

Several of the regional banks raised provisions for loan losses mainly to deal with possible bad loans coming after hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

Pittsburg-based PNC saw a $32 million rise in provisions, out of which $10 million were related to hurricanes. SunTrust, which has more than 400 branches in Florida, reported a $23 million rise in provisions.

Sub-Saharan Africa falls behind other parts of the world by most education standards, with one in four young people unable to read and 33 million children out of primary school, more than half of all those in the world.

The problems largely stem from lack of government regulation, corruption, high school costs, and other factors that could be improved if states were held liable, UNESCO said in a new report.

While 70 percent of all countries have at least nine years of compulsory education, only 40 percent of countries in sub-Saharan Africa do, the report found.

“Accountability should start with the government,” UNESCO’s regional director Gwang-Chol Chang told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in Senegal, though he emphasized that families and communities also have a role to play.

One problem in West and Central Africa is that school curriculums are often European-inspired and not adapted to the local context, Chang said, making school feel irrelevant and leaving graduates ill-equipped for the job market.

The report found in many African countries, low-fee private schools catering to poor populations are popping up faster than governments can handle so they remain unregulated and often have unqualified teachers.

In Ghana and Niger, the percentage of trained primary school teachers has fallen since 2000, the report said.

Although African governments are often hard-pressed for funds, this does not excuse many of the deficiencies in their education systems, said Teopista Birungi Mayanja, coordinator of the Africa Network Campaign on the Education for All movement committed to providing basic quality education for everyone.

“It’s only partly due to lack of resources,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding that civil society groups, unions, and other actors need to have a greater role in education decision-making.

“Unless governments allow all these voices at the table, they will never come up with a credible plan.”

The U.S. Senate killed a rule late on Tuesday that allowed consumers to band together to sue banks and credit card companies even when the small print of their contracts forced them into closed-door arbitration with their grievances.

It was a huge win for banks, who feared a flood of costly lawsuits. But for financial firms already under the spotlight for poor treatment of customers, the bad publicity may make it difficult for them to avoid court.

Credit-scoring agency Equifax Inc (EFX.N) said on Wednesday it would still allow customers to sue it over its massive cyber breach, highlighting the tricky path some financial firms have to navigate.

“Every company is not now sitting up and saying ‘let’s take advantage of this.’ It’s more complicated than that. Each does its own cost/benefit analysis,” said Christine Scheuneman, senior partner at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman.

Equifax initially turned to arbitration clauses in the face of its cyber hack but public pressure and threats from state attorneys general forced it to drop the requirement for 145.5 million consumers affected by the breach.

Politicians also slammed Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) for wanting to settle customer complaints over abusive sales practices through arbitration and Chief Executive Tim Sloan told Senators this month that the company would not stop them suing.

But the bank is fighting some customers in federal court in Utah over their attempts to take legal action against it.

Lawyers involved in that case did not respond to calls. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment on how the bank would respond to the Senate move.

JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) have such clauses for checking account customers. They have no plans to change those agreements, spokeswomen for the two companies said.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

Several global companies, including GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L), have expressed interest in bidding for the unit, which had sales of about $3.4 billion in 2016.

The prospective sale, which is being led by Centerview Partners, Guggenheim Securities and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), was first mooted on Oct. 10, when Pfizer said it was considering strategic options for the unit.

But preliminary discussions with interested parties including Reckitt have already taken place, one of the sources said, adding the U.S. drugmaker wants to get the ball rolling before the end of this year.

GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley confirmed on Wednesday she would look “carefully” at the business.

Three people familiar with the situation said the British drugmaker had hired Citi (C.N) to represent it in the auction. GSK declined to comment while Citi was not immediately available.

Other possible bidders could include Procter & Gamble (PG.N), Sanofi (SASY.PA), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Nestle (NESN.S), several sources said.

Pfizer plans to send out financial information about the consumer unit to prospective buyers in around three weeks time, one of the sources said.

The process is expected to heat up early next year as bids come in and a deal could be sealed around the middle of 2018, the source said.

Germany’s Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) is also looking to divest its consumer health business and has hired JP Morgan (JPM.N) to sell the unit, best known for making Seven Seas vitamins.

Some banking and industry sources said Merck could put the divestment on hold since the sale, estimated to be worth around $4.5 billion, risked being eclipsed by the Pfizer auction.

One source said Pfizer believed keen competition would allow it to raise at least $20 billion from the sale of the business, whose well-known brands include painkiller Advil, Centrum multivitamins and lip balm Chapstick.

As aging populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand for self-medication, the consumer health sector has proved a fertile ground for deal-making in recent years.

But the industry remains fragmented and GSK’s Walmsley said she expected more merger activity, with GSK in a strong position to act as a “consolidator”.

Although consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, they are typically very long-lasting brands with loyal customers.

Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said he was considering the sale of consumer healthcare because it was not integral to the core prescription drug business and might be worth more outside the group.

GSK has taken a different view, opting to retain a diverse portfolio in which consumer health offers a hedge against riskier prescription drugs.

For Reckitt, meanwhile, over-the-counter medicines offer higher-margin growth than its household business. Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor, who last week announced plans to separate Reckitt into health and home and hygiene divisions, said he would weigh a bid if Pfizer’s strategic review resulted in a sale.

Cleber Rene Rizerio Rocha, who prosecutors said tried to help get money out of the United States that a co-founder of TelexFree Inc left behind when he fled the country, entered his plea in federal court in Boston.

Rocha, who pled guilty to conspiracy and money laundering charges, is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 7. While the charges each carry up to 20 years in prison, prosecutors have agreed to recommend a 40-month term based on his cooperation.

The 28-year-old’s case stemmed from an investigation of TelexFree, a Massachusetts-based company that sold voice-over-internet telephone service and was founded by James Merrill, a U.S. citizen, and Carlos Wanzeler, a Brazilian.

Prosecutors said TelexFree was a pyramid scheme, making little to no money selling its service while taking in millions of dollars from thousands of people who paid to sign up to be “promoters” and post ads online for it.

TelexFree collapsed in 2014, inflicting more than $3 billion in losses on nearly 1.89 million people worldwide, prosecutors said.

Merrill was arrested in 2014. He was sentenced in March to six years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges.

Wanzeler in 2014 fled to Brazil, where he cannot be extradited from, leaving behind tens of millions of dollars he laundered from TelexFree accounts, prosecutors said.

In 2015, Leonardo Casula Francisco, Wanzeler’s nephew, asked someone who became a cooperating witness to help transfer cash generated from the scheme that Wanzeler had hidden in the greater Boston area out of the United States, prosecutors said.

The pair agreed someone would be sent to the United States to deliver the money in increments to the witness, who would send it to accounts in Hong Kong where it would be transferred to Brazil, prosecutors said.

In December, Casula sent Rocha to the United States to deliver money to the witness, an indictment said.

After a Jan. 4 meeting in a parking lot where Rocha gave the witness $2.2 million in a suitcase, federal agents followed Rocha to a Westborough, Massachusetts, apartment complex, prosecutors said.

They said that after Rocha was arrested, he helped agents locate the apartment, where they found $17 million hidden under a mattress.",Brazilian who led U.S. to $17 million under mattress pleads guilty,https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKBN1CO2I1

Domino, who for a while was mistakenly thought to have been killed when Hurricane Katrina devastated his New Orleans neighborhood in 2005, died at home on Tuesday of natural causes, the Jefferson Parish Coroner’s Office said.

As one of the pioneers of rock ‘n’ roll in the 1950s, Domino sold 65 million records - more than anyone in that period except Elvis Presley, according to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

He had dozens of songs on the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts, including “Blueberry Hill,” “Ain’t That a Shame,” “Blue Monday,” “I‘m Walkin’,” “Whole Lotta Loving,” “Hello, Josephine,” “Walking to New Orleans,” “I‘m Gonna Be a Wheel Some Day” and “Let the Four Winds Blow.”

“For lack of a better way of putting it, he’s a living, walking legend among us in New Orleans,” singer Irma Thomas told the New York Times in 2007. “Between him and Louis Armstrong, they were the first big names to put us on the musical map.”

Antoine Dominique Domino was born on Feb. 26, 1928 in New Orleans and one of nine children. A brother-in-law taught him piano, leading to a style that mixed the classic New Orleans sound with blues, country and Cajun music. He was performing in nightclubs while still a teenager and soon teamed with trumpet player Dave Bartholomew, who would become his co-writer and producer and help refine his piano style.

His nickname was attributed to his short, squatty stature, as well as a tribute to two other pianists - Fats Waller and New Orleans native Fats Pichon.

Like contemporaries Little Richard and Chuck Berry, Domino was a black performer whose music crossed over to white audiences and helped shape early rock.

His first hit was an R&B song, the autobiographical “The Fat Man,” recorded in 1949 and considered among the first songs in the rock ‘n’ roll genre.

Also like Little Richard, one of his biggest hits, “Ain’t That a Shame,” was later recorded by Pat Boone, a white singer, whose version received more radio airplay. A live version of the song by the rock band Cheap Trick was a hit in 1978.

Domino would be a huge influence on rockers who came after him - John Lennon told a New York radio station that “Ain’t That a Shame” was the first song he learned to play - but his prominence began to wane after the British invasion and other forms of rock took root in the 1960s.

Harry Connick Jr., from a later generation of New Orleans musicians, said on Twitter, “You helped pave the way for new orleans piano players... see you on top of that blueberry hill in the sky.” Guitarist Vernon Reid of the band Living Color mourned Domino’s death by tweeting, “Rock & Roll lost part of it’s soul.”

In his later years Domino was reluctant to perform and rarely left his beloved hometown, but he did go to Indianola, Mississippi, in 2015 to play “Amazing Grace” at B.B. King’s funeral.

Domino was a longtime resident of New Orleans’ Ninth Ward - the section of the city hit hardest by Katrina’s floodwaters - and had resisted early pleas to evacuate as the hurricane approached. For a time he was believed to have died in the flooding and the words “R.I.P. Fats You will be missed” were spray-painted on his house, which was flooded up to the roof.

It was later learned that Domino and his family had been rescued by boat and taken to the refugee center set up at the Superdome in the city before going to Baton Rouge. They lost most of their possessions in the flood but managed to save Domino’s couch, which was custom-made from the rear end of a vintage pink Cadillac.

After Katrina, he moved to a New Orleans suburb to live with his daughter.

The Recording Industry of America late gave Domino reproductions to replace the 20 gold record awards he lost. His Grammy Awards also were replaced and President George W. Bush visited Domino to give him a new National Medal of the Arts.

Domino titled his 2006 album “Alive and Kickin’” and proceeds went to help rebuild New Orleans and preserve its musical heritage.

O dólar recuou 0,07 por cento, a 3,2451 reais na venda, depois de acumular avanço de 2,60 por cento nos quatro pregões anteriores.

Na mínima do dia, a moeda norte-americana chegou a 3,2290 reais e, na máxima, a 3,2604 reais. O dólar futuro era negociado com baixa de cerca de 0,10 por cento no final da tarde.

“A questão de não ter quorum (para votar a admissibilidade da segunda denúncia contra Temer) está pegando, porque o mercado começa a perceber que não adianta ter um discurso otimista por parte do governo sobre a reforma da Previdência, se nem quorum consegue”, afirmou o operador da H. Commcor Corretora, Cleber Alessie Machado.

O plenário da Câmara dos Deputados, até o fechamento do mercado, não tinha atingido quorum mínimo para votar a nova denúncia contra o presidente, sinal de dificuldade do governo em reunir pelo menos 342 deputado para iniciar os trabalhos.

A segunda denúncia da Procuradoria-Geral da República (PGR) contra o presidente é pelos crimes de obstrução de Justiça e organização criminosa.

O placar, para o mercado, é importante por sinalizar o apoio que o governo terá no Legislativo para dar continuidade a importantes medidas econômicas. O cenário na Câmara ficou ainda mais tumultuado à tarde, após notícia de que Temer foi internado em Brasília com problemas urológicos.

“A vitória de Temer está praticamente precificada, a novidade será o placar da votação para avaliarmos o capital político que ele terá para aprovar as reformas, especialmente a da Previdência”, afirmou pela manhã o analista-chefe da corretora Rico, Roberto Indech.

Nos últimos dias, Temer se empenhou em tentar conseguir 263 votos pela rejeição da segunda denúncia, mesmo placar alcançado na primeira. Para isso, liberou emendas parlamentares e ainda cedeu em uma série de medidas de interesses de deputados para conseguir se manter no cargo.

O cenário externo também estava no foco, com a sucessão do comando do Federal Reserve, banco central norte-americano, tirando o sono dos investidores.

O presidente dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, tem dito que ainda avaliava pelo menos três nomes: o diretor do Fed Jerome Powell, o economista da Universidade de Stanford John Taylor e a atual chair do Fed, Janet Yellen.

Trump usou um almoço com senadores republicanos na véspera para saber suas opiniões sobre quem ele deveria escolher para comandar o Fed, de acordo com parlamentares que participaram do encontro.

Uma fonte familiar com o assunto disse que mais senadores preferiam Taylor do que o diretor do Fed Jerome Powell, e que Trump também havia dito que estava pensando em indicar Yellen para novo mandato.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

Trump had threatened to cut off the subsidies for months, prompting health insurers to raise premiums or exit insurance markets set by under Obamacare.
While Democrats accused Trump of sabotaging Obamacare, the president argued that the subsidies enriched insurance companies.

U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco sided with the Trump administration, saying the government does not have to make the payments while litigation over the subsidies unfolds.

Chhabria, appointed by Democratic former President Barack Obama, wrote that although the case appears to be a close call “it appears initially that the Trump administration has the stronger legal argument.”

The Trump administration this month terminated the payments to the insurers, which help cover medical expenses for low-income Americans, as part of several moves to dismantle Obama’s signature healthcare law formally known as the Affordable Care Act.

The subsidies were due to cost $7 billion this year and were estimated at $10 billion for 2018, according to congressional analysts.

Trump had threatened to cut off the subsidies for months, prompting health insurers to raise premiums or exit insurance markets set by under Obamacare. The payments amount to nearly $600 million a month, according to a Justice Department court filing.

Democratic attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia sued the federal government and asked for an immediate order halting Trump’s move while the case is being litigated. They argued that terminating the payments harmed customers by raising insurance rates.

While Democrats accused Trump of sabotaging Obamacare, the president argued that the subsidies enriched insurance companies.

Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income people.

Because insurers would raise premiums on policies in the absence of the subsidies, the government would be compelled to spend more on financial assistance to low-income Americans.

For foreigners this “new era” means more risk emanating from the People’s Republic.

President Xi Jinping further consolidated his personal power during this week’s party congress, as the CCP turns back toward more autocratic government. For Westerners who argued that engagement was preferable to containment, it marks a galling moment. China has not changed politically the way liberals argued it had to, nor has its economy collapsed the way some predicted it would, absent deeper reform. Those left standing are hawks who argue that China’s model works, and is a threat. To them, letting China into the World Trade Organization in 2001 was an historic mistake.

At that time, advocates of inclusion argued it would set off a virtuous cycle of reform and wealth creation. As money trickled into the pockets of the middle class, those citizens would inevitably demand, and receive, more political freedoms. For a while, that was exactly what happened. Society opened up, the private sector revived, and foreign investment poured in. Nearly 300 million Chinese people emerged from poverty in the 1980s and 1990s.

In retrospect there was nothing inevitable about it. Reform depended heavily on the political will of reformist leaders like Premier Zhu Rongji. But the party’s willingness to keep taking tough economic medicine faded over time. China’s list of unmet WTO commitments remains long.

The middle class seems indifferent. Reports on Chinese college students abroad focus on their nationalism, their defence of their government, and their disdain for dissidents. Popular protests focus on local concerns like pollution or fraud, not votes or free speech.

China’s economic imbalances will probably force a future day of reckoning. But as far as Xi is concerned, the current political and economic controls in place are necessary for Party supremacy, even if they hurt competitiveness, or foreign relations. The rest of the world can like this, or not, but whatever the doubts about its viability, a disruptive China looks like part of the new status quo.",Breakingviews - China’s autocracy puts end to reform illusions,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress-economy-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-autocracy-puts-end-to-reform-illusions-idUSKBN1CU19V

Over the course of several years, both companies have shifted their strategy, focusing on selling low-calorie versions of their colas and buying healthier beverage brands, as consumers move away from sugary sodas.

But Coke seems to be winning the so-called cola-wars by adopting a more aggressive approach to selling juices, teas and vitamin water and taking the lead on franchising its bottling operations to cut costs.

“Coca-Cola is clearly gaining share as evidenced by the very wide performance gap between itself and PepsiCo,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi wrote in a note.

The company had a 22 percent share of the North American non-alcoholic drinks market last year, ahead of PepsiCo’s 19 percent, according to Euromonitor data.

In the third quarter, Coca-Cola’s profit rose 38 percent to $1.45 billion and North America beverage sales rose to $2.75 billion.

In contrast, PepsiCo reported a drop in quarterly beverage sales in North America for the first time in two years, hit by weak demand for Gatorade and marketing missteps.

Coca-Cola has also reined in costs by refranchising its bottling operations - a move has helped it eliminate costs of operating a low-margin business, and given it a more predictable revenue stream.

General and selling expenses were down 20 percent in the third quarter, while cost of goods sold fell 18 percent.

Recent acquisitions of non-soda beverages such as salty mineral water brand Topo Chico, Honest Tea and Unilever’s (UNc.AS) AdeS soy-based beverages have increased the options Coca-Cola can offer to consumers.

Excluding items, the company earned a profit of 50 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate by a cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue fell 14.6 percent to $9.08 billion due to the refranchising, but beat the average estimate of $8.72 billion.

After reuniting with his mischievous and devious brother Loki, Thor discovers they have a sister, the formidable Hela (Cate Blanchett), who has her eyes on destroying his celestial home of Asgard.

Thor loses his magic power-wielding hammer and is cast away by his sister to an unknown futuristic planet and held hostage by an eccentric Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), forced to fight his fellow Avenger, the Hulk.

“Ragnarok,” part of Walt Disney Co’s Marvel film franchise, is by far the biggest production for New Zealand director Waititi, who previously wrote and directed small, independent fare such as 2010’s “Boy” and 2016’s “Hunt For the Wilderpeople.”

But the comedy in “Ragnarok” is very much a trademark of Waititi, who likes to find comedy often by placing unlikely characters in mundane settings, such as vampires sharing an apartment in 2014’s cult hit “What We Do in the Shadows.” Waititi said in fact that the vampire mockumentary may be remade into an American TV series.

“I love the idea of ... Hulk and Thor (sitting) on the bed making up after an argument -- like, you don’t see that in these films,” Waititi said.

After-hours television was built around the set-piece interview and guest appearance when Letterman's ""Late Night"" broke the mold in 1982 with absurd pranks and send-ups. Everyday viewers went on his show to present ""stupid pet tricks."" Behind his desk, Letterman could be serious, dry and cerebral. But he often volunteered for oddball pranks. In one well-known stunt, he worked a shift at a Taco Bell in suburban New Jersey, taking pickup orders. In another sketch, Letterman was dunked in water while covered in Alka Seltzer tablets. Receiving the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center, the national showcase for arts, Letterman, 70, was praised for his imagination, comic daring and heart. Many younger comedians, including current late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, have described Letterman as a major influence. Before Kimmel's on-stage tribute to Letterman, the entertainer recalled one of his favorite, offbeat moments. ""Dave brought this doorknob out. And he put it on a table. And he said 'It's just plain big.' That was it."" Letterman hosted more than 6,000 episodes of his original ""Late Night with David Letterman"" on NBC and its successor on CBS, ""Late Show with David Letterman,"" which ended its run in May 2015. He won multiple Emmy Awards, U.S. television's highest honor, for his work as a writer, performer and producer. The Indiana native made his first of 22 appearances on ""The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson"" in 1978. After hosting ""Late Night"" for 11 years, he moved to CBS in 1993 after losing out to longtime rival Jay Leno to succeed Carson at ""The Tonight Show"". On Sunday, comic friends teased Letterman about his late-night wars with Leno and retirement but the honoree struck a poignant note in his acceptance speech. ""Mark Twain's definition of patriotism is this: Patriotism is supporting your country all the time and your government when it deserves it."" In 2012, Letterman was recognized for his contributions to the arts and American culture at the Kennedy Center Honors, a lifetime achievement awards for performing artists.

Except for small clusters of troops dotted amid the ruins and skinny cats and dogs scavenging for food, the heart of Marawi is a ghost town, all but destroyed by the Philippines’ biggest and fiercest urban battle in recent history.

Hundreds of rebels claiming allegiance to Islamic State seized large areas of the city of 200,000 people in May and clung on through unrelenting government air strikes and artillery bombardments, right until the last remaining gunmen were killed three days ago.

The military escorted media on Wednesday through the ravaged streets of the once picturesque lakeside town, showing for the first time the front lines of a devastating conflict that has stoked fears of Islamic State’s extremist agenda taking root in the region.

The scale of the damage was stark as a convoy of vans carrying reporters and cameramen followed an army truck through one district after another, stopping off at key intersections recently cleared of unexploded munitions and booby traps.

Wide boulevards in the city were lined by crumbling homes and shop fronts missing higher floors, with fragments of chairs, children’s toys and household appliances wedged into piles of crumbled concrete.

Tattered pieces of clothing poking above banks of rubble provided the only colour in the mass of gutted grey buildings blackened by smoke. Vans, pickup trucks and cars were turned over, coated in rust or torn apart by bomb blasts.

The militants’ planning, stockpiling of weapons and their combat capability stunned government forces, who had to fight street by street to take back the city and were often pinned down by snipers and homemade bombs.

“At first our forces cannot press them, they moved from one building to the next. Our concept was to restrict them - it took time, but we constricted them,” said Lieutenant Colonel Sam Yunque, a special forces commander deployed in Marawi since the beginning of the conflict.

“We innovated to suppress their techniques. They were not better than us, that’s why they lost.”

RUINS OF WAR

The Philippines announced the end of combat operations in Marawi City on Monday after troops killed 42 remaining militants, including some foreign fighters. More than 1,100 people, including 165 troops and 45 civilians, died in the conflict. The government has said the rest were militants.

Senior officers said they took pains to protect the multitude of mosques in what is the only designated Islamic City in the mainly Catholic Philippines. Although many escaped the pounding of daily air strikes, domes and walls were peppered with holes from heavy machine gun fire as troops sought to flush out rebels hiding within.

Earlier on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis praised Filipino soldiers for defeating the militants without attracting allegations of human rights violations.

The United States provided critical tactical intelligence in the Marawi combat operation, deploying surveillance planes and drones, thermal imaging and eavesdropping equipment.

The walls were blasted away at Marawi’s police headquarters where the armoury was looted, and in the adjacent jail where more than 100 prisoners were freed.

Close by, a mosque minaret had fallen into a mash of metal and rock. Behind it was a lone, leafless tree with only a few branches left.

The militants smashed through thick layers of concrete to turn drainage channels into trenches, doubling as tunnels for fighters to move between buildings and elude surveillance drones and army snipers.

Rebel-held buildings were covered with graffiti, including one of an arrow through a heart, with the message “I love ISIS”, an acronym for Islamic State.

But there was no love for the rebel alliance among the hundreds of jubilant soldiers at send-off ceremonies held this week as troops gradually return home.

Colonel Corleto Vinluan, the commander of joint special operations, described the enemy as “rats”.

He said the military had gained valuable experience in urban combat and chose a strategy that took time, but ultimately paid off.

“We couldn’t just enter the area, it was very big, we did not know where the leaders were, we had to surround them and the area became smaller. It was that time when we really took control,” Vinluan told Reuters.

”We didn’t expect they’ll last that long, their ammunition their firearms and their food. We learned a lot from this event, we adjusted our strategies.

“They were tough fighters, some of them, but not all.”","Troops and strays, the only signs of life in ruined Marawi",https://in.reuters.com/article/philippines-militants/troops-and-strays-the-only-signs-of-life-in-ruined-marawi-idINKBN1CU1WE

Airlines contacted by Reuters said the new measures could include short security interviews with passengers at check-in or the boarding gate, sparking concerns over flight delays and extended processing time.

They will affect 325,000 airline passengers on about 2,100 commercial flights arriving daily in the United States, on 180 airlines from 280 airports in 105 countries.

U.S. Transportation Security Administration officials are giving some airlines or airports additional time to comply with the new interviews as long the U.S. government has approved security plans by Thursday.

“TSA will continue to work closely with our aviation partners and verify that all security enhancements are accurately implemented,” TSA spokeswoman Lucy Martinez said in a statement Wednesday.

The United States announced the new rules in June to end its restrictions on carry-on electronic devices on planes coming from 10 airports in eight countries in the Middle East and North Africa in response to concerns that explosives could be hidden in electronic devices.

Those restrictions were lifted in July, but the Trump administration said it could reimpose measures on a case by case basis if airlines and airports did not boost security.

European and U.S. officials said at the time that airlines had 120 days to comply with the measures, including increased passenger screening. The 120-day deadline is Thursday. Airlines had until late July to expand explosive trace detection testing.

“We see this as a big issue for China Airlines,” Steve Chang, senior vice president of the Taiwanese firm told reporters on Wednesday, adding the airline was trying to consult with the American Institute in the country over the issue.

Korean Airlines, South Korea’s flagship carrier, also said it had a lot of concerns with the new measures.

“We are asking customers to show up at the airport early ... It’s just inconvenient for the passengers,” President and Chief Operating Officer Walter Cho told Reuters in Taipei.

Lufthansa Group said on Tuesday the measures would be in place by Thursday and travelers could face short interviews at check-in or at the gate.

Economy passengers on Lufthansa’s Swiss airline have been asked to check in at least 90 minutes before departure.

Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said it would suspend in-town check-in and self bag-drop services for passengers booked on direct flights to the United States. The airline said passengers would also have short security interviews and it has advised travelers to arrive three hours before departure.

Singapore Airlines Ltd said the security checks could include inspections of personal electronic devices as well as security questioning during check-in and boarding.

Airlines for America, a U.S. trade group, said the changes “are complex security measures” but praised U.S. officials for giving airlines flexibility in meeting the new rules.

Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said the industry understood security threats to aviation were made regularly but in this case the U.S. government had not shared any specific dangers before changing the rules.

“What we have seen is very strange,” he told reporters in Taipei. “Unilateral measures announced without any prior consultation... That is something that is very concerning and disturbing.”

At their annual meeting in Taipei, Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) members passed a resolution calling for security measures to be risk-based, outcome-focused and proportionate to the probable threat.

“Unilateral actions taken by individual governments reacting to emerging threats may result in unnecessary disruption or lead to unintended safety consequences,” said the members.

AAPA includes most large Asian airlines but not mainland Chinese carriers.

“The risk is other countries make similar demands,” AAPA Director General Andrew Herdman said.

U.S. authorities in June also ordered increased security around aircraft and in passenger areas, and other places where travelers can be cleared by U.S. officials before they depart and ordered enhanced screening of personal electronic devices. Some of those new requirements take effect this week as well.

Flake had accused Trump of “reckless, outrageous and undignified” behavior and said his “instinct to scapegoat and belittle threatens to turn us into a fearful, backward-looking people.”

His condemnation in a speech on the Senate floor came just hours after Senator Bob Corker, another Republican, lashed out at Trump as “an utterly untruthful president” who was debasing the United States.

Flake, who is not seeking re-election in Arizona next year, said on Wednesday he thinks other Republican lawmakers will join him in standing up to Trump.

“Privately a number of my colleagues have expressed concern about the direction of our politics and the behavior of the president,” Flake told CNN. “There comes a tipping point where you realize we just can’t continue to normalize this kind of behavior so I do think we’ll have more people stand up in the coming months.”

Trump responded by saying Flake’s feud with him probably would have cost him with voters and that he would have lost if he had sought re-election.

“He was against me before he ever knew me,” Trump told reporters on Wednesday. “He would have never won. He did the smart thing for himself. This way he can get out somewhat gracefully.”

Despite control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives, Republicans have yet to deliver any major legislative victories this year on priorities such as tax reform, healthcare and immigration.

Republican Senator John McCain, who is fighting brain cancer, also has spoken out sharply against Trump.

But most Republicans in Congress have either remained silent or tried to play down divisions inside their party as Trump has attacked lawmakers, the media and others he sees as opposing or trying to undermine his presidency.

“I think people should settle their differences personally,” Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. “I think it’s better that way. I think it’s in our interest to have party unity so that we can continue to work forward on an agenda.”

So far, the fierce criticism from Flake and Corker has drawn more praise from Democrats than from fellow Republicans.

Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer -

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

Zverev’s stunning year, during which he briefly rose to number four in the rankings, means the 20-year-old has qualified for both season-enders, and something had to give.

“I have consulted with my team and in order to best prepare for London, we have made the decision that it is best not to play the week before in Milan,” Zverev told the ATP’s website.

“Therefore, sadly, I will be withdrawing from the Next Gen ATP Finals. However, I still plan on making an appearance at the beginning of the event to support the tournament and show my appreciation for my fans in Italy that were so supportive during my win in Rome earlier this year.”

Zverev’s withdrawal is a blow for the new event, although the back-to-back schedule would have made it extremely tough for the German to have competed at both.

He has won five titles this year and is the youngest player to qualify for the ATP World Tour Finals for 10 years.

The Next Gen Finals were launched this year to showcase the top players aged 21 and under.

It will feature shortened sets, shot clocks and no advantage scoring as the ATP tries out new innovations to appeal to a younger generation of tennis fans.

The line-up will be Russians Andrey Rublev, Karen Khachanov and Daniil Medvedev, Canadian Denis Shapovalov, American Jared Donaldson, Croatian Borna Coric and South Korea’s Hyeon Chung plus the winner of an Italian under-21 event as a wildcard.

“Il y a une volonté de mettre le CETA sous surveillance et de vérifier si on peut se doter d‘instruments qui vont lui permettre (...) d‘effacer les effets induits par ce traité”, a dit aux journalistes le ministre de l‘Ecologie, Nicolas Hulot.

La France veut notamment la mise en place d‘une “sorte de veto climatique” qui empêcherait tout investisseur d‘attaquer, notamment dans le cadre des tribunaux d‘arbitrage, des engagements climatiques - une demande des ONG, a-t-il ajouté.

Le plan vise à rassurer les opposants et à s‘assurer du soutien des députés, qui seront appelés à ratifier le texte à “l‘horizon du deuxième semestre 2018”.

L‘inquiétude s‘est propagée la semaine dernière dans les rangs de la majorité présidentielle, dont dix-huit membres de La République en marche (LREM) ont adressé au Premier ministre Édouard Philippe des propositions d‘encadrement du traité.

“Il y a eu un dialogue, notamment avec ce groupe de parlementaires et beaucoup de leurs préconisations ont été mises dans ce plan”, a dit Nicolas Hulot. D‘ici à la ratification, “les parlementaires auront tous les éléments pour apprécier l‘efficacité ou pas de ce plan et ils ont tireront les conséquences”.

APPEL À LA COMMISSION

Entré provisoirement en vigueur le 21 septembre, le CETA, fruit d‘une négociations de huit ans entre les deux parties, doit être approuvé par les parlements nationaux européens pour être définitivement mis en oeuvre.

Le texte lève près de 99% des droits de douane entre l‘UE et le Canada et doit permettre aux entreprises canadiennes et européennes de participer aux marchés publics de l‘autre partie, et d‘accroître les échanges et les investissements.

Ses détracteurs - ONG, écologistes, agriculteurs, et une partie de la classe politique - estiment qu‘il met en danger la pérennité des normes sociales et environnementales européennes et s‘inquiètent du futur mécanisme d‘arbitrage chargé de trancher les litiges entre entreprises et Etats.

La commission d‘experts indépendants, mise en place en France pour répondre à ces craintes, a pointé en septembre un “manque d‘ambition”, notamment en matière environnementale.

Au-delà du “veto climatique”, la France souhaite l‘adoption de mesures, d‘ici 2019, aux niveaux national et européen, réduisant l‘empreinte carbone des carburants consommés au sein de l‘Union européenne. Un rapport en ce sens sera présenté au parlement français d‘ici fin 2018.

La France assure par ailleurs qu‘elle soutiendra le Parlement européen dans sa demande à la Commission d‘étudier la mise en place d‘un mécanisme aux frontières prenant en compte la production de carbone dans les biens échangés.

Rund drei Viertel der Passagiere der insolventen Rivalin will die Kranich-Linie künftig befördern. Die Übernahme von mehr als der Hälfte der Air-Berlin-Flotte solle im kommenden Jahr den Umsatz um 1,5 Milliarden Euro ankurbeln und ab 2019 für noch mehr Gewinn sorgen, sagte Lufthansa-Finanzchef Ulrik Svensson am Mittwoch. Zusätzlichen Auftrieb geben die Einigung mit den Piloten im langjährigen Tarifstreit und sinkende Kosten. “Wir erwarten ein sehr starkes Jahr für die Lufthansa-Gruppe”, sagte Vorstandschef Carsten Spohr.

Eine konkrete Gewinnprognose gab er nicht ab. Aber schon vor einiger Zeit hatte Spohr für 2017 eine neue Bestmarke angedeutet. Im vergangenen Jahr flog die größte deutsche Airline einen Rekord-Gewinn vor Zinsen und Steuern von 1,75 Milliarden Euro ein. Dieses Jahr könnten es nach Einschätzung von Analysten 2,6 Milliarden Euro werden.[nL8N1MZ572] Die Aktionäre sollen daran nach offiziellem Bekunden ordentlich beteiligt werden. Die Aussicht auf eine höhere Dividende verhalf der Lufthansa-Aktie zum höchsten Stand seit mehr als 17 Jahren. Mit einem Plus von mehr als zwei Prozent stieg sie im Tagesverlauf zum größten Dax-Gewinner auf, nachdem es anfänglich noch Gewinnmitnahmen gegeben hatte.

Im dritten Quartal legte das Ergebnis vor Zinsen und Steuern um rund ein Drittel auf 1,52 Milliarden Euro zu. Mit diesem Gewinnplus im Rücken sieht Spohr die Lufthansa gut gerüstet für die anstehenden Investitionen. Allein in diesem Jahr sollen es 2,7 Milliarden Euro sein. In den Ausbau der Billig-Tochter Eurowings will Spohr 1,5 Milliarden Euro stecken, zwei Drittel davon in den Kauf von Flugzeugen. Eurowings übernimmt 81 der gut 130 Air-Berlin-Maschinen und will 3000 neue Stellen schaffen. Hier leiste der Konzern seinen Beitrag für nachhaltige Arbeitsplätze und werde sich deshalb nicht an der geplanten Auffanglösung für Air-Berlin-Beschäftigte ohne Jobperspektive beteiligen, bekräftigte Spohr. Die Transfergesellschaft wird wohl vor allem von Air Berlin und dem Land Berlin finanziert.[nL8N1MZ5KV]

Bei der Marktbereinigung in Europa will Spohr weiter aktiv mitmischen. So hat die Lufthansa auch Interesse an Teilen der ebenfalls insolventen Traditionsfluglinie Alitalia bekundet.

CREWS UMSCHULEN, FLUGZEUGE LACKIEREN

Mit Air Berlin war sich die Lufthansa Mitte Oktober einig geworden. Für die Töchter Niki und LGW will der Konzern 210 Millionen Euro zahlen. Spohr rechnet Anfang 2018 mit grünem Licht der EU-Behörden. Finanzchef Svensson erwartet für 2018 Projektkosten durch den Deal von rund 50 Millionen Euro, da etwa Crews geschult und Flugzeuge umlackiert werden. Bei Air Berlin soll Ende dieser Woche das Licht ausgehen und der Flugbetrieb in eigener Regie eingestellt werden. Die Pleite-Airline verhandelt derzeit noch mit dem Billigflieger Easyjet über die Übernahme von rund 25 Maschinen. Die Gespräche mit den Briten waren zuletzt ins Stocken geraten.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

Metronome is a bitcoin-like token that upon its launch in early December can be used immediately for a slew of applications such as payments and transfers.
Upon the launch in December, an initial supply of 10 million MTN tokens will be issued, with 8 million MTN tokens sold to the public in a descending price auction for Ethereum’s ether currency.

Blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions that has underpinned bitcoin, the original digital currency.

Metronome is a bitcoin-like token that upon its launch in early December can be used immediately for a slew of applications such as payments and transfers. It can also run on different blockchains, unlike other tokens, the company said.

“This is a foundational crypto-currency, a foundational payment layer,” Matthew Roszak, co-founder and chairman of Bloq, said in an interview with Reuters.

”How is it different from bitcoin or ethereum? It is this cross-chain, or multi-chain, ability, to move from one railroad to another. That’s a really big innovation and invention of Metronome.

Upon the launch in December, an initial supply of 10 million MTN tokens will be issued, with 8 million MTN tokens sold to the public in a descending price auction for Ethereum’s ether currency. The idea for the auction is to manage supply, Roszak said.

Ethereum is another blockchain similar to that of bitcoin,

Bloq will keep 2 million of the tokens. Roszak said the company will not receive the proceeds of the MTN sale. They will remain within the Metronome smart contract system to provide liquidity to the token’s marketplace.

“When you buy a Metronome token, you are funding a savings contract that will provide liquidity and price support for the Metronome token economy. That’s a big difference,” Roszak said.

The Bloq executive also pointed out that unlike other token offerings, there would be no pre-sale of the tokens to institutional investors prior to the December offering.

“It’s going to be a fair auction. Nobody has an advantage before the launch,” Roszak said.

According to financial data and research firm Pitchbook, Bloq raised an undisclosed amount of money from SixThirty, a business development accelerator and venture fund, in September 2016.

Iraqi engineers arrived to the sound of alarm bells warning about system malfunctions, prompting them to immediately shut down wells. Now, they need passwords and expertise from their Kurdish counterparts to restore oil output fully.

The loss of control of Kirkuk oil fields is likely to starve the KRG of vital oil revenue and cause deep concern to global trading houses such as Vitol and Glencore, which have granted the semi-autonomous government billions of dollars in loans against future oil sales.

Baghdad’s lightning military offensive into northern Iraq came after the Kurdistan Regional Government held an independence referendum last month.

Major-General Soleimani, one of the most influential military figures in the Middle East, with reach in Syria and Lebanon, issued tough warnings to Kurdish leaders ahead of the Iraqi military advance.

“We went inside the oilfield facilities after Kurdish workers fled and we found overalls and safety boots thrown on the ground,” said an engineer from the Baghdad-run North Oil Company, who declined to be named because he was ordered not to speak publicly about the issue.

“It seems that workers took them off and escaped very quickly.”

RINGING ALARMS

NOC crews entered oil facilities in the Bai Hassan and Avana fields on Oct. 17 for the first time since 2014, when Peshmerga forces drove Islamic State from the area and found all crude oil stations unmanned. Peshmerga fighters had also withdrawn.

“After we discovered that some of the key equipment was missing and the control panel was ringing alarms of crude processing malfunction, we immediately shut down oil wells,” the NOC engineer said.

A week after the operation, Iraqi engineers are still struggling to resume Kirkuk’s oil production, saying they had yet to understand how to operate the equipment processing some 350,000 barrels per day.

The military offensive more than halved Kurdistan’s oil output and cut its exports to global markets via Turkey by two thirds.

The drop in exports has deprived the region of more than $200 million in revenues over the past week, a Kurdish oil industry source familiar with loadings told Reuters.

It has also dealt a further blow to the region’s finances already stretched by a fight against Islamic State and a budget crisis caused by a fall in oil prices. The United States has called on both sides to resume dialogue, saying the tensions hamper efforts to fight Islamic State.

Resuming normal oil production and exports will be challenging and will take at least another week and will only succeed if Iraqi and Kurdish engineers agree to cooperate, according to both sides.

On Tuesday, NOC officials asked Kurdish engineering firm Kar Group to send back its workers, according to sources on both sides. Iraqi engineers need guidance on how to operate recently installed equipment at Bai Hassan and Avana, the sources said.

The pumping and operational stations for both oil fields are located in the city of Dahuk, which unlike Kirkuk is still under the control of the Peshmerga forces.

LIKE A LOCKED BOX

“Energy facilities in Kirkuk are more like a locked box and only their crew have the password,” the Iraqi engineer said.

Kar Group has, however, so far refrained from going back without security guarantees, according to sources close to the engineering company.

Kirkuk, one of the oldest and best known oil areas in the Middle East, had long been under the control of Iraqi forces until it was over-run by Islamic State. In 2014, it was retaken by the Peshmerga, the official security forces of the KRG, as part of their advance on Islamic State.

That allowed Kurdistan to regain control of an area it believes is historically Kurdish and ramp up exports from the oil fields while borrowing billions of dollars from trading houses and Russian state oil major Rosneft.

“We need to figure out who gets what when the fields resume production. At the moment the potential split of revenues is far from clear,” said the Kurdish oil industry source.

Before the referendum, Kurdistan was exporting some 600,000 bpd of crude via Turkey, which it said had made it almost totally economically independent as it could pay its own bills without the need to wait for budget transfers from Baghdad.

Under the deal with Baghdad, Kurdistan was exporting 540,000 bpd on behalf of the government in the city of Erbil and some 60,000 bpd on behalf of NOC.

With the loss of control of the Kirkuk area, Kurdistan will be in theory left with only 250,000-300,000 bpd of its own output, less than it needs to cover its debt obligations.

Vitol, Glencore, Petraco and Trafigura have loaned Kurdistan some $2.5 billion and Russia’s Rosneft has loaned some $1.2 billion. Glencore’s boss Ivan Glasenberg said last week he could not rule out a rescheduling of the payments.",Fear of Iranian general left Iraqi Kurdish oil fields deserted,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CU2CM-OCATP

Buildings in the City of London are seen behind Waterloo Bridge in London, Britain October 20, 2017. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls

While falling short of the strong growth rates enjoyed by euro zone countries earlier this year, British economic growth picked up to 0.4 percent in the July-September period from 0.3 percent in the second quarter, official data showed on Wednesday.

Sterling climbed almost a full percentage point against the U.S. dollar on the figures, which beat the average forecast for growth of 0.3 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.

British five-year government bond yields also rose to their highest since last year’s vote to leave the European Union as markets anticipated a quicker pace of BoE rate rises next year.

Britain performed much better than most economists expected immediately after last year’s vote to leave the European Union, and it was one of the fastest-growing major advanced economies in 2016.

But it slipped to the bottom of the pack earlier this year, posting its worst first-half performance since 2012, largely due to higher inflation caused by the pound’s fall after the Brexit vote, at a time when its peers have enjoyed robust growth,

While Wednesday’s figures are a small boost for under-pressure finance minister Philip Hammond ahead of his November budget, they do not alter the broad picture of an economy dogged by poor productivity and squeezed living standards.

“Despite the weak outlook, the Bank of England will now almost certainly raise the Bank Rate by 25 basis points ... on 2nd November,” said Daniel Vernazza, chief UK economist at UniCredit.

A Reuters poll published on Tuesday showed the BoE is widely expected to raise rates to 0.50 percent from 0.25 percent on Nov. 2, due to concerns that the economy cannot grow as fast as it used to without generating excess inflation. [BOE/INT]

Financial markets nudged up the chance of a move to nearly 90 percent from just over 80 percent before the data.

Last month the BoE said Wednesday’s preliminary data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) was likely to show 0.3 percent growth, though it might be stronger due to improving consumer demand.

In the past, Britain’s economy typically grew by 0.5-0.6 percent a quarter but the BoE and other economists have indicated that the sustainable growth rate may have fallen.

FOCUS ON PRODUCTIVITY

Hammond told broadcasters the growth figures were “solid” and proof of the fundamental strength of an economy that since the referendum had often made forecasters look too pessimistic.

In a separate statement, he said he was focused on boosting productivity - arguably Britain’s biggest economic problem - in order to create more higher-wage jobs.

Next month’s budget would consider ways to support high-growth firms short of finance, the housing sector and consumers, but the economic situation placed limits on what could be done, Hammond added.

Britain’s budget watchdog has said it expects to chop its forecasts for productivity growth in coming years, suggesting the economy will have less room to grow without generating inflation - a diagnosis shared by BoE Governor Mark Carney.

In the short-term, a further argument in favor of higher rates might come from solid bank lending figures from industry association UK Finance.

Nonetheless, most economists polled by Reuters think it would be a mistake for the BoE to hike interest rates now, in part because of the economic uncertainty generated by the Brexit process.

The ONS data showed the vast services industry was behind the bulk of Britain’s economic expansion in the third quarter, but manufacturing also contributed, helped by a rebound in car production.

In year-on-year terms, third-quarter growth was unchanged at 1.5 percent, also slightly stronger than analysts had expected.

Britain’s dominant services maintained its momentum from the previous quarter, the ONS said, while industrial output expanded at its fastest rate in more than a year.

Construction continued to struggle, however, contracting by 0.7 percent on the quarter - its sharpest fall since the third quarter of 2012.

“We would urge the (BoE) to proceed with caution on raising rates, as tightening monetary policy amid the current economic and political uncertainty could weaken growth,” said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce.

A Central Bank investigation that began in 2015 found that 20,000 borrowers were likely to have been affected and that they should have been given the option of a cheaper mortgage.

The scandal has risen to the top of the political agenda after a number of customers gave evidence in parliament of the problems it caused them.

The government had already threatened to penalise the banks last week. Paschal Donohoe said these actions could include an increase in its annual bank levy, amending tax law, introducing stricter reporting or shareholder activist actions if insufficient progress on compensating customers was made by an initial deadline of mid-December.

“I hope not to have to pursue these options but if the central bank cannot indicate that the issues are resolved, these are actions that I will take,” Donohoe told a news conference, adding that further work was needed by the banks to see if more customers were affected.

Donohoe also mandated the country’s central bank to prepare a report on current bank culture and behaviour. The Central Bank said it shared the government’s view that “significant and deep-rooted cultural issues” still existed in some banks.

Donohoe said he would not consider amending laws limiting pay in the sector until the issue was dealt with. These were introduced during a banking crisis a decade ago that required the largest state rescue in the euro zone.

The five main retail banks - majority state-owned Allied Irish Banks (ALBK.I) and permanent tsb (IL0A.I), part state-owned Bank of Ireland (BIRG.I) and KBC Bank Ireland (KBC.BR) and RBS’ Ulster Bank (RBS.L), laid out varying timetables on Wednesday detailing compensation plans at the behest of the government.

The central bank investigation has identified customers who should have been given the option of a cheaper “tracker” mortgage or kept on a better rate years ago. It ordered lenders to repay the difference and offer compensation.

Another 7,000 tracker mortgage customers received redress and compensation separately before the central bank stepped in and widened the probe throughout the sector.

Tracker mortgages, which follow the European Central Bank rate, were sold in Ireland prior to the financial crisis and have proven significantly cheaper than variable or fixed rate mortgages as ECB rates have long been at record lows.

Airlines contacted by Reuters said the new measures could include short security interviews with passengers at check-in or the boarding gate, sparking concerns over flight delays and extended processing time.

They will affect 325,000 airline passengers on about 2,100 commercial flights arriving daily in the United States, on 180 airlines from 280 airports in 105 countries.

U.S. Transportation Security Administration officials are giving some airlines or airports additional time to comply with the new interviews as long the U.S. government has approved security plans by Thursday.

“TSA will continue to work closely with our aviation partners and verify that all security enhancements are accurately implemented,” TSA spokeswoman Lucy Martinez said in a statement Wednesday.

The United States announced the new rules in June to end its restrictions on carry-on electronic devices on planes coming from 10 airports in eight countries in the Middle East and North Africa in response to concerns that explosives could be hidden in electronic devices.

Those restrictions were lifted in July, but the Trump administration said it could reimpose measures on a case by case basis if airlines and airports did not boost security.

European and U.S. officials said at the time that airlines had 120 days to comply with the measures, including increased passenger screening. The 120-day deadline is Thursday. Airlines had until late July to expand explosive trace detection testing.

“We see this as a big issue for China Airlines,” Steve Chang, senior vice president of the Taiwanese firm told reporters on Wednesday, adding the airline was trying to consult with the American Institute in the country over the issue.

Korean Airlines, South Korea’s flagship carrier, also said it had a lot of concerns with the new measures.

“We are asking customers to show up at the airport early ... It’s just inconvenient for the passengers,” President and Chief Operating Officer Walter Cho told Reuters in Taipei.

Lufthansa Group said on Tuesday the measures would be in place by Thursday and travelers could face short interviews at check-in or at the gate.

Economy passengers on Lufthansa’s Swiss airline have been asked to check in at least 90 minutes before departure.

Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said it would suspend in-town check-in and self bag-drop services for passengers booked on direct flights to the United States. The airline said passengers would also have short security interviews and it has advised travelers to arrive three hours before departure.

Singapore Airlines Ltd said the security checks could include inspections of personal electronic devices as well as security questioning during check-in and boarding.

Airlines for America, a U.S. trade group, said the changes “are complex security measures” but praised U.S. officials for giving airlines flexibility in meeting the new rules.

Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said the industry understood security threats to aviation were made regularly but in this case the U.S. government had not shared any specific dangers before changing the rules.

“What we have seen is very strange,” he told reporters in Taipei. “Unilateral measures announced without any prior consultation... That is something that is very concerning and disturbing.”

At their annual meeting in Taipei, Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) members passed a resolution calling for security measures to be risk-based, outcome-focused and proportionate to the probable threat.

“Unilateral actions taken by individual governments reacting to emerging threats may result in unnecessary disruption or lead to unintended safety consequences,” said the members.

AAPA includes most large Asian airlines but not mainland Chinese carriers.

“The risk is other countries make similar demands,” AAPA Director General Andrew Herdman said.

U.S. authorities in June also ordered increased security around aircraft and in passenger areas, and other places where travelers can be cleared by U.S. officials before they depart and ordered enhanced screening of personal electronic devices. Some of those new requirements take effect this week as well.

The TSA said in July it was imposing new security rules requiring U.S. domestic airline travelers to remove all electronic items larger than mobile phones such as tablets, e-readers and video game consoles from carry-on baggage for screening.",Airlines get ready for new U.S. security rules from Thursday,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-airlines-security/airlines-get-ready-for-new-u-s-security-rules-from-thursday-idINKBN1CU2YI?il=0

Relations between uneasy allies United States and Pakistan have frayed in recent years, with Washington accusing Islamabad of turning a blind eye or helping Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network militants who stage attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan denies doing so.

President Donald Trump has vowed to get tough with Pakistan unless it changed its behaviour, with U.S. officials threatening further reductions in aid and mooting targeted sanctions against Pakistani officials.

Tillerson, on a tour of Asia and the Middle East, arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday afternoon and met with Abbasi, as well as Pakistan’s powerful army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa.

“We are committed in the war against terror,” Abbasi told Tillerson, as the two men sat facing each other on a long table.

“We have produced results. And we are looking forward to moving ahead with the U.S. and building a tremendous relationship,” added Abbasi, who sat next to Bajwa.

During a short part of the meeting available to media, Tillerson told the Pakistani delegation that the nuclear-armed nation was an important U.S. ally in the region.

“(Pakistan is) important regionally to our joint goals of providing peace and security to the region and providing opportunity for greater economic relationship as well,” Tillerson said.

U.S officials say they are frustrated that Afghan Taliban and Haqqani militants are afforded freedom of movement and are able to transport weapons and raise funds inside Pakistan, something their Islamabad counterparts staunchly deny.

On Monday, during a visit to Kabul, Tillerson urged Pakistan to act against safe havens on its soil.

“Pakistan needs to, I think, take a clear-eyed view of the situation that they are confronted with in terms of the number of terrorist organisations that find safe haven inside of Pakistan.”

“RED LINE”

Pakistani officials bristle at the idea that the country is not doing enough against militants and say Pakistan has suffered more than 60,000 casualties in the war on terror since the Sept. 11 attacks in United States in 2001.

In recent years Pakistan has made substantial gains against militants and the number of attacks have drastically reduced, but some militant groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and the Islamic State continue to pose a threat and have periodically staged large-scale attacks.

Pakistan recently started to fence its long and porous 2,500-km border with Afghanistan in an attempt to stop militants criss-crossing the frontier.

As well as support for the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network, another sticking point in the relationship has been growing closeness by the United States to India, Pakistan’s arch-foe and neighbour.

Tillerson said last week that the Trump administration wanted to “dramatically deepen” cooperation with New Delhi, partly to offset Chinese influence in Asia. Trump has also called for greater Indian role in Afghanistan.

But this deepening in ties has alarmed Pakistan, which has rejected a greater political role for India for Afghanistan as a “red line” for Islamabad.

A growing number of people identifying themselves as indigenous, a higher fertility rate among indigenous people than non-indigenous, and a higher life expectancy for indigenous people than in the past explain the rate of change, Statistics Canada said.

Canada’s indigenous population grew 42.5 percent in the ten years to 2016 to 1.7 million people, compared to 11 percent growth for Canada as a whole, Statistics Canada found, in data released from a 2016 census.

The findings show a young population, with an average age of 32.1 years, compared with 40.9 for the non-aboriginal population.

The census also found a younger generation significantly more likely to be raised in foster care. Indigenous children made up 7.7 percent of all Canadians under 5 but more than half of the children in foster homes, according to the data release.

It also found that one fifth of the indigenous population lives in over-crowded housing, and 44 percent of indigenous people on reserves were living in homes that needed major repairs.

Canada’s indigenous people come from hundreds of nations and bands, with more than 70 distinct languages. They include First Nations, Métis, people of mixed indigenous and European background, and Inuit, who largely inhabit Canada’s north.

Population growth between 2006 and 2016 was highest for Métis, at 51.2 percent.

Last month, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada had failed its indigenous people. In a speech to the U.N.

Brent crude edged up after top exporter Saudi Arabia reiterated its determination to end a three-year supply glut.

The deep draw in gasoline inventories came even as refining output rose, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This suggested demand remained strong after the peak U.S. driving season.

Crude inventories rose by 856,000 barrels in the week to Oct. 20, the EIA said. Analysts had expected a decrease of 2.6 million barrels. Production rebounded from a falloff due to Hurricane Nate, and imports rose.

Brent crude futures settled up 11 cents at $58.44 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 29 cents to $52.18.

The EIA data showed gasoline and distillate inventories both fell by more than 5 million barrels, and refinery utilization rates rose 3.3 percentage points.

RBOB futures rose 1.1 percent to $1.7341 a gallon. Heating oil futures got a brief boost but settled slightly lower.

“Demand has been a little stronger than some people might have anticipated as we pushed out of the driving season, and that’s where today’s strength is coming from,” said Gene McGillian, manager of research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn.

On Tuesday, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih on Tuesday raised the prospect of prolonged output restraint even after the end of an OPEC-led pact to cut supplies.

Even as global inventory levels are falling, Brent has remained below $60 a barrel, partly on concern the crude glut may grow again after March 2018, when the output reduction deal is due to end.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers have cut oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). OPEC’s next meeting is on Nov. 7 in Vienna, Austria, when they will consider extending the deal.

While other producers cut output, U.S. production rebounded to 9.5 million bpd in the latest week. U.S. crude exports have averaged 1.7 million barrels a day over the past four weeks, the highest ever.

“Saudi Arabia’s determination to rebalance the market, together with ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, will remain supportive of oil prices,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.

“However, rising oil production in the U.S. and persistently high exports from the country will be the key bearish factors.”

Disruptions to exports from Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer, have supported oil.

There’s little doubt he can now bend the bureaucracy to his will, but that’s not necessarily a boon for market reform.

The inclusion of Xi’s name and “thought” into the party constitution marks a major shift. In the party’s hierarchical lexicon, it puts him on par with Mao. And without younger faces in the Politburo Standing Committee, the country’s highest political organ, he is likely to wield influence for years to come. To be sure, Xi didn’t throw out the rulebook: the Politburo age limit was respected. Wang Qishan, his 69-year old ally, stepped down. At the same time the new Standing Committee includes members identified with other factions. Even so, the president’s stature today is unambiguously more powerful than a week ago.

That is not a positive economic development. Xi has never been entirely coherent or consistent on reforms. His opening speech to the party congress contained the usual mixed messages, and if anything, he seems focused on protecting party control. References to the market and economy in his speech dropped by around 20 percent and 33 percent, respectively, compared to his predecessor’s speech in 2012, according to a tally by Capital Economics. Mentions of the party rose more than 40 percent.

There is also an elemental tension between Xi’s efforts to aggrandize political power and promote economic liberalization. Ministerial and local government officials terrified of the centre are less likely to resist bad policy ideas, take input from the private sector or experiment with their own initiatives. A more top-down system may become less responsive to market signals, and more sensitive to the whims of individuals in the upper echelons of power.

The tension was on display at the party congress, when Xi told a member of the Guizhou provincial delegation that a local brand of liquor was “not cheap” and implied it might sell better with a price cut. The delegate thanked the president for his instructions and said she would soon act on it. “That’s a question for the market,” Xi responded. “You can’t sell it for 30 yuan just because I said so.” It’s not clear what bureaucrats should make of that, but there’s likely to be more such mixed messaging to come.",Breakingviews - Xi's new stature can overawe China's market forces,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress-lineup-breakingviews/breakingviews-xis-new-stature-can-overawe-chinas-market-forces-idUSKBN1CU0QB

Europe remains a battleground between nationalist forces, conventional right or left governments and parties which cleave to broadly liberal positions. It is not alone. Across the world, the same impulses to define a state according to ethnic or historic criteria, or to put existing states “first,” grow in diverse forms.

Two referenda illuminate the trend. One, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq on Sept. 25, produced an almost 93 percent vote in favor of Kurdish independence, followed by an immediate demand from the Iraqi government to invalidate the vote and a threat to use the army to suppress any move to independence. On Sunday the citizens of the Catalonia region will vote on whether to secede from Spain – provided that the Spanish state, which has already arrested leaders of the referendum and confiscated voting materials, does not carry out threats to block all voting stations.

The tone in the democratic world is often set by the United States – no longer the champion of greater openness and cooperation, but now the promoter of America First. Work began earlier this week on prototypes for Donald Trump’s “beautiful” wall between Mexico and the United States; the president extended his travel ban to the citizens of three more states (Chad, North Korea and Venezuela) while dropping one, Somalia, from the list – this to align immigration “with his America First foreign policy vision.”

Europe, though, is the hub of nationalist struggles. In large part, this is because the nationalist politicians pit themselves against the continent’s large ambition to create a European Union which, in its enthusiasts’ view, should become a powerful, federal state through progressive integration – a perspective powerfully supported by the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker in his “state of the Union” address earlier this month.

Immigration has been and remains the spur for the nationalists. Its growing unpopularity fills out their sails and brings them votes from all over the political compass, including a significant proportion from working class voters accustomed to voting left, even far left.

In Germany’s general election last weekend, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) soared to become the third-largest party in the Bundestag (parliament) behind the governing CDU/CSU center-right coalition and the center-left SPD, largely on strong opposition to immigration. One of the AfD leaders, Alexander Gauland, called Chancellor Angela Merkel’s opening of the borders to some one million migrants “a gift” to his party, which it gratefully accepted and used more successfully than even the party thought possible. Some commentators believe the shock to the German system – built for decades on a moderate consensus opposed to right-wing extremism of any kind – will “condemn Europe to permanent crisis.”

In Sweden, which has taken proportionately more migrants than any other European country over the past two years, crime, including shootings and riotous behavior, seems to have increased. The extent of that has been distorted by the right, but a careful analysis in the National Review does conclude that Sweden has “a growing problem with crime that is linked to immigration.”

The phenomenon was enough for the Migration Minister from neighboring Norway, Sylvi Listhaug – a member of the nationalist Progress Party, part of the governing coalition - to make a media-trailed visit to a Swedish “no-go area,” claiming during the visit that there are ""conditions of lawlessness and criminals in control"" in places with ""a large quantity of people with immigrant backgrounds."" The subtext was that this would not be permitted to happen in Norway. Her Swedish counterpart cancelled a scheduled meeting with her, saying her statement was “complete nonsense.""

In Central Europe, the Visegrad Group of states – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – have rejected requests from fellow members of the European Union to take in a quota of migrants. Earlier this week in Prague, I asked the leader of the ANO party, Andrej Babis, strongly favored to be prime minister after the October general election, what his policy toward the EU would be. He answered that he would demand a return of powers from Brussels to the national level, since the EU had no business dictating national policy – a popular view in the country. He has already made clear that he is wholly opposed to migrants being received in Europe.

In her speech on Brexit in Florence last week, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that the British had “never felt entirely comfortable” in the EU. It’s probably a fair summation of a national mood; most British have always seen the EU as a transactional, rather than political, union. When a sizable part of the population came to believe that the EU is both incomprehensible and overbearing, Brexit resulted.

Across the English Channel, Emmanuel Macron has put himself at the head of a revived and fiercely proactive campaign to rouse the EU to continue its forward march. In a speech Tuesday, the French president proclaimed that “the only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic.” Integration – in defense, security and within the eurozone, had to be more profound, he said.

It was the vision in which one will not compromise with the nationalist forces – forces which will weaken Merkel, his strongest ally, as she tries to balance Germany’s contending forces rather than embrace his euro-optimism.

Brexit has had the headlines, and attracted the most derision from the EU enthusiasts. But nationalism – the wish to create, or to strengthen, the nation state against real or mythic enemies – remains a dominant current in the politics of the democratic countries. Battles have been won on both sides.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

The pilot program aims to speed up the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles into the national airspace system and test drone detection and tracking while waiving some limits on their use.

Under a memorandum signed by Trump on Wednesday, states and local governments would be able to seek Federal Aviation Administration approval for testing and expanded use. The White House stopped short of proposing new regulations that would allow broader nationwide use of drones or any timetable for new authority.

White House adviser Michael Kratsios told reporters the “program will open the skies for delivery of life-saving medicines and commercial packages, inspections of critical infrastructure, support for emergency management operations.”

Kratsios said the program would allow companies and governments to operate drones in ways that are currently restricted by the FAA “including beyond-visual-line-of-sight flights, nighttime operations, and flights over people.”

Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc are among a growing number of companies hoping to make package delivery by drones a reality.

The memo said the Transportation Department could allow drone flights at up to 400 feet with the goal of approving at least five pilot projects. The program would expire in three years.

In 2016, the Obama administration opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use, but left in place significant restrictions.

The FAA estimates by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and commercial drones will grow tenfold to about 442,000.

In June, Trump told drone executives the administration wants “to create new companies and lots of jobs... We’re going to give you the competitive advantage that you need.”

In attendance were chief executives of drone companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and Precision Hawk Inc.

Drone manufacturers have argued that the administration should move faster to approve broader commercial use of drones and noted that the Transportation Department does pre-approve self-driving vehicle technologies.

But security concerns remain.

In September, a civilian drone struck and damaged a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter near Staten Island, New York.

This month, a drone hit an airplane landing at a Quebec City airport, the first time an unmanned flying object collided with commercial aircraft in Canada.

The FAA has banned drone flights over 133 U.S. military facilities and over 10 U.S. landmarks, including the Statue of Liberty in New York and Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota, at the request of national security and law enforcement agencies.

The memo said that the Transportation Department would coordinate with the Defense Department, Homeland Security and Justice Department to consider public safety and national security risks in approving pilot projects.

The Commercial Drone Alliance said it was “optimistic that the program will become a model for overcoming some of the hurdles keeping the full potential of commercial drones from being realized.”

ATEC say the process has attracted US$ 1 million investment to fund further expansion in Cambodia and elsewhere - giving farmers energy security and saving them money - while cutting the health risks of cooking indoors on a wooden fire. SOUNDBITE (Khmer) FARMER SOK SOPHEAP SAYING: ""The biodigester gas doesn't give off smoke and saves a lot of my time compared with using wood. Using wood I had to stay in the kitchen putting wood on the fire until the food is cooked and to avoid overcooking it but with biodigester gas I am not worried about overcooking the rice or food. It also give a lot of other benefits, especially the organic fertilizer which I take from the tank and mix with other dry leaves and lay in my rice field."" While most biodigesters are vulnerable to flooding, ATEC says their system is suitable for earthquake and flood-prone areas, can be compacted for global transportation, and is easily assembled on site. They estimate each installation cuts 75 tonnes of greenhouse gases in its 25 lifetime - saving at least US$6,000 in fuel and produce nearly 500 tonnes of fertiliser.",Domestic biodigester designed for flood prone countries,https://www.reuters.com/video/2017/10/24/domestic-biodigester-designed-for-flood?videoId=372805466&videoChannel=118065&channelName=Moments+of+Innovation

Benchmark U.S. 10-year note US10YT=RR yields hit a seven-month high of 2.475 percent, buoyed by economic data, recent optimism over progress on tax reform by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and anticipation of a nominee to head the Federal Reserve.

Equities pared losses as yields retreated, following a Fox Business interview with Trump in which he said he was still considering keeping current Fed Chair Janet Yellen in the position. The 10-year last fell 9/32 in price to yield 2.4371 percent.

“It is possible the market may be taking some solace that Yellen is still in the mix,” said Mike Beale, senior managing director at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.

“The market may be saying, maybe one of the more hawkish, (John) Taylor or (Kevin) Warsh, is off the table.”

Low interest rates have been a driving factor in the 8-year bull market, with investors pushed into equities as other lesser-yielding instruments are viewed as unattractive by comparison.

Earnings season so far has been largely positive, with 72.1 percent of the 165 S&P 500 companies that have reported to date topping expectations, matching the average for the past four quarters.

However, with U.S. indexes at record levels, investors have scrutinized earnings to see if they justify stretched valuations.

Also weighing on sentiment: President Trump and the U.S. House of Representatives’ top tax law writer reopened the door on Wednesday to changes in the 401(k) retirement savings program, just days after Trump seemed to rule out such a step. The debate could present another hurdle to a tax reform deal.

Three large regional banks - Dallas-based Comerica Inc (CMA.N), Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N), and Cleveland-based KeyCorp (KEY.N) - together earned $2.93 billion in net interest income in the July-September period, an increase of 15 percent from a year earlier.

Wall Street analysts had reckoned that these banks would earn $2.95 billion among them, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Third-quarter net interest margins, the difference between interest paid and earned, and a key indicator of profitability, increased by 6 basis points on average across most banks, from the second quarter, according to Instinet.

Net interest margins have benefited from the three interest rate increases since the second quarter of last year.

The Fed is expected to raise rates again in December. The odds of a December move stand at 96.7 percent, compared with 87.8 percent a week ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.

If there is no rate hike in December, it will have “some negative impact” on margin outlook for 2018, D.A. Davidson analyst Gary Tenner said.

But higher interest rates cut both ways: boosting profits even as they push up borrowing costs, capping loan growth.

KeyCorp on Thursday cut its fourth-quarter loan-growth forecast to the lower-end of its previously given range of $87 billion to $88 billion range. PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) said on Oct 13 it expects modest loan growth in the current quarter, compared with the third quarter when it reported a 1 percent growth.

“Banks have been operating in a slow growth/low interest rate environment for a long time and have spent time bringing down expenses. Control what you can control has been the message,” Stephens analyst Terry McEvoy said.

“I think that will continue to be the case if we don’t get more rate hikes.”

SunTrust said on Friday that third-quarter non-interest expenses, which include most operating and overhead costs, declined 1.3 percent to $1.39 billion. Comerica’s non-interest expense fell 6.1 percent in the same period, the company said on Oct 17.

Several of the regional banks raised provisions for loan losses mainly to deal with possible bad loans coming after hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

Pittsburg-based PNC saw a $32 million rise in provisions, out of which $10 million were related to hurricanes. SunTrust, which has more than 400 branches in Florida, reported a $23 million rise in provisions.

The bank, whose fixed-income trading revenue slumped last quarter, has signed a multi-year deal to use Mosaic Smart Data’s technology division globally, the companies said in a joint statement released on Sunday.

The London-based start-up has developed technology that aggregates and analyzes vast amounts of data from the fixed-income trading division of investment banks to help them make more informed decisions and gain a competitive edge.

That includes helping traders decide which clients to focus on in a given day or enabling management to assess which trader, or trading desk has been performing better.

The partnership underscores the growing demand by banks for technology that can help them gain greater insight from the large quantity of data they produce and store.

“One of the key things the banks are starting to realize is that some of their biggest competitive advantages are locked within their data,” said Matthew Hodgson, Mosaic Smart Data’s founder and chief executive.

Banks are seeking solutions to deal with a liquidity crunch in fixed-income markets. Stricter capital requirements imposed after the 2008 financial crisis have made it more expensive for banks to act as market makers in corporate bonds, leading their fixed-income divisions to slump.

JP Morgan’s fixed-income markets revenue fell 27 percent in the three months ended in September, compared with the same period last year.

Troy Rohrbaugh, global head of macro at JPMorgan, said in a statement that Mosaic Smart Data’s technology could make the bank’s teams “quickly make better informed decisions.”

Mosaic Smart Data is the first company to complete JPMorgan’s “In-Residence” program for fintech start-ups, which was launched in 2016. The program gives young fintech companies support in helping commercialize their products and services.

Hodgson said the idea for the company came from his own experience heading trading at large banks.

“The problem banks face is how do you run your business and understand everything in real time, whether it is research or inventory, and be able to anticipate rather than react to client needs,” he said.",JPMorgan partners with data start-up to boost fixed-income trading,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-mosaic-bonds/jpmorgan-partners-with-data-start-up-to-boost-fixed-income-trading-idUSKBN1CS01D

Britain’s biggest retail lender reported a robust pre-tax profit of close to 2 billion pounds for the three months to September and topped up its already-healthy capital ratios. Shareholders might have hoped that Lloyds will spray some of that cash in their direction. Regulators have other ideas.

A sign is seen outside a branch of Lloyds Bank in central London February 3, 2014.

REUTERS/Luke MacGregor

The bank run by Antonio Horta-Osorio did most things right in the third quarter. Revenue jumped 8 percent, helped by the first-time inclusion of the UK credit card portfolio it bought from Bank of America. Operating costs fell, despite higher inflation, and bad debt charges remain under control. And while Lloyds is still paying out about 100 million pounds a month in compensation to customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance, it did not need to top up provisions for the scandal.

As a result, Lloyds’ common equity Tier 1 capital ratio improved to 14.9 percent – up 85 basis points in three months, and well ahead of the 13 percent that the bank previously reckoned it needed.

However, the regulatory goal posts are shifting. During the third quarter, the UK’s Prudential Regulatory Authority lifted the amount of extra capital that Lloyds must hold by 50 basis points to 3 percent. Meanwhile, regulators have also raised the counter-cyclical buffer for all UK lenders in an attempt to slow the surge in consumer lending. Lloyds will not know the full impact until early next year, but admits that there is “upward pressure” on its overall capital requirements.

Lloyds shareholders should not be too perturbed. Even if it pays out 4.5 pence per share in dividends - almost 50 percent more than last year – the bank will still have added 90 basis points to its capital ratio over the course of 2017 at the upper end of its own estimates. That’s more than enough to absorb any regulatory increase.

Nevertheless, the lack of clarity over its capital raises a question mark over how much Lloyds will be allowed to return to shareholders in future. Combined with Britain’s sluggish economy and the risk of a chaotic Brexit, it’s a reason for investors to doubt the value of a bank that trades at more than 1.2 times its tangible net asset value.",Breakingviews - Lloyds capital gusher suffers regulatory blockage,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyds-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-lloyds-capital-gusher-suffers-regulatory-blockage-idUSKBN1CU1A4

“We’re feeling good about what we’re seeing with future bookings,” Benjamin Smith, the carrier’s President, Passenger Airlines, told analysts on Wednesday without giving more specifics.

Yield grew by 0.4 percent on an annual basis, the first reported absolute yield growth in a quarter since the first three months of 2014, Smith said.

Montreal-based Air Canada, which has been adding more destinations in Europe and Asia, sees opportunities from service vacated by carriers like insolvent Air Berlin and struggling Alitalia.

“What we are seeing ... is the elimination in service from the weaker carriers such as Air Berlin and Alitalia into North America which definitely is providing opportunities for us,” Smith said, without elaborating.

Air Canada expects initial expressions of interest from bidders before year’s end for a previously announced plan to launch its own loyalty program with partners, Chief Executive Calin Rovinescu said.

Air Canada said it expects costs to go up slightly in the rest of the year due to higher wages.

The carrier said adjusted cost per available seat mile

for the full year would decrease 3 percent to 4 percent in 2017, compared with the 3 percent to 5 percent drop it estimated earlier.

Air Canada said passenger revenue rose 9.1 percent to C$4.48 billion ($3.53 billion) in the third quarter, while traffic increased 9 percent. That helped operating revenue jump nearly 10 percent.

Cost per available seat mile — a key measure of how much an airline spends to fly a passenger – fell 2.1 percent, on an adjusted basis, Air Canada said.

The airline’s profit in the latest quarter more than doubled to C$1.79 billion, or C$6.44 per share, from C$768 million, or C$2.74 per share, a year earlier.

That was largely due to a net income tax recovery of C$793 million in the latest quarter.

Excluding items, Air Canada earned C$3.43 per share in the latest quarter, beating analysts average estimate of C$3.28, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Operating revenue rose to C$4.88 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30 from C$4.45 billion a year earlier.

Air Canada stock was down 4 percent in afternoon trade.

Legislation introduced last week by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray would restore for two years subsidies to private insurers to help lower-income people buy insurance. President Donald Trump this month cut off those subsidies.

The bill also would provide states more flexibility to change some rules in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the signature legislative achievement of the Republican Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office previously estimated that various Republican proposals to repeal and replace Obamacare would cause more than 20 million people to lose health insurance. In contrast, the CBO on Wednesday said reinstating the subsidies, as called for in the Alexander-Murray bill, would not substantially alter the number of insured.

The CBO also estimated that the fix would not impact 2018 health insurance rates because they are already set. Health insurers said they raised premiums on average 20 percent to make up for the lost federal subsidies.

The CBO said it expected 2019 health insurance premiums to be lower with the insurer payments than without them.

While the Alexander-Murray legislation would reduce the federal deficit, the CBO previously found that eliminating the subsidies, called cost sharing reductions, would raise the federal deficit by $194 billion over a decade.

Because premiums would rise in the absence of the subsidies, the government would be compelled to spend more on financial assistance to low-income Americans.

About 20 million Americans obtained insurance through Obamacare and the law helped drive the U.S. uninsured rate to a record low, but Republicans have called it an unwarranted government intrusion in a healthcare system that represents a fifth of the U.S. economy.

It is unclear whether the Alexander-Murray bill will ever come to a vote in Congress. Trump has sent mixed signals about it, initially supporting it last week and then opposing it.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would not bring it up without Trump’s support. Trump has derided the insurer payments as a “bailout” and has vowed to let Obamacare “implode.”

“It does not bail out insurance companies, it does benefit consumers, it does benefit taxpayers to the tune of $3.8 billion,” Alexander said on Wednesday on the Senate floor.

Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies, but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income people.

Trump, who as a candidate promised to get rid of Obamacare, has been frustrated by the inability of a Congress led by his own party to pass a bill to repeal and replace it, and has taken steps that bypass lawmakers to chip away at the law.

House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan has signaled his opposition and on Wednesday said his chamber would not take up the matter or try again to pass broader Republican legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare this year.

With broad Democratic backing and the support of a dozen Republican senators, the Alexander-Murray bill has sufficient backing to exceed the 60 votes needed for passage in the 100-seat Senate, if McConnell allows it to come to a vote.

Two prominent Republicans in the House and Senate on Tuesday announced a competing Obamacare fix that is more conservative and appears to address many of the Trump administration’s objections to the Alexander-Murray proposal.

The proposal by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Republican Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, includes provisions to suspend requirements for individuals and employers to buy health coverage under Obamacare.

Ryan told Reuters in an interview he favored the Hatch-Brady proposal.",Bipartisan Obamacare fix would cut U.S. deficit: nonpartisan analysis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-cbo/bipartisan-obamacare-fix-would-cut-u-s-deficit-nonpartisan-analysis-idUSKBN1CU2B9

With roots that go back to Thomas Edison’s electric-light company in the 1870s, GE was one of 12 companies selected by Dow Jones when it created its market indicator in 1896. While some, like the American Cotton Oil Co and the National Lead Co, have long since faded into history, GE became a symbol of American industrial prowess. It began electrifying the railways in the 1890s, built the first U.S. jet engine in 1941 and supplied the silicon for Neil Armstrong’s moon boots. Under Jack Welch, it was an avatar of America’s economic revival in the 1980s and 1990s, and became the world’s most valuable company at the turn of the century.

The conglomerate has underperformed for years, though, despite shedding its appliance and finance divisions and making big bets on power and energy. GE shares have produced a total return of minus 2 percent a year for the past 10 years, according to Eikon data, far behind the Dow’s 8.4 percent annualized gain. The stock accounts for just 0.7 percent of the benchmark, well behind Apple’s 4.6 percent and Boeing’s leading 7.7 percent.

The Dow is an oddity as the only major price-weighted U.S. market tracker, and for years GE has had one of the lower weights. There is no minimum weighting required, and the boffins at S&P Dow Jones Indices may be reluctant to drop the oldest constituent, especially as today’s average contains few actual industrial companies. Yet the stock has already broken an unwritten rule that the ratio of the highest- to the lowest-priced stock should be 10 to 1.

GE still boasted a $206 billion market cap by Friday’s close, the 19th largest among U.S. companies, and exclusion from the Dow wouldn’t necessarily trigger massive selling because most indexed funds track broad indexes like the S&P 500. But it’s telling that telecoms group AT&T has underperformed the Dow by 23 percentage points since it was removed to make way for Apple two years ago. Flannery is already considering slashing the dividend to husband resources. The last thing he needs is the humiliation of being kicked out of the Dow.",Breakingviews - GE has become the ultimate industrial lightweight,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-ge-has-become-the-ultimate-industrial-lightweight-idUSKBN1CS25L

Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the committee, said two of the nominees were of “grave concern”: Bill Wehrum, nominated for assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, and Michael Dourson to head up the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention.

Carper called Dourson “one of the most troubling nominees I have ever considered during my time on this committee.”

Senator James Inhofe of oil-producing Oklahoma, the panel’s senior Republican, praised the passage of the nominees and urged the full Senate to quickly confirm them so they can “improve public health within the scope of the EPA’s authority.”

Republicans say the EPA under former President Barack Obama overstepped its authority to regulate. Scott Pruitt, President Donald Trump’s EPA administrator, has said the agency had an “activist agenda” under former President Barack Obama.

Pruitt has worked to do away with regulations pushed through by the Obama administration, and has proposed scrapping the landmark Clean Power Plan that sought to curb emissions linked to climate change. Pruitt sued the agency more than a dozen times when he was Oklahoma’s attorney general.

Kurz wants stronger borders and drastic reductions in immigration. He agrees with Strache that “several hundred people have made their way from Austria to fight and murder for the Islamic State … (there is) no place for radical thought and political Islam.”

Kurz’s win is remarkable for his youth and his refurbishment of a fading party, but it’s in tune with the rest of a rising anti-European Union mood in Middle Europe. That mood is likely to be strengthened in the outcome of this weekend’s elections in the Czech Republic. There the ANO (""Yes"") center-right party is the likely winner.

At a conference in Prague last month in which I participated, Babis said that “Europe is failing on security” and that, if the 17 countries using the euro (the Czechs do not) integrate further – “we will be out. We do not need further integration.” Babis knows his fellow citizens: only small minorities are enthusiastic Europeans, or wish their country to join the common currency zone.

A swing against the European Union was not what the end of communism in the region was supposed to ordain. The Czech Republic, like the other former Communist states, sloughed off the Soviet yoke in the late 1980s with an affirmation of freedom. In Czechoslovakia (as it then was), the stubborn dissident writer Vaclav Havel invoked “the power of the powerless” – and in 1989, a few years after being released from powerless detention in prison, won power as president of his country.

Havel saw the central European states as returning to their natural European home, after decades of icy post-war imprisonment in the Soviet bloc. But that home has become one of disputes and mutual disappointment, not of amity. Freedom from communism has, indeed, meant the creation of electoral democracy, of varying degrees of strength and transparency. But it’s also meant corruption in politics and business – bribery was pervasive in the Communist era, but relatively small scale compared to today - periods of high unemployment, a growing suspicion of the European Union as an alien force (though a careful retention of its subsidies) and a strong dislike of immigration, which has meant closed borders and a refusal to participate in the EU’s migrant resettlement program. In the Czech Republic, a new ferociously anti-immigrant and anti-Islam party, headed by Tomio Okamura, a citizen of half-Czech and half Korean-Japanese ancestry has leapt to fourth place in the opinion polls.

Central Europe is now deeply and popularly conservative. Austria, geographically part of it even if it escaped the Soviet embrace, is now more politically in tune with its neighborhood than it has ever been. Indeed Kurz spoke in a Financial Times interview of his wish, if and when chancellor, to be a “bridge” between the post-communist states and the EU -- while sharing many of the former’s concerns.

Building that bridge is going to be a tough job. The countries in which Havel placed so much importance as an enthusiastic addition to Europe – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – no longer find much common ground, except in agreeing to keep out immigrants. Babis says the group, known as the Visegrad Four, is no longer useful. All of its member states have become more closed and hostile to the EU, but in different ways.

Poland differs most strongly in one sense: in a generally pro- Moscow grouping, it is unremittingly hostile to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of the ruling Law and Justice Party, blames for the death of his brother Lech, with other members of the Polish elite, in a plane crash in Russia. Under Kaczynski’s guidance, the Polish government has sought ever-greater control over the justice system and the media, all the while attacking liberal institutions and framing the EU as an external and unwelcome influence which must be defied.

Hungary, with the authoritarian Viktor Orban at the head of a rightist government, combines strong antagonism to the EU, a close relationship with Vladimir Putin’s Russia and a paranoia which has given rise to a clamorous campaign with anti-Semitic undertones centered on the figure of the liberal, Jewish Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, who funded many of the institutions and rising politicians in post-Soviet Hungary – including Orban himself. Soros’ largest contribution, the creation of the highly regarded Central European University, is now under threat of closure.

The veteran Hungarian-Austrian journalist Paul Lendvai, author of a new, fiercely critical biography of Orban, told me that the Hungarian prime minister “is deeply cynical and very skillful. He has imposed his power everywhere. The left is split and demoralized; the only opposition he fears is from Jobbik” – a far-right anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, anti-Romany party that is now, like the Austrian Freedom Party, softening its image to seek a possible future place in a coalition.

The Middle Europeans have, in part, done what the democratic world urged them to do: they have developed an independent politics. But increasingly, their dominant political sentiment is antithetical to, even contemptuous of, the liberal, pro-integrationist ideals of the European Union. These ideals, which Havel would have recognized, are now best expressed by President Emmanuel Macron of France. But, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, once the EU’s undisputed leading actor, begins what is billed as a long negotiation to form a governing coalition after her failure to win an outright majority in Germany’s recent election, she can no longer offer the Frenchman the support on which he counted.

The EU is now caught between a Brexit-ing Britain – with which negotiations are not going well – and an increasingly disenchanted group of Middle Europeans. The relief with which the defeat of the far-right in France and the Netherlands was greeted earlier this year was premature. A determination to close borders, to oppose more powers for Brussels and reluctance to accept its authority grows and spreads – and renders the European dream of unity, for the moment, impossible.",Commentary: Middle Europe turns its back on the EU,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-austria-commentary/commentary-middle-europe-turns-its-back-on-the-eu-idUSKBN1CP26M

He failed to accomplish either.

The dust was barely settling on the capture of Islamic State’s de facto capital Raqqa, a major success for Washington and the coalition it assembled across the region and beyond. While most of the actual fighting has been done by local forces, without U.S. support the Islamist group would still almost certainly dominate huge swathes of the region. Its dramatic early victories in 2014 seriously rattled authorities in Baghdad and Riyadh in particular – but now it is largely on the ropes, neither government has much appetite for being dictated to by America.

Those in the Trump and Obama administration might be loathe to admit it, but over the last three years both followed a similar approach on Middle East policy. Occasionally dubbed “ISIS first,” it prioritized the group’s defeat above all other regional interests. It was a reasonable approach, and – while remnants of IS remain – it has proved remarkably successful.

The problem is that there is little clarity on what will now define U.S. Mideast policy. Without a single guiding principle, there is the real risk that an already-conflicted approach could fall apart entirely.

In some respects, this is already happening. With the diminished threat from IS, Washington’s always awkward alliance with the Shi’ite-dominated, Iran-allied Baghdad government and the various political entities of Iraqi Kurdistan has deteriorated with dramatic speed. A Kurdish independence referendum last month was followed quickly by an Iraqi government advance into oil-rich areas around the Kurdish city of Kirkuk. For much of the last week, Kurdish and Iraqi government forces – both U.S.-funded and equipped, and until recently allies in the bloody battle for Mosul – have been at each other’s throats.

Across the rest of the region, the historical Sunni-Shi’ite rivalry continues to grow more complex. In Syria, Iran and Russia have essentially succeeded in their attempts to salvage Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Washington appears to have accepted this as the cost of stability and pushing back against Islamic State, while giving Saudi Arabia effective carte blanche to pursue its own war in Yemen against Houthi rebels allied with Tehran.

With IS now weakened, the Trump White House clearly now hopes to make the confrontation with Iran its overarching regional priority. Trump’s October 13 announcement that he would not recertify the nuclear deal negotiated by the previous administration was the clearest signal of that so far, followed closely by new sanctions against Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, which the U.S. labels a sponsor of terror.

On Iran, however, Washington has little realistic chance of achieving the wide, unified coalition it formed against IS. America’s allies remain deeply divided on the best approach to Tehran, with European states openly reluctant to tear up the nuclear agreement also signed by Moscow and Beijing.

The Gulf states are anything but a unified coalition. The Saudi and United Arab Emirates-backed blockade of Qatar continues, putting the United States – which has major military bases in all three countries – in an awkward position, one it appears to have extremely limited ability to remedy.

The face-off between Qatar and neighbors long-infuriated by its support for groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood may now be beyond Washington’s ability to resolve. If anything, however, Tillerson was even less likely to achieve his other objective for the visit, that of turning the Iraqi government against Tehran.

When it comes to defeating Islamic State, Baghdad has been at least as dependent on Iran-backed Shi’ite militias as on Washington or the Kurds. Tillerson’s demand this weekend that those militias return to Iran will have been seen as particularly unreasonable – not least because many of their members are Shi’ite Iraqi nationals.

Tillerson’s visit risks reinforcing a narrative that had been growing in strength since the Obama administration – that America has ever-less control and influence over traditional friends and enemies alike, particularly at a time when they increasingly feel they can turn to alternatives such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Under President Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey – a reliable U.S. ally as far back as the end of the nineteenth century – has become increasingly hostile. Egypt’s military government too is increasingly keen to assert its independence, even as it continues to receive large quantities of U.S. aid.

Relations with Israel might be marginally better under Trump than Obama but they remain much looser than in recent decades. Trump has sent mixed signals on a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; suggested – but not acted upon – moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and unsettled Israelis after reports that he disclosed Israeli-provided classified information about Islamic State to Russia’s foreign minister earlier this year. Israel’s concerns about Iran’s rising influence and an unpredictable U.S. administration make it likely that the Jewish state will intensify its own efforts at regional diplomacy, particularly with the Gulf states.

It’s a paradox that this is happening at the same time as the largely successful coalition effort against Islamic State – a coalition that depended heavily on the United States, and which perhaps no other country could have ushered into existence in quite the same way. In contrast to the unilateral U.S. military intervention in Iraq, Washington went to great efforts to work with and through regional partners, and it has proved remarkably effective. (The irony isn’t confined to the Middle East. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte is celebrating a U.S.-assisted victory over IS in Marawi City at the same time that he intensifies his courtship of Russia and China.)

U.S. military assistance will remain. IS is not completely gone, and will continue to lash out. It may yet seize new safe havens as it has in parts of Libya and Afghanistan. The wider battle against al Qaeda-inspired militancy will unquestionably continue, often with U.S. military support and coordination.

After more than a decade of war and perceived failure, however, America’s enthusiasm for attempting to reshape the Middle East may be running out. But even if it isn’t, the willingness of those in the region to listen may also be exhausted.",Commentary: U.S. loses in the Mideast even as it wins against Islamic State,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-afterislamicstate-commentary/commentary-u-s-loses-in-the-mideast-even-as-it-wins-against-islamic-state-idUSKBN1CU2XM

QUÓRUM

A intenção era fazer com que todos os deputados registrassem presença, sob pena de correrem o risco de terem desconto em seus contracheques.

Xi led his team in order of rank on to a stage at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, overlooking Tiananmen Square, culminating a week-long party conclave at which he laid out his vision for an increasingly prosperous China confident of its place on the world stage.

Apart from Xi, Premier Li Keqiang was the only one to retain his spot amid sweeping changes on the Politburo Standing Committee. There has been persistent speculation Xi could seek to stay on in some capacity beyond the end of his customary second five years in power, which began on Wednesday.

All seven Standing Committee members are men in their 60s and, for the first time, none was born before China’s 1949 Communist revolution.

The make-up of the committee, which has ultimate control over the world’s second-largest economy, appeared to be a compromise to include a blend of Xi allies and those considered loyal to party elders, including Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, former presidents whose networks still wield influence.

Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, said Xi appeared to have traded securing favorable amendments to the constitution in exchange for a compromise on the make-up of the Standing Committee, a line-up he likened to a “team of rivals”.

The member considered closest to Xi is Li Zhanshu, who has often accompanied Xi on overseas trips in a chief-of-staff-style role as the head the party’s General Office.

Li, who is not related to the premier, was named the third-ranked member, meaning he will most likely assume the role of head of the largely rubber-stamp parliament. That will not be confirmed until parliament meets in March.

Xi had already strengthened his hand considerably ahead of the announcement, with his political theory and “Belt and Road” infrastructure-led development strategy put into the party constitution. He was named the party’s “core” last year.

POLITICAL CAPITAL

Guangdong party secretary Hu Chunhua and Chongqing party boss Chen Miner had been previously seen as prominent contenders to succeed Xi among the party’s so-called sixth generation of leaders but were not included in the Standing Committee.

Instead, both were named to the wider 25-member Politburo, a rung below the Standing Committee.

“He’s consolidated his power without making unnecessary problems for himself,” said David Zweig, a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

“The costs of keeping Wang Qishan or getting Chen Miner were too high. He didn’t need to do it.”

Wang, who led Xi’s sweeping anti-graft campaign and was considered China’s second most-powerful politician, is above retirement age; Chen was comparatively junior.

While the Standing Committee bears the hallmarks of compromise, the new Politburo is stacked with more than a dozen Xi allies, including Chen, Beijing party boss Cai Qi, economic adviser Liu He and Ding Xuexiang, who is expected to become Xi’s chief of staff as director of the party’s General Office.

“Xi has managed to put a lot of his own people there, as much as possible,” said Bo Zhiyue, a New Zealand-based expert on Chinese politics.

“Most of Xi’s close associates are too junior to be put into the Politburo Standing Committee right away.”

‘DREAM TEAM’

Blanket state media coverage made no mention of factional politics or alliances, while an editorial on the official People’s Daily’s WeChat account hailed the new seven-man line-up as a “dream team” to lead China into its “new era”.

Xi, who has sought to revitalize the Communist Party’s role across Chinese society, made no mention of who his successor might be as he introduced his new Standing Committee at a media event broadcast live around the country. His remarks were translated consecutively into English.

Xi did not take questions, but said the party had weathered trials and tribulations.

The U.S.-North Korea situation is becoming more fraught as both sides attempt to pile on pressure, pushing prospects for talks further away.

Just two months ago, I argued that Americans needed to put North Korea’s missile tests in perspective. (“Yes, they’re worrying. But the U.S. mainland is not in imminent danger.”) Now I’m slightly less sanguine: either side could make a catastrophic miscalculation while tensions persist. Even before Trump’s decision on Iran, the prospects for negotiations were diminishing.

Paul Wallace: How money will divide Europe after Brexit

For one, things got personal. Following an incendiary Sept. 19 speech at the U.N. General Assembly in which Trump called Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man” and threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, Kim wrote a personal letter, carried by Pyongyang’s main newspaper, calling Trump a “dotard,” among other things.

Insults and mudslinging have become part of the currency in U.S. domestic politics, but what works on the campaign trail won’t work with North Korea. There, the dignity and image of the leader is near-sacred and name-calling will be counterproductive. Elite politicking in Pyongyang is in no small part about competing to show loyalty to the supreme leader. Debate does take place at very senior levels, but only before Kim announces a position — never in contradiction to it. Any North Korean voices promoting a softer line will have been further hushed by the personal offense Kim has taken and by his forceful rhetorical pushback.

Second, the U.N. Security Council tightened sanctions against Pyongyang in August and September. These have banned all North Korea’s major exports, including textiles, seafood and coal as well as joint ventures with foreign companies and new contracts hiring North Koreans as laborers abroad. China’s agreement to these measures was key and some degree of enforcement seems to be taking place.

This reinforces Pyongyang’s bunker mentality. The zero-sum game it sees with Washington is now compounded by China’s “betrayal” in supporting these sanctions. North Korea feels it is in a life-or-death struggle and cannot be seen to flinch at this, its most difficult strategic moment in the 21st century. Given the extreme level of state control over its citizens, North Korea is also well positioned to endure suffering and tolerate a severe economic contraction.

This brings us to Iran, where the political system is partially democratic and where sanctions did indeed contribute to voices of compromise in Tehran’s government. This led to negotiations and, finally, in 2015 the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), usually referred to as the Iran nuclear deal.

The agreement is not perfect. After many years of talks, however, European and U.S. negotiators thought the deal was the best they could get. The deal does make it extremely difficult for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Iran’s uranium stockpiles have been reduced by over 95 percent, its centrifuges by over 60 percent and its ability to enrich uranium has been capped far below the threshold for nuclear weapons. Inspections verify this at all points in the supply and production chains.

The agreement’s limitations include having expiration dates on these restrictions. It also does not include curbs on Tehran’s missile programs. But Trump’s refusal to re-certify Iran’s compliance last week seems largely because of Iran’s other moves in the Middle East, including support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Trump’s Oct. 13 speech has not killed the deal – at least not yet – but it does kick the ball over to Congress, which now has to determine whether to pull out or remain. It’s not clear what Congress will do but the deal will be in jeopardy if Congress decides to resurrect pre-deal sanctions or introduce new ones.

Crucially, International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and all the other parties to the Iran agreement, including the European Union, Germany and U.N. Security Council members China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom say Iran is in compliance and that the deal should remain in place. In various statements they have all said the deal should continue to be adhered to.

Trump laid out a broader policy in which he wants to pressure U.S. allies into redoing the deal, while also trying to contain Iran’s other activities in the region more actively. But blowing up the deal would only further isolate Washington on the world stage.

This is important in terms of taking the high ground in the tensions with North Korea. Many countries in the international community, especially China, have been trying to coax North Korea back to negotiations, but they have been consistently rebuffed. Pyongyang officials argue that their country has a right to have nuclear weapons and that they are a necessity as deterrence against their old enemy.

On top of that, the North Korean authorities now can say: “See? Even if we come back to talks and make a deal with the United States, how can we trust them? Why would we ever give up our nuclear weapons for an agreement with this country?” To be fair, the regime already doesn’t trust the U.S. for its own reasons, but now it can justify it to the international community and make it harder for America’s allies to credibly argue against it.

Moreover, will China and Russia sign on to further U.N. Security Council resolutions against North Korea when the United States has shown itself to be so reticent to abide by complicated, negotiated solutions? These two countries may even lose patience with enforcing U.N. sanctions if they perceive the Trump administration to be only focused on pressure as a punitive measure rather than an attempt to find constructive solutions.

A negotiated solution to the North Korea crisis now seems well beyond the horizon. Trump’s jeopardizing of the Iran deal nudges it even further away. Until it comes into view, we all need to hope that neither side makes a mistake as they try to project toughness during this fraught period.",Commentary: Trump’s Iran decision hurts chance of a North Korea deal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abrahamian-northkorea-commentary/commentary-trumps-iran-decision-hurts-chance-of-a-north-korea-deal-idUSKBN1CO2CY

On the other side of the American culture war, a CBS vice president and legal counsel, Hayley Geftman-Gold, posted a Facebook comment that she was “not even sympathetic” to the victims because “country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” Unlike her right wing opposites, she suffered for her opinion: she was fired from what must have been a lawyer’s dream job.

Should any of these comments ­­­− the work of, at most, a few minutes when not that of a few seconds − be the concern of the state? They easily fall into the category of bad taste. Some remarks, especially Geftman-Gold’s sneeringly callous comment – for which she has since apologized – could cause further misery in those seeking to cope with the trauma of injury or loss of someone close to them.

The general opinion, especially in the United States, is that governments should stay out of it. For Washington, the anger such remarks may rouse and the distress they may cause must be endured in deference to the near-absolute right of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

But should we tolerate such verbal brutality? Can it not be “cured?” Do people have to suffer distress because of the voiced prejudices of others who often – as Limbaugh does – make a rich living from their display? There’s a growing faction saying no, and it has reached, at least in Europe, the stage of state action. The European Union Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourova has told the social media giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, that they must eliminate both hate speech and fake news, or face legislation criminalizing them for not doing so. That’s a sweeping statement: unpacking what it might mean in practice takes us deep into an area which should be marked with signs saying: “Danger! Free speech in Peril!”

Fake news is not the same as hate speech, but it can also be used to inflame social tensions. In Italy, the anti-trust chief Giovanni Petruzella has said that EU countries should create government-appointed bodies to remove fake news and even fine the media for violations. But how is fake news to be distinguished, by either artificial or human intelligence, from true news? It’s a delicate operation, since much news striving to be “true” contains false information, and much fake news has the ring of truth and would take careful investigation to disprove.

In Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech. Called, challengingly, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, NetzDG for short, it commands that Facebook and Twitter take down “blatantly illegal” hate speech within 24 hours or, if the offending material is less obviously illegal, in a week – on pain of a fine of up to 50 million euro ($58.6 million). The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech. It merely points to the passage in the German Criminal Code which declares the ""defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations"" illegal. What is defamation? When is one person’s unbearable insult another’s opinion?

Sticks and stones may break my bones/But words will never hurt me” has been a comfort of sorts to those who have been the victims of taunting and insult, but modern psychiatry claims it isn’t so. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, in a careful parsing of what constitutes harmful speech, argues that “there is a difference between permitting a culture of casual brutality and entertaining an opinion you strongly oppose. The former is a danger to a civil society (and to our health); the latter is the lifeblood of democracy.” Speech of the first kind, which “bullies and torments,” is “from the perspective of our brain cells… literally a form of violence.”

Put that way, it appears obvious: the speech which harms should be criminalized, as much as a physical assault, and in parts of Europe it is being so. Facebook, Twitter and Google are now under increasing state and public pressure to clean up their sites, to stop posting material that causes more than distress but, apparently, real damage to the brain. Embattled UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out at the United Nations last month, calling on the tech companies to go much further and faster in combating the dangerous messages they carry.

At a background-only session with Google staff in London this past week, where these issues were broached, I was told that the concerns of governments and the public were registered, and reform was on the way.

When I quoted the view of Fiyaz Mughal, head of the anti-extremist British advocacy organization Faith Matters, that the companies with which he had been working are “not dealing with the problem” because their “bottom line is money,” I was met with an assurance that this was not so. The automatic default of the communications behemoths to absolutism in free speech has been replaced, it was said, by a finer-grained examination of cause and effect, and of what could reasonably be done to address concerns.

It’s true that to juggle the demands of free speech and those of security now constitutes one of the largest ethical and practical problems facing democratic states − and the tech corporations. And it’s also true that even if Mughal is right that the companies’ first care is the bottom line – for which corporation is that not true? – the large fines now being prepared for not heeding the call to reform would be a large incentive to change.

Yet in the course of this complex balancing act, between security and liberty, profit and regulation, there is the danger of substantial damage to the freedoms of speech and the news media which democracies have been able to safeguard for most of the post-World War Two period.

In September, U.S. officials ordered Kaspersky’s products removed from government computers, saying the firm was vulnerable to Kremlin influence and that using the software could jeopardize national security.

After that announcement, the Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 5 that hackers working for the Russian government appeared to have targeted a National Security Agency (NSA) worker by using Kaspersky software to identify classified files in 2015. The New York Times reported on Oct. 10 that Israeli officials reported the operation to the United States after they hacked into Kaspersky's network.

The Russian government has denied any involvement.

Kaspersky began an internal inquiry in a bid to restore trust. On Wednesday, it said it had stumbled on the code in 2014 when the consumer version of its popular software flagged a zip file as malicious on a U.S. computer.

While reviewing the file’s contents, a Kaspersky analyst discovered it contained the source code for a hacking tool later attributed to what Kaspersky calls the Equation Group. The software removed the file and the analyst reported the matter to Chief Executive Eugene Kaspersky, who ordered that the copy of the code be destroyed, the company said.

Kaspersky said it assumed the 2014 source code episode was connected to the NSA’s loss of files described in media reports.

“We deleted the archive because we don’t need the source code to improve our protection technologies and because of concerns regarding the handling of classified materials,” said Kaspersky spokeswoman Sarah Kitsos.

Source code, which is normally hidden and gives instructions to computers, would have posed no danger to the Kaspersky customer.

Former employees told Reuters in July that the company had on rare occasions removed uninfected files. Kaspersky spokeswoman Yuliya Shlychkova on Wednesday said removals of such uninfected material happen “extremely rarely.”

Kaspersky said no third parties saw the code, though the media reports said the spy tool had ended up in the hands of the Russian government.

Kaspersky denied the Journal’s report that its programs searched for keywords including “top secret.”

The company said it found no evidence that it had been hacked by Russian spies or anyone except the Israelis, though it suggested others could have obtained the tools by hacking into the American’s computer through a back door it later spotted there.

The NSA declined to comment on Kaspersky’s review.

The new 2014 date of the incident is of interest because Kaspersky only announced its discovery of an espionage campaign by the Equation Group in February 2015. At that time, Reuters cited former NSA employees who said that Equation Group was an NSA project.

Kaspersky’s Equation Group report was one of its most celebrated findings, since it indicated that the group could infect firmware on most computers. That gave the NSA almost undetectable presence.

Shlychkova said the American machine’s files were found before the big Equation Group announcement but after Kaspersky had discovered Equation software on a machine in the Middle East. She said that occurred in March 2014.

Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who led calls in the U.S. Congress to purge Kaspersky products from federal government networks, on Wednesday sent a letter to DHS acting Secretary Elaine Duke and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, urging the U.S. government to declassify information about Kaspersky products.

The step was necessary, Shaheen wrote, “to allow the American people to make informed decisions about risks to their privacy and security.”

Also on Tuesday, Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill sent a separate letter to DHS asking what was being done to ensure federal agencies were complying with the ban on Kaspersky products.

Kaspersky’s consumer anti-virus software has won high marks from reviewers.

Canada’s indigenous population grew 42.5 percent in the ten years to 2016 to 1.7 million people, compared to 11 percent growth for Canada as a whole, Statistics Canada found, in data released from a 2016 census.

The findings show a young population, with an average age of 32.1 years, compared with 40.9 for the non-aboriginal population.

The census also found a younger generation significantly more likely to be raised in foster care. Indigenous children made up 7.7 percent of all Canadians under 5 but more than half of the children in foster homes, according to the data release.

It also found that one fifth of the indigenous population lives in over-crowded housing, and 44 percent of indigenous people on reserves were living in homes that needed major repairs.

Canada’s indigenous people come from hundreds of nations and bands, with more than 70 distinct languages. They include First Nations, Métis, people of mixed indigenous and European background, and Inuit, who largely inhabit Canada’s north.

Population growth between 2006 and 2016 was highest for Métis, at 51.2 percent.

Opener Dhawan top-scored with 68 and Karthik remained not out on 64 down the order as the hosts reached the 231-run victory target with four overs to spare at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium.

There was drama before the match when the ground curator was suspended following a TV sting operation in which he allegedly agreed to tamper with the wicket.

Indian bowlers, especially new ball colleagues Bhuvneshwar Kumar (three for 45) and Jaspreet Bumrah, laid the foundation for their comprehensive victory by restricting New Zealand to 230 for nine after the tourists opted to bat.

On a slow track, the pace duo combined slower balls with bouncers, conceding 83 runs in 20 tidy overs while sharing five wickets between them.

New Zealand were reduced to 58 for four in the 16th over and none of the touring batsmen managed a 50, crawling to the 100 mark in 26 overs.

Following their poor start, Tom Latham (38) and Henry Nicholls (42) tried to rebuild the Kiwi innings and Colin de Grandhomme subsequently made 41 off 40 balls to lend some respectability to the New Zealand total.

Leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal dismissed de Grandhomme and Adam Milne off successive deliveries but New Zealand, who won Sunday’s series opener in Mumbai by six wickets, somehow avoided being bowled out in the contest.

India lost Rohit Sharma early in their reply but Dhawan added 57 runs with skipper Virat Kohli to help them overcome the early loss.

Kohli fell for 29 but the left-right combination of Dhawan and Karthik thwarted the tourists, mixing caution with aggression during their 66-run association.

Dhawan, who was adjudged caught behind on 46 before the decision was overturned, hit five boundaries and a couple of sixes before falling to Milne.

Karthik then combined with Hardik Pandya, who chipped in with a 30-run cameo, to keep India on course, and Karthik went on to hit Tim Southee for his fourth boundary to seal India’s victory.

Other data on Wednesday showed new single-family home sales vaulting to a near 10-year high last month. The signs of strong business investment on equipment in the third quarter and a pick-up in the housing market supported views the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates in December.

“The positive reports keep the economy’s wheels turning, and the Fed on track for another rate hike this year,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “Businesses don’t invest in the future if they don’t think consumers will be there to buy their goods and services.”

The Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 1.3 percent last month after an upwardly revised 1.3 percent increase in August.

Economists had forecast orders of these so-called core capital goods increasing 0.5 percent last month after a previously reported 1.1 percent jump in August. Core capital goods orders advanced 3.8 percent year-on-year.

Shipments of core capital goods climbed 0.7 percent after soaring 1.2 percent in August. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government’s gross domestic product measurement.

Core capital goods shipments have now increased for eight straight months. Business investment on equipment stumbled in late 2015 and much of last year as declining oil prices hurt profits. Spending is in part being supported by a weakening dollar, strengthening global growth and steady oil prices.

The dollar briefly rose against a basket of currencies after the data as traders anticipated an interest rate hike in December, which would be the third this year.

Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rising to a seven-month high. U.S. stocks were trading slightly lower after lackluster earnings reports from AT&T and Boeing.

Business spending on equipment probably contributed to economic growth in the third quarter, which could help to cushion the blow on GDP from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

Economists estimate that Harvey and Irma, which devastated parts of Texas and Florida, sliced off as much as one percentage point from third-quarter GDP.

UPSIDE RISK TO THIRD-QUARTER GDP ESTIMATE

The government is due to publish its advance GDP estimate for the July-September quarter on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the economy probably grew at a 2.5 percent annualized rate in the July-September period, slowing down from the second quarter’s brisk 3.1 percent pace.

But the Commerce Department report, which also showed inventories increasing 0.6 percent in September, the largest gain since June 2015, suggested third-quarter economic growth could surprise on the upside.

The economy’s improving prospects were also underscored by a second report from the Commerce Department showing new home sales surged 18.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000 units last month amid an increase in all four regions.

That was the highest level since October 2007 and the percent gain was the largest since January 1992. New home sales are, however, volatile month-to-month and last month’s jump likely exaggerates the health of the housing market, which has struggled for much of this year.

“There are several reasons...to be reluctant to believe the upbeat message from today’s home sales report,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “This recent surge in activity has not been evident in a number of the other housing indicators that we track.”

Strong business spending on equipment is helping to support manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, shot up 2.2 percent last month amid a 5.1 percent rise in demand for transportation equipment.

Durable goods orders increased 2.0 percent in August. Unfilled orders for durable goods increased 0.2 percent in September after being unchanged the prior month.","U.S. business spending on equipment robust, new home sales surge",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-business-spending-on-equipment-robust-new-home-sales-surge-idUSKBN1CU1RS

In the short-term, a further argument in favour of higher rates might come from solid bank lending figures from industry association UK Finance.
Construction continued to struggle, however, contracting by 0.7 percent on the quarter - its sharpest fall since the third quarter of 2012.","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s sluggish economy perked up slightly during the past three months, an unexpected boost that clears the way for the Bank of England to raise interest rates next week for the first time in a decade.

While falling short of the strong growth rates enjoyed by euro zone countries earlier this year, British economic growth picked up to 0.4 percent in the July-September period from 0.3 percent in the second quarter, official data showed on Wednesday.

Sterling climbed almost a full percentage point against the U.S. dollar on the figures, which beat the average forecast for growth of 0.3 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.

British five-year government bond yields also rose to their highest since last year’s vote to leave the European Union as markets anticipated a quicker pace of BoE rate rises next year.

Britain performed much better than most economists expected immediately after last year’s vote to leave the European Union, and it was one of the fastest-growing major advanced economies in 2016.

But it slipped to the bottom of the pack earlier this year, posting its worst first-half performance since 2012, largely due to higher inflation caused by the pound’s fall after the Brexit vote, at a time when its peers have enjoyed robust growth,

While Wednesday’s figures are a small boost for under-pressure Chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of his November budget, they do not alter the broad picture of an economy dogged by poor productivity and squeezed living standards.

“Despite the weak outlook, the Bank of England will now almost certainly raise the Bank Rate by 25 basis points ... on 2nd November,” said Daniel Vernazza, chief UK economist at UniCredit.

A Reuters poll published on Tuesday showed the Bank is widely expected to raise rates to 0.50 percent from 0.25 percent on Nov. 2, due to concerns that the economy cannot grow as fast as it used to without generating excess inflation. [BOE/INT]

Financial markets nudged up the chance of a move to nearly 90 percent from just over 80 percent before the data.

Last month the Bank said Wednesday’s preliminary data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) was likely to show 0.3 percent growth, though it might be stronger due to improving consumer demand.

In the past, Britain’s economy typically grew by 0.5-0.6 percent a quarter but the Bank and other economists have indicated that the sustainable growth rate may have fallen.

FOCUS ON PRODUCTIVITY

Hammond told broadcasters the growth figures were “solid” and proof of the fundamental strength of an economy that since the referendum had often made forecasters look too pessimistic.

In a separate statement, he said he was focused on boosting productivity - arguably Britain’s biggest economic problem - in order to create more higher-wage jobs.

Next month’s budget would consider ways to support high-growth firms short of finance, the housing sector and consumers, but the economic situation placed limits on what could be done, Hammond added.

Britain’s budget watchdog has said it expects to chop its forecasts for productivity growth in coming years, suggesting the economy will have less room to grow without generating inflation - a diagnosis shared by BoE Governor Mark Carney.

In the short-term, a further argument in favour of higher rates might come from solid bank lending figures from industry association UK Finance.

Nonetheless, most economists polled by Reuters think it would be a mistake for the Bank to hike interest rates now, in part because of the economic uncertainty generated by the Brexit process.

The ONS data showed the vast services industry was behind the bulk of Britain’s economic expansion in the third quarter, but manufacturing also contributed, helped by a rebound in car production.

In year-on-year terms, third-quarter growth was unchanged at 1.5 percent, also slightly stronger than analysts had expected.

Britain’s dominant services maintained its momentum from the previous quarter, the ONS said, while industrial output expanded at its fastest rate in more than a year.

Construction continued to struggle, however, contracting by 0.7 percent on the quarter - its sharpest fall since the third quarter of 2012.

“We would urge the (BoE) to proceed with caution on raising rates, as tightening monetary policy amid the current economic and political uncertainty could weaken growth,” said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce.

The Republican plan would cut taxes for businesses and people by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, according to independent analysts.
Ryan has previously said he wants the House to pass the tax bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.
He predicted on Wednesday that some Democratic lawmakers would back the tax plan.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday that a sweeping Republican tax-cut plan is entering its toughest phase yet as lobbyists swarm Congress to try to protect valuable tax breaks.

Urging lawmakers to move quickly on the plan, Ryan said in an interview with Reuters that speedy action would prevent the legislation getting bogged down and deliver sooner the economic growth that Republicans expect from it.

“K Street,” as Washington’s lobbying industry is known after the downtown street where much of it is based, will soon descend on Capitol Hill to defend tax benefits for companies and other special interests, said Ryan, the top Republican in Congress.

”When the details come, that is when you’re going to see K Street coming to Congress. And that’s why this hasn’t been done for 31 years,” said Ryan, looking back to the country’s last major tax code overhaul under President Ronald Reagan in 1986.

While the broad parameters of the Republican plan, backed by President Donald Trump, have been made public, detailed legislation is not expected to be revealed until next week.

Securing passage by Congress of the tax plan would give Trump his first major legislative win since he took office in January. Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress and are under pressure to deliver on their election campaign promises. Final action on taxes is at least weeks away.

The Republican plan would cut taxes for businesses and people by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, according to independent analysts.

It calls for reducing the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and setting a lower rate for smaller businesses, as well as cutting taxes for individuals and allowing larger deductions for families.

Democrats have called it a gift to the rich and to corporate America that would cause the federal deficit to balloon and add to the $20 trillion U.S. national debt.

CHOPPY WATERS

Ryan referred to white-water rafting to describe how the tax overhaul effort is entering its toughest phase.

“We’ve been going through Class 3 rapids, which is a pleasant ride. It’s nice. Everybody pretty much stays in the boat and it’s pretty good. But we’re about to go through Class 5 rapids, which is the biggest rapid you can go through,” he said.

He called on Republicans to hold tight as details are hammered out. “We’ve got to make sure that everybody stays in the boat and we get the boat down the river,” Ryan said.

He dismissed concerns that tax cuts could expand the federal deficit. “We don’t anticipate a big deficit effect from this tax reform because we will broaden the base and lower the rates, plug loopholes and get faster economic growth.”

Republicans intend to pay for their proposed cuts in part by broadening the tax base. That would require discarding trillions of dollars of tax deductions, loopholes and other breaks, each one protected by powerful interests.

If lobbyists succeed in protecting such tax breaks, lawmakers would be looking at less revenue to offset the tax cuts, raising the risk of higher deficits and debt that could undermine long-term economic growth.

DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT?

Ryan has previously said he wants the House to pass the tax bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. He predicted on Wednesday that some Democratic lawmakers would back the tax plan.

“At the end of the day, I do believe some Democrats will end up voting for this thing,” Ryan said. “It’s hard for me to see why - no matter what party you’re from - you’d want to vote against this.”

Slideshow (3 Images)

At least some Democratic support could end up being needed in the Senate, where Republicans hold only a 52-48 majority. Party dissent in the Senate led to Republicans’ failure this summer to push through an overhaul of the healthcare system that Trump and the party leadership had pushed for.

Ryan, from Wisconsin, blamed Democrats for the lack of bipartisanship in Washington. Republicans are drafting the tax legislation on their own.

“I so wish we had Bill Bradley Democrats around these days. We do not have Bill Bradley Democrats. Believe me, I really, really wish we did,” Ryan said, referring to Democratic former Senator Bill Bradley, who played a key bipartisan role in the Reagan tax reform.

Among Republicans, skirmishes around the tax breaks have already begun.

Some Republican lawmakers are resisting a proposal to eliminate a popular deduction for state and local tax payments, which would hit middle-class voters in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.

“You do have to broaden the base in order to lower the rates. And that is what reform is,” Ryan said. “With respect to state and local, I think there’s a way of addressing the concerns that our members have for middle income taxpayers … so that they are net winners in tax reform as well.”

Ryan also said Republican lawmakers will not take up a bipartisan plan to stabilize Obamacare insurance markets or try again this year to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

The House speaker said he wants Congress to pass legislation to protect illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children but offered no timetable.

Asked about strong denunciations of Trump this week by two Republican senators, Ryan said people should “settle their differences personally” rather than in public.

He also urged the Department of Justice to immediately give Congress documents related to the funding of a dossier on Trump during the presidential campaign.",Ryan says Republican tax plan must speed through choppy waters: Reuters interview,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-tax-ryan/ryan-says-republican-tax-plan-must-speed-through-choppy-waters-reuters-interview-idUKKBN1CU2QL?il=0

While falling short of the strong growth rates enjoyed by euro zone countries earlier this year, British economic growth picked up to 0.4 percent in the July-September period from 0.3 percent in the second quarter, official data showed on Wednesday.

Sterling climbed almost a full percentage point against the U.S. dollar on the figures, which beat the average forecast for growth of 0.3 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.

British five-year government bond yields also rose to their highest since last year’s vote to leave the European Union as markets anticipated a quicker pace of BoE rate rises next year.

Britain performed much better than most economists expected immediately after last year’s vote to leave the European Union, and it was one of the fastest-growing major advanced economies in 2016.

But it slipped to the bottom of the pack earlier this year, posting its worst first-half performance since 2012, largely due to higher inflation caused by the pound’s fall after the Brexit vote, at a time when its peers have enjoyed robust growth,

While Wednesday’s figures are a small boost for under-pressure finance minister Philip Hammond ahead of his November budget, they do not alter the broad picture of an economy dogged by poor productivity and squeezed living standards.

“Despite the weak outlook, the Bank of England will now almost certainly raise the Bank Rate by 25 basis points ... on 2nd November,” said Daniel Vernazza, chief UK economist at UniCredit.

Financial markets nudged up the chance of a move to nearly 90 percent from just over 80 percent before the data.

Last month the BoE said Wednesday’s preliminary data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) was likely to show 0.3 percent growth, though it might be stronger due to improving consumer demand.

In the past, Britain’s economy typically grew by 0.5-0.6 percent a quarter but the BoE and other economists have indicated that the sustainable growth rate may have fallen.

The change last year to a Department of Defense manual on procedures governing its intelligence activities was made possible by a decades-old presidential executive order, bypassing congressional and court review.

The new manual, released in August 2016, now permits the collection of information about Americans for counterintelligence purposes “when no specific connection to foreign terrorist(s) has been established,” according to training slides created last year by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI).

The slides were obtained by Human Rights Watch through a Freedom of Information Act request about the use of federal surveillance laws for counter-drug or immigration purposes and shared exclusively with Reuters.

The Air Force and the Department of Defense told Reuters that the documents are authentic.

The slides list the shooting attacks in San Bernardino, California, in December 2015 and Orlando, Florida, in June 2016 as examples that would fall under the ""homegrown violent extremist"" category. The shooters had declared fealty to Islamic State shortly before or during the attacks, but investigators found no actual links to the organization that has carried out shootings and bombings of civilians worldwide.

Michael Mahar, the Department of Defense’s senior intelligence oversight official, said in an interview that AFOSI and other military counterintelligence agencies are allowed to investigate both active duty and U.S. civilian personnel as long as there is a potential case connected to the military. Investigations of civilians are carried out cooperatively with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mahar said.

Executive order 12333, signed by former President Ronald Reagan in 1981 and later modified by former President George W. Bush, establishes how U.S. intelligence agencies such as the CIA are allowed to pursue foreign intelligence investigations. The order also allows surveillance of U.S. citizens in certain cases, including for activities defined as counterintelligence.

Under the previous Defense Department manual’s definition of counterintelligence activity, which was published in 1982, the U.S. government was required to demonstrate a target was working on behalf of the goals of a foreign power or terrorist group.

It was not clear what practical effect the expanded definition might have on how the U.S. government gathers intelligence. One of the Air Force slides described the updated interpretation as among several “key changes.”

‘CLOAK OF DARKNESS’

However, some former U.S. national security officials, who generally support giving agents more counterterrorism tools but declined to be quoted, said the change appeared to be a minor adjustment that was unlikely to significantly impact intelligence gathering.

Some privacy and civil liberties advocates who have seen the training slides disagreed, saying they were alarmed by the change because it could increase the number of U.S. citizens who can be monitored under an executive order that lacks sufficient oversight.

“What happens under 12333 takes place under a cloak of darkness,” said Sarah St. Vincent, a surveillance researcher with Human Rights Watch who first obtained the documents. “We have enormous programs potentially affecting people in the United States and abroad, and we would never know about these changes” without the documents, she said.

The National Security Act, a federal law adopted 70 years ago, states that Congress must be kept informed about significant intelligence activities. But the law leaves the interpretation of that to the executive branch.

The updated interpretation was motivated by recognition that some people who may pose a security threat do not have specific ties to a group such as Islamic State or Boko Haram, Mahar at the Defense Department said.

“The internet and social media has made it easier for terrorist groups to radicalize followers without establishing direct contact,” Mahar said.

“We felt that we needed the flexibility to target those individuals,” he said.

In August 2016, during the final months of former President Barack Obama’s administration, a Pentagon press release announced that the department had updated its intelligence collecting procedures but it made no specific reference to “homegrown violent extremists.”

The revision was signed off by the Department of Justice’s senior leadership, including the attorney general, and reviewed by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a government privacy watchdog.

Mahar said that “homegrown violent extremist,” while listed in the Air Force training slide, is not an official phrase used by the Defense Department. It does not have a specific list of traits or behaviors that would qualify someone for monitoring under the new definition, Mahar said.

Hunches or intuition are not enough to trigger intelligence gathering, Mahar said, adding that a “reasonable belief” that a target may be advancing the goals of an international terrorist group to harm the United States is required.

The updated Defense Department manual refers to any target “reasonably believed to be acting for, or in furtherance of, the goals or objectives of an international terrorist or international terrorist organization, for purposes harmful to the national security of the United States.”

Mahar said that in counterterrorism investigations, federal surveillance laws, including the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, continue to govern electronic surveillance in addition to the limitations detailed in his department’s manual.",Exclusive: U.S. widens surveillance to include 'homegrown violent extremists' - documents,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-surveillance-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-widens-surveillance-to-include-homegrown-violent-extremists-documents-idUKKBN1CU1H6

A disaster destroys in hours infrastructure that took decades to build. Millions of people lose the services that separate a middle-class suburb from an impoverished slum – clean water, sewers, power, hospitals, roads. And Maria was the strongest storm to strike the area in 80 years.

Meanwhile, the media tends to focus on drama and controversy. They often overplay the story via anecdotal reporting (“Here’s Mrs. Hernandez without electricity,” says the reporter [pause], “with no help in sight”) and underplay the work being done, especially at the beginning of the response where progress is hard to see. First responders on laptops methodically solving supply problems are not very mediagenic, after all.

At the moment of any disaster, needs are at 100 percent while the response is at a zero point. The response starts in deficit. It always looks grim, especially to participants and outside observers unfamiliar with the process. They want what is a marathon to play out like a sprint.

In dealing with a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military follow a standard playbook. I know, I worked with both on and off for two decades while with the State Department. I trained with them, and was on the ground for relief efforts after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (more than 6,000 dead) and 2004 Asian tsunami (280,000 dead.) I worked the Washington DC-end of many other disasters. I read after-action reporting from 20-30 other such events.

The critical initial step is a needs assessment, from which everything else flows. Everyone wants to jump in and do something, but responders need time to visit sites, confer with local officials, and determine what is needed and where the needs are greatest. It is a slow process in a chaotic environment, delayed by weather, roads, and communications. From the outside it can look like nothing is being done; Mrs. Hernandez still doesn’t have electricity even as helicopters are flying around, apparently ignoring her!

The needs assessment gets the right help to the right places in order of priority. As an example, I was part of a liaison team with the American Navy at Phuket, Thailand following the Asian tsunami of 2005. Without any local input, the U.S. first helicopters brought in huge fresh water bladders. It turned out most of the water was unneeded; the city had warehouses full of the bottled version.

It took a day for us to track down, but the most urgent need the Navy could address was a buildup of medical waste at local hospitals. Waste pre-disaster was trucked out daily; the tsunami wrecked the roads, and so boxes of soiled bandages and infected sharps accumulated. When American resources turned to help dispose of that, hospitals were able to run at peak capacity. Lives were saved. The water bladders lay abandoned in parking lots around town.

Other decisions that can flow from a needs assessment might include restoring power to one school to shelter 50 families before fixing 50 individual homes. It can mean blocking people from calling internationally so limited cell capacity can be directed to local emergency calls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, set as a priority reopening dialysis centers across Puerto Rico. Somebody else didn’t get helped first to make that possible.

At the early-to-intermediate stages of a disaster response people in less affected areas will wait in long lines for supplies. It looks bad on TV, but can actually mean the system is working, as help was directed to a higher priority. It takes good reporting to know if that’s the case. Instead, progress is often too quickly defined as “make everything back to the way it was before the storm.”

The military plays a key role in disaster response. The problem is Americans are conditioned to believe there are unlimited resources of all types, instantly movable across notable distances.

Military units tend to have war fighting as their primary job, and most are somewhere doing that, or training to do that. Shifting to a disaster mission can happen quickly but not instantly. It’s also essential to gather people with the right skills – electrical engineers, teams that desalinate sea water for drinking, and sewage crews (3.4 million people’s waste festering with fecal-borne disease is a dreaded secondary killer in this disaster.)

Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant. Unlike Texas or Florida, no one can self-evacuate, by car or even on foot. Same for incoming aid. Everything must travel by plane, or, more likely, ship.

Puerto Ricans now need some two million gallons of fresh water a day. A gallon weighs about eight pounds, so that’s 16 million pounds of water. A C-130 cargo plane can carry some 42,000 pounds. So that’s 380 flights a day, every day, just for water. There are bigger aircraft, but the bottom line is always the same: you simply have to move the epic quantities required to respond to an epic island disaster by ship to a port, then inland by truck.

That last step, moving supplies from a port (or airport) to those who need them is known as the “last mile” problem. It haunts every disaster response.

Success with the last mile depends on local infrastructure. If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response. Next comes the need for trucks, fuel for those trucks, drivers, security, and personnel and equipment to offload the ships and load the vehicles. If you’re missing one link in the chain, the aid does not move.

These are tough realities, not excuses for why more hasn’t been done for desperate people. It can be a complex, methodical process, addressing a single problem (get water to that village) as a cascading string of nested problems. While the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s remark that Puerto Rico relief is the “most logistically challenging event” the United States has ever faced seems exaggerated, it does underscore the size of the job at hand.

So don’t be distracted by the apocalyptic tweets between Trump and his critics; they exist independent of the ground truth. Because while no response is ever fast and robust enough, the systemic breakdowns that hit New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have largely been fixed, well-before Trump even took office.

Responses are always imperfect; lack of drinking water remains a critical issue. The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas. For Harvey, the death toll was at least 70, Irma 72. Katrina saw 1,836 fatalities with over 700 people still missing.

But a tipping point will take place, where adequate services are restored and people will start to receive the help they need. Problems will reduce from regions without power to villages without power to an isolated home without power. The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico. Everything else right now seems to be just Twitter wars.","Commentary: For hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, an insider’s guide to disaster management",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-disaster-commentary/commentary-for-hurricane-hit-puerto-rico-an-insiders-guide-to-disaster-management-idUSKCN1C805X

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Domino, who for a while was mistakenly thought to have been killed when Hurricane Katrina devastated his New Orleans neighborhood in 2005, died at home on Tuesday of natural causes, the Jefferson Parish Coroner’s Office said.

As one of the pioneers of rock ‘n’ roll in the 1950s, Domino sold 65 million records - more than anyone in that period except Elvis Presley, according to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

He had dozens of songs on the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts, including “Blueberry Hill,” “Ain’t That a Shame,” “Blue Monday,” “I‘m Walkin’,” “Whole Lotta Loving,” “Hello, Josephine,” “Walking to New Orleans,” “I‘m Gonna Be a Wheel Some Day” and “Let the Four Winds Blow.”

“For lack of a better way of putting it, he’s a living, walking legend among us in New Orleans,” singer Irma Thomas told the New York Times in 2007. “Between him and Louis Armstrong, they were the first big names to put us on the musical map.”

Antoine Dominique Domino was born on Feb. 26, 1928 in New Orleans and one of nine children. A brother-in-law taught him piano, leading to a style that mixed the classic New Orleans sound with blues, country and Cajun music. He was performing in nightclubs while still a teenager and soon teamed with trumpet player Dave Bartholomew, who would become his co-writer and producer and help refine his piano style.

His nickname was attributed to his short, squatty stature, as well as a tribute to two other pianists - Fats Waller and New Orleans native Fats Pichon.

Like contemporaries Little Richard and Chuck Berry, Domino was a black performer whose music crossed over to white audiences and helped shape early rock.

His first hit was an R&B song, the autobiographical “The Fat Man,” recorded in 1949 and considered among the first songs in the rock ‘n’ roll genre.

Also like Little Richard, one of his biggest hits, “Ain’t That a Shame,” was later recorded by Pat Boone, a white singer, whose version received more radio airplay. A live version of the song by the rock band Cheap Trick was a hit in 1978.

Domino would be a huge influence on rockers who came after him - John Lennon told a New York radio station that “Ain’t That a Shame” was the first song he learned to play - but his prominence began to wane after the British invasion and other forms of rock took root in the 1960s.

Harry Connick Jr., from a later generation of New Orleans musicians, said on Twitter, “You helped pave the way for New Orleans piano players... see you on top of that blueberry hill in the sky.” Guitarist Vernon Reid of the band Living Color mourned Domino’s death by tweeting, “Rock & Roll lost part of it’s soul.”

In his later years Domino was reluctant to perform and rarely left his beloved hometown, but he did go to Indianola, Mississippi, in 2015 to play “Amazing Grace” at B.B. King’s funeral.

Domino was a longtime resident of New Orleans’ Ninth Ward - the section of the city hit hardest by Katrina’s floodwaters - and had resisted early pleas to evacuate as the hurricane approached. For a time he was believed to have died in the flooding and the words “R.I.P. Fats You will be missed” were spray-painted on his house, which was flooded up to the roof.

It was later learned that Domino and his family had been rescued by boat and taken to the refugee center set up at the Superdome in the city before going to Baton Rouge. They lost most of their possessions in the flood but managed to save Domino’s couch, which was custom-made from the rear end of a vintage pink Cadillac.

After Katrina, he moved to a New Orleans suburb to live with his daughter.

The Recording Industry of America late gave Domino reproductions to replace the 20 gold record awards he lost. His Grammy Awards also were replaced and President George W. Bush visited Domino to give him a new National Medal of the Arts.

Domino titled his 2006 album “Alive and Kickin’” and proceeds went to help rebuild New Orleans and preserve its musical heritage.

In a statement to Reuters, Apple said “Bloomberg’s claim that Apple has reduced the accuracy spec for Face ID is completely false.”

Bloomberg’s report, which cited sources close to people familiar with the situation, said Apple relaxed some of the technical specifications for sensors for the Face ID system, making it faster to test the parts.

A Bloomberg spokeswoman said the company stood behind its report.(bloom.bg/2i3E8CZ)

Apple shares were down 0.7 percent at $155.99 in midday trading.

The Face ID system - among the $999 iPhone X’s most talked-about features - uses a mathematical model of users’ faces to allow them to sign on to their phones or pay for goods with a steady glance at their phones.

Apple has faced a slew of issues with its latest set of phones launched on Sept. 12, with muted demand for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, and media and analyst reports suggesting reduced shipment plans for the iPhone X.

In its statement, Apple said it expects the iPhone X to go on sale as planned on Nov. 3 with the Face ID feature.

With the Republican-controlled Congress’s attempts to roll back laws introduced in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis largely stalled, banks are looking to regulators, particularly the U.S. central bank, to loosen the reins through rule tweaks and more lenient supervision.

Quarles, a former Wall Street lawyer and private equity investor nominated to the Fed by Trump last summer and sworn in this month, will have the most influence in such efforts due to the central bank’s extensive financial oversight powers.

“Normally, when you get a new governor at the Fed, you don’t see anything for a few months,” said Wayne Abernathy, executive vice president at the American Bankers Association and a former colleague of Quarles at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush.

“I think the expectations for Quarles are higher, because there was so much fanfare about the position. He’s going to feel some kind of pressure to show something.”

The Fed declined to comment.

With Quarles on board, banks and analysts expect the Fed to ease aspects of everyday examination and supervision, in particular reducing the number of post-inspection notices demanding fixes to technical compliance issues, ranging from sales practices to outsourcing contracts.

These ‘Matters Requiring Attention’ notices were originally conceived to raise specific concerns but are increasingly being used by watchdogs to police hundreds of activities, bogging down boards and senior managers in paperwork.

The Treasury has also identified several areas where the Fed has unilateral power to ease the liquidity and capital requirements on foreign banks operating in the United States, in some cases by simply deferring to their home rules.

The Fed’s annual stress tests analyzing how a bank would cope with market shocks - known as CCAR - are another key area where Quarles is likely to quickly make his mark.

“Now that Randal Quarles is in place, what we expect is that in fairly short order there will be some modifications to the way the CCAR works, because that is something that can largely be done at the behest of supervision,” Guy Moszkowski, managing partner at financial analyst firm Autonomous Research, told a conference on Tuesday.

STRESS TEST OVERHAUL

Quarles, who turned 60 last month, will be the first vice chair of banking supervision, a role created after the financial crisis but never filled during President Barack Obama’s administration. He will also serve as a Fed governor.

Former Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo effectively ran banking supervision until he stepped down in February, overseeing a strict implementation of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and administering rigorous “stress tests.”

Banks have complained that the testing process, which combines both quantitative and qualitative information, is too opaque, based on overly-conservative assumptions, and insensitive to different business models.

The Fed has indicated it is willing to refine stress tests, but Quarles is expected to push ahead with an overhaul - making the assumptions more generous, giving banks more information on the models, or moving to a less onerous two-year cycle. He is also likely to phase-out the qualitative aspect of the tests which gives the Fed wide-ranging discretion to fail lenders, bank lobbyists said.

The effort will be no cakewalk.

Quarles will be closely scrutinized by Democrats and consumer advocacy groups who are worried that deregulation will allow banks to return to their pre-crisis risky behavior.

Dodd-Frank does not give Quarles extensive unilateral powers, and he will have to get approval from the Fed board for any major changes, such as easing capital rules.

Trump is also expected to name a new Fed chief in the next couple of weeks. The front-runners, current Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford University economist John Taylor, have both said there is a need to reduce the regulatory burden on banks and are expected to support Quarles’ efforts.

But for other measures, including relaxing the Volcker rule, which restricted banks’ ability to trade with their own cash, other regulators will also need to agree.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), currently headed by an Obama-era appointee who has generally opposed rolling back rules, is expected to be a drag on the inter-agency process until a Trump pick is named and confirmed as a replacement, likely this spring. Reaching an agreement even then will be tough, say lawyers, due to the complexity of the rule, which is hundreds of pages long.

Still, those who know Quarles believe he is well-suited in terms of experience and personality to navigate the Fed’s halls of power. They point to his success in helping to negotiate trade deals during his time at the Treasury.

“He isn’t the kind of person that bows to consensus,” said the ABA’s Abernathy. “He’s the type of person who makes consensus.”",Banks rest hopes for lighter regulatory burden on Fed's Quarles,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-quarles/banks-rest-hopes-for-lighter-regulatory-burden-on-feds-quarles-idINKBN1CU30M?il=0

Fourth seed Del Potro will face French qualifier Julien Benneteau in the last 16 at the St Jakobs Hall, where hometown favorite Roger Federer is bidding for an eighth title.

Should he win the title in Basel he would be breathing down the neck of Spain’s Pablo Carreno Busta, currently holding the last of the eight spots heading into the Paris Masters, which takes place next week.

Around five million people cast their ballots in northern Italy, home to the once openly separatist Northern League party. More than 95 percent voted to give regional leaders a mandate to keep more money at home when dealing with matters ranging from justice to infrastructure or education. In Veneto 57 percent of voters turned up, while in Lombardy, home to the Milan financial hub, the turnout was below 40 percent.

Like Catalonia, the two Italian regions are major economic engines. They too complain that the money they pay to the central government in tax is out of proportion with what they get back in services. Lombardy’s local government says the gap amounts to 54 billion euros a year. For Veneto the difference is 15.4 billion euros. Meanwhile, the southern region of Sicily gets 10.6 billion euros more than it paid in, Lombardy says.

Since the referendums were legal but non-binding, the Italian government has no formal obligation to make concessions. And money does not flow in just one direction: the state recently paid 5 billion euros to prop up two failed Veneto-based lenders. But allowing export-driven regions that face global competition to keep a greater share of the resources they bring in should not be a taboo subject.

Italy’s central government will find it difficult to push back. Dismissing the wishes of 10 percent of those eligible to vote in general elections next spring would risk damaging the country’s ruling parties. Contrast that with Catalonia, where demands for independence led to a heavy-handed response from the central government, the dismissal of the region’s leadership, and prompted banks and other companies to shift their headquarters. The Spanish region may yet end up negotiating more autonomy. Italy’s regions will hope to achieve similar results with less damage.",Breakingviews - Italy's north teaches Catalonia a self-rule lesson,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italyy-politics-breakingviews/breakingviews-italys-north-teaches-catalonia-a-self-rule-lesson-idUSKBN1CS1JR

MILANO, 25 ottobre (Reuters) - Veneto Banca, in liquidazione coatta amministrativa, cederà a Trinity, società di investimento gestita da Attestor Capital, la partecipazione di controllo detenuta in Bim lanciando poi un‘Opa sull‘istituto di private banking torinese che sarà ripulito dai crediti deteriorati e ricapitalizzato.

Il prezzo iniziale offerto per il pacchetto di controllo e che sarà lo stesso per l‘Opa, pari a 0,22411 per azione, è decisamente inferiore alle quotazioni di borsa del titolo che quindi crolla a Piazza Affari.

Alle 17,00 circa Bim è in asta di volatilità dopo un ultimo prezzo di 0,61 euro, in calo del 37,56%.

L‘accordo per la cessione dell‘asset più grande rimasto in pancia all‘istituto veneto messo in liquidazione a fine giugno scorso e fuori dal perimetro rilevato (insieme ad alcuni attivi di Pop Vicenza) da Intesa Sanpaolo prevede un iniziale passaggio al fondo britannico di una quota del 68,07% per circa 24,1 milioni di euro.

Successivamente, entro due anni e al verificarsi di determinati eventi previsti dal contratto, Trinity potrà acquistare la rimanente quota del 2,606% in possesso della liquidazione.

Il prezzo potrà subire degli aggiustamenti con un meccanismo di earn-out in funzione degli utili normalizzati al 2021 ma che, nel caso della partecipazione di controllo del 68,8%, non potrà superare i 71,83 milioni, da corrispondere nel 2020.

L‘Opa che sarà lanciata dopo il closing è quindi fissata ad un prezzo unitario di 0,22411 per azione, oltre al corrispettivo derivante dall’earn-out che maturerà successivamente.

Tra gli azionisti rilevanti di Bim figura l‘ex manager Pietro D‘Aguì che detiene azioni per il 9% circa del capitale concesse in pegno a favore di Veneto Banca.

CESSIONE DETERIORATI E AUMENTO CAPITALE PER 121 MLN

Per ottenere il via libera dalle Autorità all‘acquisizione, previsto entro aprile, Trinity si è impegnato a presentare un piano industriale per Bim al 2021 che prevede il deconsolidamento dell‘intero portafoglio dei crediti deteriorati per un valore di libro lordo di circa 633 milioni attraverso una cartolarizzazione e assegnazione gratuita dei titoli junior a tutti i soci Bim.

Il piano prevede inoltre un rafforzamento patrimoniale nel 2018 per un importo complessivo di 121 milioni di euro.

Attestor aveva ottenuto l‘esclusiva per trattare sulla quota di maggioranza di Bim contesa anche dalla compagnia di riassicurazione Barents Re.

Secondo quanto riferito nei giorni scorsi da fonti vicine alla vicenda la scelta sarebbe ricaduta sull‘investment manager londinese, con fondi in gestione per circa 4 miliardi, per le maggiori garanzie offerte e una maggiore coerenza del proprio progetto con il piano industriale di Bim, a fronte di un corrispettivo più alto offerto da Barents.

Quest‘ultimo, sempre secondo le fonti, ha chiesto l‘accesso agli atti relativi alla procedura di vendita puntando ad un eventuale ricorso al Tar. Alla base della contestazione di quest‘ultima la tesi che la procedura di vendita, nell‘ambito della liquidazione della ex popolare sotto il cappello pubblico, non sia stata pienamente concorrenziale e discriminante nel prezzo.

Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni called the five confidence motions to get the package approved quickly despite furious opposition from the anti-system 5-Star Movement and small leftist groups.

All five of the motions, on different articles of the law, garnered comfortable majorities, even though many leftist allies had deserted coalition ranks. The bill has already passed through the lower house. A sixth vote on another article, but which was not the subject of a confidence motion, also passed.

A final vote on the law is scheduled for Thursday morning.

The proposed voting system favors parties that form pre-election coalitions and is backed by the largest parties within Italy’s main centre-left and centre-right blocs. It will penalize groups that want to go it alone, such as 5-Star.

However, opinion polls indicate that the system, which is a mix of proportional representation and first-past-the-post, will not throw up an obvious winner, with the vote split three ways between the left, right and 5-Star.

A YouTrend survey for AGI newsagency said on Wednesday that none of the three main groups would get “anywhere near an absolute majority of seats”.

It said the only way for this to happen would be for one bloc to win more than 40 percent of the vote, adding this would trigger a landslide. At present, none of the three political groups are seen winning support of more than 33 percent.

Five-Star has denounced the reform as “an institutional coup d‘etat” and senators from the group closed their eyes, or put on a blindfold as they voted “no” in the Senate.

Hundreds of their supporters filled a central Rome square to denounce the bill, chanting “honesty” and waving party flags.

“This is a fraudulent law for people here. It ignores voting rights and instead favors amalgamations and hookups,” said Rossano Cioccolini, 56, a worker from the northern city of Milan who took a day of holiday to join the Rome rally.

“The largest party in Italy, 5-Star, will not get a look in because it doesn’t accept alliances,” he added.

The use of multiple confidence motions first in the lower house and now in the Senate has allowed the ruling centre-left coalition to truncate discussion on the bill and sidestep dozens of secret votes that could have allowed disillusioned lawmakers to betray their camp and ambush the bill.

The government says the new law is needed to harmonize the electoral system for the upper and lower houses and reduce the risk of different majorities materializing in the two chambers. Previous attempts at reform this past year have all failed.

The Republican plan would cut taxes for businesses and people by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, according to independent analysts.

He predicted on Wednesday that some Democratic lawmakers would back the tax plan.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday that a sweeping Republican tax-cut plan is entering its toughest phase yet as lobbyists swarm Congress to try to protect valuable tax breaks.

Urging lawmakers to move quickly on the plan, Ryan said in an interview with Reuters that speedy action would prevent the legislation getting bogged down and deliver sooner the economic growth that Republicans expect from it.

“K Street,” as Washington’s lobbying industry is known after the downtown street where much of it is based, will soon descend on Capitol Hill to defend tax benefits for companies and other special interests, said Ryan, the top Republican in Congress.

”When the details come, that is when you’re going to see K Street coming to Congress. And that’s why this hasn’t been done for 31 years,” said Ryan, looking back to the country’s last major tax code overhaul under President Ronald Reagan in 1986.

While the broad parameters of the Republican plan, backed by President Donald Trump, have been made public, detailed legislation is not expected to be revealed until next week.

Securing passage by Congress of the tax plan would give Trump his first major legislative win since he took office in January. Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress and are under pressure to deliver on their election campaign promises. Final action on taxes is at least weeks away.

The Republican plan would cut taxes for businesses and people by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, according to independent analysts.

It calls for reducing the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and setting a lower rate for smaller businesses, as well as cutting taxes for individuals and allowing larger deductions for families.

Democrats have called it a gift to the rich and to corporate America that would cause the federal deficit to balloon and add to the $20 trillion U.S. national debt.

CHOPPY WATERS

Ryan referred to white-water rafting to describe how the tax overhaul effort is entering its toughest phase.

“We’ve been going through Class 3 rapids, which is a pleasant ride. It’s nice. Everybody pretty much stays in the boat and it’s pretty good. But we’re about to go through Class 5 rapids, which is the biggest rapid you can go through,” he said.

He called on Republicans to hold tight as details are hammered out. “We’ve got to make sure that everybody stays in the boat and we get the boat down the river,” Ryan said.

He dismissed concerns that tax cuts could expand the federal deficit. “We don’t anticipate a big deficit effect from this tax reform because we will broaden the base and lower the rates, plug loopholes and get faster economic growth.”

Republicans intend to pay for their proposed cuts in part by broadening the tax base. That would require discarding trillions of dollars of tax deductions, loopholes and other breaks, each one protected by powerful interests.

If lobbyists succeed in protecting such tax breaks, lawmakers would be looking at less revenue to offset the tax cuts, raising the risk of higher deficits and debt that could undermine long-term economic growth.

DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT?

Ryan has previously said he wants the House to pass the tax bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. He predicted on Wednesday that some Democratic lawmakers would back the tax plan.

“At the end of the day, I do believe some Democrats will end up voting for this thing,” Ryan said. “It’s hard for me to see why - no matter what party you’re from - you’d want to vote against this.”

Slideshow (3 Images)

At least some Democratic support could end up being needed in the Senate, where Republicans hold only a 52-48 majority. Party dissent in the Senate led to Republicans’ failure this summer to push through an overhaul of the healthcare system that Trump and the party leadership had pushed for.

Ryan, from Wisconsin, blamed Democrats for the lack of bipartisanship in Washington. Republicans are drafting the tax legislation on their own.

“I so wish we had Bill Bradley Democrats around these days. We do not have Bill Bradley Democrats. Believe me, I really, really wish we did,” Ryan said, referring to Democratic former Senator Bill Bradley, who played a key bipartisan role in the Reagan tax reform.

Among Republicans, skirmishes around the tax breaks have already begun.

Some Republican lawmakers are resisting a proposal to eliminate a popular deduction for state and local tax payments, which would hit middle-class voters in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.

“You do have to broaden the base in order to lower the rates. And that is what reform is,” Ryan said. “With respect to state and local, I think there’s a way of addressing the concerns that our members have for middle income taxpayers … so that they are net winners in tax reform as well.”

Ryan also said Republican lawmakers will not take up a bipartisan plan to stabilize Obamacare insurance markets or try again this year to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

The House speaker said he wants Congress to pass legislation to protect illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children but offered no timetable.

Asked about strong denunciations of Trump this week by two Republican senators, Ryan said people should “settle their differences personally” rather than in public.

He also urged the Department of Justice to immediately give Congress documents related to the funding of a dossier on Trump during the presidential campaign.",Ryan says Republican tax plan must speed through choppy waters: Reuters interview,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tax-ryan/ryan-says-republican-tax-plan-must-speed-through-choppy-waters-reuters-interview-idUSKBN1CU1T0

Odinga spoke shortly after the Supreme Court said it was unable to consider a last-minute appeal to delay the vote after five out of seven judges failed to turn up.

The Supreme Court ordered the repeat election after annulling an Aug. 8 presidential vote, which Odinga lost, on procedural grounds.

He is refusing to participate in Thursday’s contest because he says the election commission has failed to implement reforms to prevent it being, once again, marred by irregularities.

“We advise Kenyans who value democracy and justice to hold vigil and prayers away from polling stations, or just stay at home,” he told a cheering crowd in Nairobi’s Uhuru Park, backing away from previous promise to call large-scale protests.

“Convince your friends, neighbours and everyone else not participate,” he said in English. If they support the president, he cautioned: “do not insult or assault them. Instead, seek to open their eyes.”

But several speakers who preceded him gave speeches in KiSwahili calling on opposition supporters not to allow people to vote.

The repeat election was ordered by the Supreme Court on Sept. 1 after judges nullified the results of the Aug. 8 presidential contest on procedural grounds. The election commission had said Odinga lost to President Uhuru Kenyatta by 1.4 million votes.

With the Supreme Court unable to hear petitions to delay the vote, election officials said it would go ahead, regardless of Odinga’s decision.

Seeking to explain the Supreme Court’s absences, Chief Justice David Maraga said one judge was unwell, another was abroad and another was unable to attend after her bodyguard was shot and wounded on Tuesday night. It was unclear why the others did not show up.

“ENTITLED TO REBEL”

Minutes after Maraga’s remarks on live television, hundreds of supporters took to the streets of Kisumu, Odinga’s main stronghold. Riot police used teargas to disperse them. Two protesters received gunshot wounds, a Reuters witness said.

“If the government subverts the sovereign will of the people ... then people are entitled to rebel against this government,” Kisumu governor Anyang Nyong‘o, a hardline Odinga supporter, told reporters.

Such comments seem certain to fuel fears of a major confrontation with security forces, already blamed for killing nearly 50 people in Kisumu and Nairobi slums after the cancelled August vote.

Months of political uncertainty have blunted growth in Kenya, East Africa’s biggest economy and a key Western ally valued for its relative freedom and stability in a tumultuous region.

Kenyatta is keen for the poll to proceed to cement his rule.

“Many wonder when or if ever all this politicking will end,” he said in a televised speech on Wednesday evening. “I call to each and every one of us to turn out once again and vote.”

For some citizens, the instability has rekindled memories of large-scale ethnic violence that killed 1,200 people following a disputed election in 2007.

Shoppers crammed into Nairobi’s upmarket Carrefour supermarket to stock up on food, said Jason Straziuso, who had to wait nearly two hours to pay for his groceries.

“There was about 40 carts per register, everyone was jockeying for position trying to find the shortest line,” he said. “Every single cart was as full as it could be.”

Single mother Marian Elema said she had paid double the usual bus fare for to take her five children to her home town Isiolo, in central Kenya, because she feared violence would break out in the port city of Mombasa where they live.

“I decided to travel home to escape possible clashes between opposition supporters and police,” she told Reuters. “I am not here to vote but for the safety of my children.”

CHALLENGES BREWING

In Kisumu’s tallying centre, election officer John Ngutai sat huddled with a handful of other officials, waiting for missing election material and hundreds of absent colleagues.

He said attacks by opposition supporters last week meant the election board had only managed to train 250 out of 1,300 staff needed to hold the election in his constituency.

“Our trainings were disrupted and officials attacked, so some people withdrew,” he said.

The head of the national election board, Wafula Chebukati, said the vote would proceed even if some polling stations were unable to open. “In cases where there will be problems (delivering materials) ... the polling officer will have the right to inform us and polling can be suspended to another day.”

Even if the election goes ahead, the opposition might still challenge the result in the Supreme Court. Judges said they were prepared to annul the re-run, and send the country of 45 million back to square one, if the election does not meet the required standards.

In a ruling early on Wednesday, High Court Judge George Odunga said some local election officials had been appointed in an irregular manner, but to withdraw them at the last minute would only make an already dire situation worse.

”For the elections to proceed in the absence of the said officers would in my view be a constitutional crisis of unimaginable magnitude. Simply put, it would be a recipe for chaos.”

However, he admitted that not dismissing them could form the grounds for legal challenges afterwards.

Opposition lawyers seeking to challenge Thursday’s vote might also cite the failure of the election board to hold elections in all parts of the country, if enough polling stations are unable to open.

The constitution does not stipulate a minimum turnout, but says the election should be held at the same time in all parts of the country.","Kenya opposition leader urges vote boycott, civil disobedience",https://in.reuters.com/article/kenya-election/kenya-opposition-leader-urges-vote-boycott-civil-disobedience-idINKBN1CU10F

Several shareholders said this week that by agreeing to hand Tanzania 50 percent of the “economic benefits” from Acacia’s three gold mines in the East African country, Barrick may have set the baseline for what nations may demand from global mining companies, possibly slowing mine development.

Barrick, which owns 63.9 percent of Acacia, reached a framework deal last week with Tanzania under which Acacia would hand the state a 16 percent stake in each of its three in-country mines, part of the economic benefits, including taxes and royalties, that would go to the government. Acacia would also pay the government $300 million (£226.4 million).

“The 50 percent is not a good precedent by any means for a very risky business,” said Chris Mancini, an analyst at Gabelli Gold Fund, which owns shares in Barrick.

Miners would generally want more than half the profits from mines to give them the incentive to build operations in geopolitically risky parts of the world, Mancini said.

“They are disincentivising development. Barrick’s really imperiling the rest of their operations. They are imperiling the industry,” he said.

Barrick, which is the world’s biggest gold producer and has operations on five continents, said the proposed agreement complies with Tanzania’s new mining law, which requires the government to hold a stake in mining operations.

“That is not a concession, that is complying with the law,” Barrick spokesman Andy Lloyd said.

Tanzania was long seen as one of Africa’s brightest mining prospects but new laws have slowed fresh investment amid government efforts to claim a larger slice of the pie.

It has accused Acacia of understating its gold shipments, serving it with a $190 billion bill for unpaid taxes and halting most of its exports.

Barrick “are showing a willingness to cave to ridiculous demands,” said another Barrick shareholder who declined to be identified due to company policy.

Lloyd said the alternative to an agreement, which requires Acacia’s approval, would be lengthy international arbitration. Barrick believed a partnership with the government would “deliver better outcomes and greater stability for shareholders in the long run,” he said.

Barrick also owns mines in the Dominican Republic and Papua New Guinea, considered higher risk by investors. It has been teaming up with partners, as seen at its Veladero mine in Argentina and the Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea, to reduce risks.

The settlement with Tanzania comes at a time of rising so-called “resource nationalism,” notably in countries such as Indonesia and Tanzania, in which host governments seek a bigger financial cut from mines.

Some Barrick investors voiced confidence in the company.

Barrick would likely walk away from a deal if it was too onerous or set an “unwanted” precedent, said Joe Foster, portfolio manager at Van Eck Associates, Barrick’s biggest shareholder. “The company has shown a discipline to the bottom line that I believe they will respect,” Foster said.

And some investors said both mining companies and shareholders should get used to such demands from host nations.

“Some of the richest deposits are in some of the more difficult jurisdictions. It is something you have to be able to deal with and handicap as an investor,” said Dan Denbow, senior portfolio manager at USAA Investments, another Barrick shareholder.

He added that handing over 40 percent to 50 percent of economic benefits to a host government “is not that unusual.”",Barrick Gold's Tanzania deal may set expensive precedent - shareholders,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-barrick-gold-acacia-shareholders/barrick-golds-tanzania-deal-may-set-expensive-precedent-shareholders-idUKKBN1CU2J6

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

In September, U.S. officials ordered Kaspersky’s products removed from government computers, saying the firm was vulnerable to Kremlin influence and that using the software could jeopardize national security.

After that announcement, the Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 5 that hackers working for the Russian government appeared to have targeted a National Security Agency (NSA) worker by using Kaspersky software to identify classified files in 2015. The New York Times reported on Oct. 10 that Israeli officials reported the operation to the United States after they hacked into Kaspersky's network.

The Russian government has denied any involvement.

Kaspersky began an internal inquiry in a bid to restore trust. On Wednesday, it said it had stumbled on the code in 2014 when the consumer version of its popular software flagged a zip file as malicious on a U.S. computer.

While reviewing the file’s contents, a Kaspersky analyst discovered it contained the source code for a hacking tool later attributed to what Kaspersky calls the Equation Group. The software removed the file and the analyst reported the matter to Chief Executive Eugene Kaspersky, who ordered that the copy of the code be destroyed, the company said.

Kaspersky said it assumed the 2014 source code episode was connected to the NSA’s loss of files described in media reports.

“We deleted the archive because we don’t need the source code to improve our protection technologies and because of concerns regarding the handling of classified materials,” said Kaspersky spokeswoman Sarah Kitsos.

Source code, which is normally hidden and gives instructions to computers, would have posed no danger to the Kaspersky customer.

Former employees told Reuters in July that the company had on rare occasions removed uninfected files. Kaspersky spokeswoman Yuliya Shlychkova on Wednesday said removals of such uninfected material happen “extremely rarely.”

Kaspersky said no third parties saw the code, though the media reports said the spy tool had ended up in the hands of the Russian government.

Kaspersky denied the Journal’s report that its programs searched for keywords including “top secret.”

The company said it found no evidence that it had been hacked by Russian spies or anyone except the Israelis, though it suggested others could have obtained the tools by hacking into the American’s computer through a back door it later spotted there.

The NSA declined to comment on Kaspersky’s review.

The new 2014 date of the incident is of interest because Kaspersky only announced its discovery of an espionage campaign by the Equation Group in February 2015. At that time, Reuters cited former NSA employees who said that Equation Group was an NSA project.

Kaspersky’s Equation Group report was one of its most celebrated findings, since it indicated that the group could infect firmware on most computers. That gave the NSA almost undetectable presence.

Shlychkova said the American machine’s files were found before the big Equation Group announcement but after Kaspersky had discovered Equation software on a machine in the Middle East. She said that occurred in March 2014.

Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who led calls in the U.S. Congress to purge Kaspersky products from federal government networks, on Wednesday sent a letter to DHS acting Secretary Elaine Duke and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, urging the U.S. government to declassify information about Kaspersky products.

The step was necessary, Shaheen wrote, “to allow the American people to make informed decisions about risks to their privacy and security.”

Also on Tuesday, Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill sent a separate letter to DHS asking what was being done to ensure federal agencies were complying with the ban on Kaspersky products.

Kaspersky’s consumer anti-virus software has won high marks from reviewers.

The company said Monday it would submit the source code of its software and future updates for inspection by independent parties.",Kaspersky says it obtained suspected NSA hacking code from U.S. computer,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-kaspersky-russia/kaspersky-says-it-obtained-suspected-nsa-hacking-code-from-u-s-computer-idUKKBN1CU0TN

Ryan has previously said he wants the House to pass the tax bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.
He predicted on Wednesday that some Democratic lawmakers would back the tax plan.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday that a sweeping Republican tax-cut plan is entering its toughest phase yet as lobbyists swarm Congress to try to protect valuable tax breaks.

Urging lawmakers to move quickly on the plan, Ryan said in an interview with Reuters that speedy action would prevent the legislation getting bogged down and deliver sooner the economic growth that Republicans expect from it.

“K Street,” as Washington’s lobbying industry is known after the downtown street where much of it is based, will soon descend on Capitol Hill to defend tax benefits for companies and other special interests, said Ryan, the top Republican in Congress.

”When the details come, that is when you’re going to see K Street coming to Congress. And that’s why this hasn’t been done for 31 years,” said Ryan, looking back to the country’s last major tax code overhaul under President Ronald Reagan in 1986.

While the broad parameters of the Republican plan, backed by President Donald Trump, have been made public, detailed legislation is not expected to be revealed until next week.

Securing passage by Congress of the tax plan would give Trump his first major legislative win since he took office in January. Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress and are under pressure to deliver on their election campaign promises. Final action on taxes is at least weeks away.

The Republican plan would cut taxes for businesses and people by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, according to independent analysts.

It calls for reducing the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and setting a lower rate for smaller businesses, as well as cutting taxes for individuals and allowing larger deductions for families.

Democrats have called it a gift to the rich and to corporate America that would cause the federal deficit to balloon and add to the $20 trillion U.S. national debt.

CHOPPY WATERS

Ryan referred to white-water rafting to describe how the tax overhaul effort is entering its toughest phase.

“We’ve been going through Class 3 rapids, which is a pleasant ride. It’s nice. Everybody pretty much stays in the boat and it’s pretty good. But we’re about to go through Class 5 rapids, which is the biggest rapid you can go through,” he said.

He called on Republicans to hold tight as details are hammered out. “We’ve got to make sure that everybody stays in the boat and we get the boat down the river,” Ryan said.

He dismissed concerns that tax cuts could expand the federal deficit. “We don’t anticipate a big deficit effect from this tax reform because we will broaden the base and lower the rates, plug loopholes and get faster economic growth.”

Republicans intend to pay for their proposed cuts in part by broadening the tax base. That would require discarding trillions of dollars of tax deductions, loopholes and other breaks, each one protected by powerful interests.

If lobbyists succeed in protecting such tax breaks, lawmakers would be looking at less revenue to offset the tax cuts, raising the risk of higher deficits and debt that could undermine long-term economic growth.

DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT?

Ryan has previously said he wants the House to pass the tax bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. He predicted on Wednesday that some Democratic lawmakers would back the tax plan.

“At the end of the day, I do believe some Democrats will end up voting for this thing,” Ryan said. “It’s hard for me to see why - no matter what party you’re from - you’d want to vote against this.”

At least some Democratic support could end up being needed in the Senate, where Republicans hold only a 52-48 majority. Party dissent in the Senate led to Republicans’ failure this summer to push through an overhaul of the healthcare system that Trump and the party leadership had pushed for.

Ryan, from Wisconsin, blamed Democrats for the lack of bipartisanship in Washington. Republicans are drafting the tax legislation on their own.

“I so wish we had Bill Bradley Democrats around these days. We do not have Bill Bradley Democrats. Believe me, I really, really wish we did,” Ryan said, referring to Democratic former Senator Bill Bradley, who played a key bipartisan role in the Reagan tax reform.

Among Republicans, skirmishes around the tax breaks have already begun.

Some Republican lawmakers are resisting a proposal to eliminate a popular deduction for state and local tax payments, which would hit middle-class voters in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.

“You do have to broaden the base in order to lower the rates. And that is what reform is,” Ryan said. “With respect to state and local, I think there’s a way of addressing the concerns that our members have for middle income taxpayers … so that they are net winners in tax reform as well.”

Ryan also said Republican lawmakers will not take up a bipartisan plan to stabilize Obamacare insurance markets or try again this year to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

The House speaker said he wants Congress to pass legislation to protect illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children but offered no timetable.

Asked about strong denunciations of Trump this week by two Republican senators, Ryan said people should “settle their differences personally” rather than in public.

Davis was addressing confusion caused by Prime Minister Theresa May this week over the exit timetable, but he then stumbled into a new row about when lawmakers would get to vote on a final deal. His department later issued a clarification.

May is seeking a so-called implementation period of around two years after Britain’s exit from the EU in March 2019, during which its access to the EU single market would stay largely unchanged while new arrangements are put in place.

“I would be aiming to get certainly the outlines of it agreed, if we could, in the first quarter (of 2018) ... but it’s a negotiation,” Davis told a parliamentary committee.

Earlier this week May unnerved corporate executives, keen to know the trading rules they will face, by saying any transitional deal would not be agreed until the entire exit agreement was sealed, more likely towards the end of 2018.

Last week EU leaders said at a summit that they would begin preparations to move into “phase two” of the Brexit negotiations in December, a step forward that would allow London to discuss its future trade relationship with the bloc.

Davis said he expected to receive guidance from the EU on its approach to a transitional period by December, and that a deal allowing Britain to maintain conditions similar to the status quo would be struck quickly afterwards.

PARLIAMENTARY VOTE

However, having reassured businesses on the trade deal, Davis then angered lawmakers by suggesting the EU would push negotiations right up to the end of March 2019, meaning parliament might have to vote to approve the exit deal after Britain had already departed the bloc.

Political opponents accused the government of trying to subvert democracy by not giving parliament a proper say.

A spokeswoman for Davis’ department later issued a clarification, saying the government was working to get the final deal agreed by October 2018 and that it intended to give lawmakers a vote before Britain left.

“This morning the Secretary of State (Davis) was asked about hypothetical scenarios. (Chief EU negotiator) Michel Barnier has said he hopes to get the deal agreed by October 2018 and that is our aim as well,” the spokeswoman said.

May is already facing a rough ride in parliament on her minority government’s key piece of Brexit legislation, which is on hold while ministers plow through hundreds of proposed amendments - some of which have enough support to inflict an embarrassing defeat.

“This U-turn exposes another self-created shambles in government over Brexit,” Pat McFadden, an opposition lawmaker, said in a statement issued by the pro-European campaign group Open Britain.

TRADE DEAL DIFFERENCES

Despite Davis’s comments on the transition deal, Britain and the EU remain at odds on the overall timeline of the negotiations, which incorporate a withdrawal deal on the terms of the divorce, the transitional deal, and a future trade deal.

Britain wants to finish everything by the time it leaves in early 2019, while the EU thinks it could take until 2020 to tie up trade terms.

Davis said he believed Britain would be able to seal a trade and customs arrangement by the end of the two-year exit process, adding that it was important to do so to avoid getting trapped in a protracted negotiation.

“It’s not a good position to get into to be still negotiating during such an arrangement,” Davis said. “If we were doing the negotiation during a period of transition, I suspect what we would get offered is a year extension and another year extension, each time paying a fee.”

An EU official said on Tuesday that the EU will only negotiate on the details of a free trade deal after Britain has actually left in March 2019 because the EU’s own laws do not allow it to negotiate trade agreements with its own members.

Asked about this approach, Davis said a trade deal could be signed “a nanosecond” after Britain leaves, implying that he hoped for a more flexible approach from Brussels.","Amid Brexit timetable confusion, UK aims for transition outline by early 2018",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-davis/uk-expects-eu-guidance-on-brexit-transition-deal-by-december-minister-idUKKBN1CU0YD

Benchmark U.S. 10-year note US10YT=RR yields hit a seven-month high of 2.475 percent, buoyed by economic data, recent optimism over progress on tax reform by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and anticipation of a nominee to head the Federal Reserve.

Equities pared losses as yields retreated, following a Fox Business interview with Trump in which he said he was still considering keeping current Fed Chair Janet Yellen in the position. The 10-year last fell 9/32 in price to yield 2.4371 percent.

“It is possible the market may be taking some solace that Yellen is still in the mix,” said Mike Beale, senior managing director at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.

“The market may be saying, maybe one of the more hawkish, (John) Taylor or (Kevin) Warsh, is off the table.”

Low interest rates have been a driving factor in the 8-year bull market, with investors pushed into equities as other lesser-yielding instruments are viewed as unattractive by comparison.

Earnings season so far has been largely positive, with 72.1 percent of the 165 S&P 500 companies that have reported to date topping expectations, matching the average for the past four quarters.

However, with U.S. indexes at record levels, investors have scrutinized earnings to see if they justify stretched valuations.

Also weighing on sentiment: President Trump and the U.S. House of Representatives’ top tax law writer reopened the door on Wednesday to changes in the 401(k) retirement savings program, just days after Trump seemed to rule out such a step.

Ein Ausschuss der EU vertagte am Mittwoch die Entscheidung, während in Berlin die Grünen forderten, bei den Sondierungen über eine Jamaika-Koalition mit Union und FDP das Aus für die Chemikalie zu besiegeln. Die EU-Kommission teilte mit, nach Sichtung der unterschiedlichen Standpunkte der Mitgliedstaaten solle in Kürze ein neuer Termin bestimmt werden.

Die Grünen-Politikerin Katrin Göring-Eckardt verlangte, das Thema bei den Koalitionssondierungen auf die Tagesordnung zu setzen. “Dazu gehört für nicht ob, sondern wie kommt Glyphosat von den Feldern.” Sie sehe die Gefahr, dass die EU-Kommission die Entscheidung an sich ziehen wolle. “Das wollen wir verhindern und deswegen darauf Einfluss nehmen.” Sie regte einen schrittweisen Ausstieg an. Dies könne etwa in öffentlichen Parks und Privatgärten beginnen. Dann müssten aber Agrarflächen folgen.

Über den Einsatz der in der Landwirtschaft weitverbreiteten Chemikalie gibt es Streit zwischen den 28 EU-Staaten. Die Uhr tickt, da die Lizenz nur noch bis Ende des Jahres läuft. Die EU-Kommission pochte zunächst auf eine Verlängerung um zehn Jahre. Nach einem Votum des EU-Parlaments für eine Verlängerung von maximal fünf Jahren änderte die Kommission ihren Vorschlag auf maximal sieben Jahre. Offensichtlich habe die Kommission auch dafür bei den Mitgliedstaaten keine Mehrheit gefunden und die Abstimmung deshalb verschoben, sagte ein EU-Diplomat.

REGIERUNGEN DEUTSCHLAND UND FRANKREICHS INTERN UNEINS

Um die Verlängerung wird auch deshalb so zäh gerungen, weil es in wichtigen Ländern der Union keine klare Haltung zu Glyphosat gibt. In Deutschland arbeitet nach der Wahl die Bundesregierung nur noch geschäftsführend und muss bei Festlegungen vorsichtig sein. Zudem gibt es Streit zwischen den Ministerien, weshalb man sich bei einer Abstimmung in Brüssel enthalten müsste.

In Frankreich beharrt das Umweltministerium auf eine Übergangszeit von drei Jahren, nach der Glyphosat in der EU vom Markt verschwinden soll. Das Agrarministerium fordert hingegen bis zu sieben Jahre. Ein Kompromiss könnte bei vier Jahren liegen, sagte ein Regierungssprecher in Paris.

Eine Studie der Weltgesundheitsorganisation stuft Glyphosat als wahrscheinlich krebserregend ein. Untersuchungen von europäischen Lebensmittelsicherheits- und Chemiebehörden sowie aus Kanada und Japan bestätigen den Verdacht nicht.

Glyphosat wird seit über 40 Jahren eingesetzt. Der deutsche Bauernverbandspräsident Joachim Rukwied verteidigte den Einsatz und verwies auf strenge Regeln. “Wir dürfen Glyphosat beispielsweise nicht vor der Ernte einsetzen. Wir setzen Glyphosat nur ab und an ein”, sagte er dem Deutschlandfunk. Das Mittel werde nicht jedes Jahr und nicht auf jedem Feld ausgebracht.

Brussels envoys from the 27 EU states that will remain in the bloc after Britain exits on March 29, 2019, met for the first time since EU leaders last week decided not enough progress had been made in talks on the terms of the divorce with Britain to start discussions about future relations yet.

To encourage stronger efforts, EU leaders said they would start preparing now for talks on a transition period so they are ready if enough progress is made by the next summit in December.

“The process will start now, in the sense that we will meet successively... over the coming month,” one EU official involved in the talks said, adding there was likely to be discussion on the subject also during a ministerial meeting on Nov 20.

“We will prepare our thinking on the transition, the future relationship, and the possible additional guidelines for the December European Council,” the official said.

The outcome of the work would likely be presented in the December summit conclusions if leaders decide that enough progress was made on the divorce terms, officials said.

Britain wants an outline agreement with the European Union in place by the end of March 2018 on the transitional arrangements that will apply temporarily after it leaves the bloc, Brexit minister David Davis said on Wednesday.

EU officials said that was a very tough goal, but one that could be achieved if London showed enough willingness.

“It’s not so much if we can do it by the first quarter, but if we can get the UK to engage in a way that makes that possible,” the official said.

Both sides expect a transition period of around two years. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Tuesday said that would mean preserving the status quo as Britain would stay subject to EU laws and courts during that time.

In an interview with Belgium’s L‘Echo newspaper, Barnier said the only difference between full EU membership now and the transition period would be that “the British would no longer take part in decisions on European legislation”.

EU officials said the extra two years of transition would buy time for talks about a future free trade agreement, but poured cold water on the idea of extending the exit negotiations beyond that period with a view to keeping Britain within the EU.

“I don’t think anyone foresees an extension of the existing negotiation period,” the EU official said.

“We’ve already danced around with the UK for so long. First with Cameron. Then their referendum. Now this. It needs to end at some point,” the official said.

CANADA +

Businesses in Britain and in Europe are very concerned by the slow progress in Brexit talks. Not knowing what the future trade agreement between Britain and its biggest trading partner, the EU, will be, some have already started moving staff and operations out of Britain to hedge their bets.

More could follow should no more clarity be given by the two negotiating sides by the end of the year.

Barnier said that Britain could not count on a bespoke trade deal after Brexit and that since it has ruled out following the example of Norway’s relations with the EU it would probably have to model its ties on an arrangement the EU has with Canada.

Non-EU Norway currently pays for access to the bloc’s single market of 500 million people, though it is not part of the same customs union. In exchange, it is also obliged to allow the free movement of people in and out of the EU.

Britain wants to leave both the EU’s internal market and the customs union, meaning a “Canada +” scenario is more likely.

Privately-owned Purdue, which was the subject of a prior U.S. Justice Department probe related to OxyContin a decade ago, said in a statement that it is cooperating with an investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in its home state of Connecticut.

“Purdue is committed to being part of the solution to our nation’s opioid crisis and has been cooperating with the U.S. Attorney’s investigation,” Purdue said. “We will continue to do so until this matter is resolved.”

Tom Carson, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Deirdre Daly in Connecticut, declined to comment. The investigation was first reported by Bloomberg, which said that prosecutors were conducting a criminal probe into Purdue’s marketing of OxyContin.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were involved in more than 33,000 deaths in 2015, the latest year for which data is available. The death rate has continued rising, according to estimates.

Purdue has faced a wave of lawsuits by Louisiana, Washington, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Ohio, Missouri, New Hampshire and South Carolina, as well as several cities and counties. Many of those cases target other drugmakers as well.

The lawsuits have generally accused Stamford, Connecticut Purdue of deceptive marketing of OxyContin and convincing doctors and the public that its drugs had a low-risk of addiction and were effective for treating chronic pain.

The company has denied the allegations and stressed that OxyContin represents less than 2 percent of all opioids nationally.

Purdue and three executives pleaded guilty in 2007 to federal charges related to the misbranding of OxyContin and agreed to pay a total of $634.5 million to resolve a U.S. Justice Department probe.

That year, the company also reached a $19.5 million settlement with 26 states and the District of Columbia. It agreed in 2015 to pay $24 million to resolve a lawsuit by Kentucky.

Particularly since Congress, which is empowered to write American laws, declined to make similar changes to the Obama-era health law when Trump urged legislators to do so, most of the framers of the Constitution would presumably be appalled by these actions. Yet this is not just a problem with the current president. The expansion, and sometimes misuse, of executive power is a result produced in large measure by the framers’ choices to dilute accountability and responsibility in the federal government, and their designing a presidential system in which a minority party can regularly win.

Trump has mounted a two-pronged attack on the ACA following the failure of legislative repeal efforts. First, he issued an order that will weaken the regulations in the ACA requiring private insurance to cover certain essential services. This will allow some consumers to purchase cheaper plans that don’t cover very much. A subset of young and healthy people will have lower premiums, but premiums will shoot up for everyone else, as the market of people buying decent insurance becomes older and sicker. (And, of course, for young people who end up needing expensive medical treatment, what looks like a bargain will turn into a disaster.)

We know exactly how this will play out because Tennessee has used a loophole to allow barebones insurance to be offered to consumers. After weeding out the young and healthy, Tennessee’s market offers among the nation’s highest premiums on its health insurance exchange.

Although Trump’s order has no justification as public policy, it is probably legal. Barack Obama issued numerous executive orders designed to implement the Affordable Care Act, as well as taking aggressive action on issues like immigration and climate change after Congress failed to act. Given the complexity of the regulatory state and the strong tendency of Congress to gridlock, a rigid conception of executive power would probably be worse for democratic accountability and functioning governance. Policy-wise, there’s no equivalence between Obama’s attempts to make the Affordable Care Act work as intended and Trump’s explicit attempts to sabotage it. But in terms of formal executive power, there’s ample precedent for Trump’s actions. Legal challenges to Obama’s actions suspending some of the ACA’s regulations never got any traction.

Trump’s second action is even worse as policy and it also has a shakier legal foundation. Trump announced that he was ending subsidy payments to insurers that would give them incentives to cover poorer and sicker people without raising premiums on others. People buying insurance will bear the brunt of the action through higher premiums or deductibles. Since more buyers will be eligible for subsidies, the perverse effect of the action will be to insure fewer people while spending more money. (The funding might be restored by Congress: Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray have reached a deal in which Republicans will be bribed not to end the payments if states are given more leeway to loosen the law’s insurance market regulations. Trump supports the agreement, although it is not yet clear if it will have the votes to pass the Senate or House.)

The withholding of payments presents potential legal problems. Nineteen state attorneys general filed suit against the administration, arguing that the administration did not comply with the procedures necessary to stop the payments promised by the law, and also that the action violated the “take care” clause of Article II. The former argument in particular is not frivolous, but the potential of these lawsuits is unclear.

While this kind of executive policymaking is not what the framers had in mind, it’s still going to become more common. The American separation-of-powers system always tends towards stasis. There are so many choke points: a bicameral legislature, the Senate filibuster, the presidential veto, and judicial review. When Congress is unable to act, executive power is likely to fill the vacuum.

The problem is compounded by the various ways in which the Constitution distorts democratic choice. Because of factors like vote suppression, gerrymandering, nearly unlimited campaign spending, and institutions that over-represent white rural voters such as the Senate and the Electoral College, Republicans have been able to lose the popular vote and still win elections. Winner-take-all elections, instead of proportional representation, mean that the slimmest of victories puts total power in the hands of the officeholders who did not attract many voters. Racially and culturally-polarized politics mean that most rank-and-file Republicans pull the lever for the party despite not agreeing with much of its economic agenda. Once in office, Republicans are committed to policies, such as the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, that appease the Republican donor class and the activist base, but not most Republican voters and certainly not Democrats and independents.

Republican Congresses are left incapable of fulfilling their incoherent campaign promises, such as repealing Obamacare’s regulations and subsidies without taking insurance away from millions of Americans. Caught between their base’s demand to repeal, even without a meaningful replacement, but fearing the wrath of voters in more moderate states, they ended up passing nothing. The inevitable outcome is the Republican president, elected by a minority and unconcerned with reaching beyond his base, enacting the right-wing’s demands by fiat.

When considering Trump’s randomly destructive style of policymaking, it’s worth remembering that in 2016 the plurality of American voters chose Hillary Clinton, the candidate who promised to faithfully execute the Affordable Care Act, only to be denied their choice by a mechanism the Constitution’s authors intended in part to curb “excessive democracy.” The framers feared the powers of the executive branch being abused, but the system they designed has allowed it to happen.",Commentary: Blame the Constitution for Trump’s undemocratic executive orders,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lemieux-executive-commentary/commentary-blame-the-constitution-for-trumps-undemocratic-executive-orders-idUSKBN1CN2NR

Former planning minister and current lawmaker De Vido arrived with his lawyer at a federal judge’s chamber in Buenos Aires, Telam reported. That followed a congressional vote earlier on Wednesday to strip his immunity from arrest as part of a fraud probe, marking an anti-corruption milestone in a country known for impunity.

A three-judge panel ordered his arrest last week, saying De Vido should be jailed to prevent him fleeing or interfering with the case.

He would be the most powerful official from the 2007-2015 Fernandez era to be jailed. Corruption allegations have dogged her government and isolated her politically ahead of a Senate race on Oct. 22.

De Vido is under investigation in a case involving the Patagonian coal mine Rio Turbio, which prosecutors say is underproducing despite receiving multi-million dollar investments from the state. He has denied any wrongdoing.

Odinga, however, backed away from previous promises to hold large-scale protests on election day.

“We advise Kenyans who value democracy and justice to hold vigil and prayers away from polling stations, or just stay at home,” he told a cheering crowd of thousands of people on Wednesday in Uhuru Park, in the capital Nairobi.

“Convince your friends, neighbors and everyone else not participate,” he said, but if they support the president, he cautioned “do not insult or assault them. Instead, seek to open their eyes.”

Odinga is refusing to participate because he said that the election commission has failed to implement reforms to prevent another failed poll.

The Supreme Court was due to hear cases seeking to delay the polls but was unable to do so after five out of seven judges had failed to turn up, preventing a quorum.

Minutes after Chief Justice David Maraga said the case could not be heard, hundreds of supporters took to the streets of Kisumu, Odinga’s main stronghold.

Riot police used teargas to disperse them. Two protesters had gunshot wounds, a Reuters witness said.

“If the government subverts the sovereign will of the people ... then people are entitled to rebel against this government,” Kisumu governor Anyang Nyong‘o, a hardline Odinga supporter, told reporters in Kisumu.

Such comments seem certain to fuel fears of a major confrontation with security forces, already blamed for killing nearly 50 people in Kisumu and Nairobi slums after the canceled August vote.

Along with the ongoing decimation of Iraq's Sunni population, the referendum means that in practice ""Iraq"" no longer exists. In its place is a Shiite state dominated by Iran, the de facto new nation of Kurdistan, and a shrinking population of Sunnis tottering between annihilation or reservation-like existence, depending on whether the United States uses the last of its influence to sketch out red lines or abandons the people to fate.

The waste comes in that a better version of a de facto tri-state Iraq was available in 2006. Every life lost (out of a million some, including 4,424 Americans), every dollar spent (in the trillions), and every unanticipated outcome suffered (rise of Islamic State, conflict in Syria, de-democratization of Turkey) since then has been unnecessary.

Tania Karas: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes

The post-World War One failure to create a Kurdish state resulted in 30 million Kurds scattered across modern Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq destroyed civil order in much of the area populated by those Kurds, and opened the door to Iranian influence. Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies directed political violence against Iraqi Sunnis, paving the way for a Sunni protector, Islamic State, to move in.

When the American-trained (cost: $25 billion) Iraqi national army dropped its weapons and ran in 2014, and Shiite militias proved too weak to fill the breach, Obama reinserted the American military into Iraq, saving the Kurds, by then also under threat from Islamic State. The United States subsequently turned those Kurdish fighters loose in Iraq and later Syria against Islamic State. It was expediency over strategy; there was no force otherwise available in bulk.

And it kind of worked. In the short run.

The Kurds, with American help, blunted Islamic State’s progress. The problem was that while American diplomacy, the carrot-and-stick of aid, and the difficulty of maintaining long-distance logistics saw the Kurdish forces replaced by Shiite militias in some locations, the Kurds held on to their gains in the north, having in most instances displaced Iraqi Sunnis. Victorious and bloodied, the Kurds were not about to renounce their hard-earned gains.

The need for American arms did force Kurdish leaders to postpone an independence referendum, opposed by Washington, in 2014. Three years later, with Islamic State mortally weakened, Washington no longer holds sway over Kurdish ambitions. And although the Sept. 25 referendum has no legal force, Kurdish leaders will use the vote to push Baghdad for full autonomy. Donald Trump, the fifth consecutive American president to make war on Iraq, may be the last simply for lack of an Iraq to fight over.

The ground truth of autumn 2017 -- a Kurdistan in the north, a Shiite state in the south, a marginalized Sunni population out west -- is pretty much the deal that could have been had in 2006 when then-Senator Joe Biden proposed dividing Iraq into statelets. Biden wanted the United States to leave a ""residual force to combat terrorists and keep the [three] neighbors honest.” The Senate actually passed a resolution supporting Biden's idea.

It probably would have stabilized the region. The Middle East in 2006 was a very different place.

In 2006 Iran faced an American military as yet undamaged by an additional decade of grinding war. That military sat on both Iran's western border with Iraq and its eastern border with Afghanistan. The Iranian nuclear program was years behind where it is today. Syria was a relatively stable place under not-then-yet-enemy of the free world Bashar al-Assad; indeed, the British-educated Assad was initially seen as a minor reformer. Turkey was stable. Russia was not a major player in the Middle East.

With many of 2017's regional Pandoras still in the box, by Middle Eastern standards security in a divided Iraq would have been manageable via a modest American military presence.

Instead, events of the last decade mean the chance of Kurdish independence adding to regional stability is near zero. Iran, fearing that an independent Kurdish state could threaten its own sectarian balance, is already conducting maneuvers on the border, has canceled flights to and from Kurdistan, and will push its proxies in Baghdad to take action. Will Turkey, now politically distant from NATO, move to open war over disputed borderlands with Kurdistan? The Turkish parliament just extended its authorization for cross-border incursions for another year. Will Kurdish minorities in Turkey and Iran see this all as their moment to rise? Will Israel, which backs Kurdish independence in its search for regional allies, supply weapons?

In a best-case scenario, where everyone tacitly acknowledges Kurdistan while maintaining the status quo (as with Taiwan, which officially exists as a part of China even as it acts like an independent nation) there may be a measure of stability in the near term. Baghdad will talk tough even as it allows the Kurds a surprising amount of free reign -- for example, Baghdad has withdrawn its police from contested Kirkuk, leaving Kurdish forces fully in charge of the oil-rich city. Kurdistan already has full control over its own education, security, military, taxes, and diplomatic representation. Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government, has experimented with diplomatically vague language, saying “self-determination wouldn't mean a direct separation from Iraq.”

Darker predictions involve Syrian-Russian forces contesting Kurdish occupiers inside Syria. Iranian-backed Shiite militias have signaled plans to re-enter Kirkuk, and Turkey already has a running war with Kurdish fighters; tank maneuvers are ongoing with new threats gushing out of Ankara.

American policy has been a blurry gray for some time, calling for the referendum to be postponed without actually supporting or opposing independence. Traditionally the State Department favored a united Iraq somehow, while the Pentagon, with its history of in-the-dirt cooperation with Kurdish fighters stretching back to the 1991 no-fly zone and Operation Provide Comfort that essentially established the preliminary borders of Kurdistan, has been more sympathetic towards independence. The wording of America’s reaction (there has been no post-election statement issued as this is written) to the referendum could signal which part of government is making foreign policy in Iraq these days.

What seems clear is the American role going forward will be mostly limited to diplomacy, and that, regardless of who is carrying out the task, is not the country’s strong suit these days. There seems no appetite in Washington for large-scale troop redeployments, the kind of boots-on-the-ground necessary to decisively shape events.

The American military, which once could have played a role similar to its help in bringing peace to former Yugoslavia, instead will exist as a crumple zone among its own warring semi-allies.

Such a scenario exposes what might have been in 2006 when the United States could have managed events, and 2017, when America can do little more than witness them.",Commentary: Why the Kurdish referendum means the end of Iraq,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-kurds-commentary/commentary-why-the-kurdish-referendum-means-the-end-of-iraq-idUSKCN1C125Q

Zverev’s stunning year, during which he briefly rose to number four in the rankings, means the 20-year-old has qualified for both season-enders, and something had to give.

“I have consulted with my team and in order to best prepare for London, we have made the decision that it is best not to play the week before in Milan,” Zverev told the ATP’s website.

“Therefore, sadly, I will be withdrawing from the Next Gen ATP Finals. However, I still plan on making an appearance at the beginning of the event to support the tournament and show my appreciation for my fans in Italy that were so supportive during my win in Rome earlier this year.”

Zverev’s withdrawal is a blow for the new event, although the back-to-back schedule would have made it extremely tough for the German to have competed at both.

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday at the Superior Court in San Francisco, follows a widely read blog post in February from another female engineer that described Uber’s work environment as one that tolerated and fostered sexual harassment.

The lawsuit filed by Ingrid Avendano, Roxana del Toro Lopez and Ana Medina, who described themselves as Latina software engineers, says that Uber’s compensation and other practices discriminate against women and people of color. As a result, the three women have lost out on earnings, promotions and benefits, the lawsuit says.

Avendano and Toro Lopez left Uber this summer after more than two years with the company. Medina is still employed there, according to the lawsuit.

Uber spokesman Matthew Wing declined to comment.

The lawsuit describes an employee ranking system that is “not based on valid and reliable performance measures” and favors men and white or Asian employees. Women, Latino, American Indian and African American employees are given lower performance scores, making it more difficult for them to advance professionally and confining them to more menial tasks, according to the lawsuit.

“In this system, female employees and employees of color are systematically undervalued compared to their male and white or Asian American peers,” the lawsuit says.

Women, black and Latino employees also lose out on pay raises, bonuses, stock options, benefits and other wages because of the company’s discriminatory practices, the lawsuit alleges.

“These three engineers are seeking to ensure that Uber pays women and people of color equally for the hard work they’ve done – and will continue to do – to help make Uber successful,” said lawyer Jahan Sagafi of Outten & Golden which is representing the plaintiffs.

Outten & Golden have also represented employees in gender discrimination lawsuits against Goldman Sachs and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

Avendano and Toro Lopez brought their complaints to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency this summer, an administrative step that precedes a public lawsuit. News site The Information reported on the complaint Tuesday.

In August, Uber made a series of changes to address pay equity, including increasing pay of employees who were paid below the median salary for their job and providing an annual 2.5 percent raise.","Three women sue Uber in San Francisco claiming unequal pay, benefits",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-lawsuit/three-women-sue-uber-in-san-francisco-claiming-unequal-pay-benefits-idUKKBN1CU2Z1

Three large regional banks - Dallas-based Comerica Inc (CMA.N), Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N), and Cleveland-based KeyCorp (KEY.N) - together earned $2.93 billion in net interest income in the July-September period, an increase of 15 percent from a year earlier.

Wall Street analysts had reckoned that these banks would earn $2.95 billion among them, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Third-quarter net interest margins, the difference between interest paid and earned, and a key indicator of profitability, increased by 6 basis points on average across most banks, from the second quarter, according to Instinet.

Net interest margins have benefited from the three interest rate increases since the second quarter of last year.

The Fed is expected to raise rates again in December. The odds of a December move stand at 96.7 percent, compared with 87.8 percent a week ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.

If there is no rate hike in December, it will have “some negative impact” on margin outlook for 2018, D.A. Davidson analyst Gary Tenner said.

But higher interest rates cut both ways: boosting profits even as they push up borrowing costs, capping loan growth.

KeyCorp on Thursday cut its fourth-quarter loan-growth forecast to the lower-end of its previously given range of $87 billion to $88 billion range. PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) said on Oct 13 it expects modest loan growth in the current quarter, compared with the third quarter when it reported a 1 percent growth.

“Banks have been operating in a slow growth/low interest rate environment for a long time and have spent time bringing down expenses. Control what you can control has been the message,” Stephens analyst Terry McEvoy said.

“I think that will continue to be the case if we don’t get more rate hikes.”

SunTrust said on Friday that third-quarter non-interest expenses, which include most operating and overhead costs, declined 1.3 percent to $1.39 billion. Comerica’s non-interest expense fell 6.1 percent in the same period, the company said on Oct 17.

Several of the regional banks raised provisions for loan losses mainly to deal with possible bad loans coming after hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

Pittsburg-based PNC saw a $32 million rise in provisions, out of which $10 million were related to hurricanes. SunTrust, which has more than 400 branches in Florida, reported a $23 million rise in provisions.

Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares with the hope of buying them back later at a lower price.

Chipotle short-sellers are now up $334 million for the year, and the stock remains easy to borrow for shorting purposes, S3 Partners estimated.

Chipotle has been struggling to recover from a bruising string of food safety lapses that started in late 2015, including a recent norovirus outbreak at a Virginia restaurant.

The company on Tuesday said it will open fewer restaurants and posted lower-than-expected quarterly sales and earnings.

The overall short interest in Chipotle is at about $1.76 billion, according to S3 Partners data.

With nearly 20 percent of the company’s outstanding shares sold short, Chipotle is the most-shorted stock in the U.S. restaurant sector, followed by Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), Domino’s Pizza (DPZ.N) and Darden Restaurants (DRI.N), according to S3 data.

On Wednesday, shorting activity was muted, as traders appeared in no rush to close out bearish bets.

“The rule is to let your profits run and cut your losses. I can’t see these shorts covering. This is what they have been hoping for,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners.

While shorts were having a good day, the sharp drop came at a bad time for billionaire William Ackman, whose $10 billion hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management is Chipotle’s biggest investor.

The value of Pershing Square’s roughly 10 percent stake in Chipotle fell to low as $789 million, down about $145 million from Tuesday.

The loss came as Ackman’s funds’ returns were on the cusp of turning positive after two years of double-digit losses and weeks before the investor was due to face off against Automatic Data Processing (ADP.O) in a bitter proxy contest.

Trading in Chipotle’s options also leaned towards bearish bets on Wednesday.

To be sure, the high short interest might give pause to investors looking to bet against the stock, according to Brad Lamensdorf, co-manager of the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF, which had a short position in Chipotle until last year.

Lamensdorf was referring to a situation where even a modest gain in a heavily shorted stock gets blown into a sharp upward spike, as an increasing number of short-sellers rush to close bearish positions.

“When you have over 20 percent of your float short that should be a concern for any short-seller because if (Chipotle) were to turn things around and come out with good news, it would be like trying to get an elephant through a mouse hole,” he said.",Short-sellers taste profits as Chipotle shares plunge,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chipotle-results-shorts/short-sellers-taste-profits-as-chipotle-shares-plunge-idUSKBN1CU2DG?il=0

Everton’s Ronald Koeman became the third managerial casualty of the Premier League season on Monday and Bilic is at risk of suffering the same fate if he does not turn things around after last Friday’s 3-0 home loss to Brighton and Hove Albion.

West Ham are 16th in the table with eight points from nine games but Bilic said he would not walk away from the challenge.

“You ask me about Koeman, there are always three, four, five managers in those positions and I‘m definitely one of them,” Bilic said ahead of the League Cup fourth round clash at Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday.

”Does it make me lose my focus? No, it gives you even more. I never gave up in my career, no matter in which way of life, as a parent, as a friend, as a manager.

“I am never, never, never walking away... It is my job and a job I like to do especially in a place that I feel, after my hometown, is like few other places, you are treated special.”

British media reports said West Ham’s owners have given Bilic the next two games to turn things around and save his job but the 49-year-old is not worried.

“That’s my biggest strength, to be strong in hard times. Now I‘m having a hard time, yes I am. That doesn’t scare me.”

Scientists believe it belongs to the oldest-known human tsunami victim.

Researchers said on Wednesday that new examinations of the sediments where the 6,000-year-old skull was found detected hallmarks of a tsunami, with a composition remarkably similar to the remnants of a deadly 1998 tsunami that lashed the same area.

The skull was discovered near the town of Aitape, about 7 miles (12 km) inland from Papua New Guinea’s northern coast. It is one of the earliest human remains from the island of New Guinea, and initially was mistaken for a species called Homo erectus that died out about 140,000 years ago. Later scientific dating revealed it was actually 6,000 years old.

“As probably the oldest-known tsunami victim in the world, the Aitape skull speaks volumes about the long-term exposure of human populations along the world’s coastlines and how such events in the past will have undoubtedly had fundamental effects on human migration, settlement and culture,” said tsunami expert James Goff of the University of New South Wales in Australia.

The scientists examined geological deposits at the river-bed site where the skull was found, identifying clear signs of tsunami activity. They spotted microscopic organisms from the ocean in the sediment, similar to those found in soil after the 1998 tsunami.

“We also employed chemistry and examined the size of sediment grains,” finding they were indicative of a tsunami, said anthropologist-archaeologist Mark Golitko of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana and the Field Museum in Chicago.

Tsunamis, giant waves typically caused by underwater earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, are particularly dangerous natural disasters. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, caused by a massive earthquake off Sumatra, killed more than 230,000 people.

The 1998 Papua New Guinea tsunami killed more than 2,000 people, wiped out villages, destroyed crops and forced many survivors to relocate. The tsunami 6,000 years ago apparently was similar.

“Much like the 1998 tsunami, we suspect that one or more large waves very suddenly impacted the coast, washing near-shore villages and anyone living there further back into swamps and lagoons that dot the coast,” Golitko said.

The skull was found without other bones. The researchers noted that in the 1998 tsunami, many victims were washed into lagoons and their bodies scavenged by crocodiles.

The change last year to a Department of Defense manual on procedures governing its intelligence activities was made possible by a decades-old presidential executive order, bypassing congressional and court review.

The new manual, released in August 2016, now permits the collection of information about Americans for counterintelligence purposes “when no specific connection to foreign terrorist(s) has been established,” according to training slides created last year by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI).

The slides were obtained by Human Rights Watch through a Freedom of Information Act request about the use of federal surveillance laws for counter-drug or immigration purposes and shared exclusively with Reuters.

The Air Force and the Department of Defense told Reuters that the documents are authentic.

The slides list the shooting attacks in San Bernardino, California, in December 2015 and Orlando, Florida, in June 2016 as examples that would fall under the ""homegrown violent extremist"" category. The shooters had declared fealty to Islamic State shortly before or during the attacks, but investigators found no actual links to the organization that has carried out shootings and bombings of civilians worldwide.

Michael Mahar, the Department of Defense’s senior intelligence oversight official, said in an interview that AFOSI and other military counterintelligence agencies are allowed to investigate both active duty and U.S. civilian personnel as long as there is a potential case connected to the military. Investigations of civilians are carried out cooperatively with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mahar said.

Executive order 12333, signed by former President Ronald Reagan in 1981 and later modified by former President George W. Bush, establishes how U.S. intelligence agencies such as the CIA are allowed to pursue foreign intelligence investigations. The order also allows surveillance of U.S. citizens in certain cases, including for activities defined as counterintelligence.

Under the previous Defense Department manual’s definition of counterintelligence activity, which was published in 1982, the U.S. government was required to demonstrate a target was working on behalf of the goals of a foreign power or terrorist group.

It was not clear what practical effect the expanded definition might have on how the U.S. government gathers intelligence. One of the Air Force slides described the updated interpretation as among several “key changes.”

However, some former U.S. national security officials, who generally support giving agents more counterterrorism tools but declined to be quoted, said the change appeared to be a minor adjustment that was unlikely to significantly impact intelligence gathering.

Some privacy and civil liberties advocates who have seen the training slides disagreed, saying they were alarmed by the change because it could increase the number of U.S. citizens who can be monitored under an executive order that lacks sufficient oversight.

“What happens under 12333 takes place under a cloak of darkness,” said Sarah St. Vincent, a surveillance researcher with Human Rights Watch who first obtained the documents. “We have enormous programs potentially affecting people in the United States and abroad, and we would never know about these changes” without the documents, she said.

The National Security Act, a federal law adopted 70 years ago, states that Congress must be kept informed about significant intelligence activities. But the law leaves the interpretation of that to the executive branch.

The updated interpretation was motivated by recognition that some people who may pose a security threat do not have specific ties to a group such as Islamic State or Boko Haram, Mahar at the Defense Department said.

“The internet and social media has made it easier for terrorist groups to radicalize followers without establishing direct contact,” Mahar said.

“We felt that we needed the flexibility to target those individuals,” he said.

In August 2016, during the final months of former President Barack Obama’s administration, a Pentagon press release announced that the department had updated its intelligence collecting procedures but it made no specific reference to “homegrown violent extremists.”

The revision was signed off by the Department of Justice’s senior leadership, including the attorney general, and reviewed by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a government privacy watchdog.

Mahar said that “homegrown violent extremist,” while listed in the Air Force training slide, is not an official phrase used by the Defense Department. It does not have a specific list of traits or behaviors that would qualify someone for monitoring under the new definition, Mahar said.

Hunches or intuition are not enough to trigger intelligence gathering, Mahar said, adding that a “reasonable belief” that a target may be advancing the goals of an international terrorist group to harm the United States is required.

The updated Defense Department manual refers to any target “reasonably believed to be acting for, or in furtherance of, the goals or objectives of an international terrorist or international terrorist organization, for purposes harmful to the national security of the United States.”

Mahar said that in counterterrorism investigations, federal surveillance laws, including the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, continue to govern electronic surveillance in addition to the limitations detailed in his department’s manual.",Exclusive: U.S. widens surveillance to include 'homegrown violent extremists' - documents,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-surveillance-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-widens-surveillance-to-include-homegrown-violent-extremists-documents-idUSKBN1CU1H6

“No decision has been made and no candidate has been ruled out but Gary’s role is too crucial to getting tax reform done. It might be too important for him to continue to be the lead, for him to announce a change at this time,” the official said.

The Republican president is looking to announce a Fed chair nominee before leaving on a trip to Asia on Nov. 3, in order to give his choice time to go through the Senate confirmation process. Current Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s term ends in early February.

But an announcement is unlikely this week, said another source familiar with the situation.

Trump told Republican senators during a private lunch on Tuesday that his focus for a new Fed chair was on Stanford University economist John Taylor, Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Yellen, a source familiar with the meeting said.

When Trump asked the senators for a show of hands on whether they would prefer Taylor or Powell, the most support went for Taylor, the source said.

Cohn irritated Trump by criticizing the president’s response to violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August at a white supremacist rally.

But the two men in recent weeks seemed to have ironed out their differences, with Trump singling out Cohn for praise for his help in the tax reform effort.

Trump is also considering a fifth candidate for the Fed job, former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, sources have said.

Trump told Fox Business Network that he admired Yellen but that the decision to pick a new Fed chair was something to which he would like to contribute.

The gains came after India’s cabinet late on Tuesday cleared a plan to inject 2.11 trillion rupees ($32.4 billion) into state-run lenders over two years.

With the plan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is bidding to tackle a major drag on the economy that has frustrated his attempts to boost growth.

Investors sent shares of State Bank of India, the biggest lender, up as much as 29 percent to its highest since January 2015. The benchmark NSE Nifty rose as much as 1.3 percent, touching a record high.

But details of how New Delhi will fund the injections were not available. Also, questions remain about whether these would add to India’s fiscal deficit at a time markets are already doubtful it can meet its 3.2 percent target of gross domestic product for the year ending in March 2018.

The planned injections still fall short of some estimates, including from credit rating agencies, of what’s required. Fitch Ratings estimates Indian banks need $65 billion of additional capital by March 2019 to meet Basel III global banking rules.

DRAGGING ITS FEET

For now, analysts said the long-awaited actions are positive, as India, worried about its finances, was widely seen as dragging its feet in resolving problems in a banking sector saddled with $145 billion in soured loans after years of almost indiscriminate lending.

Once the world’s fastest-growing major economy, India has seen its growth rate plummet to the lowest in three years. A key factor has been the lack of private investment as state banks, which provide most of the credit, hold the largest amount of bad debt.

“At the end of the day, a good dose of the medicine that is required is being provided,” said Jobin Jacob, associate director of financial institutions at Fitch Ratings.

“How the medicine is being sourced could have its own implications on the macro picture, but as far as the banking sector is concerned, it is helpful,” he said.

Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel welcomed the injections - a step he has long advocated - calling the plan “a monumental step forward in safeguarding the country’s economic future”.

DEVIL IN DETAILS

Still, details will matter. The benchmark 10-year bond yield rose 3 basis points to 6.81 percent on worries about how the injections will be structured.

The government said on Tuesday that so-called recapitalisation bonds will account for 1.35 trillion rupees of the 2.11 trillion rupees injection, while about 580 billion rupees would come from share sales by banks. The government will also use 180 billion rupees left from its previously budgeted recapitalisation fund.

Analysts predict recapitalisation bonds would likely involve selling debt to lenders, with the government then injecting the capital back into state-owned banks, potentially in exchange for increased equity stakes in the sector.

India took a similar approach in the 1990s, and repeating such a step would avoid roiling debt markets by keeping it off markets, analysts said.

Srikanth Vadlamani, senior credit officer at Moody’s Investors Service, warned that such an approach could have some negative implications for the banks depending on the structure, though he called recapitalisation a “significant credit positive” overall.

India’s chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian said in a tweet the total capital injected by the government could ultimately be limited to paying interest on the bonds as there would not be straight cash injections.

The government could also avoid adding to its fiscal deficit by funding the plan through state-owned bodies rather than directly, an accounting sleight-of-hand that could allow New Delhi not to count the expenditure as part of its budget under International Monetary Fund rules.

Importantly, investors warned that India also needed to announce accompanying reforms to the banking sector, to prevent moral hazard and impose more credit discipline on lenders.

Policymakers “should impose targets on these banks in terms of profitability, credit quality and efficiency. This has to be carefully managed,” said David Marshall, Singapore-based analyst with CreditSights.",India's $32 billion bank recap plan spurs share gains and questions,https://www.reuters.com/article/india-economy-banks/indian-banking-shares-surge-on-governments-32-4-billion-recapitalisation-plan-idINKBN1CU09V

The aim of this policy is to enable U.S. weapons manufactures to sell their products overseas quickly by trimming the bureaucratic red tape now governing the export of non-military grade weapons and ammunition. According to the Reuters report, the new plan would mean that commercial gun exports would no longer be given the same scrutiny as missile and fighter jet sales, which often require congressional approval. The shift would also move weapons like assault rifles and handguns from the State Department’s tightly-restricted Munitions list to the Commerce Control Lists, which allows for more streamlined licensing for international sales. While the administration has explained these new procedures as a logical extension of a U.S. president who is solidly pro-business, the transfer of authority from Foggy Bottom will have unintended and damaging foreign policy repercussions.

In contrast to the significant decline in major conventional conflicts over the last 50 years, unconventional conflicts within a sovereign state’s territory, such as the current war in Syria, have become the new normal. Small weapons like AK-47’s assault rifles, Kalashnikovs, sniper rifles, and low-grade explosives are used in most of these confrontations. Indeed, the ease with which a combatant with little military training can use semi-automatic weapons on the battlefield is part of the weapons’ appeal.

Light arms have many advantages for guerilla armies: an AK-47 is a lot cheaper than a tank, a missile defense system, or a fighter aircraft and it can be smuggled across porous borders. As Senators Ben Cardin, Patrick Leahy, and Dianne Feinstein wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in opposing the new rules, the civil wars and rebellions currently taking place are being fueled by the illegal sales of what many Americans would categorize as sports rifles or hunting equipment.

Relaxing the rules on small arms exports is counterproductive to the U.S. objective of de-escalating these conflicts. The new administration policy has the potential to squander the inclusive diplomatic processes Washington has encouraged in order to promote peaceful approaches to conflict resolution in states as varied as South Sudan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Multiple agencies and departments within the U.S. government would in effect be working against one another, with the State Department hoping to end the very hostilities that are sustained by American-manufactured weapons.

Washington would not be deliberately arming combatants in a civil war, but the handguns and assault rifles American firearms manufacturers sell on the open market could find their way to a conflict zone through smuggling and diversion. In one highly-publicized case last year, corrupt Jordanian intelligence officers sold a cache of rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles that were destined for the moderate Syrian opposition to arms merchants on the underground market. The FBI later determined that one of those weapons was likely to have been responsible for the shooting deaths of two American contractors in Jordan that same year.

The civil war in Libya illustrates the insecurity that can result when governments send weapons into a conflict zone without crafting the necessary oversight and security measures that help prevent them from being sold off elsewhere. During the 2011 armed rebellion against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Washington's Arab partners – with the secret blessing of the Obama administration – delivered military assistance to the rebels trying to oust the regime. While the military aid helped to drive Gaddafi from power after eight months of combat, that same equipment eventually helped fuel the civil war still ravaging Libya. Libyan militias previously concerned with overthrowing Qaddafi began stockpiling arms to increase their political leverage for later internal battles. The availability of weapons in Libya remains so overwhelming that U.N. experts have categorized the North African country as a regional weapons bazaar. Weapons that were sent into the country to aid the Libyan rebellion have been diverted to other regional conflicts, either through arms smuggling across lightly defended borders or through illicit arms deals. African officials claim that some of these arms likely assisted the jihadist Boko Haram group to recover after serious territorial losses against the Nigerian army.

According to the Small Arms Survey, the United States is already the world’s top exporter of small arms, having reached a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. While this figure is small compared to the far larger conventional weapons contracts U.S. defense manufacturers sign every year, the possibility that even a fraction of these commercial weapons could leak into a conflict zone would have a deeply negative impact.

The question is whether the monetary benefits that are likely to result from the administration’s new rules are enough to compensate for the instability and violence that are likely to increase with more small arms available for sale around the world. The ease with which U.S. arms companies will now be able to export their products may be terrific from a business perspective. But from the standpoint of international peace and security, this policy is a dangerous gamble for the White House to take.

He predicted on Wednesday that some Democratic lawmakers would back the tax plan.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday that a sweeping Republican tax-cut plan is entering its toughest phase yet as lobbyists swarm Congress to try to protect valuable tax breaks.

Urging lawmakers to move quickly on the plan, Ryan said in an interview with Reuters that speedy action would prevent the legislation getting bogged down and deliver sooner the economic growth that Republicans expect from it.

“K Street,” as Washington’s lobbying industry is known after the downtown street where much of it is based, will soon descend on Capitol Hill to defend tax benefits for companies and other special interests, said Ryan, the top Republican in Congress.

”When the details come, that is when you’re going to see K Street coming to Congress. And that’s why this hasn’t been done for 31 years,” said Ryan, looking back to the country’s last major tax code overhaul under President Ronald Reagan in 1986.

While the broad parameters of the Republican plan, backed by President Donald Trump, have been made public, detailed legislation is not expected to be revealed until next week.

Securing passage by Congress of the tax plan would give Trump his first major legislative win since he took office in January. Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress and are under pressure to deliver on their election campaign promises. Final action on taxes is at least weeks away.

The Republican plan would cut taxes for businesses and people by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, according to independent analysts.

It calls for reducing the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and setting a lower rate for smaller businesses, as well as cutting taxes for individuals and allowing larger deductions for families.

Democrats have called it a gift to the rich and to corporate America that would cause the federal deficit to balloon and add to the $20 trillion U.S. national debt.

CHOPPY WATERS

Ryan referred to white-water rafting to describe how the tax overhaul effort is entering its toughest phase.

“We’ve been going through Class 3 rapids, which is a pleasant ride. It’s nice. Everybody pretty much stays in the boat and it’s pretty good. But we’re about to go through Class 5 rapids, which is the biggest rapid you can go through,” he said.

He called on Republicans to hold tight as details are hammered out. “We’ve got to make sure that everybody stays in the boat and we get the boat down the river,” Ryan said.

He dismissed concerns that tax cuts could expand the federal deficit. “We don’t anticipate a big deficit effect from this tax reform because we will broaden the base and lower the rates, plug loopholes and get faster economic growth.”

Republicans intend to pay for their proposed cuts in part by broadening the tax base. That would require discarding trillions of dollars of tax deductions, loopholes and other breaks, each one protected by powerful interests.

If lobbyists succeed in protecting such tax breaks, lawmakers would be looking at less revenue to offset the tax cuts, raising the risk of higher deficits and debt that could undermine long-term economic growth.

DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT?

Ryan has previously said he wants the House to pass the tax bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. He predicted on Wednesday that some Democratic lawmakers would back the tax plan.

“At the end of the day, I do believe some Democrats will end up voting for this thing,” Ryan said. “It’s hard for me to see why - no matter what party you’re from - you’d want to vote against this.”

Slideshow (3 Images)

At least some Democratic support could end up being needed in the Senate, where Republicans hold only a 52-48 majority. Party dissent in the Senate led to Republicans’ failure this summer to push through an overhaul of the healthcare system that Trump and the party leadership had pushed for.

Ryan, from Wisconsin, blamed Democrats for the lack of bipartisanship in Washington. Republicans are drafting the tax legislation on their own.

“I so wish we had Bill Bradley Democrats around these days. We do not have Bill Bradley Democrats. Believe me, I really, really wish we did,” Ryan said, referring to Democratic former Senator Bill Bradley, who played a key bipartisan role in the Reagan tax reform.

Among Republicans, skirmishes around the tax breaks have already begun.

Some Republican lawmakers are resisting a proposal to eliminate a popular deduction for state and local tax payments, which would hit middle-class voters in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.

“You do have to broaden the base in order to lower the rates. And that is what reform is,” Ryan said. “With respect to state and local, I think there’s a way of addressing the concerns that our members have for middle income taxpayers … so that they are net winners in tax reform as well.”

Ryan also said Republican lawmakers will not take up a bipartisan plan to stabilize Obamacare insurance markets or try again this year to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

The House speaker said he wants Congress to pass legislation to protect illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children but offered no timetable.

Asked about strong denunciations of Trump this week by two Republican senators, Ryan said people should “settle their differences personally” rather than in public.

Benchmark U.S. 10-year note US10YT=RR yields hit a seven-month high of 2.475 percent, buoyed by economic data, recent optimism over progress on tax reform by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and anticipation of a nominee to head the Federal Reserve.

Equities pared losses as yields retreated, following a Fox Business interview with Trump in which he said he was still considering keeping current Fed Chair Janet Yellen in the position. The 10-year last fell 9/32 in price to yield 2.4371 percent.

“It is possible the market may be taking some solace that Yellen is still in the mix,” said Mike Beale, senior managing director at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.

“The market may be saying, maybe one of the more hawkish, (John) Taylor or (Kevin) Warsh, is off the table.”

Low interest rates have been a driving factor in the 8-year bull market, with investors pushed into equities as other lesser-yielding instruments are viewed as unattractive by comparison.

Earnings season so far has been largely positive, with 72.1 percent of the 165 S&P 500 companies that have reported to date topping expectations, matching the average for the past four quarters.

However, with U.S. indexes at record levels, investors have scrutinized earnings to see if they justify stretched valuations.

Also weighing on sentiment: President Trump and the U.S. House of Representatives’ top tax law writer reopened the door on Wednesday to changes in the 401(k) retirement savings program, just days after Trump seemed to rule out such a step. The debate could present another hurdle to a tax reform deal.

“De acordo com a nossa visão, não vemos nenhuma chance de não sermos credores”, afirmou o executivo, durante sua participação no congresso do setor de petróleo OTC Brasil, no Rio de Janeiro.

“Essa é uma negociação e, portanto, tem duas partes na mesa, mas eu não vejo, como Petrobras, a possibilidade de a gente não ser credor. Isso está bem claro e bem expresso.”

A afirmação ocorre um dia após o secretário de petróleo e gás natural do Ministério de Minas e Energia, Márcio Félix, ter afirmado a jornalistas que não está definido ainda que a empresa será credora e que não há data prevista para a conclusão das discussões.

Questionado pela Reuters, Félix voltou a afirmar que, considerando a queda dos preços do petróleo desde a assinatura do contrato, em 2010, é possível ver a Petrobras como credora ao fim da renegociação. No entanto, destacou que não há nada definido.

O contrato da Cessão Onerosa garantiu à Petrobras um total de 5 bilhões de barris de produção na área. Mas, desde o início, previa uma renegociação de valores pagos pelos volumes, depois que as declarações de comercialidade fossem apresentadas.

Félix afirmou à Reuters que tem a expectativa de que a renegociação seja concluída até o fim deste ano, para que os excedentes de petróleo atualmente estimados nas áreas, além dos 5 bilhões de barris, possam ser ofertados em um leilão na primeira metade de 2018.

A grande dificuldade na negociação é chegar a um preço de referência para ajustar o contrato, segundo Félix.

“Estamos esgotando juridicamente o entendimento e estamos investindo para diminuir essa diferença de entendimento”, afirmou Félix.

Havia a expectativa de que uma solução para a renegociação fosse levada a uma reunião extraordinária do Conselho Nacional de Política Energética (CNPE) marcada para novembro. No entanto, Félix afirmou que já não há mais tempo viável.

“(Como alternativa), tem a reunião de dezembro (ordinária) ou (outra possibilidade seria) uma extraordinária mais à frente, mas aí já vai ficando difícil”, afirmou.

Félix afirmou que a reunião extraordinária do CNPE deverá aprovar as áreas da 15ª Rodada de petróleo e gás, sob regime de concessão, e a 4ª Rodada do pré-sal, sob regime de partilha.

O governo poderá tirar da 15ª Rodada, durante a reunião, áreas da chamada margem equatorial, devido à dificuldade das empresas que já têm blocos na região para conseguir licenças para perfuração.

“É possível (que a margem equatorial) fique de fora dos próximos leilões. O governo não tem interesse em criar nenhuma tensão. O foco é solucionar o que tem hoje, e um conflito é desnecessário. Isso vai ser avaliado na reunião do CNPE de novembro”, afirmou.

Securing passage by Congress of the tax plan would give Trump his first major legislative win since he took office in January.
The Republican plan would cut taxes for businesses and people by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, according to independent analysts.
Ryan has previously said he wants the House to pass the tax bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.
He predicted on Wednesday that some Democratic lawmakers would back the tax plan.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday that a sweeping Republican tax-cut plan is entering its toughest phase yet as lobbyists swarm Congress to try to protect valuable tax breaks.

Urging lawmakers to move quickly on the plan, Ryan said in an interview with Reuters that speedy action would prevent the legislation getting bogged down and deliver sooner the economic growth that Republicans expect from it.

“K Street,” as Washington’s lobbying industry is known after the downtown street where much of it is based, will soon descend on Capitol Hill to defend tax benefits for companies and other special interests, said Ryan, the top Republican in Congress.

”When the details come, that is when you’re going to see K Street coming to Congress. And that’s why this hasn’t been done for 31 years,” said Ryan, looking back to the country’s last major tax code overhaul under President Ronald Reagan in 1986.

While the broad parameters of the Republican plan, backed by President Donald Trump, have been made public, detailed legislation is not expected to be revealed until next week.

Securing passage by Congress of the tax plan would give Trump his first major legislative win since he took office in January. Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress and are under pressure to deliver on their election campaign promises. Final action on taxes is at least weeks away.

The Republican plan would cut taxes for businesses and people by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, according to independent analysts.

It calls for reducing the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and setting a lower rate for smaller businesses, as well as cutting taxes for individuals and allowing larger deductions for families.

Democrats have called it a gift to the rich and to corporate America that would cause the federal deficit to balloon and add to the $20 trillion U.S. national debt.

CHOPPY WATERS

Ryan referred to white-water rafting to describe how the tax overhaul effort is entering its toughest phase.

“We’ve been going through Class 3 rapids, which is a pleasant ride. It’s nice. Everybody pretty much stays in the boat and it’s pretty good. But we’re about to go through Class 5 rapids, which is the biggest rapid you can go through,” he said.

He called on Republicans to hold tight as details are hammered out. “We’ve got to make sure that everybody stays in the boat and we get the boat down the river,” Ryan said.

He dismissed concerns that tax cuts could expand the federal deficit. “We don’t anticipate a big deficit effect from this tax reform because we will broaden the base and lower the rates, plug loopholes and get faster economic growth.”

Republicans intend to pay for their proposed cuts in part by broadening the tax base. That would require discarding trillions of dollars of tax deductions, loopholes and other breaks, each one protected by powerful interests.

If lobbyists succeed in protecting such tax breaks, lawmakers would be looking at less revenue to offset the tax cuts, raising the risk of higher deficits and debt that could undermine long-term economic growth.

DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT?

Ryan has previously said he wants the House to pass the tax bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. He predicted on Wednesday that some Democratic lawmakers would back the tax plan.

“At the end of the day, I do believe some Democrats will end up voting for this thing,” Ryan said. “It’s hard for me to see why - no matter what party you’re from - you’d want to vote against this.”

Slideshow (3 Images)

At least some Democratic support could end up being needed in the Senate, where Republicans hold only a 52-48 majority. Party dissent in the Senate led to Republicans’ failure this summer to push through an overhaul of the healthcare system that Trump and the party leadership had pushed for.

Ryan, from Wisconsin, blamed Democrats for the lack of bipartisanship in Washington. Republicans are drafting the tax legislation on their own.

“I so wish we had Bill Bradley Democrats around these days. We do not have Bill Bradley Democrats. Believe me, I really, really wish we did,” Ryan said, referring to Democratic former Senator Bill Bradley, who played a key bipartisan role in the Reagan tax reform.

Among Republicans, skirmishes around the tax breaks have already begun.

Some Republican lawmakers are resisting a proposal to eliminate a popular deduction for state and local tax payments, which would hit middle-class voters in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.

The Public Investment Fund (PIF) announced the assets-under-management goal at a conference showcasing a program to turn the strictly conservative country into a high-tech business hub with a lifestyle free of hardline Islamism.

PIF published its first comprehensive business program, outlining targets for investments and returns for 2018-2020, under reforms to boost private-sector growth and wean the largest Arab economy off oil export dependence.

Expected to receive proceeds from the planned sale of 5 percent of state oil giant Saudi Aramco’s IPO-ARMO.SE shares, PIF has around $230 billion worth of assets under management now.

The IPO is the centerpiece of Vision 2030, a reform plan to diversify the economy of the world’s largest oil exporter beyond petroleum, championed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.

The crown prince underscored the social side of the reforms on Tuesday when he said he wanted a moderate Islam in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy which practices an austere version of the religion, and would eradicate extremism.

That theme was echoed on Wednesday by Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan.

OPEN FOR BUSINESS

“Islam is not radical or extremist. Islam is moderate. As Saudis, we are welcoming and open for business,” he said, when asked to elaborate on Prince Mohammed’s remarks.

Event organizers projected a open image of the kingdom. Men and women mixed freely at non-alcoholic “networking cocktails” in the ornate lobby of the Ritz Carlton, including the crown prince himself, who took selfies with attendees.

Women were told in official program materials that they did not need to wear the normally obligatory long abaya robe and headscarf whilst inside the event and could opt for formal business attire, like men.

PIF Investments will be in sectors such as real estate and infrastructure as well as in new areas of activity in the Saudi economy through the establishment of companies such as the Saudi Arabian Military Industries company and the Saudi Real Estate Refinancing Company.

One of the biggest tasks facings PIF will be the delivery of a $500 billion plan to build a business and industrial zone extending into Jordan and Egypt, announced at the start of the conference on Tuesday.

PIF also set a new target to increase total shareholder return to 4-5 percent between now and 2020 from 3 percent, it said on Wednesday.

The 96-page program said PIF will structure its investments in six areas: Saudi equity holdings, sector development, real estate and infrastructure, mega projects, international strategic investments and a “diversified pool” across global asset classes.

It said “long-term” average annual return from these areas would be between 6.5 to 9 percent.

Outside of Saudi Arabia, PIF’s investments will be in a number of assets such as fixed-income, public equity, private equity and debt, real estate, infrastructure and alternative investments such as hedge funds, the fund said.

PIF Managing Director Yasir Al Rumayyan said the fund was open to investing in more big ticket items such as U.S. ride services company Uber [UBER.UL].

It also outlined its four major sources of funding to include capital injections from the government, government asset transfers, loans and debt instruments as well as retained earnings from investments.

Rumayyan told Reuters the fund would be a conservative borrower when it enters international debt markets to obtain leverage for its expansion.",Saudi Arabia reform push targets wealth fund doubling assets,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-economy/saudi-arabia-reform-push-targets-wealth-fund-doubling-assets-idUSKBN1CU2OT?il=0

Benchmark U.S. 10-year note US10YT=RR yields hit a seven-month high of 2.475 percent, buoyed by economic data, recent optimism over progress on tax reform by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and anticipation of a nominee to head the Federal Reserve.

Equities pared losses as yields retreated, following a Fox Business interview with Trump in which he said he was still considering keeping current Fed Chair Janet Yellen in the position. The 10-year last fell 9/32 in price to yield 2.4371 percent.

“It is possible the market may be taking some solace that Yellen is still in the mix,” said Mike Beale, senior managing director at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.

“The market may be saying, maybe one of the more hawkish, (John) Taylor or (Kevin) Warsh, is off the table.”

Low interest rates have been a driving factor in the 8-year bull market, with investors pushed into equities as other lesser-yielding instruments are viewed as unattractive by comparison.

Earnings season so far has been largely positive, with 72.1 percent of the 165 S&P 500 companies that have reported to date topping expectations, matching the average for the past four quarters.

However, with U.S. indexes at record levels, investors have scrutinized earnings to see if they justify stretched valuations.

Also weighing on sentiment: President Trump and the U.S. House of Representatives’ top tax law writer reopened the door on Wednesday to changes in the 401(k) retirement savings program, just days after Trump seemed to rule out such a step. The debate could present another hurdle to a tax reform deal.

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday at the Superior Court in San Francisco, follows a widely read blog post in February from another female engineer that described Uber’s work environment as one that tolerated and fostered sexual harassment.

The lawsuit filed by Ingrid Avendano, Roxana del Toro Lopez and Ana Medina, who described themselves as Latina software engineers, says that Uber’s compensation and other practices discriminate against women and people of color. As a result, the three women have lost out on earnings, promotions and benefits, the lawsuit says.

Avendano and Toro Lopez left Uber this summer after more than two years with the company. Medina is still employed there, according to the lawsuit.

Uber spokesman Matthew Wing declined to comment.

The lawsuit describes an employee ranking system that is “not based on valid and reliable performance measures” and favors men and white or Asian employees. Women, Latino, American Indian and African American employees are given lower performance scores, making it more difficult for them to advance professionally and confining them to more menial tasks, according to the lawsuit.

“In this system, female employees and employees of color are systematically undervalued compared to their male and white or Asian American peers,” the lawsuit says.

Women, black and Latino employees also lose out on pay raises, bonuses, stock options, benefits and other wages because of the company’s discriminatory practices, the lawsuit alleges.

“These three engineers are seeking to ensure that Uber pays women and people of color equally for the hard work they’ve done – and will continue to do – to help make Uber successful,” said lawyer Jahan Sagafi of Outten & Golden which is representing the plaintiffs.

Outten & Golden have also represented employees in gender discrimination lawsuits against Goldman Sachs and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

Avendano and Toro Lopez brought their complaints to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency this summer, an administrative step that precedes a public lawsuit. News site The Information reported on the complaint Tuesday.

In August, Uber made a series of changes to address pay equity, including increasing pay of employees who were paid below the median salary for their job and providing an annual 2.5 percent raise.","Three women sue Uber in San Francisco claiming unequal pay, benefits",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-lawsuit/three-women-sue-uber-in-san-francisco-claiming-unequal-pay-benefits-idUSKBN1CU2Z1

The settlement with the German bank was announced on Wednesday by the attorneys general of New York and California, Eric Schneiderman and Xavier Becerra, who led the probe by 44 U.S. states and Washington, D.C.

Deutsche Bank is the second bank to settle the multistate probe, following a $100 million settlement by Britain’s Barclays Plc (BARC.L) in August 2016.

Both banks agreed to cooperate in the probe into several other banks, which is continuing.

Wednesday’s settlement came 2-1/2 years after Deutsche Bank agreed in April 2015 to pay $2.5 billion to settle rate-rigging probes by U.S. and British regulators, and a London-based unit pleaded guilty to criminal wire fraud.

The bank has also reached multiple rate-rigging settlements in private U.S. investor lawsuits.

“This settlement resolves the bank’s final pending U.S. regulatory inquiry related to Libor,” Deutsche Bank spokesman Troy Gravitt said in a statement about Wednesday’s accord.

Banks use Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, to set rates on roughly $350 trillion of credit card, mortgage, student loan and other transactions, and to determine the cost of borrowing from one another.

Deutsche Bank admitted to allegations that from 2005 to 2009, it made false or misleading Libor submissions, tried to influence other banks’ submissions to benefit its own trading positions, and concealed its deception from customers.

The settlement agreement included emails and instant messages detailing the alleged manipulation, including one in which a Libor submitter told a trader who sought a particular quote: “Ok will try to give you a belated Christmas present.”

Schneiderman said such conduct can interfere with or undermine confidence in financial markets.

“Large financial institutions, like all other market participants, have to abide by the rules,” he said in a statement.

Banks have paid roughly $9 billion to settle Libor-rigging probes worldwide.

In July, Andrew Bailey, head of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, said that regulator will phase out Libor by the end of 2021, citing a lack of data underpinning it.

Under the current “declaration of cooperation”, issued in December 2016, OPEC with Russia and some non-OPEC countries have pledged to limit their output.

Production limits were originally intended to apply for six months between January and June 2017 but have since been extended for a further nine months until the end of March 2018.

The original declaration was vague about its objectives but senior officials have since indicated the primary goal is to reduce oil inventories in OECD industrialised countries down to the five-year average.

OPEC and its allies are now roughly half-way towards that goal, with stocks about 160 million-170 million barrels above the five-year average, compared with 280 million at the start of 2017 (“Monthly Oil Market Report”, OPEC, March and Oct. 2017).

OPEC officials have stressed their resolve to finish what they have started and reduce stocks even further next year.

“We are determined to do whatever it takes to bring global inventories down to the normal level which we say is the five-year average,” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said during a conference in Riyadh on Tuesday.

“The intent is to keep our hands on the wheel between now and until we get to a balanced market and beyond,” he said (“Saudi determined to end oil glut, sees smooth exit for OPEC pact”, Reuters, Oct. 24).

Since inventories are unlikely to be reduced to the target by the end of March, OPEC officials are discussing an extension of the production cuts for up to another nine months.

But the more complicated and important task is deciding when and how to exit from the current agreement and whether to try to replace it with another production accord.

“When we get closer to that (five-year average) we will decide how we smoothly exit the current agreement, maybe go to a different arrangement to keep supply and demand closely balanced so we don’t have a return to higher inventories,” Falih said on the sidelines of an investor conference in Riyadh.

DECLARING VICTORY

Knowing when to declare that an objective has been achieved and making a course correction is often a major challenge for policymakers.

If a policy has been successful, there is a tendency to continue pursuing it, even when the environment has changed and demands a different response.

OPEC and its allies must decide when to switch the focus from limiting output and cutting stocks to growing production again to meet rising demand.

If they wait too long, stocks will fall too far, prices will rise strongly, shale production will ramp up, and the oil market’s adjustment will overshoot.

There is an entire branch of engineering and information technology on “control theory” or how to adjust system inputs to achieve the desired level of output.

The challenge is to adjust inputs smoothly and in a timely manner to keep outputs close to a reference value rather than swinging around wildly (“On governors”, Maxwell, 1868).

In OPEC’s case, the challenge is to adjust production to achieve some desired level of inventories, prices and market share.

In practice, the organisation has never been much good at this; policy shifts have tended to be reactive rather than proactive.

OPEC has often contributed to the cyclical instability by being slow to react to rather than anticipate the changing balance between supply and demand.

STOCKS, PRICES, SHARE

OPEC’s declared objective of reducing excess global oil inventories to their five-year average is only an intermediate target.

The ultimate objective is to achieve some desired combination of price and market share that sustainably maximises income for its member states (leaving to one side the question of time horizon).

In practice, the organisation is led by Saudi Arabia, and the kingdom’s priority tends to alternate between supporting prices and defending market share.

Between the middle of 2014 and the middle of 2016, the kingdom focused on defending market share, which contributed to significant oversupply and worsened the slump in oil prices.

Since the end of 2016, the kingdom’s priority has switched to cutting stocks and pushing up prices, and it has been willing to accept some reduction in market share to achieve it.

Saudi officials have so far indicated the focus will remain on inventory reduction and price support well into 2018, even if the kingdom has to concede market share to rival producers.

But as stocks continue to fall, the kingdom will have to make some tricky decisions about when to adjust its production policy and what combination of prices and market share to target.

A MOVING TARGET

Global consumption rose by almost 6 million barrels per day (bpd) over the last five years, from less than 91 million bpd in 2012, to more than 96 million bpd in 2016 (“Statistical Review of World Energy”, BP, 2017).

Consumption is forecast to rise by another 1.5 million bpd in both 2017 and 2018, which means demand will be almost 10 million bpd higher in 2018 than in 2012.

If a balanced oil market includes some desired ratio of stocks to consumption, then a balanced market in 2018 will need to carry a significantly higher level of stocks than 2012-2016 average.

Cutting inventories back to the five-year average would leave the market feeling exceptionally tight. If OPEC tries to force stocks down to that level, the result will be a big rise in spot prices and a sharp move into backwardation.

This is exactly what happened following previous OPEC-led efforts at market rebalancing in 1999/2000 and 2010/2011, and it could happen again in 2018/19 (tmsnrt.rs/2lh2Gxe).

MANAGING TRANSITIONS

In the aftermath of an oil price slump, OPEC and its advisors normally announce they will cut excess stocks, raise prices to a “normal” level, and then pledge to keep the market stable.

Following the wrenching 1997/98 price slump, OPEC announced it would target a price band of $22-$28 per barrel, which became a formal target between 2000 and 2004 before being quietly shelved.

In 2008, Saudi Arabia’s then King Abdullah called $75-$80 per barrel a “fair price”, and it became a de facto price target for a time, before it too was overtaken by events and quietly abandoned.

Oil prices quickly overshot both targets, and OPEC proved either unable or unwilling to prevent them climbing further.

As the oil market continues to tighten in 2018, the same pattern could repeat itself, with both spot prices and the backwardation increasing.

A NEW TARGET?

OPEC and its allies must decide whether to take some of the increase in demand for their crude in the form of higher prices, higher output, or both.

Since most countries are already pumping near full capacity, the decision will principally rest with Saud Arabia, its close ally Kuwait, and Russia.

Higher prices would risk a renewed boom in shale production from the United States, so Saudi Arabia is likely to be cautious about the market tightening too much.

But the kingdom needs higher oil revenues to jump-start its economy out of recession and fund an ambitious social and economic transformation programme.

And higher prices might help achieve a better valuation if and when the kingdom tries to sell shares in its national oil company, Saudi Aramco.

Averting a renewed shale boom suggests the kingdom should focus on adding production to keep prices below $60.

But revenue maximisation and the looming sale of oil company shares argues for letting prices rise above $60 in 2018.

Policymakers are likely to adopt a mixed strategy and opt for some combination of both increased output and higher prices.

OPEC has never been great at fine-tuning and the track record suggests prices are likely to overshoot on the upside.

Once prices have overshot, the cycle can begin all over again.",Column: OPEC must think about exit strategy,https://www.reuters.com/article/oil-opec-kemp/column-opec-must-think-about-exit-strategy-idINKBN1CU2BQ

Debating an emergency motion calling on authorities to beef up rules and enforcement of gender equality laws and sanctions for abuse in workplaces across Europe, members of the European Parliament also demanded the EU legislature stop turning a blind eye to “disgusting” practices by some of their own colleagues.

“Here, today, in the very heart of European democracy, we have women being molested and harassed,” Polish member Jadwiga Wisniewska told the chamber. “This is unimaginable.”

This month’s allegations about Hollywood producer Weinstein - who denies all accusations of non-consensual sex - has set off a wave of reflection about sexual harassment in Europe as in other parts of the world.

Several MEPs held signs bearing the Twitter hashtag #metoo. “I have been sexually harassed, just like millions of other women in the European Union,” German member Terry Reintke said.

“It is about time that we very clearly say that we should not be ashamed. The perpetrators should be ashamed.”

In the EU institutions themselves, with an unusual mix of powerful hierarchies, politics and a culturally diverse workforce drawn from across the continent, women are accusing managers of doing too little for too long to stamp out abuse.

“We’ve all heard the stories and rumors going on for many years,” Britain’s Margot Parker said during the debate in Strasbourg, the Brussels-based parliament’s second home.

“The very place that claims to legislate against this sort of disgusting behavior is turning a blind eye to its practice.”

This week, Parliament President Antonio Tajani spoke of his “shock and indignation” after a Sunday Times report on more than a dozen mostly young female parliamentary aides who complained of groping, stalking and other harassment by male lawmakers.

He pledged to step up existing protections to encourage people to come forward, something campaigners say is overdue.

“NO SURPRISE”

“It comes as no surprise to those of us working for years on the fight to end violence against women that sexual harassment is also widespread throughout the EU institutions,” said the European Women’s Lobby, a Brussels-based, pan-European organization.

“There is still inadequate means to ensure that women still feel safe enough to come forward to report incidences.”

At the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU which employs 32,000 people, 55 percent of them women, measures have been in place since 2006 to prevent any form of harassment and to protect whistleblowers.

Over the past five years an average of 13 complaints have been made each year, with disciplinary sanctions being imposed in about four cases each year, Commission figures show.

Commenting on those figures, European Women’s Lobby secretary-general Joanna Maycock, told Reuters that the number of complaints seemed “very low” for the size of the workforce.

The Commission’s gender equality chief, Czech Commissioner Vera Jourova, said last week that she had herself been a victim of sexual harassment in the past but saw “stigmatization” as preventing many women in Brussels from speaking up.

The Weinstein affair was, she feared, the “peak of the iceberg”.

Jourova was speaking to Brussels’ Politico news service, which has set up a confidential website that has garnered more than 30 allegations in a week, from both women and men, of offences including rape, connected to the European Parliament.",EU too?

But an Iraqi military spokesman suggested an offensive - launched to wrest back territory after Kurds voted overwhelmingly for independence in a referendum in September - would continue regardless.

The Iraqi government has transformed the balance of power in the north of the country since launching its campaign last week against the Kurds, who govern an autonomous region of three northern provinces and had held a swathe of other territory.

“The fighting between the two sides will not produce a victory for any, it will take the country to total destruction,” the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) said in a statement.

The KRG proposed an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and “starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi Constitution”.

Baghdad has always considered the Kurdish secession referendum illegal. It responded last week by seizing back the city of Kirkuk, the oil-producing areas around it and other territory that the Kurds had captured from militant group Islamic State.

In a brief social media comment hinting that the campaign would continue, an Iraqi military spokesman said: “Military operations are not connected to politics.”

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has said the KRG should cancel the vote’s outcome as a pre-condition for talks. Several Shi‘ite members of parliament on Wednesday asked him to stick to his position and not to accept just a freeze of the referendum.

On Wednesday, Abadi began an official visit to neighboring Turkey and Iran. Turkey and Iran both have Kurdish populations of their own and have supported Baghdad taking a hard line on the referendum.

Now that the Kurds have swiftly yielded most of their territory outside of their autonomous region to the advancing Iraqi forces, there are signs of pressure easing. Iran announced the reopening of one of the border crossings with the Kurdistan region, which it had closed earlier this month in support of the Iraqi government.

In Ankara, President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was ready to give all support to Baghdad as it seeks to reopen a crude oil pipeline from the Kirkuk oilfields to Turkey. The pipeline goes through the Kurdish autonomous region. Iraq had stopped shipping oil through it when the Kurds took Kirkuk in 2014.

In a statement to media after meeting Abadi, Erdogan said they discussed what political, military and economic steps they could take after what he called the “illegitimate” Iraqi Kurdish referendum last month.

STRATEGICALLY VITAL

Abadi has ordered his army to recapture all disputed territory and has demanded central control of Iraq’s border crossings with Turkey, which are all located inside the Kurdish autonomous region.

Kurdish Peshmerga forces beat back an advance by Iranian-backed pro-government paramilitaries on Tuesday in the region of Rabi‘a, 40 km (25 miles) south of the Fish-Khabur border area with Turkey and Syria, Kurdish officials said.

Fish-Khabur is strategically vital because oil from both Kurdish and government-held parts of northern Iraq crosses via a pipeline there into Turkey, the main route out of the area for the exports that are crucial to any Kurdish independence bid.

The fighting so far has taken place outside the Kurdish autonomous region, but Fish-Khabur is inside it.

The fighting between the central government and the Kurds is particularly tricky for the United States which is a close ally of both sides, arming and training both the Kurds and the central government’s army to fight Islamic State.

U.S. Ambassador Douglas Silliman “worked with Iraqi security forces and Kurdish Peshmerga to end clashes endangering a Christian community and other civilians” north of Mosul, Washington’s Baghdad embassy said on its Twitter account.

The Iraqi government’s advance over the past week has been achieved with comparatively little violence, with Kurds mostly withdrawing without a fight.

But it caused Kurds to flee en masse from Tuz Khurmato, a multi-ethnic city south of Kirkuk where sectarian tension flared after Iraqi forces took control, humanitarian organizations said.Most of those displaced, estimated at nearly 30,000, are in need of urgent aid and staying in open shelters, officials from two international humanitarian organizations told Reuters.

Abadi pledged in an interview to the Wall Street Journal to disarm Shiite militias that refuse to come under his control after Islamic State’s defeat.

Iraqi forces are preparing in parallel an offensive to recapture the last patch of Iraqi territory still in the hands of Islamic State, on the border with Syria, the military said on Wednesday.

The militant group also holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is also shrinking there as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi‘ite militias backed by Iran and Russia.","Kurds offer to suspend independence drive, seek talks with Baghdad",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CT37K

Zverev’s stunning year, during which he briefly rose to number four in the rankings, means the 20-year-old has qualified for both season-enders, and something had to give.

“I have consulted with my team and in order to best prepare for London, we have made the decision that it is best not to play the week before in Milan,” Zverev told the ATP’s website.

“Therefore, sadly, I will be withdrawing from the Next Gen ATP Finals. However, I still plan on making an appearance at the beginning of the event to support the tournament and show my appreciation for my fans in Italy that were so supportive during my win in Rome earlier this year.”

Zverev’s withdrawal is a blow for the new event, although the back-to-back schedule would have made it extremely tough for the German to have competed at both.

He has won five titles this year and is the youngest player to qualify for the ATP World Tour Finals for 10 years.

The Next Gen Finals were launched this year to showcase the top players aged 21 and under.

It will feature shortened sets, shot clocks and no advantage scoring as the ATP tries out new innovations to appeal to a younger generation of tennis fans.

The line-up will be Russians Andrey Rublev, Karen Khachanov and Daniil Medvedev, Canadian Denis Shapovalov, American Jared Donaldson, Croatian Borna Coric and South Korea’s Hyeon Chung plus the winner of an Italian under-21 event as a wildcard.

As part of the plan RCom said its 4G services will run through an existing deal to share radio spectrum with Reliance Jio, the 4G network owned by Reliance Industries which sparked a price war when it opened for business last year.

Reliance Industries is controlled by Mukesh Ambani, the older brother of RCom’s main owner Anil Ambani.

Earlier this month, RCom said it would evaluate an alternative plan for the mobile business after a deal fell through to merge the unit with rival Aircel.

The company, which has $6.7 billion of debt, won a temporary reprieve from its lenders on its debt-servicing obligations in June. RCom has agreed to give the banks stakes in the company by swapping part of the debt for equity.

It was initially banking on the wireless merger deal and a separate deal to sell a stake in its radio masts infrastructure business to cut its debt load by 60 percent. After the wireless deal fell apart RCom said it would also amend the masts deal with Canada’s Brookfield Infrastructure.

On Wednesday, RCom said it will be “optimizing its 2G and 3G footprint, and related infrastructure and human resources” with effect from Nov. 30, without elaborating further.

With the Republican-controlled Congress’s attempts to roll back laws introduced in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis largely stalled, banks are looking to regulators, particularly the U.S. central bank, to loosen the reins through rule tweaks and more lenient supervision.

Quarles, a former Wall Street lawyer and private equity investor nominated to the Fed by Trump last summer and sworn in this month, will have the most influence in such efforts due to the central bank’s extensive financial oversight powers.

“Normally, when you get a new governor at the Fed, you don’t see anything for a few months,” said Wayne Abernathy, executive vice president at the American Bankers Association and a former colleague of Quarles at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush.

“I think the expectations for Quarles are higher, because there was so much fanfare about the position. He’s going to feel some kind of pressure to show something.”

The Fed declined to comment.

With Quarles on board, banks and analysts expect the Fed to ease aspects of everyday examination and supervision, in particular reducing the number of post-inspection notices demanding fixes to technical compliance issues, ranging from sales practices to outsourcing contracts.

These ‘Matters Requiring Attention’ notices were originally conceived to raise specific concerns but are increasingly being used by watchdogs to police hundreds of activities, bogging down boards and senior managers in paperwork.

The Treasury has also identified several areas where the Fed has unilateral power to ease the liquidity and capital requirements on foreign banks operating in the United States, in some cases by simply deferring to their home rules.

The Fed’s annual stress tests analyzing how a bank would cope with market shocks - known as CCAR - are another key area where Quarles is likely to quickly make his mark.

“Now that Randal Quarles is in place, what we expect is that in fairly short order there will be some modifications to the way the CCAR works, because that is something that can largely be done at the behest of supervision,” Guy Moszkowski, managing partner at financial analyst firm Autonomous Research, told a conference on Tuesday.

STRESS TEST OVERHAUL

Quarles, who turned 60 last month, will be the first vice chair of banking supervision, a role created after the financial crisis but never filled during President Barack Obama’s administration. He will also serve as a Fed governor.

Former Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo effectively ran banking supervision until he stepped down in February, overseeing a strict implementation of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and administering rigorous “stress tests.”

Banks have complained that the testing process, which combines both quantitative and qualitative information, is too opaque, based on overly-conservative assumptions, and insensitive to different business models.

The Fed has indicated it is willing to refine stress tests, but Quarles is expected to push ahead with an overhaul - making the assumptions more generous, giving banks more information on the models, or moving to a less onerous two-year cycle. He is also likely to phase-out the qualitative aspect of the tests which gives the Fed wide-ranging discretion to fail lenders, bank lobbyists said.

The effort will be no cakewalk.

Quarles will be closely scrutinized by Democrats and consumer advocacy groups who are worried that deregulation will allow banks to return to their pre-crisis risky behavior.

Dodd-Frank does not give Quarles extensive unilateral powers, and he will have to get approval from the Fed board for any major changes, such as easing capital rules.

Trump is also expected to name a new Fed chief in the next couple of weeks. The front-runners, current Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford University economist John Taylor, have both said there is a need to reduce the regulatory burden on banks and are expected to support Quarles’ efforts.

But for other measures, including relaxing the Volcker rule, which restricted banks’ ability to trade with their own cash, other regulators will also need to agree.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), currently headed by an Obama-era appointee who has generally opposed rolling back rules, is expected to be a drag on the inter-agency process until a Trump pick is named and confirmed as a replacement, likely this spring. Reaching an agreement even then will be tough, say lawyers, due to the complexity of the rule, which is hundreds of pages long.

Still, those who know Quarles believe he is well-suited in terms of experience and personality to navigate the Fed’s halls of power. They point to his success in helping to negotiate trade deals during his time at the Treasury.

“He isn’t the kind of person that bows to consensus,” said the ABA’s Abernathy. “He’s the type of person who makes consensus.”",Banks rest hopes for lighter regulatory burden on Fed's Quarles,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-fed-quarles/banks-rest-hopes-for-lighter-regulatory-burden-on-feds-quarles-idUKKBN1CU30K?il=0

Davis was addressing confusion caused by Prime Minister Theresa May this week over the exit timetable, but he then stumbled into a new row about when lawmakers would get to vote on a final deal. His department later issued a clarification.

May is seeking a so-called implementation period of around two years after Britain’s exit from the EU in March 2019, during which its access to the EU single market would stay largely unchanged while new arrangements are put in place.

“I would be aiming to get certainly the outlines of it agreed, if we could, in the first quarter (of 2018) ... but it’s a negotiation,” Davis told a parliamentary committee.

Earlier this week May unnerved corporate executives, keen to know the trading rules they will face, by saying any transitional deal would not be agreed until the entire exit agreement was sealed, more likely towards the end of 2018.

Last week EU leaders said at a summit that they would begin preparations to move into “phase two” of the Brexit negotiations in December, a step forward that would allow London to discuss its future trade relationship with the bloc.

Davis said he expected to receive guidance from the EU on its approach to a transitional period by December, and that a deal allowing Britain to maintain conditions similar to the status quo would be struck quickly afterwards.

PARLIAMENTARY VOTE

However, having reassured businesses on the trade deal, Davis then angered lawmakers by suggesting the EU would push negotiations right up to the end of March 2019, meaning parliament might have to vote to approve the exit deal after Britain had already departed the bloc.

Political opponents accused the government of trying to subvert democracy by not giving parliament a proper say.

A spokeswoman for Davis’ department later issued a clarification, saying the government was working to get the final deal agreed by October 2018 and that it intended to give lawmakers a vote before Britain left.

“This morning the Secretary of State (Davis) was asked about hypothetical scenarios. (Chief EU negotiator) Michel Barnier has said he hopes to get the deal agreed by October 2018 and that is our aim as well,” the spokeswoman said.

May is already facing a rough ride in parliament on her minority government’s key piece of Brexit legislation, which is on hold while ministers plow through hundreds of proposed amendments - some of which have enough support to inflict an embarrassing defeat.

“This U-turn exposes another self-created shambles in government over Brexit,” Pat McFadden, an opposition lawmaker, said in a statement issued by the pro-European campaign group Open Britain.

TRADE DEAL DIFFERENCES

Despite Davis’s comments on the transition deal, Britain and the EU remain at odds on the overall timeline of the negotiations, which incorporate a withdrawal deal on the terms of the divorce, the transitional deal, and a future trade deal.

Britain wants to finish everything by the time it leaves in early 2019, while the EU thinks it could take until 2020 to tie up trade terms.

Davis said he believed Britain would be able to seal a trade and customs arrangement by the end of the two-year exit process, adding that it was important to do so to avoid getting trapped in a protracted negotiation.

“It’s not a good position to get into to be still negotiating during such an arrangement,” Davis said. “If we were doing the negotiation during a period of transition, I suspect what we would get offered is a year extension and another year extension, each time paying a fee.”

An EU official said on Tuesday that the EU will only negotiate on the details of a free trade deal after Britain has actually left in March 2019 because the EU’s own laws do not allow it to negotiate trade agreements with its own members.

Asked about this approach, Davis said a trade deal could be signed “a nanosecond” after Britain leaves, implying that he hoped for a more flexible approach from Brussels.","Amid Brexit timetable confusion, UK aims for transition outline by early 2018",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CU0YH-OCATP

More than 600,000 of Myanmar’s largely stateless Rohingya minority have crossed to Bangladesh since Aug. 25 attacks by Rohingya militants sparked a military crackdown beset by allegations of killings, rape and arson by security forces.

The U.N. has called the army operation “ethnic cleansing”. Myanmar has denied the majority of allegations and said it will accept the return of those who can prove they are residents.

A regional administrator and an activist told Reuters a group of about 10 Myanmar nationals working for U.S.- and Britain- based charity Relief International (R.I.) was forced to turn back when residents of the mostly Buddhist ethnic Rakhine community staged a protest in the town of Myebon.

Reuters reported this month that activists among the town’s Buddhist majority had stepped up efforts to segregate Buddhists and Muslims, instructing Rakhines not to trade with Muslims, for fear of militancy.

Deliveries of food aid to Myebon’s Muslims have been delayed and only allowed in after inspections by Buddhist community representatives.

“The R.I. group were trying to go to the camp and the locals blocked the way,” said Tin Shwe, the town’s administrator, adding that the aid workers returned to their office after Wednesday’s incident.

Samir Maleh, country director for Relief International in Myanmar, declined to comment on the incident.

Leaders of the Rakhine Buddhist community have long bristled at international agencies and NGOs whom they accuse of favouring the Rohingya with their support.

Aid workers and U.N. staff have told Reuters they fear enforced segregation may trigger further displacement in Rakhine, either through fresh violence or as Muslims flee on boats to Malaysia and Thailand, fuelling a new stage of crisis in the Bay of Bengal.

Wednesday’s incident was the latest example of the numerous obstacles that humanitarian organizations face in Rakhine State, said Pierre Peron, a spokesman for the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

“Of course we respect that any group should be able to exercise their rights of freedom of speech and peaceful assembly, but the simple fact here is that life-saving aid is being blocked from reaching vulnerable people who desperately need it, including children and the elderly.”

About 3,000 Muslims - including Rohingya and those accepted as Myanmar citizens - have been confined to a camp for displaced people in Myebon since communal violence swept Rakhine in 2012.

Photos posted on social media site Facebook on Wednesday showed about two dozen women sitting down to block a small street, with a smaller group of men standing behind.

Khin Thein, a leader of a regional branch of the Arakan Women’s Network, said her group joined the protest after authorities told the community the NGO would provide education about gender-based violence, hygiene and sanitation to Muslims.

”They have food, they have shelter to live,“ she told Reuters. ”We can’t accept these kinds of excess things for them.

We will not allow them to pass through our township. We already protested several times in the past. We have suspicions about them. We don’t trust foreigners, international people.”","In Myanmar's Rakhine, aid workers blocked from entering Muslim camp amid tension",https://in.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya/in-myanmars-rakhine-aid-workers-blocked-from-entering-muslim-camp-amid-tension-idINKBN1CU1PZ

Brent crude edged up after top exporter Saudi Arabia reiterated its determination to end a three-year supply glut.

The deep draw in gasoline inventories came even as refining output rose, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This suggested demand remained strong after the peak U.S. driving season.

Crude inventories rose by 856,000 barrels in the week to Oct. 20, the EIA said. Analysts had expected a decrease of 2.6 million barrels. Production rebounded from a falloff due to Hurricane Nate, and imports rose.

Brent crude futures settled up 11 cents at $58.44 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 29 cents to $52.18.

The EIA data showed gasoline and distillate inventories both fell by more than 5 million barrels, and refinery utilization rates rose 3.3 percentage points.

RBOB futures rose 1.1 percent to $1.7341 a gallon. Heating oil futures got a brief boost but settled slightly lower.

“Demand has been a little stronger than some people might have anticipated as we pushed out of the driving season, and that’s where today’s strength is coming from,” said Gene McGillian, manager of research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn.

On Tuesday, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih on Tuesday raised the prospect of prolonged output restraint even after the end of an OPEC-led pact to cut supplies.

Even as global inventory levels are falling, Brent has remained below $60 a barrel, partly on concern the crude glut may grow again after March 2018, when the output reduction deal is due to end.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers have cut oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). OPEC’s next meeting is on Nov. 7 in Vienna, Austria, when they will consider extending the deal.

While other producers cut output, U.S. production rebounded to 9.5 million bpd in the latest week. U.S. crude exports have averaged 1.7 million barrels a day over the past four weeks, the highest ever.

“Saudi Arabia’s determination to rebalance the market, together with ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, will remain supportive of oil prices,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.

“However, rising oil production in the U.S. and persistently high exports from the country will be the key bearish factors.”

Disruptions to exports from Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer, have supported oil.

“No decision has been made and no candidate has been ruled out but Gary’s role is too crucial to getting tax reform done. It might be too important for him to continue to be the lead, for him to announce a change at this time,” the official said.

The Republican president is looking to announce a Fed chair nominee before leaving on a trip to Asia on Nov. 3, in order to give his choice time to go through the Senate confirmation process. Current Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s term ends in early February.

But an announcement is unlikely this week, said another source familiar with the situation.

Trump told Republican senators during a private lunch on Tuesday that his focus for a new Fed chair was on Stanford University economist John Taylor, Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Yellen, a source familiar with the meeting said.

When Trump asked the senators for a show of hands on whether they would prefer Taylor or Powell, the most support went for Taylor, the source said.

Cohn irritated Trump by criticizing the president’s response to violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August at a white supremacist rally.

But the two men in recent weeks seemed to have ironed out their differences, with Trump singling out Cohn for praise for his help in the tax reform effort.

Trump is also considering a fifth candidate for the Fed job, former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, sources have said.

Trump told Fox Business Network that he admired Yellen but that the decision to pick a new Fed chair was something to which he would like to contribute.

NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart told a conference call that a meeting between the league, the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) and players will be held early next week and that he expected the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback to be invited.

“He has been in discussion with the players coalition. I expect he will be invited to this meeting,” Lockhart said of Kaepernick, who began kneeling last year as a way to protest against racial injustice in the United States.

“We look forward to him joining the conversation with the NFLPA, the league and players coalition but I don’t have any confirmation that he is planning to attend.”

The players coalition, which is a group led by NFL players, invites players to the events.

Former San Francisco 49er quarterback Kaepernick, 29, has been unemployed this season despite injuries at other teams that have created job openings. Some experts attribute his political activism as the key reason teams are wary of signing him.

He opted out of his contract with the 49ers in the offseason but has said his agent reached out to all 32 teams to make sure they were aware of his interest in playing this season.

His political stance has inspired many NFL players to kneel in protest during renditions of the national anthem, most notably last month after U.S. President Donald Trump said kneeling players should be fired for disrespecting the country.

The NFL weighed the fervor of players protesting about racism against Trump’s anger during a regularly scheduled autumn meeting in New York City last week that was attended by team owners, players and their union’s leaders.

At that meeting the NFL did not seek commitments from its players to stop kneeling during pre-game renditions of the national anthem but rather focused on helping them in their political activism and said they would meet again soon.

Domino, who for a while was mistakenly thought to have been killed when Hurricane Katrina devastated his New Orleans neighborhood in 2005, died at home on Tuesday of natural causes, the Jefferson Parish Coroner’s Office said.

As one of the pioneers of rock ‘n’ roll in the 1950s, Domino sold 65 million records - more than anyone in that period except Elvis Presley, according to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

He had dozens of songs on the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts, including “Blueberry Hill,” “Ain’t That a Shame,” “Blue Monday,” “I‘m Walkin’,” “Whole Lotta Loving,” “Hello, Josephine,” “Walking to New Orleans,” “I‘m Gonna Be a Wheel Some Day” and “Let the Four Winds Blow.”

“For lack of a better way of putting it, he’s a living, walking legend among us in New Orleans,” singer Irma Thomas told the New York Times in 2007. “Between him and Louis Armstrong, they were the first big names to put us on the musical map.”

Antoine Dominique Domino was born on Feb. 26, 1928 in New Orleans and one of nine children. A brother-in-law taught him piano, leading to a style that mixed the classic New Orleans sound with blues, country and Cajun music. He was performing in nightclubs while still a teenager and soon teamed with trumpet player Dave Bartholomew, who would become his co-writer and producer and help refine his piano style.

His nickname was attributed to his short, squatty stature, as well as a tribute to two other pianists - Fats Waller and New Orleans native Fats Pichon.

Like contemporaries Little Richard and Chuck Berry, Domino was a black performer whose music crossed over to white audiences and helped shape early rock.

His first hit was an R&B song, the autobiographical “The Fat Man,” recorded in 1949 and considered among the first songs in the rock ‘n’ roll genre.

Also like Little Richard, one of his biggest hits, “Ain’t That a Shame,” was later recorded by Pat Boone, a white singer, whose version received more radio airplay. A live version of the song by the rock band Cheap Trick was a hit in 1978.

Domino would be a huge influence on rockers who came after him - John Lennon told a New York radio station that “Ain’t That a Shame” was the first song he learned to play - but his prominence began to wane after the British invasion and other forms of rock took root in the 1960s.

Harry Connick Jr., from a later generation of New Orleans musicians, said on Twitter, “You helped pave the way for New Orleans piano players... see you on top of that blueberry hill in the sky.” Guitarist Vernon Reid of the band Living Color mourned Domino’s death by tweeting, “Rock & Roll lost part of it’s soul.”

In his later years Domino was reluctant to perform and rarely left his beloved hometown, but he did go to Indianola, Mississippi, in 2015 to play “Amazing Grace” at B.B. King’s funeral.

Domino was a longtime resident of New Orleans’ Ninth Ward - the section of the city hit hardest by Katrina’s floodwaters - and had resisted early pleas to evacuate as the hurricane approached. For a time he was believed to have died in the flooding and the words “R.I.P. Fats You will be missed” were spray-painted on his house, which was flooded up to the roof.

It was later learned that Domino and his family had been rescued by boat and taken to the refugee center set up at the Superdome in the city before going to Baton Rouge. They lost most of their possessions in the flood but managed to save Domino’s couch, which was custom-made from the rear end of a vintage pink Cadillac.

After Katrina, he moved to a New Orleans suburb to live with his daughter.

The Recording Industry of America late gave Domino reproductions to replace the 20 gold record awards he lost. His Grammy Awards also were replaced and President George W. Bush visited Domino to give him a new National Medal of the Arts.

Domino titled his 2006 album “Alive and Kickin’” and proceeds went to help rebuild New Orleans and preserve its musical heritage.

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday at the Superior Court in San Francisco, follows a widely read blog post in February from another female engineer that described Uber’s work environment as one that tolerated and fostered sexual harassment.

The lawsuit filed by Ingrid Avendano, Roxana del Toro Lopez and Ana Medina, who described themselves as Latina software engineers, says that Uber’s compensation and other practices discriminate against women and people of color. As a result, the three women have lost out on earnings, promotions and benefits, the lawsuit says.

Avendano and Toro Lopez left Uber this summer after more than two years with the company. Medina is still employed there, according to the lawsuit.

Uber spokesman Matthew Wing declined to comment.

The lawsuit describes an employee ranking system that is “not based on valid and reliable performance measures” and favors men and white or Asian employees. Women, Latino, American Indian and African American employees are given lower performance scores, making it more difficult for them to advance professionally and confining them to more menial tasks, according to the lawsuit.

“In this system, female employees and employees of color are systematically undervalued compared to their male and white or Asian American peers,” the lawsuit says.

Women, black and Latino employees also lose out on pay raises, bonuses, stock options, benefits and other wages because of the company’s discriminatory practices, the lawsuit alleges.

“These three engineers are seeking to ensure that Uber pays women and people of color equally for the hard work they’ve done – and will continue to do – to help make Uber successful,” said lawyer Jahan Sagafi of Outten & Golden which is representing the plaintiffs.

Outten & Golden have also represented employees in gender discrimination lawsuits against Goldman Sachs and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

Avendano and Toro Lopez brought their complaints to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency this summer, an administrative step that precedes a public lawsuit. News site The Information reported on the complaint Tuesday.

In August, Uber made a series of changes to address pay equity, including increasing pay of employees who were paid below the median salary for their job and providing an annual 2.5 percent raise.","Three women sue Uber in San Francisco claiming unequal pay, benefits",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-lawsuit/three-women-sue-uber-in-san-francisco-claiming-unequal-pay-benefits-idUSKBN1CU2Z1?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

After years of investing in hydrogen fuel cells and electric-gasoline hybrids, Japanese manufacturers are talking up all-battery electric vehicles (EVs) at the annual gathering.

Many are looking to catch up with global rivals amid rapidly tightening global emissions regulations and improving technology that may make EV batteries a price-competitive option to gasoline engines in the coming years.

“As far as green cars go, vehicle powertrain electrification is a must,” said Soichiro Okudaira, president of Daihatsu Motor Co, a fully owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp, which showed its concept of the “Pro Cargo” multi-use mini electric van at the show’s first media day on Wednesday .

“EV (technology) is a great match with small cars people use everyday to commute, go shopping, because it’s easy to charge and maintain.”

Even Toyota, the country’s largest automaker which set up an EV development team just a year ago, said pure EVs would be one of the “key solutions” for cleaner vehicles in the near future.

Still, the maker of the Mirai fuel cell vehicle (FCV) is sticking to its view that the hydrogen fuel cell is the ultimate “green car” technology.

Analysts say FCVs can refuel faster than an EV can recharge and can travel longer distances, making them a potentially attractive option for larger vehicles - though the cost and limited refuelling infrastructure pose challenges.

Underlining its point, Toyota introduced two new FCVs at the show: the six-seater “Fine-Comfort Ride” concept car, and the “Sora” fuel-cell bus, which will be launched next year.

TIPPING POINT

Honda Motor Co on Wednesday announced it would launch a compact EV in Japan in 2020, following Nissan Motor Co, long a proponent of EVs and maker of the Leaf, the world’s best-selling battery electric car launched in 2010.

Slideshow (7 Images)

As advances in lithium ion battery technology improve charging times and lower production costs, some automakers and suppliers expect increased demand will boost EV sales within the next decade, lowering their price towards gasoline vehicles.

“We see this tipping point happening around 2025. By then for the customer to buy petrol or EV it will be practically same cost,” Nissan Executive Vice President Daniele Schillaci said.

“And then ... if you have the same price for EVs and petrol why would you buy traditional technology?”

While global automakers acknowledge the internal combustion engine may become obsolete in the coming decades, smaller automaker Mazda Motor Corp continues to squeeze more efficiency out of gasoline engines, developing its spark-ignition compression engine which it says could improve fuel economy by as much as 30 percent.

Others argue that reports of the death of the gasoline engine have been greatly exaggerated.

“Many in the media appear to be saying that EVs are going to take over the world, but given ongoing technology and cost limitations, it will be difficult for that to happen anytime soon,” Subaru Corp CEO Yasuyuki Yoshinaga said.","Japanese carmakers warm to EVs, but still see role for hydrogen",https://www.reuters.com/article/autosho-tokyo-ev/japanese-carmakers-warm-to-evs-but-still-see-role-for-hydrogen-idINKBN1CU1YI

The world’s largest biotechnology company also raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to $12.50 to $12.70 per share from its earlier view of $12.15 to $12.65, despite taking a financial hit to its Puerto Rico operations from Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island last month.

Analysts on average were looking for 2017 earnings of $12.58 per share, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Amgen estimated the cost to 2017 earnings of cleanup, repair and restoring full operations in Puerto Rico would be 15 cents to 18 cents per share over the third and fourth quarters, with no expected disruption to product supply.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

Wozniacki had started her fifth appearance at the season-ending tournament with a 6-2 6-0 victory over Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina and Romania’s Halep appeared equally as powerless against the 27-year-old former number one.

The Dane’s victory margin assured her of a last-four berth after the loss of four games in two matches while Halep lives to fight another day with her opening straight-sets win over Caroline Garcia giving her a 1-1 record in the Red Group.

Frenchwoman Garcia recovered from her opening loss to rally past Svitolina with an epic 6-7(7) 6-3 7-5 victory later in the day, a result that leaves the other three women in the group all with a chance of joining Wozniacki in the semis.

Wozniacki has been the form player on the WTA Tour this season, winning 58 matches, reaching seven finals and claiming one tournament victory in Tokyo last month.

The rankings show Halep as the world leader and Wozniacki in sixth but the Romanian was utterly outclassed as her opponent raced through the first set in 23 minutes on the back of a 94 percent first serve success rate.

“I think I played really well today and stayed aggressive throughout. I didn’t expect to be leading by that much in the first set and I started to think ‘what’s happening? Am I really playing that well?',” Wozniacki said in a courtside interview.

Halep had been as much a spectator as the stunned crowd packed into the Singapore Indoor Stadium and although she tried to rouse herself after getting to 30-30 in the first game of the second set, Wozniacki held firm for a 1-0 lead.

FLEETING RESPITE

The Dane had won 17 games in a row across her last two matches before Halep finally got on the scoreboard after 34 minutes when she held to love.

The respite was fleeting, however, as Wozniacki continued to punish Halep’s scrappy forehand to break for a 3-1 lead and an ace snuffed out the only break point the Dane faced all match as she moved within two games of victory.

Another forehand error handed Wozniacki a match point after a little more than an hour, which she duly converted with a forehand winner.

“I just stayed positive, took the ball early and went for my shots,” the Dane added. “It’s a great court for me as I was putting spin on the ball to get in position for my shots and wait for the right opportunities to hit my winners.”

Garcia was the more aggressive of two well-matched players, even forging a pair of set points in the opening tiebreak, but sloppy forehand errors handed Svitolina the initiative as she edged the tightest of first sets.

Svitolina broke early in the second to assume control until Garcia threw caution to the wind, after shedding a few tears following a pep-talk from her father and coach Louis-Paul, and reeled off five of the next six games to level the match.

The decider followed a similar pattern to the second set with Svitolina keeping her nose ahead until Garcia fought back through a barrage of winners to reel off the last four games and seal her first WTA Finals victory.

Reuters analysis of federal jobs data shows that out of 656,000 new manufacturing jobs created between 2010 and 2014, two thirds can be attributed to foreign direct investment.

More recent jobs numbers are not yet available, but over $700 billion in foreign capital has poured in over the last two years bringing total foreign investment to $3.7 trillion at the end of 2016, a world record.

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday at the Superior Court in San Francisco, follows a widely read blog post in February from another female engineer that described Uber’s work environment as one that tolerated and fostered sexual harassment.

The lawsuit filed by Ingrid Avendano, Roxana del Toro Lopez and Ana Medina, who described themselves as Latina software engineers, says that Uber’s compensation and other practices discriminate against women and people of color. As a result, the three women have lost out on earnings, promotions and benefits, the lawsuit says.

Avendano and Toro Lopez left Uber this summer after more than two years with the company. Medina is still employed there, according to the lawsuit.

Uber spokesman Matthew Wing declined to comment.

The lawsuit describes an employee ranking system that is “not based on valid and reliable performance measures” and favors men and white or Asian employees. Women, Latino, American Indian and African American employees are given lower performance scores, making it more difficult for them to advance professionally and confining them to more menial tasks, according to the lawsuit.

“In this system, female employees and employees of color are systematically undervalued compared to their male and white or Asian American peers,” the lawsuit says.

Women, black and Latino employees also lose out on pay raises, bonuses, stock options, benefits and other wages because of the company’s discriminatory practices, the lawsuit alleges.

“These three engineers are seeking to ensure that Uber pays women and people of color equally for the hard work they’ve done – and will continue to do – to help make Uber successful,” said lawyer Jahan Sagafi of Outten & Golden which is representing the plaintiffs.

Outten & Golden have also represented employees in gender discrimination lawsuits against Goldman Sachs and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

Avendano and Toro Lopez brought their complaints to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency this summer, an administrative step that precedes a public lawsuit. News site The Information reported on the complaint Tuesday.

In August, Uber made a series of changes to address pay equity, including increasing pay of employees who were paid below the median salary for their job and providing an annual 2.5 percent raise.","Three women sue Uber in San Francisco claiming unequal pay, benefits",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-lawsuit/three-women-sue-uber-in-san-francisco-claiming-unequal-pay-benefits-idUKKBN1CU2Z1?il=0

Shares of the company, known for its trademark beaver logo, rustic casual wear and Canadian-made leather goods, opened at C$11.50, down 4.2 percent from their initial public offering price of C$12. They slumped 16.3 percent from the IPO price to C$10.05 at 1110 EST (1510 GMT).

FILE PHOTO: The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in New York, U.S. April 28, 2014. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo

Several global companies, including GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L), have expressed interest in bidding for the unit, which had sales of about $3.4 billion in 2016.

The prospective sale, which is being led by Centerview Partners, Guggenheim Securities and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), was first mooted on Oct. 10, when Pfizer said it was considering strategic options for the unit.

But preliminary discussions with interested parties including Reckitt have already taken place, one of the sources said, adding the U.S. drugmaker wants to get the ball rolling before the end of this year.

GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley confirmed on Wednesday she would look “carefully” at the business.

Three people familiar with the situation said the British drugmaker had hired Citi (C.N) to represent it in the auction. GSK declined to comment while Citi was not immediately available.

Other possible bidders could include Procter & Gamble (PG.N), Sanofi (SASY.PA), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Nestle (NESN.S), several sources said.

Pfizer plans to send out financial information about the consumer unit to prospective buyers in around three weeks time, one of the sources said.

The process is expected to heat up early next year as bids come in and a deal could be sealed around the middle of 2018, the source said.

Germany’s Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) is also looking to divest its consumer health business and has hired JP Morgan (JPM.N) to sell the unit, best known for making Seven Seas vitamins.

Some banking and industry sources said Merck could put the divestment on hold since the sale, estimated to be worth around $4.5 billion, risked being eclipsed by the Pfizer auction.

One source said Pfizer believed keen competition would allow it to raise at least $20 billion from the sale of the business, whose well-known brands include painkiller Advil, Centrum multivitamins and lip balm Chapstick.

As aging populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand for self-medication, the consumer health sector has proved a fertile ground for deal-making in recent years.

But the industry remains fragmented and GSK’s Walmsley said she expected more merger activity, with GSK in a strong position to act as a “consolidator”.

Although consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, they are typically very long-lasting brands with loyal customers.

Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said he was considering the sale of consumer healthcare because it was not integral to the core prescription drug business and might be worth more outside the group.

GSK has taken a different view, opting to retain a diverse portfolio in which consumer health offers a hedge against riskier prescription drugs.

For Reckitt, meanwhile, over-the-counter medicines offer higher-margin growth than its household business. Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor, who last week announced plans to separate Reckitt into health and home and hygiene divisions, said he would weigh a bid if Pfizer’s strategic review resulted in a sale.

The Greens, seen as closest to Macron on economic policy and Europe, appeared to have caved in to demands by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Free Democrats (FDP) that a new government continue down a path of fiscal discipline.

Merkel, whose conservatives placed first but lost seats in an election last month, is trying to forge a coalition with the pro-business FDP and the Greens, which requires bridging disagreements on taxes, immigration and foreign policy.

In a joint paper agreed after late-night talks on Tuesday, the parties said they all supported a balanced budget. A senior Greens politician who participated in the talks also told Reuters that the parties were united in opposing Macron’s idea for a euro zone budget.

“None of the participating parties support a euro zone budget,” said Reinhard Buetikofer, a member of the European Parliament.

The parties are expected to reconvene on Thursday to finalize a joint paper on Europe, after agreeing a rough blueprint for fiscal policy late on Tuesday.

That blueprint included a pledge to respect “debt brake” legislation enshrined in the constitution since 2009, which forces the federal government to virtually eliminate structural budget deficits, limiting them to 0.35 percent of GDP.

It also contained a commitment to provide relief to lower and middle income earners, dismantle the “solidarity tax” for poor eastern states and provide financial incentives to make German homes more energy efficient.

Cem Ozdemir, a leader of the Greens who is seen as a possible foreign minister in the new government, highlighted a decision to re-examine plans to raise defence spending by the outgoing “grand coalition” of Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD), who are moving into opposition.

Tax relief and investment needs would be finalised once more details on tax revenues become available next month, Ozdemir said, suggesting that the balanced budget commitment was not final.

“CAVE IN”

The Greens politician also said that a new coalition would have to provide a “pro-European” answer to proposals from Macron and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker for closer cooperation in fiscal matters, defence and migration.

“There are a lot of differences to overcome. But I am hoping for a clear commitment to Europe,” said Ozdemir in a video posted on the Greens website.

Buetikofer said the Greens supported the idea of boosting investment within the framework of the existing EU budget.

But their rejection of Macron’s idea for a separate budget for the euro zone at such an early stage of the coalition talks was seen by some members of the party as an unnecessary “cave in” to Merkel’s conservatives and the FDP.

Macron has called for the creation of a euro zone budget of several hundred billions of euros to help the single currency bloc cope with economic shocks.

One FDP participant who requested anonymity suggested that the Greens may have given away too much in the talks on Tuesday night and expressed concern that the leadership of the party could be forced to change tack in the days ahead by angry grass roots members.

Former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat who ruled with the Greens for seven years, accused the environmentalist party of “preparing Frau Merkel’s bed” in a desperate attempt to re-enter government.

Immigration could also be a contentious issue in the coalition talks as Merkel’s conservatives row back on the open-door policy towards refugees that she adopted in 2015. This will also be on the agenda on Thursday.",German coalition talks deal early blow to Macron on Europe,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-politics/german-coalition-talks-deal-early-blow-to-macron-on-europe-idUKKBN1CU0ON

In December, Congress will need to pass legislation to continue funding the federal government through the rest of the fiscal year that ends next Sept. 30.
Senate rules require a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat chamber to pass spending bills, and Republicans have a 52-48 majority.
In the House, Republican hard-liners often oppose spending legislation.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday he wants Congress to pass legislation to protect illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children but offered no timetable, with existing safeguards due to expire in March.

President Donald Trump last month rescinded a program created under his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama that protected the young adult illegal immigrants known as “Dreamers” from deportation and provided work permits.

Asked in a Reuters interview whether he thought Congress could tackle legislation this year to help the “Dreamers,” Ryan said the timing was unclear.

“I don’t know when we’re going to do it. We’re having lots of discussions on how to do it, and the timing is something that’s just open to debate.”

“I want to do it,” Ryan said. “The goal is: we want to fix this and we’re working on it, and we want to make sure that we do it in such a way that we don’t have the same problem down the road - that means border security and interior enforcement.”

The illegal immigrants protected under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program are primarily Hispanic young adults.

Winning passage of legislation to protect the Dreamers may not be easy, as Congress has struggled for years to approve immigration-related legislation.

Trump has taken a hard-line stance against illegal immigrants. Under Trump’s action, the protections for the Dreamers disappear in the first week of March. He urged lawmakers to come up with an alternative before the protections expire.

Trump took Republican congressional leaders by surprise last month when he met with top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and top House of Representatives Democrat Nancy Pelosi about a potential deal on DACA. Schumer and Pelosi came away from the meeting saying they had the outlines of an agreement with Trump, but his administration subsequently made demands that angered Democrats including for funding of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Democrats have said they see a budget vote in early December as a chance to try to force Republicans to accept legislation to help the Dreamers.

In December, Congress will need to pass legislation to continue funding the federal government through the rest of the fiscal year that ends next Sept. 30.

Republicans, who control both houses of Congress, will need Democratic votes to approve the spending bill. Senate rules require a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat chamber to pass spending bills, and Republicans have a 52-48 majority.

Haley was the first senior member of President Donald Trump’s administration to visit South Sudan, which spiraled into civil war in 2013, just two years after gaining independence from Sudan. She met one on one with Kiir for some 45 minutes.

“I let him know that the United States was at a crossroads and that every decision going forward was going to be based on his actions,” Haley told reporters after the meeting in the capital Juba.

The United Nations has warned that the violence in South Sudan, which has forced some 4 million people to flee their homes, was providing “fertile ground” for a genocide. Kiir’s government has denied U.N. allegations of ethnic cleansing.

Haley had to cut short a visit to a camp for South Sudanese displaced by the violence amid rowdy anti-Kiir protests.

“He understood that Americans were disappointed in his leadership in South Sudan, I made that very clear. And he understood that all the aid or help that he hopes will go forward is not a given,” she said.

Haley did not elaborate on what further action Washington could take, but said that Kiir “got what I was trying to say.” On Monday she said Washington was considering how to pressure Kiir into peace, though noted that withdrawing aid may not work.

The Trump administration last month imposed sanctions on two senior South Sudanese officials and the former army chief.

“We have lost trust in the government and we now need to regain that trust and the only way to regain that trust is through the actions of taking care of all of the people,” Haley told South Sudan’s Eye Radio.

PROTEST CUTS SHORT CAMP VISIT

She demanded that Kiir allow full and consistent humanitarian aid access and bring peace and stability to the country. She said she pushed a timeline for Kiir to act, but declined to elaborate.

Nhial Deng Nihal, a senior adviser to Kiir, said the president told Haley his government and a U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan had established “mechanisms that work jointly to improve and address the humanitarian problems.”

He also told reporters that Kiir said government troops “will also be observing a cessation of hostilities in order to create an atmosphere for dialogue.”

The civil war was sparked by a feud between Kiir, a Dinka, and his former deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer. It has plunged parts of the world’s youngest nation into famine.

A fragile peace deal broke down last year and Machar fled the country. He is being held in South Africa to stop him stirring up trouble, sources told Reuters in December.

Haley had to cut short a visit to a camp in Juba, where U.N. peacekeepers are protecting some 30,000 displaced people, after hundreds of rowdy pro-Machar protesters blocked nearby roads, yelling “Salva Kiir is a killer” and “Welcome USA.”

Protesters held a large sign that read “South Sudan IDPs (internally displaced people) and refugees love President Trump, the peacemaker and supporter of human rights.”

A spokeswoman for the U.N. mission said the protest “started to gain momentum after (Haley) left, IDPs became upset that she was not able to meet with them.” Haley was meeting with a displaced family when she had to leave early due to security concerns.

The previous U.S. administrations of President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama were heavily involved in the birth of South Sudan, which signed a peace accord with Sudan in 2005 and gained independence in 2011.","U.S. has lost trust in South Sudan, Trump envoy tells president",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-southsudan-usa/u-s-has-lost-trust-in-south-sudan-trump-envoy-tells-president-idUKKBN1CU2U0?il=0

Legislation introduced last week by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray would restore for two years subsidies to private insurers to help lower-income people buy insurance. President Donald Trump this month cut off those subsidies.

The bill also would provide states more flexibility to change some rules in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the signature legislative achievement of the Republican Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office previously estimated that various Republican proposals to repeal and replace Obamacare would cause more than 20 million people to lose health insurance. In contrast, the CBO on Wednesday said reinstating the subsidies, as called for in the Alexander-Murray bill, would not substantially alter the number of insured.

The CBO also estimated that the fix would not impact 2018 health insurance rates because they are already set. Health insurers said they raised premiums on average 20 percent to make up for the lost federal subsidies.

The CBO said it expected 2019 health insurance premiums to be lower with the insurer payments than without them.

While the Alexander-Murray legislation would reduce the federal deficit, the CBO previously found that eliminating the subsidies, called cost sharing reductions, would raise the federal deficit by $194 billion over a decade.

Because premiums would rise in the absence of the subsidies, the government would be compelled to spend more on financial assistance to low-income Americans.

About 20 million Americans obtained insurance through Obamacare and the law helped drive the U.S. uninsured rate to a record low, but Republicans have called it an unwarranted government intrusion in a healthcare system that represents a fifth of the U.S. economy.

It is unclear whether the Alexander-Murray bill will ever come to a vote in Congress. Trump has sent mixed signals about it, initially supporting it last week and then opposing it.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would not bring it up without Trump’s support. Trump has derided the insurer payments as a “bailout” and has vowed to let Obamacare “implode.”

“It does not bail out insurance companies, it does benefit consumers, it does benefit taxpayers to the tune of $3.8 billion,” Alexander said on Wednesday on the Senate floor.

Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies, but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income people.

Trump, who as a candidate promised to get rid of Obamacare, has been frustrated by the inability of a Congress led by his own party to pass a bill to repeal and replace it, and has taken steps that bypass lawmakers to chip away at the law.

House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan has signaled his opposition and on Wednesday said his chamber would not take up the matter or try again to pass broader Republican legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare this year.

With broad Democratic backing and the support of a dozen Republican senators, the Alexander-Murray bill has sufficient backing to exceed the 60 votes needed for passage in the 100-seat Senate, if McConnell allows it to come to a vote.

Two prominent Republicans in the House and Senate on Tuesday announced a competing Obamacare fix that is more conservative and appears to address many of the Trump administration’s objections to the Alexander-Murray proposal.

The proposal by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Republican Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, includes provisions to suspend requirements for individuals and employers to buy health coverage under Obamacare.

Ryan told Reuters in an interview he favored the Hatch-Brady proposal.",Bipartisan Obamacare fix would cut U.S. deficit: nonpartisan analysis,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-cbo/bipartisan-obamacare-fix-would-cut-u-s-deficit-nonpartisan-analysis-idUSKBN1CU2B9?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Air Canada Flight AC781, an A320 originating in Montreal, landed at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) on Sunday after receiving proper clearance only to learn that a subsequent message from air traffic control was not received by the crew, a spokeswoman for the airline said by email.

Air traffic control at SFO had instructed the Air Canada crew multiple times to execute a go-around because the controller was not certain that a preceding arrival would be completely clear of the runway before the jet was due to land, said FAA spokesman Ian Gregor.

“The Air Canada crew did not acknowledge any of the controller’s instructions,” Gregor said by email.

“Upon landing, the crew was informed the tower had attempted unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft, however, the message was not received by the crew,” Air Canada spokeswoman Isabelle Arthur wrote in a separate email.

The FAA was already investigating a separate incident from July after an Air Canada pilot lined up to land on a taxiway at SFO where four other planes were waiting to depart.

Gregor said a supervisor tried to alert Sunday’s flight by using a red light gun to alert the plane to go around, as is standard practice when an air crew is not responding to radio instructions. Instead, the flight landed, as previously authorized, on runway 28R at 9:26 p.m. PDT (0626 GMT).

These board committees are important for the merger because T-Mobile and Sprint are majority owned by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE) and Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) respectively, and could be left vulnerable to potential lawsuits from minority shareholders if they don’t establish independent mechanisms to review the deal.

Both T-Mobile and Sprint have formed committees comprising independent board directors to decide on whether the deal should be signed once the merger agreement has been finalized, which is expected in the next three weeks, the sources said.

The companies’ special board committees have also hired financial advisers to help them deliver fairness opinions, the sources added.

As with many all-stock mergers, T-Mobile and Sprint have decided there is no need to give their minority shareholders a vote on the deal, the sources said.

An alternative would have been to make the merger subject to approval by a majority of their minority shareholders. However, the companies’ advisers have determined this is not legally necessary, and could even jeopardize the deal were minority shareholders to organize against it, according to the sources.

Some T-Mobile minority shareholders believe Sprint should not be offered any premium for its shares, the sources said. However, T-Mobile and Sprint have tentatively agreed on a range for a stock exchange ratio which, even at its low end, would offer Sprint a modest premium to where its shares are trading currently, the sources added.

This could result in SoftBank and other Sprint shareholders holding close to 40 percent of the combined company based on where the shares are currently trading, the sources added. The exact share exchange ratio will be determined by looking at the volume-weighted average stock price of the companies over the last few months, one of the sources added.

T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s due diligence on each other is almost complete, and much of their focus now is on working out a business plan for the combined company, as well as an integration strategy, according to the sources.

Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank plan to accept the same terms in a merger as the other shareholders, the sources said.

Sprint, T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom declined to comment, while SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.

Sprint shares rose as much as 3 percent in New York on Wednesday morning, giving the company a market capitalization of around $28.5 billion, after it also reported a narrower quarterly loss than most analysts had estimated, and it added subscribers.

For the moment, there seems to be an easing in the historic tensions between the two main – and often warring – branches of Islam. Religious differences are not the focus; this is a classic geopolitical power struggle for control of Iraq, Syria, and Kurdistan, and for expanding diplomatic and strategic reach throughout the region.

Iran is lined up to be the big winner in Syria. Islamic State's defeat will significantly lessen Sunni influence, and Tehran’s role as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's protector will only increase now that it appears Assad will remain in control of some portion of the country. Iran will have pieced together a land corridor to the Mediterranean. The Saudis will be left with little influence.

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

The same goes for the United States. American forces have been largely relegated to playing traffic cop among various on-again off-again allies such as the Turks and Kurds, each with its own agenda in Syria. Any influence Washington thinks it still has is further diluted by the presence of the Russians, who are there to support Assad while maintaining a permanent presence in the heart of the Middle East. American efforts may wind up as little more than fumbling around to keep Israel and Jordan from overreacting to the increased Iranian influence on their borders.

In Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, Riyadh appears to be pivoting towards warmer relations with the Shi’ite government in Baghdad. That a Saudi airline is announcing the first return of direct service between the two countries since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 is no coincidence, nor is it an isolated event.

The Saudis also appear ready to take advantage of a looming intra-Shi’ite power struggle in Baghdad among Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, and Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Sadr, the most religiously zealous of the group, has always been something of a nationalist and is wary of Iranian influence. It is thus not surprising he made friendly trips under official invitation to Sunni Riyadh, and the United Arab Emirates, in recent months.

Sadr is an interesting choice for the Saudis to use to gain influence in Baghdad. Real progress for Riyadh means untangling years of close Iranian cooperation in Iraq, to include limiting the power of the Iranian-backed militias. Sadr has significant influence in that respect, and can use his popularity and credibility to sell Saudi cooperation to his followers who remember Saudi funding of al Qaeda in Iraq and Islamic State over the years. Enhancing Sadr's Shi’ite religious status can further Sunni Saudi goals. During his visit, the Saudis gifted Sadr with $10 million for “rebuilding,” and also astutely threw in some visas for this year’s Hajj pilgrimage for Sadr to distribute.

The Saudis otherwise have little to work with in Iraq compared to Iran. Tehran’s ties to officials in Baghdad are just a tiny part of a deep relationship forged in the bloody fight against the American occupiers and the ousting of Islamic State. Iranian money continues to support Iraq, and the Shi’ite militias are still mostly under Iranian influence.

Iran is also probably the most stable Muslim nation in the Middle East. It has existed more or less within its current borders for thousands of years, and is largely religiously, culturally, and linguistically homogeneous (though keep an eye on the Kurdish minority.) While governed in significant part by its clerics, the country has held a series of increasingly democratic elections. And unlike the Saudi monarchs, Iran’s leaders do not rule in fear of an Islamic revolution. They already had one.

Power struggles create flashpoints, and the Saudi-Iranian fight post-Islamic State is no exception. The Saudi-Iranian proxy war in Yemen has settled into a version of World War One-style trench warfare, with neither side strong enough to win nor weak enough to lose. In an ugly form of stasis, the conflict seems likely to stay within its present borders.

The powder keg is Kurdistan. Though arguably a de facto state since 2003, after the Kurds voted formally voted for independence in a Sept. 25 referendum, Iran and the Iranian-backed government in Baghdad were pressed to make clear they will not tolerate an actual Kurdish nation. With Islamic State nearly defeated and combat-tested Shi’ite militias ready for their next tasks, Tehran and Baghdad no longer need to keep the Kurds on their side. Fighting has already broken out around Kirkuk, an oil-rich city in Iraqi Kurdistan, between forces supported by Baghdad/Tehran and Kurdish fighters – leaving a gap for the Saudis to offer financial or covert support to the Iraqi Kurds.

Saudi involvement could morph an Iraqi civil war into a new proxy struggle right on Iran’s own western border, with the possible complication of further unrest inside Iran by its Kurdish minority.

While it may seem odd to write about the changing balance of power in the Middle East largely leaving out the United States, that may well describe America’s range of options post-Islamic State.

Washington’s influence in Baghdad is limited and relations with Iran are in shambles under the Trump administration. It is highly unlikely America will join Iran to fight against Kurdish allies who helped defeat Islamic State. Nor are American troops likely to battle Iranian-led militias in support of Kurdish independence that Washington says it doesn’t really support right now.

That leaves the United States sidelined, with few options other than perhaps supporting the Saudis from afar in whatever anti-Iranian meddling they do in Iraq.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

The pilot program aims to speed up the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles into the national airspace system and test drone detection and tracking while waiving some limits on their use.

Under a memorandum signed by Trump on Wednesday, states and local governments would be able to seek Federal Aviation Administration approval for testing and expanded use. The White House stopped short of proposing new regulations that would allow broader nationwide use of drones or any timetable for new authority.

White House adviser Michael Kratsios told reporters the “program will open the skies for delivery of life-saving medicines and commercial packages, inspections of critical infrastructure, support for emergency management operations.”

Kratsios said the program would allow companies and governments to operate drones in ways that are currently restricted by the FAA “including beyond-visual-line-of-sight flights, nighttime operations, and flights over people.”

Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc are among a growing number of companies hoping to make package delivery by drones a reality.

The memo said the Transportation Department could allow drone flights at up to 400 feet with the goal of approving at least five pilot projects. The program would expire in three years.

In 2016, the Obama administration opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use, but left in place significant restrictions.

The FAA estimates by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and commercial drones will grow tenfold to about 442,000.

In June, Trump told drone executives the administration wants “to create new companies and lots of jobs... We’re going to give you the competitive advantage that you need.”

In attendance were chief executives of drone companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and Precision Hawk Inc.

Drone manufacturers have argued that the administration should move faster to approve broader commercial use of drones and noted that the Transportation Department does pre-approve self-driving vehicle technologies.

But security concerns remain.

In September, a civilian drone struck and damaged a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter near Staten Island, New York.

This month, a drone hit an airplane landing at a Quebec City airport, the first time an unmanned flying object collided with commercial aircraft in Canada.

The FAA has banned drone flights over 133 U.S. military facilities and over 10 U.S. landmarks, including the Statue of Liberty in New York and Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota, at the request of national security and law enforcement agencies.

The memo said that the Transportation Department would coordinate with the Defense Department, Homeland Security and Justice Department to consider public safety and national security risks in approving pilot projects.

The Commercial Drone Alliance said it was “optimistic that the program will become a model for overcoming some of the hurdles keeping the full potential of commercial drones from being realized.”

Senator John Thune, a Republican, said the new policy “provides sensible direction that promotes drone safety, innovation, and local input.”",Trump administration program to test expanded drone use,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-drones/trump-administration-programme-to-test-expanded-drone-use-idUKKBN1CU2T9?il=0

But while money will unite leaders at this week’s European summit, it will divide them after Brexit.

The British government once hoped that the Oct. 19-20 meeting would be the moment when the Brexit negotiations could move on to discuss trade. That aspiration now seems hopeless. European leaders look set to insist on further delay until there is more progress in the first stage of talks, above all in reaching agreement on how much Britain will have to pay to settle its obligations when it leaves.

Political discord at the heart of the British government and the weakness of Theresa May following the loss of the Conservative majority in the general election have undoubtedly been hampering negotiations. Not unreasonably, European leaders worry about striking a deal with someone who might not be prime minister when Britain leaves the EU in 17 months’ time.

The EU holds the strongest cards because what matters most for Britain is its future trading arrangements with the huge market on its doorstep. The deadline under the Article 50 withdrawal procedure increases the EU’s leverage since Britain must leave with or without a deal in March 2019 (unless the 27 European states agree unanimously on an extension.) Despite hyped-up talk in London about preparing for no deal at all, Britain will do its utmost to avoid what would be a ruinous outcome, grounding flights to Europe and causing long hold-ups at border crossings, such as Dover on the south coast of England.

John Lloyd: We boomers are leaving a toxic legacy

If economic size and time favor the EU, the British government’s strongest card is money - one that it has played in various guises for centuries with its continental neighbors - and it is naturally reluctant to show its full hand too early. Even so May has already made an important concession. As part of the transition period of around two years that she called for in her emollient Florence speech last month, Britain would continue to pay in to the EU budget to ensure that none of the member states was out of pocket owing to the decision to leave. These net payments of around €10 billion ($11.8 billion) a year would fix the immediate problem facing the EU, the hole that would otherwise open up in its finances during the final two years of its current budgetary framework, which runs from 2014 to 2020.

But that extra money from aligning Britain’s effective date of departure with the end of the EU’s budgeting plan will not be enough, for two reasons. One is the way the EU in effect borrows from the future, by making spending commitments that it pays for later. In principle, the EU cannot borrow to pay for expenditure. But, through its accounting procedures, the EU can and does commit it to spending that will be paid for by future receipts from the member states.

What this means is that even after 2020 there will still be payments due on commitments made under the current seven-year spending plan. That pile of unpaid bills, eloquently called the reste ὰ liquider (the amount yet to be settled), is forecast to be €254 billion ($300 billion) at the end of 2020. Estimates of what Britain might owe towards this vary, but taking into account what might have been spent on British projects it could be around €20 billion ($23.6 billion).

On top of that – and the second main reason why the EU is holding out for more – the EU has liabilities, notably arising from the unfunded retirement benefits of European staff estimated at €67 billion ($79 billion) at the end of 2016, which it is expecting Britain to share. Even taking into account some potential offsets from its share of assets, Britain may face a bill of between €30 billion ($35 billion) and €40 billion ($47 billion) on top of the €20 billion ($23.6 billion) paid during the transition period.

Although money is Britain’s strongest card in the negotiations, there are political limits to the amount that the government can stump up. Brexit campaigners used inflated figures to exaggerate the money that could supposedly be switched into the health service from Britain’s contribution to the EU. That means the reality of having to pay a large exit bill could be electorally toxic. Yet in order to secure what really matters for Britain – access on reasonable terms to the huge European market – May’s government will have to confront the public with this cost.

The British predicament is so extreme and rifts between Conservative ministers over how much ground to concede so acute that a breakdown in the negotiations is conceivable later this year. With so much attention focused on the political drama playing out in London, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the EU will face a harsh budgetary future even with a substantial divorce settlement. Indeed the insistence that Britain pay up is a sign of the strains that will come to the fore after the transition period ends. The EU will lose one of its big net contributors, the second largest after Germany in 2015.

The EU’s budget of around 1 percent of GDP is in any case puny given the scale of its ambitions. Those hoping for greater generosity on the part of the remaining rich countries are likely to be disappointed. With German Chancellor Angela Merkel weakened following her poor performance in the federal election, Germany will be even more tight-fisted than before in its efforts to avoid anything that smacks even faintly of a “transfer union.” Yet if the poorer countries receive less, that will sharpen the north-south divide that emerged so starkly during the euro crisis when countries such as Finland resented having to contribute to bailouts – especially to Greece – while southern states smarted at the imposition of austerity. And it will exacerbate tensions with eastern countries such as Poland that are big beneficiaries from the EU budget.

Both Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, and – more important – French President Emmanuel Macron, have recently set out plans to reboot Europe. But these grand visions will count for little unless they are matched by the solidarity of hard cash. At present the EU can make common cause in pursuit of Britain’s exit bill. But once Britain leaves, the bickering over money will begin – and the push toward a stronger union could be tougher than ever to achieve.",Commentary: How money will divide Europe after Brexit,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallace-brexit-commentary/commentary-how-money-will-divide-europe-after-brexit-idUSKBN1CM2BN

Haley was the first senior member of President Donald Trump’s administration to visit South Sudan, which spiraled into civil war in 2013, just two years after gaining independence from Sudan. She met one on one with Kiir for some 45 minutes.

“I let him know that the United States was at a crossroads and that every decision going forward was going to be based on his actions,” Haley told reporters after the meeting in the capital Juba.

The United Nations has warned that the violence in South Sudan, which has forced some 4 million people to flee their homes, was providing “fertile ground” for a genocide. Kiir’s government has denied U.N. allegations of ethnic cleansing.

Haley had to cut short a visit to a camp for South Sudanese displaced by the violence amid rowdy anti-Kiir protests.

“He understood that Americans were disappointed in his leadership in South Sudan, I made that very clear. And he understood that all the aid or help that he hopes will go forward is not a given,” she said.

Haley did not elaborate on what further action Washington could take, but said that Kiir “got what I was trying to say.” On Monday she said Washington was considering how to pressure Kiir into peace, though noted that withdrawing aid may not work.

The Trump administration last month imposed sanctions on two senior South Sudanese officials and the former army chief.

“We have lost trust in the government and we now need to regain that trust and the only way to regain that trust is through the actions of taking care of all of the people,” Haley told South Sudan’s Eye Radio.

PROTEST CUTS SHORT CAMP VISIT

She demanded that Kiir allow full and consistent humanitarian aid access and bring peace and stability to the country. She said she pushed a timeline for Kiir to act, but declined to elaborate.

Nhial Deng Nihal, a senior adviser to Kiir, said the president told Haley his government and a U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan had established “mechanisms that work jointly to improve and address the humanitarian problems.”

He also told reporters that Kiir said government troops “will also be observing a cessation of hostilities in order to create an atmosphere for dialogue.”

The civil war was sparked by a feud between Kiir, a Dinka, and his former deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer. It has plunged parts of the world’s youngest nation into famine.

A fragile peace deal broke down last year and Machar fled the country. He is being held in South Africa to stop him stirring up trouble, sources told Reuters in December.

Haley had to cut short a visit to a camp in Juba, where U.N. peacekeepers are protecting some 30,000 displaced people, after hundreds of rowdy pro-Machar protesters blocked nearby roads, yelling “Salva Kiir is a killer” and “Welcome USA.”

Protesters held a large sign that read “South Sudan IDPs (internally displaced people) and refugees love President Trump, the peacemaker and supporter of human rights.”

A spokeswoman for the U.N. mission said the protest “started to gain momentum after (Haley) left, IDPs became upset that she was not able to meet with them.” Haley was meeting with a displaced family when she had to leave early due to security concerns.

The previous U.S. administrations of President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama were heavily involved in the birth of South Sudan, which signed a peace accord with Sudan in 2005 and gained independence in 2011.","U.S. has lost trust in South Sudan, Trump envoy tells president",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-southsudan-usa/u-s-has-lost-trust-in-south-sudan-trump-envoy-tells-president-idUKKBN1CU2U0

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday at the Superior Court in San Francisco, follows a widely read blog post in February from another female engineer that described Uber’s work environment as one that tolerated and fostered sexual harassment.

The lawsuit filed by Ingrid Avendano, Roxana del Toro Lopez and Ana Medina, who described themselves as Latina software engineers, says that Uber’s compensation and other practices discriminate against women and people of color. As a result, the three women have lost out on earnings, promotions and benefits, the lawsuit says.

Avendano and Toro Lopez left Uber this summer after more than two years with the company. Medina is still employed there, according to the lawsuit.

Uber spokesman Matthew Wing declined to comment.

The lawsuit describes an employee ranking system that is “not based on valid and reliable performance measures” and favors men and white or Asian employees. Women, Latino, American Indian and African American employees are given lower performance scores, making it more difficult for them to advance professionally and confining them to more menial tasks, according to the lawsuit.

“In this system, female employees and employees of color are systematically undervalued compared to their male and white or Asian American peers,” the lawsuit says.

Women, black and Latino employees also lose out on pay raises, bonuses, stock options, benefits and other wages because of the company’s discriminatory practices, the lawsuit alleges.

“These three engineers are seeking to ensure that Uber pays women and people of color equally for the hard work they’ve done – and will continue to do – to help make Uber successful,” said lawyer Jahan Sagafi of Outten & Golden which is representing the plaintiffs.

Outten & Golden have also represented employees in gender discrimination lawsuits against Goldman Sachs and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

Avendano and Toro Lopez brought their complaints to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency this summer, an administrative step that precedes a public lawsuit. News site The Information reported on the complaint Tuesday.

In August, Uber made a series of changes to address pay equity, including increasing pay of employees who were paid below the median salary for their job and providing an annual 2.5 percent raise.","Three women sue Uber in San Francisco claiming unequal pay, benefits",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CU2Z1-OCATC

Verlander has been a picture of durability since joining the Astros at the end of August. But he faces his toughest task yet as he tries to extend one of the more impressive runs in postseason history.

Thankfully for the Astros, the six-time All-Star and former Cy Young Award winner as the American League’s best pitcher has seemingly always managed to find another gear when it comes to Major League Baseball’s postseason.

“The mental focus is just another level. It’s something that would be easy to say, ‘Why don’t you just do that every game?’ It’s unsustainable throughout the course of the regular season,” said Verlander. “If you were that mentally focused, you’d just burn out. It’s just another level.”

He will need to be at his best at Dodger Stadium, though, if he hopes to flip the script a day after Clayton Kershaw shut down the potent Astros with a signature pitching performance that gave Los Angeles a 3-1 win in the opener to the best-of-seven games series.

Verlander certainly has the postseason pedigree. Dating back to 2011, he is 10-3 with a 2.40 earned run average, 113 strikeouts and 26 walks in 16 postseason outings.

The longtime Detroit Tigers pitcher, who joined Houston in hopes of winning an elusive World Series ring, was also named the MVP of the AL Championship Series on Saturday after allowing just one earned run in 16 innings versus the New York Yankees.

Verlander, 34, said when the stakes are at their highest in October he generally gets so deep into a zone that he manages to tune out everything around him.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

Whether governments will cut carbon pollution swiftly enough to stave off climate catastrophe remains an open question.","When Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt announced last week that his agency would repeal the Clean Power Plan, the Trump administration’s allies in the Republican Party and the coal industry hailed it as a major blow against over-regulation. Applauding Pruitt’s move, House Speaker Paul Ryan called the plan to stop power plants from dumping unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the atmosphere ”a vast, unlawful expansion of government authority” into the energy sector that had been “especially devastating” to coal country.

The reality is different. Republicans say that deregulating carbon pollution will revive the coal industry, but it won’t. The decades-long decline in coal jobs reflects larger economic forces: mechanization, tapped-out coal veins in Appalachia, and stiffer competition from increasingly cheap energy production from solar panels, wind turbines, and natural gas. In the last decade, coal’s share of the U.S. energy portfolio declined from half to one-third. This predates the Clean Power Plan, which has not yet even taken effect.

The Trump administration may not even be able to repeal the Clean Power regulation. Liberal states and environmental groups already are lining up to challenge Pruitt’s plans in court. The federal government is legally obligated to limit carbon pollution and coal is the most carbon-intensive energy source. Unless Republicans change the law, they may be forced to uphold the plan. Anyway, the Democrats will reinstate the rule if they win back control of the White House.

Although Ryan called the Clean Power Plan a “signature climate rule” of the Obama administration, it was Republican President Richard Nixon who signed the Clean Air Act of 1970, which requires EPA to regulate pollutants that endanger human health. In 2007, the Supreme Court held in Massachusetts v. EPA that clear evidence — some of it produced by the government’s own scientists — demonstrated that carbon emissions cause global warming, which in turn causes dangers such as smog, deadly heat waves, and hurricanes. Therefore, the court ruled that EPA had to regulate carbon.

George W. Bush stalled on implementation until the end of his administration, and Barack Obama spent his first few years in office trying to craft legislation in which the government would create a cap-and-trade program to regulate carbon. Because the Senate failed to pass cap-and-trade, the Obama administration eventually came up with the Clean Power Plan.

Even if Pruitt were able to convince courts that the Clean Power Plan’s costs outweigh its benefits – an argument for which environmentalists have plenty of counter-evidence – the EPA would still be obligated to come up with a replacement carbon pollution regulation. Courts could order EPA to produce a regulation by a certain time and hold Pruitt in contempt of court if he fails to comply. That’s what happened to EPA administrator William D. Ruckelshaus in 1984 for not issuing standards on radioactive airborne materials.

Although other regulatory rollbacks might trigger apoplexy among green organizations, in this case they say they are certain of victory. Michael Brune, president of the Sierra Club, the largest U.S. environmental organization, while predicting that “Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt will go down in infamy for launching one of the most egregious attacks ever on public health,” also noted, “No matter who is in the White House, EPA is legally required to limit dangerous carbon pollution.”

To be sure, Pruitt’s plan represents a threat to the environment. Coal is the dirtiest major source of energy in the United States. In addition to contributing to climate change, it produces a host of toxins such as nitrous oxide and mercury and is a major source of smog. When it drafted the Clean Power rule, the EPA estimated that it would prevent 90,000 childhood asthma attacks, 300,000 missed work and school days, and 3,600 premature deaths per year by 2030. If the courts do let Pruitt repeal the rule, it could slow the transition away from coal, causing dirtier air and more global warming.

However, the only way to lastingly prevent carbon regulation would be to revise the Clean Air Act to stipulate that its standards do not apply to carbon. Republicans in Congress have tried to do just that. Their most recent bill, released in February, immediately attracted over 100 co-sponsors, all of them Republicans.

Preventing carbon regulation would be extremely unpopular. Polls show large majorities of the public, sometimes including a majority of Republican voters, support regulating climate pollution.

As David Doniger, director of the climate program at the left-leaning Natural Resources Defense Council and a former EPA official, told me in April for an article I wrote in The Washington Post: “After the Bush administration...the Clean Air Act was still in effect and the Obama administration started to set things right. It’s not a very satisfying thing to think of this as a 30-years war, but it’s longer than a four-year battle.”

Trump does have considerable political capital invested in the battle. In March, he issued an executive order directing Pruitt to get rid of the Clean Power rule. As a candidate, the president repeatedly promised to end his predecessor’s “war on coal” and put the miners back to work.

However, market realities will make this promise impossible to keep as coal’s slide continues. In 2016, natural gas passed coal as the leading source of American electricity, a shift the U.S. Energy Information Agency finds is “mainly a market-driven response to lower natural gas prices.” There’s no sign of the fracking-driven cheap gas boom abating. In fact, Trump hopes to boost it by deregulating fracking on federal land. Whether governments will cut carbon pollution swiftly enough to stave off climate catastrophe remains an open question. But laws in place from a time when Republicans were more moderate will ultimately ensure that carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants is regulated — insufficient and late though it may be — and coal’s foreordained death will hardly have been slowed at all.",Commentary: EPA repeal of Clean Power Plan won’t get Trump what he wants,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-adler-coal-commentary/commentary-epa-repeal-of-clean-power-plan-wont-get-trump-what-he-wants-idUSKBN1CT2TT

The mainly French-speaking province last week passed the law which does not specify which face coverings are prohibited but has largely focused debate on the niqab worn by some Muslim women, which covers everything but the eyes.

People affected by the law would include public-sector employees such as teachers, police officers, hospital and daycare workers and those dealing with them.

Quebec’s Justice Minister Stephanie Vallee said the province wants to ensure accurate identification and better communication and public safety.

Vallee said women would have to remove their veils when necessary for identification but not for the entirety of a transit ride or other public service. She said no-one would be denied emergency medical care, even if they refused to unveil.

“These are common-sense rules,” Vallee told reporters in Quebec City.

Vallee’s remarks come amid continuing protests against the law, including from Muslim groups and rights advocates. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the government has no place dictating what women wear but stopped short of saying Ottawa would challenge the law.

Vallee said those who refused to uncover their faces for religious reasons can apply for accommodation on religious grounds, although it was not immediately clear what that would entail.

Right-wing extremist groups and some local French-speaking media in recent years have targeted Quebec’s Muslims as part of a broader debate on the accommodation of religious and cultural minorities in the province.

There’s Google for accessing information; Twitter for sharing opinion and news; Facebook for interacting with friends; Amazon for shopping, AirBnB for places to stay and Uber for getting around.

Until relatively recently, most consumers and governments took this as a positive trend. While there were disputes over individual and limited issues – not least the companies’ unwillingness to pay tax or comply with requests from local regulators – they usually were seen as good for the economy and job opportunities. With their slick lobbying and PR operations, the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were courted by politicians and civil society alike.

That is changing. The decision by London authorities to strip Uber of its license to operate in the British capital is part of a wider backlash in a rapidly escalating war between governments and the tech firms they believe have become too powerful and contemptuous of rules and democratic authority. Uber and its biggest rival Lyft were ejected from the Texas capital of Austin last year for refusing to fingerprint their drivers. In 2013 in San Francisco and Oakland, tech giants such as Google and Apple’s private employee buses, which were illegally using public bus stops, were blocked by protesters.

Other cities are clearly watching carefully. New York’s city regulators said Monday they were looking at their own probe into Uber, looking specifically at its impact on the city’s own yellow cab sector.

Political perceptions of these tech firms are changing too. After the so-called “Arab Spring,” many Western governments – and the Obama administration in particular – openly praised the tech firms as being a positive global influence, helping democratize the world.

That assumption unraveled as the same platforms later fueled the rise of far right parties in Europe and the Trump presidential campaign. Under Congressional pressure, Facebook voluntarily turned over details of 3,000 election-related ads that appeared to have been paid for by Russia-linked buyers.

Such scrutiny may only be the beginning. Increasingly, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are being blamed for seismic changes in Western political systems, accused of allowing themselves to be hijacked by automatic bots and hardliners to radicalize politics and often spread extremism.

Getting too close to tech firms now brings its own political dangers. U.S. think tanks that happily embraced funding from Google now find themselves criticized for it, accused of reining in any debate critical of the company and its counterparts.

Instead of spreading opportunity, such firms are increasingly blamed for killing jobs. Amazon’s success is at the heart of what trade analysts referred to as the “retail apocalypse,” the shutting of growing numbers of stores across the United States and beyond. Uber has proved toxic to more tightly controlled taxi industries. The drivers of London’s famous black cabs have been particularly hard hit, and their aggressive lobbying of politicians is seen as one of the key factors behind London mayor Sadiq Khan’s decision to suspend Uber’s operating license.

The decision proved immediately contentious. For all the criticisms of Uber – that it ignores regulators and the employment rights of those who drive for it, and that there have been reports of abuse and sexual assaults by drivers – it has slashed transport costs for its users. It has also provided opportunities – although without much in the way of job security – for hundreds of thousands around the world. An Uber-launched petition to reverse the London ban quickly notched up 600,000 signatures.

For the firms themselves, this is a familiar dynamic. Facebook, Google and Twitter in particular have been tangling with national governments since they began operating in relatively autocratic countries such as Russia, China and those in the Middle East, where those in authority have long felt threatened by the quick and easy access they offer to information. Sometimes, the tech companies have found themselves blocked outright.

Increasingly, the perception has become that many of these firms are simply willing to push their luck to see what they can get away with.

Technology firms do have a difficult balance to strike. Google, Apple and others have long made a virtue of protecting user data against what they see as overly intrusive requests for access by authorities. In some areas, the rights and wrongs are arguable. In others, however – such as the payment of tax – governments and campaigners believe the issues are much more clear-cut.

In many respects, Uber and AirBnB are seen amongst the most egregious examples of companies that have seriously and deliberately pushing the limits of what is strictly legal. While London’s already more stringent taxi regulation means Uber needs a license, in many other cities both it and its drivers operate outside the conventional taxi licensing system. AirBnB lets out rooms in cities that explicitly ban short-term rentals. Both have based their entire business model on working around, if not entirely flouting, pre-existing local regulations. Authorities often seemed to lack the ability, or the political will, to enforce the rules.

The London Uber decision is perhaps the most significant escalation in that war so far. It’s not that the firm will necessarily be ultimately banned from the streets, as it will continue to operate pending an appeal. The most likely scenario is that the firm and regulators reach a deal – although that could be a difficult process.

Early signs are that the firm is indeed willing to compromise. On Monday, its chief executive sent London authorities a contrite letter saying that the firm realized it had to change. Mayor Khan welcomed the statement, saying he favored talks to resolve the issue.

What Khan – a fast-rising star within the opposition Labour Party – has demonstrated, however, is that the firm can only operate if authorities allow it to do so. It is fundamentally replaceable – indeed, that have already been suggestions that a quickly-formed rival with better employment and safety practices might take its place. Something similar happened in Austin: although the Texas state government overruled the ban on Uber and Lyft in May, both companies now face more local competition.

Giant tech firms are unlikely to go away. But neither are national or local governments, democratically elected or otherwise. With a host of new technologies coming down the line – self-driving cars, automatic shops, artificial intelligence – many controlled by the same companies, these fights are only going to get bloodier.",Commentary: Uber’s London fight a sign of tech battles to come,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-uber-commentary/commentary-ubers-london-fight-a-sign-of-tech-battles-to-come-idUSKCN1C223I

Odinga, however, backed away from previous promises to hold large-scale protests on election day.

“We advise Kenyans who value democracy and justice to hold vigil and prayers away from polling stations, or just stay at home,” he told a cheering crowd of thousands of people on Wednesday in Uhuru Park, in the capital Nairobi.

“Convince your friends, neighbors and everyone else not participate,” he said, but if they support the president, he cautioned “do not insult or assault them. Instead, seek to open their eyes.”

Odinga is refusing to participate because he said that the election commission has failed to implement reforms to prevent another failed poll.

The Supreme Court was due to hear cases seeking to delay the polls but was unable to do so after five out of seven judges had failed to turn up, preventing a quorum.

Minutes after Chief Justice David Maraga said the case could not be heard, hundreds of supporters took to the streets of Kisumu, Odinga’s main stronghold.

Riot police used teargas to disperse them. Two protesters had gunshot wounds, a Reuters witness said.

“If the government subverts the sovereign will of the people ... then people are entitled to rebel against this government,” Kisumu governor Anyang Nyong‘o, a hardline Odinga supporter, told reporters in Kisumu.

Such comments seem certain to fuel fears of a major confrontation with security forces, already blamed for killing nearly 50 people in Kisumu and Nairobi slums after the canceled August vote.

Brent crude edged up after top exporter Saudi Arabia reiterated its determination to end a three-year supply glut.

The deep draw in gasoline inventories came even as refining output rose, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This suggested demand remained strong after the peak U.S. driving season.

Crude inventories rose by 856,000 barrels in the week to Oct. 20, the EIA said. Analysts had expected a decrease of 2.6 million barrels. Production rebounded from a falloff due to Hurricane Nate, and imports rose.

Brent crude futures settled up 11 cents at $58.44 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 29 cents to $52.18.

The EIA data showed gasoline and distillate inventories both fell by more than 5 million barrels, and refinery utilization rates rose 3.3 percentage points.

RBOB futures rose 1.1 percent to $1.7341 a gallon. Heating oil futures got a brief boost but settled slightly lower.

“Demand has been a little stronger than some people might have anticipated as we pushed out of the driving season, and that’s where today’s strength is coming from,” said Gene McGillian, manager of research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn.

On Tuesday, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih on Tuesday raised the prospect of prolonged output restraint even after the end of an OPEC-led pact to cut supplies.

Even as global inventory levels are falling, Brent has remained below $60 a barrel, partly on concern the crude glut may grow again after March 2018, when the output reduction deal is due to end.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers have cut oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). OPEC’s next meeting is on Nov. 7 in Vienna, Austria, when they will consider extending the deal.

While other producers cut output, U.S. production rebounded to 9.5 million bpd in the latest week. U.S. crude exports have averaged 1.7 million barrels a day over the past four weeks, the highest ever.

“Saudi Arabia’s determination to rebalance the market, together with ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, will remain supportive of oil prices,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.

“However, rising oil production in the U.S. and persistently high exports from the country will be the key bearish factors.”

Disruptions to exports from Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer, have supported oil.

Several global companies, including GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L), have expressed interest in bidding for the unit, which had sales of about $3.4 billion in 2016.

The prospective sale, which is being led by Centerview Partners, Guggenheim Securities and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), was first mooted on Oct. 10, when Pfizer said it was considering strategic options for the unit.

But preliminary discussions with interested parties including Reckitt have already taken place, one of the sources said, adding the U.S. drugmaker wants to get the ball rolling before the end of this year.

GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley confirmed on Wednesday she would look “carefully” at the business.

Three people familiar with the situation said the British drugmaker had hired Citi (C.N) to represent it in the auction. GSK declined to comment while Citi was not immediately available.

Other possible bidders could include Procter & Gamble (PG.N), Sanofi (SASY.PA), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Nestle (NESN.S), several sources said.

Pfizer plans to send out financial information about the consumer unit to prospective buyers in around three weeks time, one of the sources said.

The process is expected to heat up early next year as bids come in and a deal could be sealed around the middle of 2018, the source said.

Germany’s Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) is also looking to divest its consumer health business and has hired JP Morgan (JPM.N) to sell the unit, best known for making Seven Seas vitamins.

Some banking and industry sources said Merck could put the divestment on hold since the sale, estimated to be worth around $4.5 billion, risked being eclipsed by the Pfizer auction.

One source said Pfizer believed keen competition would allow it to raise at least $20 billion from the sale of the business, whose well-known brands include painkiller Advil, Centrum multivitamins and lip balm Chapstick.

As aging populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand for self-medication, the consumer health sector has proved a fertile ground for deal-making in recent years.

But the industry remains fragmented and GSK’s Walmsley said she expected more merger activity, with GSK in a strong position to act as a “consolidator”.

Although consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, they are typically very long-lasting brands with loyal customers.

Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said he was considering the sale of consumer healthcare because it was not integral to the core prescription drug business and might be worth more outside the group.

GSK has taken a different view, opting to retain a diverse portfolio in which consumer health offers a hedge against riskier prescription drugs.

For Reckitt, meanwhile, over-the-counter medicines offer higher-margin growth than its household business. Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor, who last week announced plans to separate Reckitt into health and home and hygiene divisions, said he would weigh a bid if Pfizer’s strategic review resulted in a sale.

“C‘est le sens de cet acte deux de la réforme du marché du travail dont le but est (...) d‘offrir de nouvelles protections et de vraies garanties aux actifs”, a-t-il ajouté.

La remise à plat de la formation professionnelle et de l‘apprentissage devra garantir une meilleure qualité des formations dispensées et un accès plus facile.

Muriel Pénicaud veut notamment améliorer l‘articulation entre lycées professionnels et centres d‘apprentissage, revoir la carte des formations en fonction des besoins des branches et des entreprises et simplifier le mode de financement.

La formation professionnelle devrait être l‘objet d‘une négociation interprofessionnelle, comme le souhaitent les partenaires sociaux. Patronat et syndicats devront donc s‘entendre sur les modalités d‘application de la réforme.

Ils recevront une lettre de cadrage du gouvernement leur indiquant les grandes orientations dans une quinzaine de jours, pour que les discussions démarrent à la mi-novembre.

Le gouvernement mènera en parallèle des concertations avec les régions sur ce sujet.

Les discussions sur la réforme de l‘assurance chômage, qui devraient débuter fin novembre pour se terminer en janvier, commenceront par une rencontre multilatérale, conformément au souhait des partenaires sociaux.

Mais il n‘est pas possible à ce stade, selon le gouvernement de préciser si la suite prendra la forme de négociations ou de concertations. “Sur l‘assurance chômage, on est sur un terrain plus nouveau (...) Il faut d‘abord qu‘on pose des hypothèses, un diagnostic”, a expliqué Muriel Pénicaud.

En plus de l‘ouverture du régime aux indépendants et démissionnaires, elle entend lutter contre le travail précaire par un système de type bonus-malus pour décourager l‘abus de contrats courts et encourager les contrats à durée indéterminée (CDI).

Mais ces réformes arrivent dans un climat social tendu. La CGT, Solidaires et des syndicats étudiants, suivis cette fois par Force ouvrière, ont annoncé mardi une nouvelle journée de mobilisation contre la politique “libérale” d‘Emmanuel Macron.

CFDT, CFTC, Unsa et Fage ont, elles, envoyé une mise en garde au gouvernement, l‘exhortant à “prendre en compte les inquiétudes, alimentées par certaines mesures” comme la baisse des aides au logement ou la réforme de l‘impôt sur la fortune.

Pour ces syndicats, les “futures réformes de l‘assurance chômage et de la formation professionnelle doivent rééquilibrer les souplesses accordées aux entreprises” par les ordonnances sur la réforme du droit du travail.",Coup d'envoi des prochaines réformes sociales de Macron,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRKBN1CU2TF-OFRTP

Most of those displaced from Tuz Khurmato are in need of urgent aid and staying in open shelters, officials from two international humanitarian organisations told Reuters.

A third, Amnesty International, said on Tuesday that satellite images, videos, photos and dozens of testimonies indicate that hundreds of properties were looted, set on fire and destroyed in what appeared to be a targeted attack on predominantly Kurdish areas of the city of about 100,000 people.

The Kurds fled after Kurdish Peshmerga fighters withdrew from the city on Oct. 16, as government forces and Iranian-backed Sh‘ite Popular Mobilisation moved in in retaliation for an independence referendum held by the Kurdistan region authorities last month.

Tuz, located between oil-rich Kirkuk and Baghdad, is also inhabited by Sh‘ite Turkmen and Arabs.

“Many of the people displaced are staying in the open and in public places, in schools, mosques or unfinished buildings,” Said Jennifer Connet, Oxfam’s Program Manager.

“They need emergency aid and also psychological support as many lost contact with children and relatives or witnessed traumatic incidents as they fled.”

The official of the other organisation confirmed that account but gave only as background information in order not compromise its access to the displaced people.

At least 11 civilians were killed, Amnesty said, citing testimonies of people who escaped from the city who said they were attacked by Turkmen Shiite paramilitaries.

Popular Mobilisation, a paramilitary force trained in Iran and supporting the Iraqi government in the region, was not involved in the violence that happened in the city, spokesman Karim Nuri told Reuters in Baghdad.

“It was not forced displacement, our Kurdish brothers fled fearing reprisals,” he said, calling on government security to put an end to the unrest.

“Problems happened between the different components, clans, families,” he said, refuting the political nature of the exodus.

The Kurds displaced from Tuz fled to the neighbouring regions of Diyala, Sulaimaniya, and some to Erbil, further north, said Connet.

“Humanitarian access to the displaced families is possible but going to Tuz is extremely difficult,” she said.","Nearly 30,000 Kurds displaced from city near Kirkuk: aid groups",https://in.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds-tuz/nearly-30000-kurds-displaced-from-city-near-kirkuk-aid-groups-idINKBN1CU1U0

Finance Minister Bill Morneau, under fire in recent days over conflict-of-interest allegations, pointed to stronger-than-expected economic growth as proof the Liberal strategy of deficit spending had paid dividends in the two years since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a surprise majority.

“So now, with a little more wind in our sails, we’re doubling down on a plan with proven results and reinvesting in the middle class,” Morneau said in a speech to parliament.

The government has been badly shaken by charges that Morneau, the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of human resources management firm Morneau Shepell (MSI.TO), was in a conflict of interest because he did not place his holdings in a blind trust, but hopes the fiscal update will reset pubic focus on the strong economy.

The deficit was projected to shrink to C$19.9 billion this year from C$28.5 billion projected in the March budget, but the improvement included a reduction in the government’s so-called fiscal cushion to C$1.5 billion from C$3 billion in March.

The budget shortfall was forecast to shrink further, to C$18.6 billion next year and to C$12.5 billion by the end of the budget’s five-year horizon in 2022-23. Each of those years included a C$3 billion fiscal cushion, a risk adjustment that economists consider prudent.

Morneau’s update had little impact on financial markets, but the additional stimulus may give the Bank of Canada more room to continue to hike interest rates, though no move is expected at the bank’s next policy decision on Wednesday.

“You kind of have a hand off from monetary policy to the federal government by way of fiscal stimulus,” said Scott Smith, managing partner at Viewpoint Investment Partners. “If you can thread the needle, then it’s a great strategy ... the challenge comes if there’s a hiccup in any link of the chain as it pertains to either monetary or fiscal policy.”

Morneau said the government would strengthen the child benefit by indexing it to inflation from next July, a pledge that will cost C$5.6 billion over five years, and increase the tax benefit for low-income workers.

He forecast GDP growth to slow to 2.1 percent in 2018 and 1.6 percent in 2019, from 3.1 percent this year.

Together with the smaller deficits, the growth would reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 30.5 percent this year from 31.2 in 2016-2017 and gradually to 28.5 percent by 2022-23, better than most G7 rivals.","Canada to unveil smaller budget deficit, hopes will shift focus",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CT2WG-OCADN

Several global companies, including GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L), have expressed interest in bidding for the unit, which had sales of about $3.4 billion in 2016.

The prospective sale, which is being led by Centerview Partners, Guggenheim Securities and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), was first mooted on Oct. 10, when Pfizer said it was considering strategic options for the unit.

But preliminary discussions with interested parties including Reckitt have already taken place, one of the sources said, adding the U.S. drugmaker wants to get the ball rolling before the end of this year.

GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley confirmed on Wednesday she would look “carefully” at the business.

Three people familiar with the situation said the British drugmaker had hired Citi (C.N) to represent it in the auction. GSK declined to comment while Citi was not immediately available.

Other possible bidders could include Procter & Gamble (PG.N), Sanofi (SASY.PA), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Nestle (NESN.S), several sources said.

Pfizer plans to send out financial information about the consumer unit to prospective buyers in around three weeks time, one of the sources said.

The process is expected to heat up early next year as bids come in and a deal could be sealed around the middle of 2018, the source said.

Germany’s Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) is also looking to divest its consumer health business and has hired JP Morgan (JPM.N) to sell the unit, best known for making Seven Seas vitamins.

Some banking and industry sources said Merck could put the divestment on hold since the sale, estimated to be worth around $4.5 billion, risked being eclipsed by the Pfizer auction.

One source said Pfizer believed keen competition would allow it to raise at least $20 billion from the sale of the business, whose well-known brands include painkiller Advil, Centrum multivitamins and lip balm Chapstick.

As aging populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand for self-medication, the consumer health sector has proved a fertile ground for deal-making in recent years.

But the industry remains fragmented and GSK’s Walmsley said she expected more merger activity, with GSK in a strong position to act as a “consolidator”.

Although consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, they are typically very long-lasting brands with loyal customers.

Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said he was considering the sale of consumer healthcare because it was not integral to the core prescription drug business and might be worth more outside the group.

GSK has taken a different view, opting to retain a diverse portfolio in which consumer health offers a hedge against riskier prescription drugs.

For Reckitt, meanwhile, over-the-counter medicines offer higher-margin growth than its household business. Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor, who last week announced plans to separate Reckitt into health and home and hygiene divisions, said he would weigh a bid if Pfizer’s strategic review resulted in a sale.

The company has yet to announce a date for its third-quarter earnings and management's first conference call with Wall Street analysts since it disclosed the breach last month. That is a departure from its normal practice of scheduling earnings by mid-October.

Equifax has until Nov. 9 to release its results or seek an extension from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which gives large companies 40 days after the close of a quarter to report their financials to investors.

Company representatives declined to say when the results will be issued.

Equifax is struggling to recover from one of the worst cyber attacks in history. Its shares are down about 24 percent from Sept. 7, when it announced the breach, which prompted outrage from U.S. lawmakers and consumers and the departure of its chief executive. State and federal probes into the incident are underway.

“A significant amount of uncertainty remains regarding the financial and operational impacts from Equifax’s breach,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Gary Bisbee said in a note on Monday, as he cut his recommendation on the stock to “hold” from “buy.”

Lingering questions include how the incident might hurt earnings of the Atlanta-based company, the impact on Equifax’s market share and the likelihood of the U.S. government tightening regulation of the credit reporting industry, Bisbee said.

Equifax’s shares were down 0.8 percent at $107.90 on Wednesday, having rebounded from a more than two-and-a-half-year low of $89.59 on Sept. 14.

The average analyst price target on the stock is now $124.62, down from $153.25 before the breach, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Still, 11 of the 15 analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters who cover the company have a “buy” or “strong buy” recommendation on the stock. Four others have hold ratings.

Equifax, one of the big three credit reporting bureaus along with Experian Plc (EXPN.L) and TransUnion (TRU.N), is expected to report earnings of $1.49 per share, not including one-time items, for the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That has dropped 2.1 percent over the past month, but is still above the $1.44 the company reported for the same period last year.

SEEKING CLARITY

The chief near-term risk for Equifax is how the breach will weigh on its workforce solutions unit, which provides payroll and human-resources services to companies, said Morningstar analyst Brett Horn. That unit made up about 20 percent of Equifax’s $3.1 billion in total revenue last year.

The breach may cause businesses to question whether they should provide sensitive employee information to Equifax, Horn said.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service temporarily suspended a contract worth more than $7 million it recently awarded to Equifax following another security issue with Equifax’s website.

Horn said Equifax may not be ready to provide investors with financial details about how much the incident will cost to clean up and how it will affect future earnings.

That may depend on how much of the post-breach expenses will be paid by insurers and how much the free credit monitoring and identity theft services the company is offering consumers as a result of the breach will ultimately cost.

When it finally does report earnings and talk to analysts, investors are eager for an update on the company’s search for a new chief executive, new chief security officer and new chief information officer to replace executives who departed after the hack.

Rich Sichel, senior investment strategist at The Philadelphia Trust Co, said he wants answers to some of those questions before he considers investing in the stock.

“Too much is unknown,” Sichel said. “I wouldn’t be in a bighurry to get in.”","Equifax, reeling from hack, still has no earnings report date",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-equifax-cyber-results/equifax-reeling-from-hack-still-has-no-earnings-report-date-idUSKBN1CU2R1?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

No. 2: A woman walks across the campus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts May 16, 2012. REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

A deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.","Donald Trump is approaching a crucial deadline on his Iran policy. On Oct. 15, he will have to certify whether Tehran is observing the 2015 multinational agreement to forego nuclear weapons. Trump has reluctantly certified Iran’s compliance, which is due quarterly, twice since taking office. This time, his belligerent address to the United Nations suggests he may not.If the United States follows through on threats to stop fulfilling its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as the Iran deal is formally known, its allies in Europe will be forced to choose between committing a crime and making a mistake. Whichever they decide, the strength of the transatlantic coalition – America’s most important and most reliable partnership – will be cast into doubt.

Iran is complying with the JCPOA. The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly confirmed it, as have partner intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). European leaders oppose refusing to certify Iranian compliance because it would make it likely that Congress will re-impose U.S. sanctions.

That would be only the first of two body blows to the agreement and to the alliance. The second would be an abuse of U.S. authority to re-impose United Nations sanctions.

The president has the power to force the United Nations to “snap back” the multilateral sanctions lifted under the deal – biting restrictions on Iranian banks and other businesses. If the United States re-imposes its own sanctions on Iran, it will inevitably avail itself of these UN sanctions, as well.

The Bush and Obama administrations persuaded Russia, China, and the UN Security Council to sanction Iran’s economy in order to limit its nuclear program. The JCPOA traded these sanctions for tight nuclear restrictions and inspections, but the United States and its partners worried that the Security Council might fail to re-impose the sanctions if Iran cheated, reducing Iran’s incentive for long-term compliance. A clever procedural solution was built into the JCPOA. Any participant in the deal can demand that the Security Council vote on a resolution to continue sanctions relief. The U.S. can veto that resolution, so even if the Security Council votes 14-1 all of the previous restrictions on Iran still snap back into place.

The JCPOA was built to respond to Iranian violations, even if Russia and China were no longer aligned with the United States and the EU. It was not designed to withstand a hawkish or isolationist America using its veto power outside of the terms of the deal or against the objections of its European partners.

Ironically, though, if the U.S. does choose to act alone, in the absence of Iranian violations and against the wishes of its allies, it might undermine the substantive goal of UN snapback, leaving empty sanctions on paper.

Once the UN applies – or in this case, re-applies – sanctions, the European Commission and European Union member countries are supposed to take a number of steps to make the UN sanctions part of EU law and regulation. This is serious business for Europe, which is strongly committed to the idea that, as a matter of international law, the UN can impose binding requirements on all members in the interest of international peace and security. The EU has occasionally faced legal challenges in applying UN sanctions, but it never has simply chosen to ignore a binding Security Council resolution as a matter of policy.

Europe would be sorely tempted to do exactly that on Iran. The snap back mechanism is designed for cases of Iranian non-compliance. Under the JCPOA, Washington does not need to prove that Iran has violated the deal, but Europe may decide that American bad faith justifies breaking from its own UN obligations. Certainly, Europe will categorically disagree with the U.S. policy. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, echoing the senior leadership of the UK, France, and Germany, said after Trump’s UN speech that the deal is working and must be preserved. If the U.S. withdraws, the EU has made clear it will do everything within its power to keep the agreement alive by sustaining newly established business ties with Iran.

Europe would thus be faced with a choice between a crime under international law and what it considers to be a policy mistake. In either case, Europe would be justifiably furious about being forced to choose between two important, deeply held policies – adherence to Security Council resolutions and implementation of the JCPOA.

Other countries, including Russia and China, may also prove lax in applying the restored sanctions, but this is both less uncommon and less important to Iran’s economic aspirations. U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA will hurt Iran’s economy badly, but will not achieve the kind of strangulating effect the broad international coalition had before the deal. A deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.

At the UN last week, President Trump called the Iran deal “an embarrassment to the United States.” He teased that he has made a decision about whether to certify Iranian compliance to Congress but refused to tell anyone, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, what he had decided. The weeks leading to the October 15 certification deadline may be Europe’s last, best chance to explain to President Trump and his advisors that undermining, let alone abrogating, the JCPOA would be a catastrophe not only for the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but also for the bond between the United States and Europe. The only winners would be Europe’s and America’s adversaries.",Commentary: Trump’s Iran threats risk a U.S. break with Europe,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blanc-iran-commentary/commentary-trumps-iran-threats-risk-a-u-s-break-with-europe-idUSKCN1C32E3

The complaint, filed by Dominique Huett in state court in Los Angeles on Tuesday, says the company was aware that Weinstein had previously settled other allegations of harassment and assault and should not have let the movie producer meet privately with Huett in a hotel room in 2010.

Representatives for the Weinstein Company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A spokeswoman for Harvey Weinstein said “any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.”

The New York Times reported on Oct. 5 that Weinstein had reached eight previously undisclosed settlements with women who accused him of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact. The New Yorker magazine reported that 13 women had claimed that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them.

The New York City Police Department has said it is investigating an allegation of sexual assault by Weinstein in 2004. The Los Angeles Police Department said earlier this month that it is investigating a 2013 sexual assault allegation against Weinstein.

Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.

However, in California, negligence claims must be brought within a two-year statute of limitations.

Jennifer Drobac, a law professor at the University of Indiana and an expert in sexual harassment law, said that Huett will have a tough time proving her case given the time limit in the statute of limitations has expired.

But in Huett’s lawsuit, the actress says she could not have known about the alleged pattern of harassment by Weinstein, or the company’s knowledge of it until media reports surfaced earlier this month.

Drobac argued though that Huett could have sued Weinstein after the alleged incident, which might have led her to discover more about Weinstein’s past behavior and what the company knew about it.

Wozniacki had started her fifth appearance at the season-ending tournament with a 6-2 6-0 victory over Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina and Romania’s Halep appeared equally as powerless against the 27-year-old former number one.

The Dane’s victory margin assured her of a last-four berth after the loss of four games in two matches while Halep lives to fight another day with her opening straight-sets win over Caroline Garcia giving her a 1-1 record in the Red Group.

Frenchwoman Garcia recovered from her opening loss to rally past Svitolina with an epic 6-7(7) 6-3 7-5 victory later in the day, a result that leaves the other three women in the group all with a chance of joining Wozniacki in the semis.

Wozniacki has been the form player on the WTA Tour this season, winning 58 matches, reaching seven finals and claiming one tournament victory in Tokyo last month.

The rankings show Halep as the world leader and Wozniacki in sixth but the Romanian was utterly outclassed as her opponent raced through the first set in 23 minutes on the back of a 94 percent first serve success rate.

“I think I played really well today and stayed aggressive throughout. I didn’t expect to be leading by that much in the first set and I started to think ‘what’s happening? Am I really playing that well?',” Wozniacki said in a courtside interview.

Halep had been as much a spectator as the stunned crowd packed into the Singapore Indoor Stadium and although she tried to rouse herself after getting to 30-30 in the first game of the second set, Wozniacki held firm for a 1-0 lead.

FLEETING RESPITE

The Dane had won 17 games in a row across her last two matches before Halep finally got on the scoreboard after 34 minutes when she held to love.

The respite was fleeting, however, as Wozniacki continued to punish Halep’s scrappy forehand to break for a 3-1 lead and an ace snuffed out the only break point the Dane faced all match as she moved within two games of victory.

Slideshow (3 Images)

Another forehand error handed Wozniacki a match point after a little more than an hour, which she duly converted with a forehand winner.

“I just stayed positive, took the ball early and went for my shots,” the Dane added. “It’s a great court for me as I was putting spin on the ball to get in position for my shots and wait for the right opportunities to hit my winners.”

Garcia was the more aggressive of two well-matched players, even forging a pair of set points in the opening tiebreak, but sloppy forehand errors handed Svitolina the initiative as she edged the tightest of first sets.

Svitolina broke early in the second to assume control until Garcia threw caution to the wind, after shedding a few tears following a pep-talk from her father and coach Louis-Paul, and reeled off five of the next six games to level the match.

The decider followed a similar pattern to the second set with Svitolina keeping her nose ahead until Garcia fought back through a barrage of winners to reel off the last four games and seal her first WTA Finals victory.

Halep will hope to advance with a win over Svitolina on Friday, while Garcia faces the unenviable task of taking on Wozniacki with the world number eight needing a victory to stand any chance of reaching the last four.",Wozniacki swats aside Halep to reach Singapore semis,https://www.reuters.com/article/tennis-wtafinals/wozniacki-swats-aside-halep-to-reach-singapore-semis-idINKBN1CU20S

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain April 19, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

In August, fires raging in a remote region of British Columbia choked Vancouver and Seattle with smoke. That month, more than a million acres in Montana burned, forcing schoolchildren to stay inside. In September, terrifying images circulated of fires smoldering in the background of everyday scenes like an airport tarmac in Burbank, California and a golf course in Oregon.

The toll of these fires is the product of bad land use, especially over-development at the perimeter of forests, and subsequent fire suppression efforts that protect those developments at the expense of a vital natural cycle. If U.S. and Canadian authorities don’t adopt the right policies, wildfires will only become more deadly.

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

Following a wet and snowy winter in the West, many hoped this year would see minimal wildfires. But a hot, dry summer that set heat records even in normally-chilly San Francisco destroyed that optimism. This year is no fluke: large wildfires have become more common and damaging in recent years. In 2015, Washington State saw its worst wildfire season on record, including the largest fire in state history. In 2013, a rapidly escalating wildfire in Arizona killed 19 members of an elite firefighting squad. Climate scientists predict that global warming will make wildfires worse as less mountain snowpack and hotter, drier summers conspire to create more conflagrations.

The issue is most acute in the western areas of North America because the region’s rapidly growing population, proliferation of rural vacation homes, and suburban sprawl means more and more people are building too close to forests. From 1960 to the early 2000s, the U.S. population living in what’s known as the “wildland-urban interface,” the locations where homes and businesses butt up against a fire-prone natural environment – think of a subdivision in an Arizona canyon or a cluster of mountain cabins in Colorado surrounded by thick forest – has ballooned by 720 percent, from 25 to 140 million people. According to the U.S. Forest Service, 60 percent of new home construction since 1990 is located in this dangerous zone. As Montana Public Radio, reporting on the wildfire season, described it, “There’s an unquenchable demand for home construction in and near wildfire-prone areas.”

While heavily-forested landscapes are precisely the draw for constructing a cute cabin in the woods or relocating to a small town in the shadow of a tree-lined ridge, they are also increasingly dangerous places for people to live and towns to grow. When human lives and property are under threat, state and local jurisdictions have an obligation to respond. That costs a lot of money – this year has already proven to be the most expensive wildfire season in Montana since 1999, adjusted for inflation – and risks the lives of courageous firefighters.

Just like the need for stricter land-use regulations in the wake of coastal flooding from this season’s devastating hurricanes, it’s time for state and local governments to stop allowing people to live cheek-by-jowl with wildfire-prone vegetation and hold accountable those who take the risk. After all, when local firefighting budgets are exhausted, as they quickly are in heavy fire seasons, the U.S. Forest Service picks up the slack at a cost to all taxpayers. Even worse, voters in some areas with a history of past fires have rejected special assessments to pay for the extra fire prevention and response measures that their lifestyle requires, forcing the cost onto their neighbors who don’t live in fire zones.

Currently, just two states – California and Oregon – have mandatory mitigation measures that require structures in fire-prone zones to be built with fire-resistant materials and homeowners to clear vegetation a certain radius away from the building to prevent fire from engulfing a structure.

Stricter rules are a good first step, but the bigger problem is the people who are living near wildlands in the first place. National Geographic reports that the number of housing units within half a mile of a national forest grew from 484,000 in 1940 to 1.8 million in 2000.

Wildfires serve an important role in ecosystems, clearing underbrush and debris and allowing healthy trees to flourish. When more people live in or near forests, firefighters are ordered to suppress blazes near those houses, disrupting the natural wildfire cycle and making future fires even worse by building up the store of dry vegetation.

Low-density, sprawling development is the chief culprit. Outward expansion happened around every major U.S. city, but the consequences are the most severe in the fire-prone western United States. Many of the major cities with the lowest population densities, such as San Diego, Salt Lake City and Phoenix, are found in the West. Even supposedly eco-friendly West Coast burgs like Portland and Seattle are more spread out than East Coast cities such as Boston or Philadelphia. “In the last half century, about one-fifth of the American people have moved into flame zones, insufficiently aware of the perils awaiting them and inadvertently testing the limits of nature’s tolerance,” writes former National Park Service director Roger Kennedy in “Wildfire and Americans: How to Save Lives, Property, and Your Tax Dollars.”

The West’s historical draw may be as an escape valve from crowded eastern cities, but it’s time to retire that outdated narrative. Westerners who aren’t working the land need to live in dense housing in or near cities, not on big lots out at the edge of a wild forest. There are risks even if that forested hillside is close to the central city – like the Oakland hills, where California’s deadliest fire raged in 1991. Perversely, homeowners there used insurance payouts to build even bigger houses in the hills, though thankfully insurance companies are finally wising up and even refusing to re-insure in fire-prone areas.

The forest should be for visiting and maybe staying overnight in a tent, not for living in permanently. When the smoke from British Columbia made life unbearable in my Seattle apartment over the summer, I retreated to the cleaner air of Olympic National Park. The beautiful temperate rainforest would be a heavenly place for a cabin if I could afford one, but the responsible course of action is to follow the old hiker’s maxim: take only pictures, leave only footprints.",Commentary: There’s a way to reduce the wildfire toll.

Not all in the administration seem to agree with Trump’s harder-line approach on Iran. Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly stated that Trump “should consider staying” in the deal, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has reportedly argued against decertification. Speaking after his first meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, Tillerson also seemed to indicate a willingness to take a longer-term view when he told a media conference that the Washington-Tehran relationship had “never had a stable, happy moment in it.” ”Is this going to be the way it is for the rest of our lives and our children’s lives and our grandchildren’s lives,” he asked.



Tillerson’s remarks evoked an encounter told to me by Mohsen Rafiqdoost, a former Iranian Revolutionary Guards Commander, of a 1982 meeting he had with Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.

Rafiqdoost recalled suggesting that the U.S. embassy grounds in Tehran be converted to a Revolutionary Guards base. Ayatollah Khomeini rejected the idea, asking “Why would you go there? Are we not going to have relations with America for a thousand years?”

It’s clear that decades of estrangement have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Iran in Washington. Notwithstanding the Obama administration’s nuclear negotiations, every U.S. administration since the 1979 Iranian revolution has failed in its declared objective to contain Iran.

If Trump wishes to free future generations of anxiety over U.S.-Iran tensions, he should pay careful attention to five points in formulating his Iran policy.

Shoppers at the Grand Bazaar in the center of Tehran, Iran, August 2, 2017. Nazanin Tabatabaee Yazdi/TIMA via REUTERS

First, American officials need to stop speaking about Iran in threatening and insulting terms. The Iranian people are proud of their thousands of years of history and above all else view mutual respect as integral to their foreign relations. However, Foreign Minister Zarif told me that Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month was the “most insulting speech of any American president toward Iran since the revolution” and that it “made any potential for dialogue with the United States meaningless.”

Second, U.S. regime-change policies have been self-defeating. The principal reason for lasting Iranian distrust of the United States since the revolution has been U.S. policies aimed at undermining and overturning the Iranian political system. In June, Tillerson openly declared that U.S. policy towards Iran included regime change -- a statement not heard from a senior U.S. official in years and which marked a sharp departure from conventional U.S. rhetoric of seeking Iranian “behavior” change.

In stark contrast, Barack Obama told the UN that “we are not seeking regime change and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy.” Consequently, he was able to diplomatically engage Iran on its nuclear program, and reach the July 2015 nuclear deal. The respectful letters exchanged between Obama and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei helped set the process in motion. This would not happen today even if Trump made a similar overture, as the key to successful negotiations with Iran is to first drop regime-change policies.

Third, since the 1953 U.S.-led coup that overthrew democratically-elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, Iranians have resented U.S. interference in Iran. The political landscape of conservatives, moderates, and reformists in Iran is in many ways similar to the competition between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. As such, any agreement between Washington and Tehran must be negotiated in a way that transcends the partisan divide in each country -- or else it would be inherently fragile. The challenges the nuclear deal has been subject to in Washington by the Republican Party is testament to this need. With respect to Iran too, negotiations must be carried out in a way that respects Iran’s political makeup and hierarchies.

Fourth, the Trump administration needs to accept that Iran, as a large country with immense natural resources and an educated population, has legitimate security concerns and interests in its neighborhood. Washington must recognize that U.S. policies aimed at isolating Tehran and refusing to accept a legitimate Iranian role in the region have only seen Iranian influence grow in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon while U.S. influence wanes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. From Iran’s perspective, its post-1979 foreign policy has been driven by the aim of deterring foreign aggression and securing the country’s borders rather than the pursuit of regional hegemony. After the revolution, Iran was invaded by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and, for much of the past decade, chaos on its thousands of miles of borders with Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan – all factors that have compelled it to play a regional role. If the United States wants to avoid scenarios where regional states aggressively compete for power it must encourage the creation of a regional security system involving the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries along with Iraq and Iran.

Finally, the record of U.S.-Iran negotiations shows that “dual track” policies of pressure and diplomacy are destined to fail. While Trump appears to be trying to bring Iran to the negotiating table in a position of weakness, Iranian policymakers tend to respond to pressure by retaliating in kind.

In a recent Washington Post op-ed, former Secretary of State John Kerry highlighted how by the time he entered into negotiations with Iran, after years of sanctions, Iran had “mastered the nuclear fuel cycle” and built a uranium stockpile large enough to make 10 to 12 bombs. “In other words, Iran was already a nuclear-threshold state,” wrote Kerry.

The lesson for Washington here is that if push comes to shove, Tehran will develop its own bargaining chips --- not capitulate in the face of whatever threats are made when Trump delivers his next policy speech on Iran.",Commentary: A former Iranian diplomat on what Trump needs to know about Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mousavian-iran-commentary/commentary-a-former-iranian-diplomat-on-what-trump-needs-to-know-about-iran-idUSKBN1CE22K

Ironically, the government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would have done better to simply ignore the non-binding referendum. It was always likely to produce a vote for independence, if only because those who favored it were far more likely to vote. Broader opinion polls conducted before the weekend ballot never showed majority support for independence, and most estimates suggest it has been ebbing steadily since 2013 to around 40 percent.

The scale of the violence this weekend and the brutality of the national police attempts to stop the ballot – almost 900 injured, according to local authorities – has changed everything. While the referendum was expected to be a polarizing event, the Spanish authorities have now effectively guaranteed it will be seen as a defining moment not just for Catalonia but the country at large. It would be astounding if it did not yield a substantial spike in separatist feeling. In a single day, the Rajoy government may have taken what should have been a manageable issue and escalated it into an existential challenge for Spain.

Catalonia’s governor Carles Puigdemont could always have been hoping to declare independence in the aftermath of the ballot. The widely reported violence, however, delivers a degree of political legitimacy to that fact. That doesn’t mean Spain will necessarily fracture – but it does dramatically increase the chances of that happening in the longer run.

A Spanish break-up will have broad implications for a continent that has spent much of the last decade bouncing from crisis to crisis, but had been having a better year than many U.S. and British pundits had anticipated. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both bested far-right challenges in national elections, growth is improving in eurozone economies and the refugee crisis appears to have stabilized.

Events in Spain, however, are a stark reminder that almost every European country remains trapped in a slow-burning political crisis with an ever-growing chance of unusual, unorthodox and outright aggressive nationalist or radical politics eroding the center ground.

In France, the National Front is clearly poised to take advantage of the faltering popularity of Macron, who defeated far-right leader Marine LePen in May. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in a strong third in last week’s election, and is now in parliament for the first time. The festering sore of Brexit continues to raise a host of challenges for both the EU and Britain, while Greece, Italy and Spain continue to struggle economically despite strong broader European growth.

So far, European nations are struggling to work out what their position should be with Spain. For all the public criticism of what is clearly seen as an unnecessarily heavy-handed Spanish clampdown, few European leaders have been willing to criticize Rajoy in public. Behind closed doors, however, the message will almost certainly be that the weekend’s scenes cannot be repeated.

Spain is not the only European country with separatist regions, and that will certainly be little appetite for a wider upswing in the regional nationalism. Just as serious, however, is the way events in Spain reinvigorate the wider European narrative of crisis.

Already, the euro was trading slightly lower on Monday on the news. Russian broadcasters and social media feeds – always keen to jump on anything that undermines the European political mainstream – gave front-page coverage to the news of riot police using rubber bullets and batons to stop the Catalonia vote. Wider international attention can be expected to continue, potentially exacerbating political polarization at every step.

Rajoy’s government is in a tricky situation. It must realize that more heavy-handed use of law enforcement will simply strengthen the separatist cause. Unlike more authoritarian states, Spain does not have the option of bludgeoning dissent into the ground. But nor can it afford to ignore events in Catalonia, for fear the now-heightened momentum behind the pro-independence movement grows still further.

The most obvious solution would be to offer Catalonians more regional autonomy. So far, however, there are few signs of that – and Rajoy’s early statements praising the police response and denying that the referendum has any legal force look set to aggravate tensions rather than ameliorate them.",Commentary: Spain's missteps supercharge the Catalonia crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-catalonia-commentary/commentary-spains-missteps-supercharge-the-catalonia-crisis-idUSKCN1C724O

Puigdemont spurned an invitation to explain his position to the Senate in Madrid on Thursday – an indication of the rigid stands taken by both sides in Spain’s gravest political crisis since the end of the Franco dictatorship in 1975.

He also kept his silence on whether to call for a new regional election, a move which might prompt the Madrid government to postpone its plan to take over Catalonia’s institutions and police.

The next few days could prove crucial in the battle of wills that has followed an independence referendum on Oct. 1, which Madrid declared illegal and the Catalan government said endorsed its claim to statehood.

While it is not clear how the central government will take over in practical terms, nor how Catalan civil servants and police will react, some independence supporters have threatened a campaign of civil disobedience, raising the possibility of ugly confrontations.

The Catalan secessionist drive is the most serious existential challenge to a Western European country since the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, when voters in the end decided to stay part of the United Kingdom.

It has caused deep resentment elsewhere in Spain, caused a flight of business from the wealthy region, and worried other European leaders who see it as fanning separatist sentiment elsewhere on the continent.

Madrid has rejected Puigdemont’s calls for dialogue to resolve the situation, saying he first must withdraw an ambiguous declaration of independence made earlier this month. But it did invite to him address the Senate on Thursday.

However, late on Wednesday the Catalan leader turned down the offer, a spokesman for the regional government said, on the grounds that Madrid had already announced its plans to impose direct control on the autonomous region.

The Senate is expected to give the green light for that on Friday morning.

It was still unclear if Puigdemont would make a unilateral declaration of independence, which, given the opposition from the Madrid government as well as European leaders, would be merely symbolic.

ROCK AND HARD PLACE

Also up in the air was whether he would call a snap regional election, something a senior Catalan politician said on Tuesday was being considered. He could still do this on Friday before the Senate strips him of his powers and imposes direct rule.

Some Spanish political and business leaders, along with most Catalan newspapers, have backed the idea as a snap election could forestall direct rule and help break the deadlock.

Slideshow (6 Images)

Calling an election could also either strengthen Puigdemont’s mandate if pro-independence parties won, or allow him a graceful exit if they did not.

An opinion poll published by the El Periodico newspaper on Sunday showed a snap election would probably have results similar to the last ballot, in 2015, when a coalition of pro-independence parties formed a minority government.

The actual steps to enforce direct rule could be taken gradually in order not to inflame the situation. Catalonia said on Monday it was confident its officials, including the police, would defy attempts by Madrid to take over institutions.

Analyst Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence said Puigdemont was caught between radicals and moderates in the Catalan establishment.

Radical elements want him to make the Catalan parliament declare independence unilaterally on Thursday or Friday. This would provoke a tough government reaction, playing into their hands, he said.

More moderate voices have said that if he calls an early election, he could stop the imposition of direct rule.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

Trump told reporters he wants to protect the popular tax-deferred savings program, but said it was possible it could be part of congressional negotiations over tax cuts.

“Maybe we’ll use it as negotiating, but trust me ... there are certain kinds of deals you don’t want to negotiate with,” Trump said on the White House South Lawn as he prepared to depart on a trip to Dallas.

On Capitol Hill, Representative Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means committee, said Trump and lawmakers were discussing how to handle 401(k) plans. The employer-administered plans have been used for four decades by millions of workers to save for retirement.

”No decision’s yet been made on if there will be any changes,“ Brady told reporters. ”We’re simply considering ideas to help people save more and save early in life.

“If we can reach consensus on that, including with the president, in a good way, we’ll move forward - but if not, we will keep things as they are,” Brady said. “All the focus is on can we help people save more.”

Currently, employees may contribute up to $18,000 a year to the tax-deferred accounts, with those 50 and older able to contribute up to $24,000. Savings are typically invested in mutual funds.

Brady was expected to introduce tax overhaul legislation next week, as Trump has long promised. Republican leaders want Congress to approve the measure by the end of this year. It includes a sharp cut in the corporate tax rate.

But many details are still being worked out, including how to offset revenue that would be lost to tax cuts. One way to do that might be to limit pre-tax 401(k) contributions, which would help the government realize more revenue in the near term but would result in a decline in revenue generation down the road.

Earlier this week, after The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported that Republicans were considering capping annual contributions at $2,400, Trump wrote on Twitter: “There will be NO change to your 401(k)”.

Tampering with 401(k) plans, which have largely replaced defined benefit pensions in the United States, would risk alienating tens of millions of workers, as well as the mutual fund operators which rely on the plans for much of their business. Many companies match a percentage of their employees’ 401(k) contributions.

Changes to the tax-deferred savings program could also provide ammunition to Democrats, who have painted Trump’s plan, with its $6 trillion in tax cuts, as a gift to the rich and corporate America that would balloon the federal deficit.",Trump and U.S. House tax lawmaker reopen door to 401(k) changes,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-taxes/trump-and-u-s-house-tax-lawmaker-reopen-door-to-401-changes-idUSKBN1CU2MI?il=0

North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said last month Pyongyang may consider conducting “the most powerful detonation” of a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean amid rising tensions with the United States.

The minister made the comment after U.S. President Donald Trump warned that the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea, which has been working to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting America, if it threatened the United States.

CIA chief Mike Pompeo said last week that North Korea could be only months away from gaining the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons.

Experts say an atmospheric test would be a way of demonstrating that capability. All of North Korea’s previous nuclear tests have been conducted underground.

U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco sided with the Trump administration, saying the government does not have to make the payments while litigation over the subsidies unfolds.

Chhabria, appointed by Democratic former President Barack Obama, wrote that although the case appears to be a close call “it appears initially that the Trump administration has the stronger legal argument.”

The Trump administration this month terminated the payments to the insurers, which help cover medical expenses for low-income Americans, as part of several moves to dismantle Obama’s signature healthcare law formally known as the Affordable Care Act.

The subsidies were due to cost $7 billion this year and were estimated at $10 billion for 2018, according to congressional analysts.

Trump had threatened to cut off the subsidies for months, prompting health insurers to raise premiums or exit insurance markets set by under Obamacare. The payments amount to nearly $600 million a month, according to a Justice Department court filing.

Democratic attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia sued the federal government and asked for an immediate order halting Trump’s move while the case is being litigated. They argued that terminating the payments harmed customers by raising insurance rates.

While Democrats accused Trump of sabotaging Obamacare, the president argued that the subsidies enriched insurance companies.

Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income people.

Because insurers would raise premiums on policies in the absence of the subsidies, the government would be compelled to spend more on financial assistance to low-income Americans.

Domino, who for a while was mistakenly thought to have been killed when Hurricane Katrina devastated his New Orleans neighborhood in 2005, died at home on Tuesday of natural causes, the Jefferson Parish Coroner’s Office said.

As one of the pioneers of rock ‘n’ roll in the 1950s, Domino sold 65 million records - more than anyone in that period except Elvis Presley, according to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

He had dozens of songs on the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts, including “Blueberry Hill,” “Ain’t That a Shame,” “Blue Monday,” “I‘m Walkin’,” “Whole Lotta Loving,” “Hello, Josephine,” “Walking to New Orleans,” “I‘m Gonna Be a Wheel Some Day” and “Let the Four Winds Blow.”

“For lack of a better way of putting it, he’s a living, walking legend among us in New Orleans,” singer Irma Thomas told the New York Times in 2007. “Between him and Louis Armstrong, they were the first big names to put us on the musical map.”

Antoine Dominique Domino was born on Feb. 26, 1928 in New Orleans and one of nine children. A brother-in-law taught him piano, leading to a style that mixed the classic New Orleans sound with blues, country and Cajun music. He was performing in nightclubs while still a teenager and soon teamed with trumpet player Dave Bartholomew, who would become his co-writer and producer and help refine his piano style.

His nickname was attributed to his short, squatty stature, as well as a tribute to two other pianists - Fats Waller and New Orleans native Fats Pichon.

Like contemporaries Little Richard and Chuck Berry, Domino was a black performer whose music crossed over to white audiences and helped shape early rock.

His first hit was an R&B song, the autobiographical “The Fat Man,” recorded in 1949 and considered among the first songs in the rock ‘n’ roll genre.

Also like Little Richard, one of his biggest hits, “Ain’t That a Shame,” was later recorded by Pat Boone, a white singer, whose version received more radio airplay. A live version of the song by the rock band Cheap Trick was a hit in 1978.

Domino would be a huge influence on rockers who came after him - John Lennon told a New York radio station that “Ain’t That a Shame” was the first song he learned to play - but his prominence began to wane after the British invasion and other forms of rock took root in the 1960s.

Harry Connick Jr., from a later generation of New Orleans musicians, said on Twitter, “You helped pave the way for New Orleans piano players... see you on top of that blueberry hill in the sky.” Guitarist Vernon Reid of the band Living Color mourned Domino’s death by tweeting, “Rock & Roll lost part of it’s soul.”

In his later years Domino was reluctant to perform and rarely left his beloved hometown, but he did go to Indianola, Mississippi, in 2015 to play “Amazing Grace” at B.B. King’s funeral.

Domino was a longtime resident of New Orleans’ Ninth Ward - the section of the city hit hardest by Katrina’s floodwaters - and had resisted early pleas to evacuate as the hurricane approached. For a time he was believed to have died in the flooding and the words “R.I.P. Fats You will be missed” were spray-painted on his house, which was flooded up to the roof.

It was later learned that Domino and his family had been rescued by boat and taken to the refugee center set up at the Superdome in the city before going to Baton Rouge. They lost most of their possessions in the flood but managed to save Domino’s couch, which was custom-made from the rear end of a vintage pink Cadillac.

After Katrina, he moved to a New Orleans suburb to live with his daughter.

The Recording Industry of America late gave Domino reproductions to replace the 20 gold record awards he lost. His Grammy Awards also were replaced and President George W. Bush visited Domino to give him a new National Medal of the Arts.

Domino titled his 2006 album “Alive and Kickin’” and proceeds went to help rebuild New Orleans and preserve its musical heritage.

Domino, a quien se dio por muerto cuando el huracán Katrina devastó su barrio en Nueva Orleans en 2005, falleció en su casa el martes de causas naturales, informaron las autoridades locales de Jefferson Parish.

El pianista, uno de los pioneros del rock ‘n’ roll en los inicios de la década de 1950, vendió 65 millones de discos, más que cualquier otro músico de su época sin contar a Elvis Presley, de acuerdo al Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Domino fue artífice de decenas de éxitos como “Blueberry Hill”, “Ain’t That a Shame”, “Blue Monday”, “I‘m Walkin’”, “Whole Lotta Loving”, “Hello, Josephine”, “Walking to New Orleans”, “I‘m Gonna Be a Wheel Some Day” y “Let the Four Winds Blow”.

“Al no haber mejor forma de decirlo, hay que calificarlo como una leyenda que vive y camina entre nosotros en Nueva Orleans”, dijo Irma Thomas al New York Times en 2007. “Él y Louis Armstrong fueron los primeros en ponernos en el mapa musical”.

Antoine Dominique Domino nació el 26 de febrero en 1928 en Nueva Orleans como uno de nueve hermanos. Un hermanastro le enseño a tocar el piano, y con el tiempo creó un estilo que combinó el sonido clásico de Nueva Orleans con blues, música country y Cajun.

Siendo un adolescente ya tocaba en clubes nocturnos y muy joven se unió musicalmente al trompetista Dave Bartholomew, con quien comenzó a componer y que le ayudó a producir sus canciones y refinar su estilo al piano.

Su sobrenombre se dio por su baja estatura y como un tributo a los pianistas Fats Waller y Fats Pichon.

Al igual que sus contemporáneos Little Richard y Chuck Berry, Domino fue un músico negro cuyas composiciones llegaron a la audiencia blanca y le dieron forma al rock naciente.

Su primer éxito fue una canción de R&B, la autobiográfica “The Fat Man”, grabada en 1949 y considerada por muchos como una de las primeras canciones del rock ‘n’ roll.

Domino se convertiría en una gran influencia para muchas estrellas de rock. John Lennon dijo en una entrevista radial que “Ain’t That a Shame” fue la primera canción que aprendió a tocar.

A data glitch forced Italy’s biggest bank by assets to publish third-quarter results two weeks ahead of schedule. Fortunately, the figures show lower costs and stronger capital. And a fee-boosting partnership with French asset manager Amundi helped offset the drag from low interest rates.

The headquarters of UniCredit bank is seen in Milan, Italy, in this February 8, 2016 file photo

For UniCredit board members who were summoned to approve the results at the crack of dawn on Tuesday, the inadvertent leak of numbers overnight was a nuisance. For investors, the preliminary figures provided early reassurance that CEO Jean Pierre Mustier’s aggressive restructuring plan is paying dividends.

The Milanese bank’s core Tier 1 capital rose to 13.5 percent of risk-weighted assets at the end of September, higher than in the previous quarter and helped by the sale of asset manager Pioneer. This gives UniCredit a buffer to absorb the changes, such as the introduction of new accounting rules which force banks to provision for bad loans in a new way. That should allow it to hit Mustier’s 12.5 percent target ratio at the end of 2019.

There are other comforting signs. Quarterly income from fees was up 4 percent, demonstrating the benefits of the long-term distribution agreement with Amundi, which bought Pioneer in December. The deal allows UniCredit to rejuvenate its offering of investment products while reaping the capital gain from the sale.

Beefing up fee-generating products is a good antidote to Europe’s anaemic interest rate environment. Despite talk of an end to the easy-money phase that has squeezed banks’ traditional sources of income, there is no sign that this will happen soon – or that interest rates will rise very far when it does.

This means that even disciplined banks such as UniCredit might struggle to earn a return that exceeds their cost of capital. That will make consolidation – for example through a combination with Germany’s Commerzbank – increasingly tempting.",Breakingviews - UniCredit gets head start on recovery path,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-unicredit-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-unicredit-gets-head-start-on-recovery-path-idUSKBN1CT1MF

FILE PHOTO - EpiPen auto-injection epinephrine pens manufactured by Mylan NV pharmaceutical company for use by severe allergy sufferers are seen in Washington, U.S. on August 24, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Bourg/File Photo

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

In a dovish statement that emphasized “substantial uncertainty” about the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the central bank said the economy is operating close to its potential but slack remains in the labor market.

The cautious tone after back-to-back rate hikes in July and September sent the Canadian dollar tumbling lower, and bets on a December rate increase slipped to less than 30 percent from 37 percent before the rate announcement. BOCWATCH

The Canadian dollar slumped more than one cent, hitting its weakest since Aug. 15 at C$1.2775, or 78.28 U.S. cents.

“We were thinking January (for the next hike), but that’s at risk now, we could push it out further into 2018,” said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.

The central bank noted the recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar twice in its policy statement, saying inflation will rise to 2 percent a bit later in 2018 than previously expected and export growth will be slightly slower because of the stronger currency.

“While less monetary policy stimulus will likely be required over time, Governing Council will be cautious in making future adjustments to the policy rate,” the bank said in a statement.

In its quarterly Monetary Policy Report, the central bank said economic activity is forecast to remain close to full capacity and “at times modestly above” depending on how the supply side of the economy evolves.

The bank highlighted the risk that U.S. trade protectionism could drive firms to boost offshore production, hurting exports and business investment.

“This less aggressive stance on interest rates partly reflects concerns over NAFTA renegotiations and, to a lesser extent, the stronger Canadian dollar,” David Madani, senior economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note, adding that he does not expect another rate hike this year.

The bank said recent mortgage rule tightening would dampen housing activity, and warned that a drop in house prices in Toronto or Vancouver could douse residential investment and consumption in those areas and have “modest direct spillovers” to the rest of Canada.","Bank of Canada holds rates steady, pledges caution",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CU21F-OCABS

The settlement with the German bank was announced on Wednesday by the attorneys general of New York and California, Eric Schneiderman and Xavier Becerra, who led the probe by 44 U.S. states and Washington, D.C.

Deutsche Bank is the second bank to settle the multistate probe, following a $100 million settlement by Britain’s Barclays Plc (BARC.L) in August 2016.

Both banks agreed to cooperate in the probe into several other banks, which is continuing.

Wednesday’s settlement came 2-1/2 years after Deutsche Bank agreed in April 2015 to pay $2.5 billion to settle rate-rigging probes by U.S. and British regulators, and a London-based unit pleaded guilty to criminal wire fraud.

The bank has also reached multiple rate-rigging settlements in private U.S. investor lawsuits.

“This settlement resolves the bank’s final pending U.S. regulatory inquiry related to Libor,” Deutsche Bank spokesman Troy Gravitt said in a statement about Wednesday’s accord.

Banks use Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, to set rates on roughly $350 trillion of credit card, mortgage, student loan and other transactions, and to determine the cost of borrowing from one another.

Deutsche Bank admitted to allegations that from 2005 to 2009, it made false or misleading Libor submissions, tried to influence other banks’ submissions to benefit its own trading positions, and concealed its deception from customers.

The settlement agreement included emails and instant messages detailing the alleged manipulation, including one in which a Libor submitter told a trader who sought a particular quote: “Ok will try to give you a belated Christmas present.”

Schneiderman said such conduct can interfere with or undermine confidence in financial markets.

“Large financial institutions, like all other market participants, have to abide by the rules,” he said in a statement.

Banks have paid roughly $9 billion to settle Libor-rigging probes worldwide.

In July, Andrew Bailey, head of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, said that regulator will phase out Libor by the end of 2021, citing a lack of data underpinning it.

It signaled its preference for Airbus after Bombardier failed to reach an agreement with Boeing Co earlier this year that would have given the U.S. company a stake in the CSeries jetliners, according to the sources. The Canadian government’s role has not been previously reported.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s administration took a calculated risk in steering Bombardier toward Airbus, according to the sources. It helped save a key product for Bombardier and likely resolved a brewing trade dispute with the United States, but potentially set back efforts to improve trade and economic ties with China.

The deal with Airbus came at a critical time for Bombardier. Its $6 billion CSeries program, already losing money, had become the subject of a trade dispute in which Boeing charged in a complaint to U.S. authorities that the jetliners benefited from Canadian government subsidies and unfair pricing.

Bombardier had considered a Chinese partnership as early as 2015, after talks about a possible merger with Airbus became public and fell apart. This year, as negotiations with Boeing over a CSeries partnership faltered and concerns about the future of the program mounted, Bombardier’s interest in a deal with China intensified, two sources said.

The prospect of such a deal raised concern within the Canadian government, two of the sources said, where officials believed jobs or technology could be “siphoned away” to China. They also expressed uneasiness about what some saw as inadequate Chinese safeguards against intellectual property theft.

In a series of calls with Bombardier in August and September, Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains and Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, as well as senior officials in Trudeau’s office, urged Bombardier to contact the European company, the two sources said.

“From the federal government’s point of view, anything was better than a link-up with China,” according to an Ottawa source. The source said the government suggested to Bombardier that Chief Executive Alain Bellmare reach out to his counterpart at Airbus, Tom Enders.

The government’s efforts eventually helped pave the way for an Oct. 16 agreement in which Airbus took a majority stake in the narrow-body, medium-range CSeries jets for one dollar.

But they also came at a time when Ottawa is pushing for closer economic ties with Beijing. Canada, concerned about Washington’s threats to scrap the NAFTA trade deal, wants to bolster relations with China in order to cut its heavy dependence on exports to the United States. Talks between Ottawa and Beijing are ongoing.

Bombardier declined to discuss its CSeries negotiations. Representatives of Bains, Champagne and Trudeau declined to comment. Beijing officials declined to comment. Boeing also declined to comment.

Asked whether Airbus had stepped in because of concerns about China obtaining a stake in the CSeries, Airbus CEO Enders said: “We were obviously not privy to these discussions.”

AN IMPERFECT PARTNER

Bombardier’s most recent discussions about a Chinese tie-up centered on Comac, a Chinese state-owned firm developing passenger jets, according to a source familiar with the Canadian company’s thinking. Financial terms of any potential deal were not known. Comac did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Sources said Comac was also among the companies Bombardier held talks with in 2015, along with national aerospace conglomerate AVIC and possibly a state-owned investment fund.

For Bombardier, a tie-up with the Chinese would have offered access to the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, providing a boost to its struggling CSeries program. Bombardier has not a secured CSeries sale in 18 months.

Inside Bombardier, however, executives worried that talks with potential Chinese partners were not moving quickly enough, according to sources.

With discussions stalled, Bombardier approached Boeing last spring, three of the sources said. Bombardier offered Boeing a stake in the CSeries under similar terms to those later offered to Airbus, two of the sources said.

The U.S. company agreed to study the proposal, but eventually decided against it based on its experience with a troubled purchase of Canadian aerospace assets in the late 1980s.

That once again Bombardier’s focus back on a deal with the Chinese - until Ottawa pressed the case for discussions with Airbus over the summer.

Asked why senior Canadian federal officials suggested to Bombardier that it talk to Airbus, the Ottawa source said: “People felt that Bombardier might not have thought of this option, given the collapse of the earlier talks.”

Officials from Airbus and Bombardier soon began what would be a series of meetings at restaurants in Paris, London and Munich. The meetings involved only four people - the two CEOs along with another executive from each company. A representative of the Canadian government did not attend.",Exclusive: Canada pushed for Airbus deal as Bombardier courted China,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bombardier-airbus-china-exclusive/exclusive-canada-pushed-for-airbus-deal-as-bombardier-courted-china-idUSKBN1CU0DG
