If you’re as passionate about pizza as we are, you know our bona fides and you know the drill. We’ve been at this for a while. We’ve obsessively cast as wide a net as possible across the country to search for the best pizzas. All year, once each annual list appears, we research new spots ourselves and follow up on the discoveries of others wherever they are across the country. We tap friends for recommendations, pore over reader tips, argue, seek out experts to help us rank responsibly — and eat as much pizza as we can.

Here are the top five pizzas in America:

WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump is siding with Republican Senate incumbents in key re-election races, potentially putting him on a collision course with Steve Bannon, the onetime White House chief strategist who has declared a “season of war” on their party’s establishment.

The two men have praised each other and their efforts in public. Behind the scenes, they have been unable to reach agreement on how to proceed in some Senate races, according to people familiar with their conversations. In a speech on Friday, Mr. Bannon described Mr. Trump as “an instrument” in a larger movement, instead of the leader of one.

“If you want to take your state back—if you want to take your country back—you’re going to have to roll up your sleeves,” Mr. Bannon said during his keynote speech at the California Republicans’ fall convention in Anaheim, Calif. “There is no one person—Donald Trump, [U.S. Rep.] Mark Meadows, [U.S. Sen.] Ted Cruz, Laura Ingraham, Steve Bannon—they are not going to get this done.”

In Washington, Mr. Trump has shown a willingness to protect sitting senators. He stood with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Rose Garden last week and declared that he and Kentucky’s longest-serving U.S. senator are “closer than ever before.” Mr. Trump last week phoned at least three incumbents and committed his support: GOP Sens.

Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab alleges in a lawsuit filed in Colorado that he's been forced to eat foods forbidden by his religion, endured harassment yelled by white supremacist inmates saying things offensive to Muslims and has been prohibited from communicating with relatives, including nieces and nephew, according to the Detroit Free Press.

The lawsuit names U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and Joe Does 1 through 20.

According to the lawsuit obtained by the newspaper, the U.S. government prohibits him from communicating with “more than 7.5 billion people, the vast majority of people on the planet.”

“Prison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the United States Constitution,” the lawsuit said.

Abdulmutallab is serving four life prison terms in Florence, Colo., after pleading guilty to eight counts in 2011, including conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism.

The bomb plot failed due to Abdulmutallab wearing the explosive undergarments for more than two weeks ahead of the attempted attack, former Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole told Fox News Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge at the 2014 Aspen Security Forum.

""Let's say it was degraded,"" Pistole said at the time.

In 2009, months before the attack, he traveled to Yemen in a desperate bid to see Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric and one of the best-known Al Qaeda figures, according to the government. He told investigators that the suicide mission was approved by Al Qaeda after a three-day visit with his mentor.

Al-Awlaki and the bomb maker were killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen just days before Abdulmutallab's trial. At the time, then-President Barack Obama publicly blamed al-Awlaki for the terrorism plot.

The case had lasting implications for security screenings at American airports.

Abdulmutallab's ability to defeat security in Amsterdam contributed to the deployment of full-body scanners at U.S. airports.

The Transportation Security Administration was using the scanners in some American cities at the time, but the attack accelerated their placement. There are now hundreds of the devices nationwide.

And — score another win for Murphy’s Law — that’s where everything went wrong.

FAKE NEWS ADS ARE REPORTEDLY POPPING UP ON FACT-CHECKING WEBSITES

As reported in Haaretz, there is just a one-letter difference in the Arabic language between a colloquial phrase for “Good morning” and another for “Attack them” — and Facebook’s automatic translation algorithms picked the wrong one when they converted the words into Hebrew.

When Israeli police were alerted to a picture of a man standing next to a bulldozer along with the words “Attack them” in Hebrew, they became understandably alarmed, because bulldozers have been used as weapons in hit-and-run terrorist attacks.

And rather than consult with an Arabic-speaking officer who could have immediately identified that the man had written “Good morning,” the police instead went directly to the construction site outside Jerusalem and arrested the culprit “on suspicion of incitement,” a spokeswoman told The Times of Israel.

The 46-year-old dad of four and the 32-year-old Winstead — who plays McGregor’s lover on the FX series — shared a passionate kiss at the Good Life Eatery in the posh St. John’s Wood district of northwest London, according to pictured published by The Sun.

“They were deep in conversation and were there together for more than an hour,” a customer told the newspaper.

“As they left, she got on to the back of Ewan’s motorbike, and they sped off together.”

If McGregor and Winstead were trying to be discreet, then they picked the wrong place.

“There’s always lots of celebrities around in that area,” the customer said.

“The cafe was really busy with people including delivery drivers coming in and out the whole time.

A McGregor family source later told People magazine on Sunday that the actor and his production-designer wife of 22 years, Eve Mavrakis, called it quits in May but kept their split private.

In recent months McGregor and Mavrakis have posted pictures of themselves without their wedding rings on social media, The Sun reported.

Winstead married director Riley Stearns in 2010. They announced their separation in May.

McGregor, 46, and Winstead, 32, play lovers Ray Stussy and Nikki Swango on the edgy FX series.

Mavrakis, 51, and McGregor — also well known for roles in “Trainspotting” and three “Star Wars” movies — have four daughters together, Clara, 21, Jamyan, 16, Esther, 15 and Anouk, 6.

McGregor plays Obi-Wan Kenobi in the “Star Wars” prequels.

Back in February, Winstead shared an Instagram photo of herself and McGregor.

“Pretty lovely Canadian Sunday. Good night!” she wrote.

In “Fargo,” Winstead plays a recently released prisoner and McGregor a probation officer.

“This is a very interesting person with a complicated moral compass,” Winstead told the Los Angeles Times back in May.

She told Time magazine, also in May, that her on-screen relationship with McGregor is lasting one.

“Once I knew that their love was real, then I was able to really move forward with this sort of sweet, bubbly, optimistic version of a femme fatale,” she said

The account created a stir earlier this year when Gizmodo reported that it likely belonged to Comey. At the time the account used the handle @projectexile7. The account’s name has remained Reinhold Niebuhr.

TWITTER AIMS TO BOOST USER SAFETY, UPDATES ITS RULES

While the origins of the @FormerBu handle are unclear, Reinhold Niebuhr was an American theologian who died in 1971. Comey wrote a thesis on Niebuhr while a student at the College of William and Mary.

The account’s first tweet was sent out on March 30 – a meme of Will Ferrell saying “actually I’m not even mad – that’s amazing” and a link to the FBI jobs website.

A second tweet – a photo of the Hudson River, was sent out on Oct. 18. A photo of Little Round Top, Gettysburg, was tweeted the following day with the message “good place to think about leadership and values.”

A photo tweeted on Oct. 20 showed a figure in a cornfield accompanied by the message “Good to be back in Iowa.”

With speculation again mounting that Comey was behind the account, a photo of migrating birds was tweeted Sunday. “Watching migrating white pelicans in Iowa thinking about Niebuhr’s Serenity Prayer,” read the accompanying message.

Comey was finally unmasked on Monday when he tweeted an image of himself standing on any empty road, apparently in Iowa. “Goodbye Iowa. On the road home. Gotta get back to writing. Will try to tweet in useful ways,” he wrote.

Journalist Benjamin Wittes, a close friend of Comey’s who had long refused to confirm the identity of @FormerBu, admitted Monday that the account belongs to the former FBI chief.

“OK, in light of this latest tweet, I will confirm that @FormerBu is, in fact, James Comey himself,” he tweeted.

President Trump took a swing at Comey last week when he tweeted that the former FBI director “totally protected Hillary Clinton” in the private email case. Trump made the attack following the release of FBI documents that show Comey began drafting a statement on the Clinton email investigation months before interviewing key witnesses and Clinton herself.

Pence and White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster paid tribute to the service members, including 220 Marines, on the anniversary of the deadly truck bombing during President Ronald Reagan's first term.

The vice president pointed to President Donald Trump's recent decision to decertify the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, which was tied to the bombing, and placed the 1983 attack as the first battle in the nation's ongoing war against terrorism. He also recalled the 58 French paratroopers who died when a second attacker struck their installation in Beirut.

""The Beirut barracks bombing was the opening salvo in a war that we have waged ever since — the global war on terror. It's a conflict that has taken American troops across the wider world — from Lebanon to Libya, from Nigeria to Afghanistan, from Somalia to Iraq, and many other battlefields in between,"" he said.

Pence said under Trump's leadership, ""we will drive the cancer of terrorism from the face of the earth.""

The Beirut bombing was the deadliest attack against U.S. Marines since the battle over Iwo Jima in February 1945. The ceremony and parade at the Marine Barracks in Washington was attended by retired Lt. Col. Larry Gerlach, the commander of the battalion landing team who survived the bombing, and families of service members who were killed.

Pence told the audience of his personal connection to the incident: His brother, Greg Pence, served in the Marines and was stationed at the Beirut barracks around the time of the attack.

The vice president said he and his parents and other family members worried about his brother's safety when they heard about the bombing. Days later, Greg Pence, who is now running for Congress in Indiana, called home to tell his family that his battalion had shipped out shortly before the bombing.

""I promise all of you, just like my brother, we'll never forget. We'll never forget the 241 who never had that chance,"" Pence said.

If you want to listen to the conscience of a true conservative, talk to Paul Gosar.
In Montana, Commissioner Matt Rosendale is a highly electable principled conservative who has won statewide in Montana recently and can turn out a dedicated conservative primary vote as well.
These candidates will help bring change to Washington and continue the trend of principled conservatives joining the Senate Republican conference.
It’s amazing how desperate the Washington establishment now looks trying to claim some of these conservative candidates as their own.","There’s been a lot of talk recently about the 2018 U.S. Senate midterms and Americans who prefer conservative Washington outsiders as candidates have much to be happy about. Since the American people elected the ultimate political outsider Donald Trump as president of the United States in 2016, establishment Republicans in Washington have done little to convince these voters that they got the message. The status quo in Washington is still failing, the president’s agenda is stalled, and that is emboldening anti-establishment conservatives to run for the U.S. Senate.

It’s a simple equation. If Congress passed some of the big ticket items that they promised, there would be less oxygen for challengers. That being said, principled Washington outsiders are lining up to either take out liberal Democrats up for re-election in states that Donald Trump carried, primary RINO Republican Senators like Jeff Flake, or run for open seats.

My organization Citizens United Political Victory Fund has been involved in midterm elections such as these for a long time. We take them seriously. We’ve had some great success stories, and we’ve learned from our mistakes in the races we’ve lost. We analyze each race on the merits, state by state, candidate by candidate.

In West Virginia, conservative all-star and twice elected state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey is the change agent and outsider in the race. We’ve supported Morrisey in the past and his record as AG indicates he’ll come to Washington to fight for the reforms that Republicans have been promising for a long time. He’s running against establishment darling Congressman Evan Jenkins in the Republican primary who was a Democrat just a few years ago. Morrisey can draw the contrast necessary to defeat incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin in the general election next November.

What’s more important is a candidate’s mindset. Are they satisfied with Washington’s record? Are they determined to fight for and not just talk about conservative reform? Are they willing to speak truth to power in the intimidating marbled halls of Congress?

In Arizona, Congressman Paul Gosar would be a dynamite conservative reformer to retire the anti-Trump, pro-amnesty, pro-Washington candidate Senator Jeff Flake. If you want to listen to the conscience of a true conservative, talk to Paul Gosar. In Ohio, my longtime friend and conservative ally Josh Mandel is well-positioned to defeat status quo supporting career politician Sherrod Brown in this high stakes rematch. Mandel is an unabashed supporter of President Trump and will fight for the critical economic reforms that carried the president to victory in Ohio in 2016.

In Missouri, I was proud to be an early supporter of Josh Hawley for Attorney General and will support him again in his race for the Senate against liberal incumbent Claire McCaskill. When I was talking up AG Hawley around the country earlier this year, establishment types were very cool to him and were talking up their own preferred choice at the time. We were drawn to Hawley very early because of his fine work fighting for religious liberty in the Hobby Lobby case at the U.S. Supreme Court. In Tennessee, we worked hard behind the scenes to rally behind Marsha Blackburn, a longtime friend of the conservative movement. This was critical in order to keep the anti-Trump establishment candidate Governor Bill Haslam out of the race that will fill retiring Senator Bob Corker’s seat.

In Montana, Commissioner Matt Rosendale is a highly electable principled conservative who has won statewide in Montana recently and can turn out a dedicated conservative primary vote as well. When he ran for Congress in 2014, the establishment supported another candidate in the primary. I’m glad they’ve come to see the light this year. Out of touch liberals in Washington got into Democrat Jon Tester’s head years ago and Matt Rosendale is the candidate who will defeat him in 2018.

These candidates will help bring change to Washington and continue the trend of principled conservatives joining the Senate Republican conference. It’s not enough to throw out meaningless statistics that say someone votes with President Trump 90 percent of the time, because the other 10 percent are the truly tough votes in which career politicians make a living out of heading for the hills time after time after time. What’s more important is a candidate’s mindset. Are they satisfied with Washington’s record? Are they determined to fight for and not just talk about conservative reform? Are they willing to speak truth to power in the intimidating marbled halls of Congress? Do they have the courage to take on the entrenched status quo? Those are the questions that matter. The candidates I mentioned above all share this mindset and are dead serious about coming to Washington to change it. It’s amazing how desperate the Washington establishment now looks trying to claim some of these conservative candidates as their own.",Conservative Senate candidates are ready to take on the Establishment in 2018,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/23/conservative-senate-candidates-are-ready-to-take-on-establishment-in-2018.html

An Associated Press video, filmed as Syrian government troops recaptured Qaryatayn, showed several bodies in the streets of the town.
ISIS militants first seized Qaryatayn in August 2015, and relied on the strategically located town to defend another of their bastions, the historic city of Palmyra.
But ISIS, facing major setbacks around Syria and Iraq, launched a new attack on the town in late September and recaptured it.
Most of the ISIS militants who were involved in attacks on the town were local residents.","The bodies of at least 67 Syrian civilians, many summarily killed by the Islamic State group, have been discovered in a central town in Syria that government forces retook from the extremists over the weekend, the Syrian government and activists said Monday.

A senior Syrian official described the attack as a ""shocking massacre,"" saying the search for and documentation of those killed in the town of Qaryatayn is still underway, and the number of bodies was likely to climb.

Some were shot in the street as ISIS militants retreated from the town because they were suspected of working with the government, according to activists. At least 35 had been shot dead, their bodies dumped in a shaft.

The militants have been retreating across northern and eastern Syria, days after having been defeated in Raqqa, the one-time ""capital"" of the group's self-proclaimed caliphate. The killings raise the specter of more revenge attacks by the group while it fights to hang on to its last strongholds in Syria.

An Associated Press video, filmed as Syrian government troops recaptured Qaryatayn, showed several bodies in the streets of the town. In the video, a town resident says IS ""monsters"" killed more than a 100 people, including soldiers and civilians.

""These are people who don't know God, they don't know anything. They killed children and women with knives, they beat women, broke their arms,"" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity, fearing for his safety.

Talal Barazi, the governor of the surrounding Homs province, told The Associated Press on Monday that most of the bodies were of townspeople who were government employees or were affiliated with Syria's ruling Baath party.

He said the killings went on for the three weeks that ISIS held the town and ""terrorized"" its residents, adding that at least 13 residents remain missing while six bodies have not been identified.

""It is a shocking massacre,"" he said.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had documented the killings of at least 128 people in Qaryatayn during the last days of IS control of the town. The head of the Observatory, Rami Abdurrahman, called it a ""massacre.""

Syrian troops and allied militias regained control of the town on Saturday. The government-run Syrian Central Military Media at the time said the Syrian army and its allies restored security and stability to Qaryatayn after clearing the town of ISIS fighters.

The activist-run Palmyra Coordination Committee published the names of 67 civilians confirmed killed and said the number was likely to rise. It said at least 35 were found shot and dumped into a deep shaft.

The activist-run group said other bodies were also found in the town streets — apparently of people shot by pro-government forces and suspected of working with ISIS. The Observatory also said it documented at least 12 killed at the hands of pro-government troops after they regained control of the town.

ISIS militants first seized Qaryatayn in August 2015, and relied on the strategically located town to defend another of their bastions, the historic city of Palmyra. At the time, thousands of the town's Christian residents fled, fearing the extremist group's brutality.

With Russian backing, Syrian troops regained control of the town in April 2016. But ISIS, facing major setbacks around Syria and Iraq, launched a new attack on the town in late September and recaptured it.

At the time, Russia accused the United States, which is battling the Islamic State group, of looking the other way and allowing ISIS to attack Qaryatayn.

Most of the ISIS militants who were involved in attacks on the town were local residents. Pro-government media blamed the loss of Qaryatayn for the second time on what it described as militant ""sleeper cells.""

Zimbabwe's government said it respected the turnabout and that the U.N. health agency ""benefited tremendously"" from the attention.

WHO director-general Tedros Ghebreyesus last week told a conference in Uruguay on non-communicable diseases that Mugabe, who was present, had agreed to be a ""goodwill ambassador"" on the issue.

After the outcry by international leaders and health experts, Tedros said in a statement that he had reflected and decided to change his mind, calling it in the best interests of the U.N. health agency. Tedros said he had consulted with the Zimbabwe government about his decision.

The 93-year-old Mugabe, the world's oldest head of state, has long been criticized at home for going overseas for medical treatment as Zimbabwe's once-prosperous economy falls apart and the country's health care system deteriorates. Mugabe also faces U.S. sanctions over his government's human rights abuses.

The United States had said the appointment of Mugabe by WHO's first African leader ""clearly contradicts the United Nations ideals of respect for human rights and human dignity.""

Two dozen organizations — including the World Heart Federation and Cancer Research U.K. — released a statement slamming the appointment, saying health officials were ""shocked and deeply concerned."" The groups said they had raised their concerns with Tedros on the sidelines of the Uruguay conference, to no avail.

Zimbabwe's government said it respected Tedros' decision to withdraw Mugabe's appointment.

Foreign Affairs Minister Walter Mzembi told state broadcaster ZBC that the U.N. health agency ""benefited tremendously"" from the original decision to name Mugabe to the post because of the global attention that resulted.

""On a name-recognition scale this name beats them all, but it is our business to protect its brand equity from unnecessary besmirching,"" Mzembi said. ""So on the balance, it is wiser to let go.""

The heads of U.N. agencies and the U.N. secretary-general typically choose celebrities and other prominent people as ambassadors to draw attention to global issues of concern, such as refugees (Angelina Jolie) and education (Malala Yousafzai). The choices are not subject to approval.

The ambassadors hold little actual power. They also can be fired. The comic book heroine Wonder Woman was removed from her honorary U.N. ambassador job in December following protests that a white, skimpily dressed American prone to violence wasn't the best role model for girls.

Zimbabwe once was known as the region's prosperous breadbasket. But in 2008, the charity Physicians for Human Rights released a report documenting failures in the southern African nation's health system, saying Mugabe's policies had led to a man-made crisis.

""The government of Robert Mugabe presided over the dramatic reversal of its population's access to food, clean water, basic sanitation and health care,"" the group concluded. Mugabe's policies led directly to ""the shuttering of hospitals and clinics, the closing of its medical school and the beatings of health workers.""

Mugabe, who has led Zimbabwe since independence in 1980, has been criticized at home for his frequent overseas travels for medical treatment that have cost impoverished Zimbabwe millions of dollars. His repeated visits to Singapore have heightened concerns over his health, even as he pursues re-election next year.

The U.S. in 2003 imposed targeted sanctions, a travel ban and an asset freeze against Mugabe and close associates, citing his government's rights abuses and evidence of electoral fraud.",World Health Organization revokes appointment of Mugabe,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/22/world-health-organization-revokes-appointment-mugabe.html

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote. Change the bag often.",8 overlooked germy places in your kitchen to clean now,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/8-overlooked-germy-places-in-your-kitchen-to-clean-now.html

Sen. John McCain appeared to take a swipe at President Trump in an interview that aired Sunday when he called out the “highest income” Americans at the time who found a doctor to say they had a “bone spur” so they could avoid the Vietnam draft.

McCain was interviewed on C-CPAN3, American TV and talked about the war. The interview was wide ranging, but he mentioned the draft.

“We drafted the lowest income level of America and the highest income level found a doctor that would say that they had a bone spur,” McCain said “That is wrong. That is wrong. If we are going to ask every American to serve, every American should serve.”

The New York Times reported last year that Trump received a total of five military deferments during the war. Four were for education and one—in 1968—was the bone spurs in his heels. During that time, the U.S. inducted about 300,000 men into the military.

“I had a doctor that gave me a letter, a very strong letter on the heels,” Trump told the paper.

Vicente Adolfo Solano, 53, appeared at a brief hearing Monday afternoon on a charge of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction at the Dolphin Mall west of Miami. Solano was arrested Friday after accepting a fake bomb provided by the FBI outside the mall, according to an FBI affidavit.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Chris McAliley said she will appoint a public defender to represent Solano, who is being held without bail. A bond hearing is set Thursday and Assistant U.S. Attorney Karen Gilbert said the government wants him kept behind bars until trial as a risk of flight and danger to the community.

Solano told the judge he works as a painter earning $13 an hour. No relatives appeared at the hearing. Court records show Solano has had only minor brushes with the law, most recently in 2014 and 2015 for driving with a suspended license. That document noted he had no prior felony record.

The FBI began investigating Solano in late September after a confidential informant tipped agents off about his plans, the affidavit said. Most of the subsequent conversations were recorded. Investigators also found three pro-Islamic State videos that Solano allegedly sent to the confidential informant.

""I am here because I like the way (Islamic State) confronts the United States and the countries of the coalition,"" Solano allegedly said in one video, wearing a black mask and shirt and standing in front of black flag. ""The United States is the most terrorist country of all. I am going to plant a bomb ... that's how it's going to be done.""

In a second video, Solano said he is a ""sympathizer of the Islamic group, ISIS"" using another acronym for the Islamic State.

It's not clear from the affidavit whether Solano had any links to any foreign terrorist groups. At one point, he told the confidential informant he had not discussed his plot with anyone else.

His plans started to come together in October when the confidential informant introduced Solano to an undercover FBI employee who could supposedly help build a bomb. Solano provided a sketch of the food court at the mall, which he thought would be most crowded, according to the FBI.

""It's easy because look ... I go in, I sit down, I leave it and goodbye. I leave it. I won't have a problem with that,"" Solano said in one conversation recorded by the FBI.

After buying screws and other materials to build the bomb, Solano met with the two undercover FBI men at a hotel to put it together. Then the three of them drove over to the mall, where ""Solano took steps that he believed would arm the device and the timer to count down"" on the fake bomb, the affidavit said.

Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do.
But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","I sat on a parenting panel last month with a well-known and widely respected counselor by the name of Sissy Goff, M.Ed, LPC-MHSP. She is the Director of Child & Adolescent Counseling at Daystar in Nashville and when asked about the biggest issue facing kids today, she confirmed what you’ve probably read about recently on your news feed or even your Facebook feed – the increasing anxiety epidemic in our country.

But it’s not just an epidemic among our kids. It’s an epidemic among us -- their parents.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults.

In a recent article entitled “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety” we glean significant insight into the anxiety epidemic:

I’ll just share just two key points from the article:

* Privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic.

* For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop.’ Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.

If you’re reading this article as a mom, I imagine it breaks your heart like it breaks mine (as the mother of four boys who range in age from toddler to teenager) to learn that the pressure our kids are under “is relentless and getting worse.” Of course, I think we already assumed this to be true. But knowing it to be true leaves us responsible to do something to fight against it.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

See, we parents aren’t the only ones linking accomplishment to acceptance and success to significance. Our kids are attempting to answer the question, “Is who I am enough?” by how well they perform on the field, how much they excel in school, and how many likes they get on their Instagram feed.

They are attempting to answer that question, “Is who I am enough?” by proving they can do enough and be enough. Whatever “enough” is. Because you and I both know enough is never enough when the goal is perpetual perfection.

The primary message our kids receive is that they’d better be the best at everything, and this leaves them afraid to reveal their inadequacies and insecurities—and hiding behind the best version of themselves.

In turn, parents of anxious teens feel helpless and hopeless, questioning all of the steps we are -- or aren’t -- taking. Our confidence as moms crumbles as we try to help our kids navigate the battles they have to fight and the mountains they have to climb.

We are constantly second guessing ourselves: “Have I done too much? Have I not done enough? Am I helping or am I hurting my child?”

Our anxiety escalates and overflows into our parenting and onto our kids, who then take our anxiety on top of their own.

I won’t pretend to even begin to be able to solve this for us here. I don’t have all the answers. Not even a little bit. But I do have this one nugget – which is the primary message woven into my new book, ""Mom Set Free,"" and I believe it to be true with everything in me.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.

It starts with us. It doesn’t end with us. But we are part of the solution.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

Of course, some kids are just more prone to perfection seeking than others. Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it. But often, we parents play a role in the pressure -- and therefore, anxiety -- our kids feel, so we have to be willing to take an honest look at how we pile our own pressure onto our kids.

And ultimately, it is our responsibility to help our kids push back the pressure they face with the truth of God’s Word. I am not at all suggesting that therapy and medication aren’t part of the solution. They often times are. But please let us not forget the alive and powerful Word of God that has the absolute power to show us where our significance comes from and ultimately set us free from proving our worth and our value in our performance.

Kids who constantly feel like they just don't measure up and who feel they have “everything” to prove need to be told – over and over again - they actually have “nothing” to prove. Because this pressure to prove our value and worth has left parents and children alike longing for what all our hearts most crave:

• to be known—truly and deeply known

• to be accepted—for who they are, not who they wish they were to be loved—with no strings attached

This isn’t sentimental fluff. This is solid truth from which freedom springs. There is absolutely no denying the inherent and deepest longing every human soul holds.

If we want to raise kids who find freedom from the pressure to get it ALL right in order to be accepted and welcomed, then we are going to need to walk in that freedom first. Or at least be willing to discover how to walk in that freedom alongside our kids.

We need to know that failing doesn’t make us failures and succeeding doesn’t make us significant. At least not in the eyes of our Creator -- the only One whose opinion of us really matters in the end.

In God’s eyes we are of great worth, not because of anything we have or haven’t done, but because of what has been done for us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The cross has the final word on our value. Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do. But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","America's teen anxiety epidemic is heartbreaking.

October is an exciting month for the family. Even if you or your kids aren’t into the haunted part of Halloween, you can still embrace the festivities of fall, warmth and togetherness. Encourage your kids to exercise their imagination and creativity with these Halloween-themed crafts that everyone can participate in.

1. Family Portrait Pumpkins

Skip the mess of carving pumpkins this year by investing in some good old fashioned chalk. Simply paint a circle on each pumpkin with chalkboard paint. You’ll probably have to apply at least three coats of paint. Then, draw a self-portrait using a piece of chalk. Voila!

2. Colorful Garland

Before kids jump in the pile of leaves this weekend, encourage them to collect a few especially vibrant ones. Press the leaves in a book for a couple of hours while the kids continue to play outside. Once they’ve been flattened, show your children how to clip the leaves to a string with miniature clothespins and find spots to hang them throughout the house together.

3. Harvest Vignettes

Look to nature’s bounty for easy decor ideas. Arrange apples, pears, pumpkins, squash and gourds in baskets throughout your kitchen and dining areas. Having easy access to fruits will also promote healthy eating for your family this season.

4. Candy Laboratory

First, gather vases, jars and dishes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Then fill each container with colorful treats, like candy corn, marshmallows and of course candy eyeballs. Challenge your family members to come up with a creative new name for each candy. Crows bones, zombie zingers and pumpkin teeth are excellent examples. Arrange the jars neatly on a tray or turn a bar cart into a wonderful candy buffet.

5. Candy Corn Checkerboards

A checkerboard made from a placemat can be quickly rolled up and easily tucked away. Cut a 1½-inch square from cardstock paper to make a stencil. Start at one edge of the square and paint every other square. Precise placement and straight lines aren’t necessary in this project, which makes it great for kids. Small imperfections can even give the game a rustic or quirky look. You can use candy corn or small plastic spiders as game pieces.

6. Gothic Deskscape

Fall break is the perfect time to take a break from work and transform your home office into a spooky showcase. Open a dictionary and lay a magnifying glass on the definition of “Halloween”. Stack a pile of literature to display your favorite fall titles, like The Tell-Tale Heart or Harry Potter. Swap out a desk lamp’s lightbulb for one with an orange glow or purple hue, and don’t forget an inkwell and quill pen!

7. Mantel Accessories

Fireplace mantels are the go-to spot for any holiday decor. Find wooden display letters at your local craft store to spell out “boo” or another ghastly term above the hearth. Place a mini pumpkin or two and add some candles. A stack of books and a vase of bare branches are also great ideas.

8. Stylish Spider Webs

Tulle is great for wrapping accessories, draping over doorways and even dressing up the bushes. Don’t overlook the nooks and crannies though. This fabric is even more effective in small corners of a room since that’s where spiders hang out most anyway. You might even have to dust off a few real webs before making your own.

9. Window Decals

Shadows and silhouettes can be extra spooky this time of year. Use your interior lighting and the long dark nights to your advantage by decorating windows with DIY decals. Sketch large outlines of your favorite Halloween characters on fade-resistant paper. Then cut out your witches, skeletons, bats, cats or ghosts and tape them to the inside of your home’s windows.

10. Dip-Dyed Baskets

Prepare for trick-or-treaters this year by sprucing up a traditional candy basket. Fill a plastic container (larger than your basket) with semigloss paint. Place the basket in the paint and push down until all sides are covered to your desired height. Let the basket sit overnight on an elevated rack you don’t mind getting dirty, like an old cookie sheet.

One user commented: “This ad campaign is genius.","A women's suit company has launched a racy new ad campaign featuring women in sleek, tailored suits alongside men in, well, nothing.

Dutch suit label Suistudio has taken their slogan “Not Dressing Men” to a whole new level by including buff, butt-naked men in the promo shots for their latest fashion line.

The photos show women dressed in well-fitted suits and clearly in a position of power, while the naked men are featured in the background and are almost used as a type of prop.

One of the pictures shows a woman sitting on a lounge, dressed in a beige suit, while she rests her feet on the naked man stretched out beneath her.

Another features a woman in a sleek black suit, lounging on a couch with her hand on a man’s bare butt.

The photos are all set in what looks like a luxury high-rise apartment, with the woman always front and center and the man in the background or half out of the frame with his face concealed.

The studio is using the campaign as a statement to highlight the sexist way women are commonly portrayed in advertisements, particularly when selling products aimed at men.

Vice president of Suistudio USA Kristina Barricelli said the pictures bring focus to the normalized way women are often sexualized and used as objects in advertisements — the men aren’t portrayed in any way that women haven’t been before.

“There is nothing wrong with sex, the naked human body, and the inclusion of that in a campaign. Sex is a big part of fashion,” she told online newsite Upworthy.

“The problem is that in recent history, we haven’t seen a naked man objectified in the background. How strange! Why not?”

The ad campaign has gained a lot of attention online and there has been backlash from people calling the ad out for objectification, claiming it is a step backwards in the fight for gender equality.

“I’m sure if the roles were reversed and this was published there would be a backlash from females saying that they are being [sexualized], objectified, abused and so on. But somehow it is OK to do the same things to males. Hypocrites,” one Instagram user commented.

“Sexism is sexism, no matter if a woman dominates a man or vice versa.”

“And revenge is not a way to overcome injustice,” another user said.

While some are calling out the ad for being sexist, others are saying it is empowering and praising the company for shedding light on gender inequality.

One user commented: “This ad campaign is genius. How many times have we seen a woman’s legs only or her bottom as a prop in men’s ad campaigns? All is fair in love and fashion.”

“Excellent cultural commentary! Love the irony,” another said.

Gowdy, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee and a member of the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committee, told Fox News’ Bret Baier on “Special Report” Tuesday night that “for a number of reasons” Comey should return to Capitol Hill and the committees needed to further examine the FBI memos before he did.

“Whenever somebody decides to charge someone, there are lots of layers of scrutiny. When you decide not to charge someone, there aren’t that many layers of scrutiny but there ought to be at least a couple,” Gowdy said. “The media should do it but also Congress should look at this decision not to charge and whether or not it was made before you interviewed two dozen witnesses, including the target of the investigation, yeah we need to talk to him again.”

According to Gowdy, the timeline of events and some of Comey’s decisions along the way did not appear to add up. He was referring to Comey’s statement during his June congressional testimony in which he said the tarmac meeting between former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton encouraged him to announce his findings in the email investigation.

“His ostensible reason for taking that decision away from the Department of Justice was that meeting on the tarmac but yet a month and a half earlier he is memorializing a decision he’s already made so the chronology does not add up,” Gowdy said. “His answers have been all over the map.”

Gowdy also told the Fox News anchor that he not only wants to talk to Comey, but also plans to speak to his former colleagues.

Baier’s interview also touched on Gowdy’s investigation into Samantha Power, the former ambassador to the United Nations during the Obama administration, and her office’s request to unmask at least 260 individuals heard on surveillance recordings.

He followed up: ""As it has turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!""

GOWDY WANTS COMEY TO TESTIFY AGAIN

The flurry of tweets was in reference to the FBI releasing documents this week that prove Comey began drafting a statement regarding the Clinton email investigation months before he interviewed her and other key witnesses. The document release was titled “Drafts of Director Comeys July 5, 2016 Statement Regarding Email Server Investigation Part 01 of 01.”

The release bolstered critics' claims that Comey was drafting an ""exoneration statement"" well before ending the case and recommending against criminal charges.

The contents of the newly released emails, however, were largely unclear as the majority of the document was redacted. The records, that are now public, show the email titled “Midyear Exam—UNCLASSIFIED” was sent by Comey on May 2, 2016 to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, General Counsel James Baker and James Rybicki, chief of staff and senior counselor.

Trump's Wednesday challenge to the Justice Department regarding the matter was a throwback to his summer criticism of the nation's top law enforcement official, Attorney General Jeff Sessions. While Trump had been at odds with one of his earliest supporters over the decision to recuse in the Russia probe, Trump in recent weeks has dialed down that criticism.

The existence of the Comey documents was first brought to light by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., after they reviewed transcripts with top Comey aides who alluded to the email’s existence.

The Judiciary Committee penned a letter on Aug. 30 to newly appointed FBI Director Christopher Wray noting their findings, saying that “it appears that in April or early May of 2016, Mr. Comey had already decided he would issue a statement exonerating Secretary Clinton. That was long before FBI agents finished their work.”

“The outcome of an investigation should not be prejudged while FBI agents are still hard at work trying to gather the facts,” the letter stated.

The existence of these documents raised questions over Comey’s June 2017 Senate testimony regarding his decision to go public with findings in the Clinton email investigation. Comey noted former Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s involvement in the probe, including her controversial meeting with former President Bill Clinton days before his wife was interviewed.

The society’s president, John Runions, told the Journal-Register that the box is “a great link” to Lincoln for the small community outside the state capitol of Springfield.

“Once I got it, I knew what it was, and my dad was the same way,” Terry Campbell said of the object. “He didn’t use it for anything. He kept it on a shelf. We knew what it was and that was just kind of a heirloom that sat there and we looked at it.”

Just last week, we had students from Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Japan, Liberia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, and Mali around our table. We’ve made our goal to fill our home as often as possible with people who are different from us—to learn, to laugh, and to grow—but you might not get that impression if you Google our business or check out my personal Facebook profile.

That’s because 10 months ago, my husband and I filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota law that would require our small business to celebrate same-sex marriages if we enter into the marriage industry at all.

As Christians, we’d love to use our talents as filmmakers to celebrate the goodness of marriage as taught in the Bible though our work, but the state has made it clear that if we don’t promote all messages about marriage, we’ll face enormous fines, and even up to 90 days in jail, simply for living according to our convictions.

Since then, we’ve received a staggering amount of messages wishing death, disease, and poverty on us, our family, and even some of our closest associates all because we challenged the idea that the government shouldn’t have the power to silence or threaten anyone for not promoting all messages.

So when a federal judge ruled in our case, and equated our request to protect our conscience to posting a “White Applicants Only” sign in our window, we were both hurt and deeply offended. Like most people in the expressive professions, we work with all people; we just can’t promote all messages.

A person’s protected status is irrelevant to these types of message-based decisions. For example, an atheist print-shop owner is no more guilty of religious discrimination for declining to design a T-shirt for a Christian that proclaims “God exists” than we are guilty of sexual orientation discrimination for declining to create films promoting messages about marriage with which we disagree.

Not just our business practices, but our whole lives, run counter to the “whites only” analogy. Two of our sons are adopted from Ethiopia. Our youngest child is half Cameroonian and half Native American. And having eight children means we can’t afford to travel the world, so we bring the world to us. We do this precisely because we believe beauty exists in the diversity of God’s creation.

In fact, several years ago we intentionally began to stay home on holidays so that we could celebrate with people who would otherwise have no place to go. This has included spending Christmas with an alcoholic Vietnam veteran, a bisexual international student, and yes, even Trump supporters, among many, many others. We love all people. We work with all people. We simply don’t promote all messages.

But the irony of it all is that every single person operates this way. Nobody wants to be forced to promote messages—via custom artistic expression in our case—or have to repress their own speech just because their opinion is unpopular in the eyes of the government.

If the First Amendment only protects speech that is popular in its cultural day, then it really doesn’t protect any speech.

This is why we’re appealing the court’s ruling. This case is about preserving the freedom of all people to live according to their sincerely held beliefs—a principle we all should be able to support.

We are all on a journey with our convictions. I wish I could invite you into our home and discuss it over one of my daughter’s amazing homemade lemon tarts. But until that can happen, no matter where you are on that path or what you believe about marriage, we should all be able to agree that living peacefully according to our deepest convictions without the fear of government punishment is best for everyone.",Christian videographer: Let's live together in peace instead of silencing those with whom we disagree,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/20/christian-videographer-lets-live-together-in-peace-instead-silencing-those-with-whom-disagree.html

When critics of tax reform claim it’s a tax cut for the rich, that’s of course because it’s only middle-income and upper-income people who pay income taxes.","Of all the tall tales told about taxes, the tallest is that the rich don’t pay their fair share.

The Internal Revenue Service this month released its latest numbers and they show that not only do the rich, along with the middle-class, pay the most in income taxes, but their burden has been going up, not down.

Our tax system is unfair, at least if you measure fairness by the fact that a very small number of taxpayers carry almost all the income tax burden.

The top ten percent of earners, those making more than $138,000 in 2015, made 47 percent of the nation’s income, but they paid 71 percent of the nation’s income tax. The top 1 percent, the people former President Obama decried the most, made 21 percent of the nation’s income in 2015, but they paid 39 percent of the nation’s income tax.

Not only are these people paying their fair share, they’re picking up other people’s shares as well.

Roughly half the taxpayers in the U.S. pay no income taxes. As a practical matter, most taxpayers need to make around $39,000 before they’re hit by the income tax. All taxpayers pay the payroll tax, but according to a recent study by the Urban Institute, when workers retire, Social Security and Medicare give taxpayers their money back. The less money you make, the more likely you are to get all your payroll taxes back, and then some.

When critics of tax reform claim it’s a tax cut for the rich, that’s of course because it’s only middle-income and upper-income people who pay income taxes. And it’s been that way for a long time.

Income taxes are different. You don’t get them back. They pay for the military, nuclear weapons upkeep, environmental protection, food stamps, housing assistance, welfare, Medicaid and a myriad of other services and transfer payments.

There are 140,000 million taxpayers in the United States. Half of them make less than $39,275, the cutoff point that divides the top 50 percent from the lower 50 percent. Because taxes are so high on upper income Americans, that means that 70 million Americans – 50 percent of the country – pay 97 percent of the income tax. The other half pay less than 3 percent.

When critics of tax reform claim it’s a tax cut for the rich, that’s of course because it’s only middle-income and upper-income people who pay income taxes. And it’s been that way for a long time.

In 2001, the top 10 percent made 43 percent of the money and they paid 64 percent of the income tax. The top 1 percent made 17 percent of the money and paid 33 percent of the income tax.

The proposed tax reform pending in the Congress will likely continue this trend because the doubling of the standard deduction and the increase in the child credit mean more people will pay no taxes, shifting the burden even more to the few people who do. As for upper income people, so long as their share of the tax cut is in proportion to their share of the taxes they pay, it’s hard to argue that the tax cut is unfair.

But what about Warren Buffet’s secretary? Remember her? We were told she pays a higher tax rate than her boss. Perhaps Mr. Buffet reduced his tax rate thanks to an abundance of charitable giving combined with other reasons, but examples like this, according to the IRS, are exceptions to the rule. It’s bad policy to legislate by rare anecdote, especially when the facts run contrary to the anecdote.

The system is incredibly progressive. According to the IRS, in 2015, the top 1 percent paid an average tax rate of 27.1 percent, the top 10 percent paid an average rate of 21.4 percent, the top 30 percent paid an average rate of 17.4 percent and the top 50 percent paid an average rate of 15.7 percent. The bottom 50 percent paid an average rate of 3.6 percent.

Average Tax Rate:

Top 1% 27.1% Top 10% 21.4% Top 30% 17.4% Top 50% 15.7% Bottom 50% 3.6%

Not only do middle-income and upper-income Americans pay the most, they make it possible for their fellow Americans to receive quite a bit of government largesse. According to a study from the American Enterprise Institute, 60 percent of U.S. households, those making less than about $51,000, receive more in transfer payments than they pay in federal taxes.

The bottom 20 percent of earners, according to AEI, received $9600 in government transfer payments in 2013 and paid only $800 in federal taxes. They got back twelve times what they paid in.

The United States is a generous nation. A small group of people pay an awful lot of money which gets redistributed to their fellow citizens.

As Congress considers tax reform, the best policy would be a new tax code with lower rates that stimulates the economy to create more jobs and lift wages. When the economy booms again, fewer workers will need government payments and instead, they can join the ranks of taxpayers who earn enough to see the merits and fairness of income tax rate cuts.","Taxes and the rich -- yes, they pay their fair share, and they will after tax reform, too",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/23/taxes-and-rich-yes-pay-their-fair-share-and-will-after-tax-reform-too.html

NBC News first reported that Podesta and his Democratic lobbying firm are now subjects in the special counsel’s Russia investigation, after inquiries regarding former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s finances.

The Podesta Group was co-founded by Tony and his brother John Podesta, who is a longtime Clinton aide and served as chairman of her 2016 presidential campaign.

CLINTON CAMPAIGN GLOSSING OVER ITS OWN RUSSIA CONNECTIONS

According to Monday’s NBC News report, Manafort organized a PR campaign for a pro-Ukraine nonprofit called the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine (ECMU), which reportedly was backed by a pro-Russia party. The Podesta Group reportedly was one of many firms that worked on the campaign.

According to NBC News, Mueller's team began looking at Podesta and his company and is now pursuing a criminal inquiry into whether the company violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).

Under FARA, people in the United States who lobby on behalf of foreign entities must register through the Justice Department as a foreign agent and disclose their work. Podesta's firm eventually filed a registration for the ECMU work, after the media reported on the business and Congress started asking questions.

But in a statement on Monday, a spokesperson for The Podesta Group claimed the company was in compliance -- citing a series of filings dating back years -- and is “fully” cooperating with the special counsel’s office.

“The Podesta Group fully disclosed its representation of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine (ECFMU), and complied with FARA by filing under the lobbying disclosure act over five years ago and within weeks of starting our work,” the spokesperson said. “Any insinuation to the contrary is false. The Podesta Group has fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s office and taken every possible step to provide documentation that confirms compliance with the law. Based on our due diligence and on the recommendation of definitive legal experts, the firm immediately filed the appropriate public disclosures of its representation of the ECFMU over five years ago, and in eight subsequent public filings.”

The spokesperson said the work for ECMU “was in support of Ukraine’s admission to the EU, a position supported by foreign policy experts at the time. The ECFMU provided formal certification that it was neither funded by nor directed by a government or political party.”

The special counsel’s office declined to comment on whether Mueller’s team is investigating Tony Podesta and his firm. John Podesta left the company years ago.

The development, though, would speak to how the Mueller probe may be expanding well beyond the original focus on Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential collusion with Trump associates -- ensnaring Democratic figures in the process.

“It’s a cliché, but a good cliché – prosecutors go where the evidence leads them,” former high-ranking DOJ official James Trusty, now with Ifrah Law LLC, told Fox News on Monday. “When you define the mission broadly, there is a lot of room for [an independent prosecutor’s] exploration.”

Trusty said Mueller’s investigation was broad, leaving “a lot of room to legitimately poke around and find information, on one party or another.”

“If you define it very narrowly, it is much easier to say the special counsel is a rogue elephant, but if you define the mission broadly, it is all fair game to look into any violation of federal law and relationships with Russia,” Trusty told Fox News. “You’ll find there are prosecutions no one would have anticipated at the start, or corruption from a different party than were initially looked at.”

It has been over three years since Russia illegally annexed Crimea. Yet the international community has barely lifted a finger to restore Ukraine’s sovereignty over Russian-occupied territory in Crimea and the Donbas.

Instead, we have seen half-hearted gestures and “tough talk” with very little to back it up. While America has imposed strong sanctions on Russia, our European allies have failed to match our resolve.

Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has kept thousands of his troops in eastern Ukraine, sustaining a deadly war of attrition that has hobbled Ukraine’s government, economy and society.

We can and must do more.

Currently, Putin is advocating for a United Nations “peacekeeping” mission in the Donbas, the area of eastern Ukraine occupied by Russian troops and Kremlin-backed separatist forces. Putin says the mission will protect European monitors sent to observe the conflict, but the truth is more sinister.

Ukrainians now look to the United States as their only hope for a successful future of peace and prosperity.

Putin is trying to use the creation of the peacekeeping mission to force de facto recognition of the separatist quasi-states in eastern Ukraine. To set up the peacekeeping mission, Putin wants the Ukrainian government and U.N. forces to engage directly with separatist leaders, even though Moscow calls the shots. It’s a transparent attempt to secure increased diplomatic recognition for Russian-armed, Kremlin-controlled militias. Ukraine has rejected the idea out of hand.

America must speak up louder in opposition to Putin’s twisted attempt to use U.N. peacekeepers to achieve his own strategic interests. We’ve heard from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about how critical it is that we give our full support to Ukraine.

I worked with Hillary Clinton and her team when she came to Yalta to attend Ukrainian businessman and philanthropist Victor Pinchuk’s European Strategy Conference in 2013 to deliver this exact message just a few months before Putin illegally annexed Crimea.

Ukrainians now look to the United States as their only hope for a successful future of peace and prosperity.

In working for Pinchuk, I gained a first-hand understanding of how important America is to Ukrainians when it comes to beating back Russia, promoting democracy and advancing Western values.

Ukrainians have earned our support. They show their thankfulness for ongoing American efforts in surprising ways.

For example, Victor Pinchuk’s son, Roma – along with Ukrainian executives Fadi Hraibi and Daniel Valk – have come to America’s aid in areas of Houston hit hard by Hurricane Harvey.

The three Ukranians are heading the Interpipe Harvey Cleanup mission in conjunction with the relief organization Samaritan’s Purse. They’re working in low-income areas of Houston devastated by Harvey to clear trees from homes and yards, put tarps on roofs and remove mud from homes. Their focus is helping Houstonians who don’t have natural disaster insurance and the elderly.

We are lucky to have allies and friends like this.

Roma Pinchuk’s work in Houston is an example of Ukraine making the effort to secure a true partnership with America – an effort Ukrainians have been making for decades. Their work sends a loud message that Ukrainians are committed to our success and are partners in a relationship that must be reciprocal.

America faces a world where fewer and fewer countries share our values and where democracy is under attack all over the globe. Ukraine is a rare bright spot. Government leaders, businesspeople, activists and voters all enthusiastically support integrating their country and society with the West, right in Putin's back yard.

America ought to reciprocate the good will of the Ukrainian people and the generosity of individuals like Pinchuk by strongly supporting Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Putin's neo-Soviet imperialism, as well as assisting its transition to democratic governance and a free economy.

WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump is siding with Republican Senate incumbents in key re-election races, potentially putting him on a collision course with Steve Bannon, the onetime White House chief strategist who has declared a “season of war” on their party’s establishment.

In Washington, Mr. Trump has shown a willingness to protect sitting senators.

“My wife and I have been passionate about education being a gateway for upward mobility and equality,” Long told The Associated Press. “I think we can all agree that equity in education can help affect change that we all want to see in this country.”

Long began his career in St. Louis in 2008 and played for the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots last season. Long’s foundation has selected four organizations whose missions focus on making education easily accessible to underserved youth while also providing students the support they need to develop strong social and emotional character.

The four organizations are based in the three communities in which Long has played during his NFL career. The city that raises the most money during the season will receive an additional $50,000 donation.

“There’s a lot of opportunities to help out and they’re wonderful organizations,” Long said. “We have such a great platform as football players and hopefully fans get behind it.”

Long grew up in Charlottesville and starred in high school at St. Anne’s-Belfield before going to the University of Virginia. He was moved to start the scholarship program following the violent protests in Charlottesville in August.

It was another week of hunting for witches to burn in Washington. Even Gen. John Kelly, a man who has served our nation with honor and sacrifice, was nearly consumed by the flames.

Kelly’s sin is his willingness to be chief of staff to President Trump, and to try to stop the madness that appears determined to destroy Trump, no matter the cost to America.

Last week’s episode was instructive about the state of our disunion. That the deaths of four soldiers, ambushed in Niger, would be reduced to political fodder for the bonfire reveals the depths of depravity.

The first false charge was that Trump “lied” when he said recent presidents did not always make condolence calls to the next of kin. He was correct, though he could die waiting for an apology.

The second false charge was that Trump had been “disrespectful” when he called the widow of one of the fallen soldiers. Made by a Democratic congresswoman from Florida who listened to the call, the charge had the earmarks of a hit job from impeachment wing nuts.

As the fire spread, thanks to the media’s eagerness to believe anything critical of Trump, Kelly stepped forward.

Well, besides being reasonable activities for a night out in Atlantic City, officials who help prepare specific sports for Olympic recognition apparently think they could soon take their place alongside running, gymnastics and ski jumping in the world’s most prestigious athletic competition.

Seriously.

The Switzerland-based Global Association of International Sports Federations earlier this month granted observer status to the International Federation of (Match) Poker, the International Pole Sports Federation and International Table Soccer Federation along with the organizing bodies for four other nontraditional sports — the first step toward joining the Olympic program.

“We warmly welcome our first Observers,” Patrick Baumann, the president of GAISF, said in a statement. “This is an exciting time for them and for us and we will do everything within our remit to help them realize their full potential as International Federations within the global sport’s family and, one day, maybe become part of the Olympic program.”

Baumann added: “The new sports debuting at Tokyo 2020 and at the Buenos Aires Youth Olympics are evidence that the pathway is there.”

Joining the program in Tokyo in two years will be softball, karate, surfing, skateboarding, sport climbing and baseball — the games’ second shot at Olympic status. These sports were chosen, especially skateboarding and sport climbing, in part to reflect the changing interest in younger athletes and the worldwide popularity of these sports.

""Through these additional events, the Tokyo 2020 Games aims to inspire new generations and become a turning point and a model for future Olympic Games,” Yoshiro Mori, the president of the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, said in a statement.

But pole dancing, foosball, aka “table soccer,” and poker?

These barroom pursuits, along with dodgeball, foot golf, kettlebell lifting and the previously mentioned sports, now all have the same status as sports like baseball and surfing once had.

Under the GAISF, observer status allows new sport to grow its base while being guided by the federation toward the requirements of membership, such as receiving the required recognitions by National Olympic Committees, increasing their membership and becoming compliant with the regulations of the World Anti-Doping Agency.

And for aspiring poker Olympians, don’t worry, cigarettes and watered-down cocktails are so far not on the list of banned “performance-enhancing drugs.”

So now that they’ve taken the first steps toward Olympic gold, when – or, more importantly, will – these sports make their debuts in the Olympics?

Before anything else happens, the sport needs to be practiced by men in 75 countries on four continents and by women in 40 countries on three continents be considered for the Olympics.

So the men’s division of pole dancing – surely equality demands that there be a men’s division – may run into some issues there.

Besides these stipulations, poker may face the same challenge imposed on chess by the International Olympic Committee with its ban on purely “mind sports.”

And even if dodgeball, foot golf, kettleball lifting, table soccer and arm wrestling can pass these tests, the IOC has worked in recent years to manage the scope of the games by only permitting new sports to join when others are discontinued. Meaning that these athletes might have to wait for sports like curling and table tennis to go the way of tug-of-war and water skiing.","Olympics may soon feature pole dancing, foosball and poker",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/18/olympics-may-soon-feature-pole-dancing-foosball-and-poker.html

Per the CBC, a 21-year-old Italian woman got to a hospital ASAP, and now doctors are puzzling over her ""most unusual"" case of bleeding from her face and palms, a condition she'd apparently suffered from for three years.

While the case study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal doesn't reveal much detail about the woman herself, it notes she was diagnosed with hematohidrosis, a rare condition in which blood is excreted or sweated out through pores or unbroken skin (ie, it's not coming out through a cut or other injury).

The patient tends to break out in the bloody sweating when she's either asleep or doing something physical, and the condition seems to get worse when she's stressed.

An episode can last up to five minutes. Per CTV News, doctors say the woman's condition is embarrassing enough to her that she became ""socially isolated"" and showed depression and panic disorder symptoms.

Although it's still not known what spurs such bleeding, different theories have emerged, including blood coagulation disorders or an overactive nervous system that reacts when a patient is under stress.

A Toronto hematologist thinks this particular patient has ""a very bizarre anatomical defect on a microscopic level"" that's causing her bleeding, perhaps in her sweat ducts.

A medical historian tells the CBC she was at first wary anyone could actually sweat blood, but after research reaching back to Aristotle's time (and her find of nearly 20 cases since 2000), she now believes the condition exists.

The patient has since been administered a heart and blood pressure med that has cut down—though not eliminated—her bleeding. (Here's what life is like when you're allergic to your own sweat.)

Forty-seven years later, his heroism will finally be commemorated on Monday when he receives the Medal of Honor during a special ceremony with President Trump at the White House.

“This medal and the presidential citation, it honors what the [Vietnam-era veteran] had done,” Rose told reporters on Friday. “They were asked to do a very difficult thing and they did it. They fought hard and, unfortunately, many didn’t make it back. This honors them. We stand up for them and are a focal point in that honor.”

Rose enlisted in April 1967 at the urging of his father – to avoid getting drafted by the Navy or the Marine Corps. In 1968, he graduated as a Special Forces medic and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group before being reassigned to the 46th Special Forces Company headquartered in Thailand a year later.

It was there, in April 1970, that Rose was assigned to the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group. The unit’s real purpose was to join forces with local fighters to attack North Vietnamese forces in Laos – officially off limits for combat, USA Today reported.

On Sept. 11, 1970, the unit – comprised of Americans, Vietnamese and indigenous paramilitary Montagnard personnel – were sent deep into enemy territory. As soon as they made contact, two Americans and two Montagnards were wounded, and Rose jumped into action.

The Army said the gunfire got so intense Rose had to crawl from position to position to treat the wounded.

“The actions that Mike performed during that operation, you can’t imagine it, you can’t put it into words,” said retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley, who was in charge of the unit, on Friday. “We were going into an area that U.S. forces had not been in….Had we not come out the day we were extracted, we probably would not have left.”

During the extraction of the troops, one of the helicopters crashed to the ground, injuring many on board and killing one.

Ignoring his own injuries – sustained earlier in the mission – Rose re-entered the destroyed helicopter to pull a solider to safety. McCarley said the soldier shouldn’t have survived, but did, thanks to Rose.

“I had the opportunity to meet with him [years later]…it had not affected him in any way,” he added. “Mike did a miraculous job.”

Despite the many who were wounded, only three men died during the four days of almost constant gunfire deep in enemy territory.

“My job was to focus on the individuals that were hurt,” he said on Friday. “When you focus, you don’t concern yourself on getting hurt or killed. You just have to do your job and keep going down the road.”

For his bravery, Rose earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation’s second-highest award for valor.

But what happened during those four days in Laos were never mentioned.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more. I’m proud of him, [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.” - Retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley

“When we left MAG SOC, the unit did not exist. If anyone asked me, I was going to be a mail clerk during the Vietnam War,” Rose said.

That is until 1998, when a report by CNN and Time magazine revealed Rose and the soldiers in Operation Tailwind were sent to Laos to capture American defectors and had used deadly Sarin nerve gas during the attack.

A Pentagon investigation dismissed the report, saying the mission focused on collecting intelligence on the logistics of the North Vietnamese army and destroying their supplies.

While the story of Rose’s valor has now led to a Medal of Honor, however, the covert operations by the U.S. in Laos are still obscured as somewhere “deep in enemy-controlled territory.”

McCarley said he was disappointed Rose had previously only received the Distinguished Service Cross, saying he deserved the top honor.

For more than 40 years, McCarley and others in the military and government fought to get the award upgraded.

Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more,” McCarley said. “I’m proud of him [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.”

Rose, who will be joined by his wife, Margaret Rose, and their three children -- as well as 12 of the men who served with him in Laos -- on Monday, said he considers it a privilege to be part of the small group of service members who have received the Medal of Honor.

“We cannot forget these men and women who served this country valiantly,” he said.","Army Capt.

The event was held at the Mandalay Bay hotel, where the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history took place on Oct 1.

The blue and white 2007 Mustang Shelby GT500 was donated by Barrett-Jackson President Steve Davis, who purchased it from its original owner, former Ford CEO Mark Fields, in 2008. It was just the seventh car that came off the line that year and had less than 900 miles on the odometer.

On Thursday, John W. Kelly, the White House Chief of Staff and a retired four-star Marine general, rightly told the world that America’s troops deserved their countrymen’s respect, falsely and wrongly trashed Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, and arrogantly refused to take questions from reporters who lacked a nexus to a fallen American soldier or a Gold Star family. A day later, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders proclaimed that ex-generals should be immune from criticism, or as she put it, “If you want to get into a debate with a four-star Marine general, I think that’s something highly inappropriate.”

Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, joined the Brian Kilmeade Show today to discuss the importance of passing the budget today so we can move forward with tax reform. Listen to the full interview below:

Chairman Brady on the importance of the budget passing today's vote:

It means everything. This is, the budget gives us the runway to land tax reform on in a big, bold way. Secondly, and I think most importantly, it makes sure that no party including the democrats can obstruct tax reform from getting to the president's desk this year. So it's very simple. No budget, no tax reform. And from a timing standpoint, once that budget is reconciled between the house and senate it's signed, sealed and delivered within 24 hours. We're going to bring forward the Republican tax reform plan and for the first time in 31 years we're going to start action on it.

Chairman Brady responding to Joe Manchin saying he could get six to eight democrats:

I think we do have a lot of common ground with Democrats like Joe Manchin. They want a strong middle class tax cut. They want to stop seeing our jobs go overseas, in fact we want to see them come back here, we deliver exactly that. I wouldn't raise that business rate because it just gives an advantage to China and Europe and our competitors, but I want to continue to work with democrats on how we make our businesses more competitive, especially our main street businesses. You know those small businesses on average they make about $75,000 a year. They work their fingers to the bone. It is a tough slog and they're hiring a lot of our workers. We're continuing in the House in the Ways and Means Committee to continue to work to provide even more help for our smaller business.

Chairman Brady on what's at stake today with the budget vote:

Everything. In my view. One, it's the direction of this country. We cannot stay saddled with this current tax code. We're losing jobs right and left. We've got to change. Secondly, for Republicans you know, how hard is it for us to unite behind President Trump and deliver on our promises? Especially on tax reform. And I think Republicans are not going to disappoint.

Tax reform remains the top legislative priority for the President. He spoke with House Republicans during a conference call yesterday and is expected to meet with Senate Republicans at the Capitol tomorrow.

Wane Gelinas, a senior at Bonny Eagle High School in Standish, said hunting is a family tradition and he wanted his last yearbook photo to show his love of the sport.

“It’s just my sport,” he told WCSH-TV. “It’s just what I do. I don’t play football. I don’t play basketball. I just hunt.”

In a Facebook post, Gelinas wrote: “So here's what I wanted to have as my senior picture but was informed ‘No you can't put something like that in the yearbook.’ So you're telling me that a football player can have theirs with a football, a lacrosse player can have theirs with their stick, and a guy or girl can dress up like one or the other but a hunter can't have theirs with their gun!”

School Principal Lori Napolitano told WCSH-TV the photo goes against the school’s code of conduct, which prevents bringing weapons to school or wearing clothing or other items that depict weapons.

“We just want to draw the line at weapons of any kind being in the picture, that way we’re not trying to pass judgement on which was are promoting violence or which ones aren’t,” she said.

She added that other students have tried to submit photos in the past of them holding weapons and they have always been denied.

Pence and White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster paid tribute to the service members, including 220 Marines, on the anniversary of the deadly truck bombing during President Ronald Reagan's first term.

The vice president pointed to President Donald Trump's recent decision to decertify the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, which was tied to the bombing, and placed the 1983 attack as the first battle in the nation's ongoing war against terrorism. He also recalled the 58 French paratroopers who died when a second attacker struck their installation in Beirut.

""The Beirut barracks bombing was the opening salvo in a war that we have waged ever since — the global war on terror. It's a conflict that has taken American troops across the wider world — from Lebanon to Libya, from Nigeria to Afghanistan, from Somalia to Iraq, and many other battlefields in between,"" he said.

Pence said under Trump's leadership, ""we will drive the cancer of terrorism from the face of the earth.""

The Beirut bombing was the deadliest attack against U.S. Marines since the battle over Iwo Jima in February 1945. The ceremony and parade at the Marine Barracks in Washington was attended by retired Lt. Col. Larry Gerlach, the commander of the battalion landing team who survived the bombing, and families of service members who were killed.

Pence told the audience of his personal connection to the incident: His brother, Greg Pence, served in the Marines and was stationed at the Beirut barracks around the time of the attack.

The vice president said he and his parents and other family members worried about his brother's safety when they heard about the bombing. Days later, Greg Pence, who is now running for Congress in Indiana, called home to tell his family that his battalion had shipped out shortly before the bombing.

""I promise all of you, just like my brother, we'll never forget. We'll never forget the 241 who never had that chance,"" Pence said.

A disputed Catalan independence referendum on Oct. 1 precipitated the crisis.
One voice Madrid will never silence, however, is that of the Camp Nou.
Others, however, value the Camp Nou as a haven from the turmoil.","The rallying cry erupted, almost precisely, after 17 minutes and 14 seconds of soccer in the match between Barcelona and Malaga.

""In! In-de! In-de-pen-den-ci-a!""

It rolled around and around the Camp Nou stadium like a tide, from behind one of the goals into a frothing chorus of thousands of voices.

Then, as suddenly as it started, the chant faded. Red and yellow flags — Catalonia's colors — were furled. Attention returned to the Spanish league match. Eyes refocused on Lionel Messi with a ball at his feet.

But the point had been made. More vociferously than usual.

The timing of the chant spoke volumes: 1714 was the year when Spain first took away self-rule from Catalonia. For years, Barcelona's overwhelmingly Catalan fans have loudly mourned that watershed when their team plays. Rarely, however, have their cries carried as much emotion as now, with Catalonia again struggling with Madrid over how the prosperous northeastern region is governed.

A disputed Catalan independence referendum on Oct. 1 precipitated the crisis. The Spanish government deployed riot police in response and further hardened its position this weekend, announcing a plan to use previously untapped constitutional powers to reassert control over the region that has enjoyed a large degree of autonomy since democracy returned to Spain following the 1975 death of dictator Gen. Francisco Franco.

One voice Madrid will never silence, however, is that of the Camp Nou. With nearly 100,000 seats squeezed into a cavernous bowl, the arena is not only one of soccer's biggest and most famous stadiums, but also a tremendous echo chamber for Catalan independence sentiment.

Led by five-time world player of the year Messi, the team is a world-renowned symbol of Catalan pride. Each trophy in an almost uninterrupted streak of brilliance since 2006 has provided bragging rights for Catalans and poked the eye of the team of the Spanish establishment — Real Madrid.

""Here we get the chance to express ourselves,"" said 33-year-old Diana Pluma Garcia as she joined the crowd at Saturday's 2-0 victory, which kept Barcelona at the top of the standings. ""We can come and show our Catalan sentiment, and the entire world gets to see it because of Barca's visibility.""

To some fans, the club's business structure also serves as a model of how they would like to govern themselves. Unlike some big European rivals with rich owners, like Qatar-funded Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona is owned by its more than 143,000 ""socis,"" or members, who democratically choose those who run the club.

""The club is an example to be followed,"" Barcelona member Marta Ferre said. ""We, as members, have the right to decide about our future, and the residents here in Catalonia want the same thing.""

Before Messi and Co. beat Malaga, Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu and his directors held one of their regular general assemblies with members, fielding questions, complaints and recommendations.

Among the nearly 600 attendees was Jose Maria Segura. He joined in 1945, with membership No. 427.

""Things have not gone well this time,"" the 89-year-old Segura said of Catalonia's latest push for independence. ""We will need to take a step back, look at what went wrong, and three or four years from now we will try to make it happen again. And it's going to keep happening because of the sentiment of the younger people. My grandson is 16, and when he comes here for the soccer, when he chants 'Independencia,' his eyes light up.""

One of those young fans, 17-year-old Julia Manera, said she and others have always brought flags to support the separatist cause, ""even before what happened Oct. 1.""

""And we will keep coming and will continue fighting for our cause, no matter what,"" she added.

Barcelona has performed a delicate balancing act, saying Catalans should be allowed to choose but not advocating independence. The club wants to avoid any risk of losing access to Spanish league revenues and lucrative European competition.

Club history also offers a sobering example of the potential dangers of Spanish politics: In 1936, Barcelona president Josep Sunol was assassinated by Franco's troops.

""We can't be manipulated by political interests, no one can take ownership of our shield and our flag,"" Bartomeu told members. ""We know that Barcelona is more than a club, and that the Camp Nou has been a space for freedom of expression and respect. And that will continue to be the case.""

While most players have not taken sides, Barcelona defender Gerard Pique broke ranks by encouraging Catalans to vote in the referendum. For that, he was booed by fans when he last joined the Spanish national team at a training camp in Madrid.

Barcelona's neutrality frustrates some of its pro-separatist fans. Others, however, value the Camp Nou as a haven from the turmoil.

""People can chant and say whatever they want, supporting independence or not,"" said 35-year-old Enric Sanchez, sitting behind one of the goals with his 7-year-old daughter, Nuria. ""But I will never mix sports and politics. The parliament is the place to talk about politics. Here is a place to watch soccer.""

Now, he needs to address nonprofit health care providers, and just like he did last week, he doesn’t need the do-nothing-Congress to actually do it.
As strange as it might sound on first blush, Trump can use for profit companies to bring reform to health care in America.","In the oath most medical school graduates take, there is a line they say: “I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability.” If only executives at health care and pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, and hospitals took a similar oath.

In all the talk of repealing failed ObamaCare and replacing it with a well-functioning, fiscally responsible and consumer-friendly set of policies, health insurance providers have taken a beating. Drug manufacturers haven’t gotten off easy, and neither have doctors.

But one area of the health care industry that hasn’t been examined hard enough is where the bulk of health care takes place: hospitals, especially nonprofit hospitals.

Just as technology is driving changes in the economies of health care, so are the types of hospitals that provide that health care. First, what is it we’re talking about: nonprofit hospitals are designated as such by the IRS for complying with not for profit guidelines, such as who owns the hospital (a religious order, a charitable organization, or a state-run university), how much “free care” they provide to indigent patients, and other benefits the hospital shares with the community. They don’t pay federal income or state and local property taxes.

As Politico recently noted, the nation’s top seven U.S. hospitals collected more than $33.9 billion in revenue in 2015. But their spending on free treatment for low-income patients shrank from $414 million in 2013 to $272 million in 2015.

While for-profit hospitals tend to get dinged by the public for being bottom-line-driven or owned by big, faceless corporations or investor groups, nonprofit hospitals aren’t simply owned by an order of nuns in the poorest part of town. Ascension, the largest nonprofit hospital network in America runs more than 140 hospitals, 30 senior care facilities and overall claims to have more than 1200 health care facilities in 22 states. In 2016 the nonprofit Ascension made almost a half-billion in profits. Such hospitals are able to make that kind of money, not only from patients who pay, but also from for-profit ventures with for-profit partners, research programs, wellness programs, even their dining facilities.

But Ascension pales in comparison to other nonprofits. We're not talking hundreds of millions of revenue, but billions upon billions in patient revenue. Chicago's Northwestern Hospital pocketed almost $4 billion in patient revenue in 2015, and the ""business"" sitting on the most cash reserves in Oregon? Not Nike, a global shoe and athletic outfitter, but Provident Health and Services, sitting on nearly $6 billion in cash.

How does this happen? Price inflation for those patients paying for their health care, whether through private insurance or other medical coverage, with the rationale being that those fees help those who need charitable care. But it’s just not working out that way, and even ObamaCare, which was supposed to help lower costs and increase access to care, didn’t help. As Politico recently noted, the nation’s top seven U.S. hospitals collected more than $33.9 billion in revenue in 2015. But their spending on free treatment for low-income patients shrank from $414 million in 2013 to $272 million in 2015.

Take in all those numbers and consider that about two-thirds of the hospital systems in America that are enjoying record revenues operate as tax exempt, nonprofit health care providers. When such a significant part of the health industry is acting as a charity, we as taxpayers and consumers are simply begging for health care price inflation.

An investigation by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and the investigative arm of the U.S. Congress found that not for profit hospitals went out of their way to raise the cost of health care using their charitable works as the rationale, while also not fully disclosing either their actual costs or their profits.

Yet, shockingly, in all the debate about reforming health care, no one really wants to talk about the real problem: costs, and their main driver, health care facilities. Call the almost non-existent conversation about all of this Example A of the power of the special interests; that and the campaign re-election donations hitting elected officials’ campaign accounts.

President Donald Trump made a bold and strong move with his executive orders last week that enabled consumers to buy insurance coverage across state lines and end of payments to insurance companies under the Affordable Care Act, which in polite company were called subsidies, but in the real world are known as illegal bribes paid for by the long suffering American taxpayer to insurance companies already enjoying massive profits. Now, he needs to address nonprofit health care providers, and just like he did last week, he doesn’t need the do-nothing-Congress to actually do it.

The president should instruct Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to change the charity regulations to require tax-exempt hospitals to post their prices for care. Further, the regulation changes should require that anything over $20 million in revenue will not be treated as tax exempt unless the providers post prices, have complete cost transparency, and can have real evidence that at least ten percent of their care is charitable. If they will not post prices, they will have their tax-exempt status withdrawn. It’s that simple.

By bringing pricing transparency, Trump can unleash some of the best negotiators in the world: American businesses. As one of the largest consumers of health care products, American businesses can gain the ability to negotiate and drive down both the underlying costs as well as insurance premiums with pricing transparency. As strange as it might sound on first blush, Trump can use for profit companies to bring reform to health care in America. Ultimately, pricing transparency is the only way to get to consumer-centered policy. If Trump were to enforce that transparency, it would revolutionize health care in America and make the industry patient- and doctor-centric once again.",The charitable health care racket -- Trump should slap new regulations on nonprofit hospitals,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/23/charitable-health-care-racket-trump-should-slap-new-regulations-on-nonprofit-hospitals.html

Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

Mike Julianelle runs the Instagram account Got Toddlered, where he shares memes and photos featuring “things children have ruined.” But as it turns out, his kids have affected not only his household and his old way of life, but his appearance as well.

FATHER SUPPORTS BREASTFEEDING PARTNER WITH HILARIOUS, SWEET GESTURE

On Oct. 12, Julianelle shared side-by-side photos of himself. One was from 2006, before he had kids, and it shows him looking youthful and rested. In the other one, from 2016, Julianelle appeared unshaven and exhausted.

“Wanna see something REALLY scary? Here’s me, before and after I had kids!” he wrote alongside the images.

The father of two, who has a seven-year-old and almost two-year-old, told HuffPost that after sharing the picture, he got a message from a follower suggesting he ask for submissions from other parents, as well. So Julianelle encouraged everyone to share their “scariest ‘Before and After Kids’ pics” for him to post on the account.

“Let the nightmares begin!” he wrote.



Julianelle has since shared over a dozen before-and-after photos. He said he’s received far more of those submissions than any of the “my toddler destroyed something” memes he previously got.

“Obviously, it’s meant to be lighthearted, and no one is seriously blaming their children for the state of their faces or lives, except for me when I seriously blame my kids for the state of my face and my life, which is basically all I do on my blog and Facebook page and Twitter,” he told HuffPost.

He said he hopes the pictures make people laugh and let parents know they aren’t alone in feeling overwhelmed.

It’s amazing how desperate the Washington establishment now looks trying to claim some of these conservative candidates as their own.","There’s been a lot of talk recently about the 2018 U.S. Senate midterms and Americans who prefer conservative Washington outsiders as candidates have much to be happy about. Since the American people elected the ultimate political outsider Donald Trump as president of the United States in 2016, establishment Republicans in Washington have done little to convince these voters that they got the message. The status quo in Washington is still failing, the president’s agenda is stalled, and that is emboldening anti-establishment conservatives to run for the U.S. Senate.

It’s a simple equation. If Congress passed some of the big ticket items that they promised, there would be less oxygen for challengers. That being said, principled Washington outsiders are lining up to either take out liberal Democrats up for re-election in states that Donald Trump carried, primary RINO Republican Senators like Jeff Flake, or run for open seats.

My organization Citizens United Political Victory Fund has been involved in midterm elections such as these for a long time. We take them seriously. We’ve had some great success stories, and we’ve learned from our mistakes in the races we’ve lost. We analyze each race on the merits, state by state, candidate by candidate.

In West Virginia, conservative all-star and twice elected state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey is the change agent and outsider in the race. We’ve supported Morrisey in the past and his record as AG indicates he’ll come to Washington to fight for the reforms that Republicans have been promising for a long time. He’s running against establishment darling Congressman Evan Jenkins in the Republican primary who was a Democrat just a few years ago. Morrisey can draw the contrast necessary to defeat incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin in the general election next November.

What’s more important is a candidate’s mindset. Are they satisfied with Washington’s record? Are they determined to fight for and not just talk about conservative reform? Are they willing to speak truth to power in the intimidating marbled halls of Congress?

In Arizona, Congressman Paul Gosar would be a dynamite conservative reformer to retire the anti-Trump, pro-amnesty, pro-Washington candidate Senator Jeff Flake. If you want to listen to the conscience of a true conservative, talk to Paul Gosar. In Ohio, my longtime friend and conservative ally Josh Mandel is well-positioned to defeat status quo supporting career politician Sherrod Brown in this high stakes rematch. Mandel is an unabashed supporter of President Trump and will fight for the critical economic reforms that carried the president to victory in Ohio in 2016.

In Missouri, I was proud to be an early supporter of Josh Hawley for Attorney General and will support him again in his race for the Senate against liberal incumbent Claire McCaskill. When I was talking up AG Hawley around the country earlier this year, establishment types were very cool to him and were talking up their own preferred choice at the time. We were drawn to Hawley very early because of his fine work fighting for religious liberty in the Hobby Lobby case at the U.S. Supreme Court. In Tennessee, we worked hard behind the scenes to rally behind Marsha Blackburn, a longtime friend of the conservative movement. This was critical in order to keep the anti-Trump establishment candidate Governor Bill Haslam out of the race that will fill retiring Senator Bob Corker’s seat.

In Montana, Commissioner Matt Rosendale is a highly electable principled conservative who has won statewide in Montana recently and can turn out a dedicated conservative primary vote as well. When he ran for Congress in 2014, the establishment supported another candidate in the primary. I’m glad they’ve come to see the light this year. Out of touch liberals in Washington got into Democrat Jon Tester’s head years ago and Matt Rosendale is the candidate who will defeat him in 2018.

These candidates will help bring change to Washington and continue the trend of principled conservatives joining the Senate Republican conference. It’s not enough to throw out meaningless statistics that say someone votes with President Trump 90 percent of the time, because the other 10 percent are the truly tough votes in which career politicians make a living out of heading for the hills time after time after time. What’s more important is a candidate’s mindset. Are they satisfied with Washington’s record? Are they determined to fight for and not just talk about conservative reform? Are they willing to speak truth to power in the intimidating marbled halls of Congress? Do they have the courage to take on the entrenched status quo? Those are the questions that matter. The candidates I mentioned above all share this mindset and are dead serious about coming to Washington to change it.

A pair of twins who were formerly connected at the head are sitting up on their own and continuing to hit crucial developmental milestones after undergoing separation surgery in June. Abby and Erin Delaney, of Mooresville, North Carolina, have spent all 15 months of their lives at Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania, Fox 29 reported.

Erin was recently discharged, but Abby remains in recovery.

“Nearly five months after separation, we are happy to announce that both Erin and Abby Delaney are doing well as they continue to recover from this very complex surgery,” Gregory Heuer, the girls’ neurosurgeon who co-led the 30-member surgical team, said.

WOMAN'S 'MISSING' IUD TURNS UP IN HER BLADDER

Heather and Riley Delaney were told that their daughters were craniopagus conjoined twins during a prenatal ultrasound. It’s considered the least common type of conjoined twins, and only accounts for about 2 percent of cases, Fox 29 reported. They were born 10 weeks early via C-section in July 2016, and weighed 2 lbs., 1 ounce each.

“Although this has been a long journey, with many ups and downs, Riley and I are thrilled to see how well the girls are doing today,” Heather said, according to Fox 29. “We are so grateful for the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia team, and for the support and encouragement that our families, our friends and the community have given us during this long journey.”

While the hospital has performed 24 separation surgeries, the girls were considered the earliest separation of craniopagus conjoined twins ever recorded, Dr. Jesse Taylor, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon said.

“We know that children heal better and faster the younger they are, therefore our goal for Erin and Abby was separation as soon as possible with minimum number of surgeries,” Taylor said, according to Fox 29.

The twins will require additional surgeries in the future to address missing bone areas at the tops of their heads and to minimize scarring, but for now, they are working on crawling and practicing rolling over.

“The girls are inspiring,” Heather said. “As their parents, it is very neat for Riley and me to have a front row seat to this and watch them overcome these incredible obstacles. We cannot wait to see what their future holds.”",Formerly conjoined twins thriving after separation surgery,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/10/23/formerly-conjoined-twins-thriving-after-separation-surgery.html

The star called out her former attorney, Lisa Bloom, prompting a response from the civil rights attorney soon after.

Bloom, who has a history of helping celebrities with legal matters and is currently representing Blac Chyna in her lawsuit against the Kardashian family, previously helped Griffin after her now infamous scandal involving a photo she took with a fake severed head of President Donald Trump.

WARNING: IMAGE IN BELOW TWEET MAY BE DISTURBING

The two appeared together at a press conference in which Griffin was meant to explain her outrage over the backlash her photo received both from the public and the president’s family. Bloom took specific issue with the fact that Griffin was being singled out by the high-profile family while other male artists weren’t.

Since that time, there seems to have been a falling out between the two women, as Griffin took to Twitter on Saturday to dress down Bloom and demand her money back for her legal services.

“Dear @LisaBloom pls stop calling me. If you’d like to refund me the tens of thousands of $$ I wasted on your services maybe I’ll talk to you,” she wrote.

Soon after, Bloom posted a lengthy message to Twitter explaining what went wrong in that press conference, but making sure not to denounce her former client.

“Kathy Griffin reached out to me after her Trump mask photo posted a few months ago and a few days later I had a press conference with her,"" Bloom wrote. ""Her entire team (entertainment lawyer, criminal lawyer and several others) approved in advance the statements she and I were going to make. Yet Kathy then during the press conference spontaneously chose to put aside the notes we had worked so hard on together. She said on camera “my notes are by the wayside and it’s all off the cuff” and then ad libbed. I was sorry she made that choice but I respected her right to speak as she saw fit. She was, as she always says, then widely panned for her comments. Now she blames me. She’s the only client I’ve ever had who chose to extemporize at a press conference rather than read from notes we prepared in advance.

“I got a lot of death and rape threats afterward and still do. I know Kathy has as well and I’m sure it’s unnerving.

“Kathy has now made a video about how women should stand together, and yet she’s attacked me, a lifetime women’s right attorney, and not the rest of her team, all of whom were men. This is sad, but I still believe that Kathy Griffin is one of the funniest comics alive, that she meant no ill will with the photo, and I wish her the best.”

The teenager, who loved nothing more than writing and performing her own songs, believed that a radio tour would allow her to follow in the footsteps of her heroes like Patsy Cline, Linda Ronstadt, Martina McBride and all of the other female artists who came before her.

But Armiger told Fox News she would soon learn that the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry came with a hefty price.

Years before pop superstar Taylor Swift was groped by a radio DJ from Denver, Colo., Armiger says she was fending off a different handsy DJ while she was underage.

""I was at a radio station in Texas and was taking a promo photo with one of the on-air DJs after doing my performances and he grabbed my butt during the photo,"" Armiger told us. ""And at the same time he was whispering in my ear, 'When are you going to be legal?'""

Armiger told us she ""was shocked"" and ""terrified"" but had no one to lean on for support.

""I brought up my fears and I was told that's how it was and if I wanted to be in music, I'd have to get over it,"" she said.

Armiger decided to keep her mouth shut after that, but things came to a head in June 2016 when the singer was sued by her record label, Cold River, and filed a counterclaim alleging the label told her to ""sex it up"" in order to become successful.

According to the lawsuit, Armiger said she was asked to ""purchase 'hot, game-changing' clothes,"" ""hug, kiss and flirt"" with radio programmers. Armiger said she was told she needed to make the programmers ""wish you would take them home with you.""

Cold River Record head Pete O'Heeron told Fox News at the time the suit was ""baseless"" and ""an attempt to try and smear good people.""

Armiger said she can't comment on her battle with Cold River after a settlement was made, but said she now wants to share her stories of sexual harassment after hearing the bombshell sexual abuse allegations against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that have rocked Hollywood.

""There's something really horrible going on behind the scenes,"" she told us, saying the country music community has its fair share of Weinstein-like behavior.

The now-26-year-old detailed several other stories of sexual harassment that she's encountered. Armiger recalled taking a radio programmer and his team to lunch when the program director asked everyone to share their ""top five list of women they would want to sleep with.""

After sharing his first choice, Armiger said a radio programmer turned to her, ""looking me in the eyes, he said, 'But you would absolutely be my No. 2.'""

Armiger said he then turned to her guitar player and said, ""Surely you've been f--king her. Where is she on your list?""

The guitar player suggested the group change the subject to something more appropriate, but Armiger said she still ""got flack"" for the exchange.

""The programmer called and said if I ever brought that guitar player back again he'd never play my music again,"" she recalled.

The singer said she was similarly rebuked after a radio DJ was interviewing her about her album ""Confessions of a Nice Girl"" at the 2010 ACM Awards.

""As we were doing the interview, he is trying to feel me up under the table -- this is on air -- trying to ask me whether or not my album title was true because surely I couldn't be a nice girl. I had to be a naughty girl,"" Armiger said.

When the DJ later asked her what her least favorite interview question was, Armiger was ""pissed"" and curtly said, ""The worst question is that you're asking me if I'm a nice girl or a naughty girl because what kind of person asks that?""

She said ""that didn't go over well"" and she learned ""not to talk back"" after that.

When Armiger filed her lawsuit against Cold River, she said many people in the country music world would not work with her anymore.

""When my story first became public and in the aftermath when I was finally to start looking for other opportunities in the industry, we went to [publishing houses] but we would be met with, 'We're not going to sign you, but we're really a big fan and we just want to know your story and how are you?'""

She continued, ""That was the consensus; that was everywhere I went. I would talk to booking agents and they were scared to work with me because they either thought somehow the tour would be canceled or I was a liability to work with.""

Armiger said she does not want to name her harassers out of fear of retribution, but she hopes coming forward with her story of harassment in the country music world will make a difference because ""it has to change.""

""I don't think it will change until people start speaking out, and for the most part they're too scared,"" she told us.

""He always put a smile on everyone's face because he always had a smile on his face,"" Elijah Estrada, a friend of Brown's, said. ""He didn't let anything hold him down or break him down. He would push through.""

Brown was stabbed multiple times in the chest after a verbal exchange escalated to a violent altercation, police said.. He was in critical condition when he was taken to the hospital, where he later died. His death was declared a homicide.

“It was random, a senseless act of violence that shouldn’t have happened,” Estrada said.

Capt. Walter Ozeki, with the Hawaii Police Department’s Criminal Investigation Division, said there were multiple people at the scene of the altercation, but they quickly fled when the situation turned violent. Shortly after the incident, police said they located several suspects.

Sarah Williams was paddling off the coast of Normanville when a 15-feet great white shark slammed into her kayak, Australia’s Channel 9 reported. Williams was fishing for squid while her brother and father, were in a motorized boat watching her from a short distance away.

“When I was in the air…it flew me into the air it felt like I was watching a typical ‘Jaws’ movie,” Williams told Channel 9.

Her father, Chris Williams, recalled hearing an “awful” sound when the shark hit the kayak and saw his daughter get “launched” out and into the water as it circled around for its prey.

“This scream…you can’t describe what this scream was like,” the father said while holding back tears. “The shark had rolled…[I could see] the dark side and the white belly, huge fins, white water everywhere.”

The father and brother powered up the motor boat and sped to rescue Sarah Williams. They spotted the shark circling back and “still having a go at her.” Luckily, they got to Williams just in time to pull her to safety.

Sarah Williams said the moment went by like a blur because of the adrenaline pumping through her body.

She added, “It was crazy, not knowing that I actually had survived such a traumatic experience.”

Teeth marks were found on the kayak. Williams was hospitalized for minor cuts and bruises.

As part of the investigation, the prosecutor's office issued a subpoena seeking company records on harassment complaints and legal settlements to determine whether any civil rights and anti-discrimination laws were broken.

""No New Yorker should be forced to walk into a workplace ruled by sexual intimidation, harassment or fear,"" said Schneiderman, a Democrat. ""If sexual harassment or discrimination is pervasive at a company, we want to know.""

The New York City-based company fired Weinstein on Oct. 8 after The New York Times and The New Yorker exposed allegations of sexual assault and harassment spanning decades.

More than three dozen women, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, have publicly accused the entertainment mogul of abuse. Weinstein has denied allegations of nonconsensual sex.

A woman who answered the phone in The Weinstein Co.'s media relations office said the company had no comment on the subpoena or news of the investigation.

Police in Los Angeles, New York City and London are also investigating Harvey Weinstein over allegations of sex abuse in those cities.

The Oscar winner was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the Producers Guild of America has started the process of expelling him.

The allegations have prompted calls in Albany to use the power of the state to crack down on harassment. Democratic Assemblywoman Nily Rozic of Queens proposed legislation that would make designers, photographers, retailers and others liable for harassment experienced by models.

I made [this necklace] for myself and my friends encouraged me to share it…We have seen several orders in the last day, so the necklace resonates with some.","The hashtag #MeToo has been trending on social media over the last few days after actress Alyssa Milano encouraged others to share their stories of sexual harassment and assault. But some retailers are using the viral campaign to sell products, and not everyone agrees with this decision.

One product in particular has sparked a wave of backlash, with many accusing the designer of profiting off others’ pain. Jewelry company Adornia announced its latest product, a lariat necklace spelling out “Me Too,” which retails for $44.

Initially, the brand promised to donate 10 percent of all proceeds to the Rape Abuse Incest National Network. However, it later amended that amount to 100 percent, though it’s unclear whether this was spurred on by harsh criticism of the product or was simply a typo.

Allure reports that Adornia’s PR company followed up their initial email, correcting the error. “Apologies for the typo — 100% of the proceeds from this necklace is being donated to RAINN. Designer Moran Amir was inspired by her own experience as a survivor of adolescent sexual abuse to help women speak out loud.” However, according to Refinery29, Adornia designer Moran Amir made the change in an effort to assuage people’s criticism of her motives. “To eschew any controversy that I was profiting off of other people's pain, I raised the donation to RAINN to 100%,” she said.

But despite the altruistic element, reactions to the necklace were fierce, with people on Twitter calling the product “opportunistic” and “gross.”

“Today in the complete and utter reprehensible cooptation of feminist causes, a brand is selling a ""ME TOO"" necklace,” one Twitter user wrote.

“It seems really opportunistic and tone-deaf to be commodifying an organic movement for awareness of sexual assault with #MeToo jewelry,” another user wrote. ""I really like the idea of wearing our beliefs on our sleeve proverbial or not.""

FITNESS COMPANY SLAMMED FOR 'INAPPROPRIATE' POSTER BLASTS CRITICS AS 'WHINY FEMINAZIS'

Others argue that there’s nothing wrong with the necklace, and is simply a symbol of female empowerment.

“I think it's cool. Feminists have always used fashion to get the message across, from Suffragette sashes to throwing away bras. Dope,” another user tweeted.

In spite of the harsh feedback to the product, Amir is standing by the necklace, and the company has responded to critics multiple times on Twitter.

“We mean no offense so decided to increase the donation to 100% for this necklace in order to state our mission more clearly,” Adornia wrote.

“I appreciate your feedback. Our intention was to unite women through this expression, not profit off their pain,” the company wrote.

Amir explained to Refinery29 why she created the necklace in the first place, noting how shocked she was by the controversy.

The same may well happen—or be happening—with Donald Trump.

One reason is that there is no hard constituency in America for political incompetence, and that is what he continues to demonstrate.

The first sign of political competence is knowing where you stand with the people. Gallup this week had him at 36 percent approval, 59 percent disapproval. Rasmussen has him at 41 percent, with 57 percent disapproving. There have been mild ups and downs, but the general picture has been more or less static.

As reported in Haaretz, there is just a one-letter difference in the Arabic language between a colloquial phrase for “Good morning” and another for “Attack them” — and Facebook’s automatic translation algorithms picked the wrong one when they converted the words into Hebrew.

When Israeli police were alerted to a picture of a man standing next to a bulldozer along with the words “Attack them” in Hebrew, they became understandably alarmed, because bulldozers have been used as weapons in hit-and-run terrorist attacks.

And rather than consult with an Arabic-speaking officer who could have immediately identified that the man had written “Good morning,” the police instead went directly to the construction site outside Jerusalem and arrested the culprit “on suspicion of incitement,” a spokeswoman told The Times of Israel.

It was another week of hunting for witches to burn in Washington. Even Gen. John Kelly, a man who has served our nation with honor and sacrifice, was nearly consumed by the flames.

Kelly’s sin is his willingness to be chief of staff to President Trump, and to try to stop the madness that appears determined to destroy Trump, no matter the cost to America.

Last week’s episode was instructive about the state of our disunion. That the deaths of four soldiers, ambushed in Niger, would be reduced to political fodder for the bonfire reveals the depths of depravity.

The first false charge was that Trump “lied” when he said recent presidents did not always make condolence calls to the next of kin. He was correct, though he could die waiting for an apology.

The second false charge was that Trump had been “disrespectful” when he called the widow of one of the fallen soldiers. Made by a Democratic congresswoman from Florida who listened to the call, the charge had the earmarks of a hit job from impeachment wing nuts.

As the fire spread, thanks to the media’s eagerness to believe anything critical of Trump, Kelly stepped forward. He commended the president for making condolence calls, which he insisted were not uniformly made, and said he gave Trump a script and that the president “in the best way he could,” followed it.",Goodwin: Leave John Kelly Alone,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/23/goodwin-leave-john-kelly-alone#commenting

Director James Comey has long been a punching bag for President Donald Trump.

Trump accused Comey of having “totally protected” Clinton in the 2016 presidential election in a series of tweets this week after the F.B.I. confirmed that Comey had drafted a statement regarding the department’s investigation into Clinton’s email server months before it was actually completed.

But while Trump publicly hit the nation’s former chief investigator hard this week, his public opinion throughout his presidency and campaign hasn't been all bad.

Criticism

On Clinton’s emails

Trump has often tweeted about Comey’s involvement in the F.B.I.’s investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state.

“Hillary and the Dems loved and praised FBI Director Comey just a few days ago. Original evidence was overwhelming, should not have delayed!” Trump tweeted in October 2016.

In May 2017, before Comey was officially sacked, Trump tweeted that Comey “was the best thing that ever happened to” Clinton because he “gave her a free pass for many bad deeds.”

“The phony Trump/Russia story was an excuse by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?” he continued.

After the F.B.I. confirmed that Comey had drafted a statement about Clinton before the investigation was completed, Trump took to Twitter to lambast the former F.B.I. chief even more.

“Wow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete. Many people not interviewed, including Clinton herself,” Trump tweeted. “Comey stated under oath that he didn’t do this – obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?” Trump tweeted.

“As it turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!” he said.

On stopping government leaks

Trump has several times tweeted his disappointment with Comey and the FBI not being able to stop “national security ‘leakers’” – and has even accused the former FBI chief of leaking as well.

“The FBI is totally unable to stop the national security ‘leakers’ that have permeated our government for a long time. They can't even find the leakers within the FBI itself. Classified information is being given to media that could have a devastating effect on U.S.” Trump tweeted in February.

In May, seven days after Comey’s termination, Trump tweeted that he had asked the former FBI director “from the beginning of [Trump’s] administration” to find “leakers” in the intelligence community.”

Trump also threatened Comey against leaking, himself, information to the media.

“James Comey better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press,” Trump tweeted on May 12.

His tweet came after the New York Times reported that Trump asked for Comey’s loyalty during a private dinner, which Comey declined to give. The New York Times cited sources who said they knew about the details of the dinner through Comey.

On Comey’s firing

Trump fired Comey on May 9 and sent his FBI chief a short, impersonal letter to make him aware of his termination.

Trump predictably took to Twitter to defend the firing and slam Democrats and those critical of Comey's removal.

“James Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI,"" Trump said on the morning of May 10.

“Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!” Trump said in a subsequent tweet.

On the Russia investigation

Comey told Trump that he was not under investigation by the FBI, Trump said in a May 2017 interview with NBC News.

“I said, if it’s possible would you let me know, am I under investigation? He said, ‘You are not under investigation,’” Trump said.

The president added during the interview that Comey is a “showboat” and a “grandstander.”

When asked if he was angry with Comey over his investigation into Russia’s meddling in the presidential election, Trump just said he “want[s] somebody that’s competent” to lead the FBI. He added that he is “a big fan of the FBI.”

Trump reportedly called Comey “crazy” and a “nut job” during a conversation with Russian officials in the Oval Office the day after Comey’s firing, according to the New York Times.

“I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job,” Trump said according to a document of the meeting obtained by the Times. “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.”

Praise

On Clinton’s emails

While the president eventually castigated Comey’s handling of the probe into Clinton’s private email server, Trump initially praised him for investigating Clinton at all.

“It took a lot of guts,” Trump said in October of Comey’s decision to reopen the Clinton investigation.

“I have to give the FBI credit. That was so bad what happened originally,” Trump said of the FBI’s original decision not to recommend charges be brought against Clinton by the Justice Department.

“It took guts for Director Comey to make the move that he made in light of the kind of opposition he had where they’re trying to protect her from criminal prosecution,” Trump said at a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

“I was not his fan, but I’ll tell you what — what he did, he brought back his reputation,” Trump continued.

He also encouraged Comey then to “hang tough.”

On the Russia investigation

In prepared remarks released ahead of Comey’s testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this year, Comey confirmed reports that Trump asked the F.B.I. to lay off his former national security adviser as the department investigated Russia’s influence on the 2016 presidential election. But Comey also confirmed that he did reassure the president that Trump was not under investigation.

Trump was “pleased” by Comey’s admission.

“The president is pleased that Mr. Comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the President was not under investigation in any Russian probe,” Trump’s lawyer said in a statement. “The President feels completely and totally vindicated. He is eager to continue to move forward with his agenda.”",What Trump has said about Comey — from having 'guts' to being a 'nut job',http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/19/what-trump-has-said-about-comey-from-having-guts-to-being-nut-job.html

The pop star’s newest music video for the single “…Ready for It” will premiere Thursday night and she’s giving fans a sizzling sneak peek of what’s to come.

The 27-year-old posted a series of clips on Instagram Monday, which teased a major battle within an explosive sci-fi world. In one scene, Swift is spotted with lightning-like powers before going face-to-face with a villain.

While Swift starts off wearing a black hooded cloak, she later transforms into a cyborg wearing a nude bodysuit.

The 32-year-old’s flesh-colored bodysuit, which was meant to mimic second skin, stirred headlines when the film first premiered.

Swift’s new song is from her upcoming album “Reputation.” Earlier this year, she unveiled the record’s first music video for the track “Look What You Made Me Do.”

Swift, who has changed a lot over the years, proudly declared, “I’m sorry, the old Taylor Swift can’t come to the phone right now. Why? Oh, ‘cause she’s dead!”

Fans immediately took to Twitter and shared their excitement for Swift's daring fashion choice:

The proposed ban is on the agenda of a meeting of ICAO's panel on dangerous goods being held this week and next week in Montreal.
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration formerly led the U.S. negotiations on the regulation of dangerous goods at ICAO meetings.
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has now decided to put PHMSA back in charge at future ICAO dangerous goods deliberations, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said Thursday.
""I strongly believe it has the potential to put the lives of airline passengers and crews at serious risk,"" he said.","The U.S. government is urging the world airline community to ban large, personal electronic devices like laptops from checked luggage because of the potential for a catastrophic fire.

The Federal Aviation Administration said in a paper filed recently with a U.N. agency that its tests show that when a laptop's rechargeable lithium-ion battery overheats in close proximity to an aerosol spray can, it can cause an explosion capable of disabling an airliner's fire suppression system. The fire could then rage unchecked, leading to ""the loss of the aircraft,"" the paper said.

The U.N. agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization, sets global aviation safety standards, although member countries must still ratify them. The proposed ban is on the agenda of a meeting of ICAO's panel on dangerous goods being held this week and next week in Montreal.

The FAA has conducted 10 tests involving a fully-charged laptop packed in a suitcase. A heater was placed against the laptop's battery to force it into ""thermal runaway,"" a condition in which the battery's temperature continually rises.

In one test, an 8-ounce aerosol can of dry shampoo —which is permitted in checked baggage — was strapped to the laptop. There was a fire almost immediately and it grew rapidly. The aerosol can exploded within 40 seconds.

The test showed that because of the rapid progression of the fire, Halon gas fire suppressant systems used in airline cargo compartments would be unable to put out the fire before there was an explosion, the FAA said. The explosion might not be strong enough to structurally damage the plane, but it could damage the cargo compartment and allow the Halon to escape, the agency said. Then there would be nothing to prevent the fire from spreading.

Other tests of laptop batteries packed with potentially dangerous consumer goods that are permitted in checked baggage like nail polish remover, hand sanitizer and rubbing alcohol also resulted in large fires, although no explosions.

As a result, the paper recommends that passengers shouldn't be allowed to pack large electronic devices in baggage unless they have specific approval from the airline. The paper says the European Safety Agency, the FAA's counterpart in Europe; Airbus, one of the world's largest makers of passenger airliners; the International Federation of Airline Pilots' Association, and the International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industries Association, which represents aircraft makers, concurred in the recommendation.

The paper doesn't address whether the ban should extend to domestic flights, but points out the risk that baggage containing a large electronic device could be transferred from one flight to another without the knowledge of the airline. The FAA said it believes most devices larger than a smartphone are already being carried by passengers into the cabin, rather than put in checked bags.

Rechargeable lithium batteries are used in consumer products ranging from cellphones and laptops to electric cars. Manufacturers like them because they pack more energy into smaller packages, but the batteries can self-ignite if they have a manufacturing flaw, are damaged, exposed to excessive heat, overcharged or packed too closely together. The fires can burn up to 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit, close to the melting point of the aluminum used in aircraft construction.

Since 2006, three cargo jets have been destroyed and four pilots killed by in-flight fires that investigators say were either started by batteries or made more severe by their proximity.

Earlier this year, the U.S. imposed a ban on laptops in the cabins of planes coming into the country from 10 Middle Eastern airports for security reasons. The ban was fully lifted in July after U.S. officials said airports in the region had taken other steps to increase security.

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration formerly led the U.S. negotiations on the regulation of dangerous goods at ICAO meetings. But the Obama administration put the FAA in charge in 2009 after congressional Democrats accused high-level officials at PHMSA of being too cozy with the industries they regulate.

Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has now decided to put PHMSA back in charge at future ICAO dangerous goods deliberations, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said Thursday. Both agencies are part of the Transportation Department.

DeFazio called the decision ""inexplicable"" in a letter to Chao.

""I strongly believe it has the potential to put the lives of airline passengers and crews at serious risk,"" he said.

Chao didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Lobbyists for lithium battery makers and companies that use the batteries in their products have previously urged the change.","US: Laptops in checked bags pose fire, explosion risk",https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/20/us-laptops-in-checked-bags-pose-fire-explosion-risk.html

At least that’s the running monologue playing out in more media outlets than we can completely ignore. But somewhere along the journey from childhood to retirement the solution to that problem has become the New Year’s Resolution that almost everyone makes and almost everyone hates: exercise more.

As children, playing outside was the reward, not the punishment … so much so that a ridiculous trend in too many elementary schools today is for children to be deprived of outside play time in a stationary timeout at recess as punishment (because we all know that the one-thing that helps discipline a hyperactive child to be calm is enforced stillness. Or not.)

Yet, trudging through the institutional world of education, exercise became the thing that the quintessential, sadistic gym teacher enforced, complete with tests, metrics and goals for the unattainable. The joy of movement dimmed as the realization that perfection was just not on the menu for most of us. And there was math to prove it. Charts, indexes, measurements, graphs – all calculated to show the weary where they fall short.

Exercise stopped being many people’s entertainment, when it stopped being fun.

I can’t be the only person who finds modern-day conversations about exercise about as compelling as a marketing report, full of deliverables and metrics. Or like a performance evaluation by a cranky boss who won’t notice the 10 things you did right, but only the one thing you did wrong.

I already live in a world of deadlines and demands. Whether at home or at work, I must comply with so many requirements that I cannot bear to take up an activity that has a to- do list.

In fact, a working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research reported that even when people were paid to go to the gym, most were not motivated to do it. Money could not camouflage the reality that many have lost that loving feeling for organized pain. And when the sales pitch is “no pain, no gain,” how surprising is it that many people just say no?

As my own children reach adulthood, I listen to their conversations about how they “should” exercise, if only they had the time. “Should” stands doomed in the English language, a verbal storeroom for closets we don’t want to clean or vegetables we don’t want to eat. As soon as you “should” do something, you don’t want to do it.

In today’s competitive school environments, the emphasis can be so much on winning that coaches don’t want to spend time with kids in general, but rather a specific few, so they cull every team to the top players.

Forgotten is the beautiful model of days past (called my childhood) in which every kid could come out to practice and to participate with the team, while only a deserving and talented few suited up on game day. The team was bigger than the perfect, and the fun of training together was its own reward. If you need a reminder of that, watch the movie “Rudy” with a box of tissues.

I am a proud member of the Track B team … and will probably live longer for it. The A Team intensified their performances and ran until they were sick in the grass, striving for excellence. Admirable to be sure.

On the B team, we jogged on the track, rarely so intensely that we couldn’t keep the conversation running, and got out of school on the day of the meets to run a few races and cheer on the winners. Staying in shape in the context of community was the draw.

Recently, I’ve rediscovered “running,” which for me means faster than walking at a pace most likely to be the worst in any timed race. I don’t want to train for anything, achieve anything or set a record. What I like best about running is that I’m not working.

I wonder if more people would overlook the fact that they are “exercising” if they could remember that it used to be fun outside. It feels a bit un-American to tell people don’t go for the gold, but I suspect that more people would try getting active if it sounded less like work and lot more like a reward.

Outside, you get a break from work, chores, family, computers and responsibilities.

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

RELATED: Duvet vs. Coverlet - What’s the Difference?

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor.

MICHELLE OBAMA, NOT MELANIA TRUMP, MAKES VANITY FAIR'S INTERNATIONAL BEST DRESSED LIST

Pierre, too, will reportedly be accompanying Trump to the Smithsonian on Friday morning, telling Women’s Wear Daily that he jumped at the chance.

“She asked me if I wanted to be her date, and I said, ‘Oh hell, yes,’” Pierre told WWD. “As a foreigner who became an American, to have your gown put in the Smithsonian Museum is a big huge honor.

IVANKA TRUMP SAYS SHE WENT THROUGH A 'PUNK PHASE' IN EARLY NINETIES

In a January interview with Harper’s Bazaar, Pierre said Trump herself contributed to the design of the white, off-the-shoulder dress, picking out a “beautiful six-ply silk” for the construction and specifying the shape of the neckline.



""The lines are as sleek as a paper cut; the curves of the skirt are fluid, yet the overall shape is sharp and intense,” he told the magazine. “For me it reflects her personality.”

According to the Smithsonian, the tradition of first ladies giving over their gowns began in 1912 with Helen Taft, who donated the white silk chiffon dress she wore to her husband’s 1909 inauguration.

It has been over three years since Russia illegally annexed Crimea. Yet the international community has barely lifted a finger to restore Ukraine’s sovereignty over Russian-occupied territory in Crimea and the Donbas.

Instead, we have seen half-hearted gestures and “tough talk” with very little to back it up. While America has imposed strong sanctions on Russia, our European allies have failed to match our resolve.

Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has kept thousands of his troops in eastern Ukraine, sustaining a deadly war of attrition that has hobbled Ukraine’s government, economy and society.

We can and must do more.

Currently, Putin is advocating for a United Nations “peacekeeping” mission in the Donbas, the area of eastern Ukraine occupied by Russian troops and Kremlin-backed separatist forces. Putin says the mission will protect European monitors sent to observe the conflict, but the truth is more sinister.

Ukrainians now look to the United States as their only hope for a successful future of peace and prosperity.

Putin is trying to use the creation of the peacekeeping mission to force de facto recognition of the separatist quasi-states in eastern Ukraine. To set up the peacekeeping mission, Putin wants the Ukrainian government and U.N. forces to engage directly with separatist leaders, even though Moscow calls the shots. It’s a transparent attempt to secure increased diplomatic recognition for Russian-armed, Kremlin-controlled militias. Ukraine has rejected the idea out of hand.

America must speak up louder in opposition to Putin’s twisted attempt to use U.N. peacekeepers to achieve his own strategic interests. We’ve heard from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about how critical it is that we give our full support to Ukraine.

I worked with Hillary Clinton and her team when she came to Yalta to attend Ukrainian businessman and philanthropist Victor Pinchuk’s European Strategy Conference in 2013 to deliver this exact message just a few months before Putin illegally annexed Crimea.

Ukrainians now look to the United States as their only hope for a successful future of peace and prosperity.

In working for Pinchuk, I gained a first-hand understanding of how important America is to Ukrainians when it comes to beating back Russia, promoting democracy and advancing Western values.

Ukrainians have earned our support. They show their thankfulness for ongoing American efforts in surprising ways.

For example, Victor Pinchuk’s son, Roma – along with Ukrainian executives Fadi Hraibi and Daniel Valk – have come to America’s aid in areas of Houston hit hard by Hurricane Harvey.

The three Ukranians are heading the Interpipe Harvey Cleanup mission in conjunction with the relief organization Samaritan’s Purse. They’re working in low-income areas of Houston devastated by Harvey to clear trees from homes and yards, put tarps on roofs and remove mud from homes. Their focus is helping Houstonians who don’t have natural disaster insurance and the elderly.

We are lucky to have allies and friends like this.

Roma Pinchuk’s work in Houston is an example of Ukraine making the effort to secure a true partnership with America – an effort Ukrainians have been making for decades. Their work sends a loud message that Ukrainians are committed to our success and are partners in a relationship that must be reciprocal.

America faces a world where fewer and fewer countries share our values and where democracy is under attack all over the globe. Ukraine is a rare bright spot. Government leaders, businesspeople, activists and voters all enthusiastically support integrating their country and society with the West, right in Putin's back yard.

America ought to reciprocate the good will of the Ukrainian people and the generosity of individuals like Pinchuk by strongly supporting Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Putin's neo-Soviet imperialism, as well as assisting its transition to democratic governance and a free economy.

Trump responded on Twitter:

“I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!”

Despite efforts by some officials to ease political tensions over the condolence call – what typically is a private and personal moment – the feud has only continued to build.

TRUMP SLAMS 'WACKY' REP. WILSON

On Monday, Myeshia Johnson backed up part of Wilson’s account, saying Trump told her “he knew what he signed up for, but it hurts anyway.”

“It made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice,” she said.

Chevrolet won't say why.

The Bowling Green factory where the Corvette has been manufactured since 1981 has been shut down the past few months for the installation of a new paint shop and other upgrades, so the model year was already truncated.

Chevy is still scheduled to build around 9,700 of the coupes and convertibles by January, according to the newspaper, so 2018 cars won’t exactly be rare, but they may end up being among the last of their kind.

Although the folks at Chevy haven’t admitted it, they are hard at work on a next-generation sports car that’s believed to be a mid-engine successor to the Corvette.

The question is, what will be coming out of the factory when the plant starts building 2019 model year cars on January 29?

In a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times published on Saturday, Carter seemed to ally himself with Trump, criticizing the media for its coverage of the new administration.

""I think the media have been harder on Trump than any other president certainly that I've known about,"" Carter told . ""I think they feel free to claim that Trump is mentally deranged and everything else without hesitation.""

In addition, Carter also aligned himself with Trump on the issue of whether or not football players should stand while the national anthem is being played before games. Trump reignited the controversy in late September when he urged football coaches to bench players who chose to protest against racial injustice in the country by kneeling instead of standing during the anthem. Since then, National Football League ratings have plummeted while many sports fans expressed their disapproval of kneeling during the anthem and politicizing a patriotic tradition.

""I think they ought to find a different way to object, to demonstrate. I would rather see all the players stand during the American anthem,"" Carter said.

The former president also pushed back against one of the prevailing narratives Democrats and liberal-leaning media outlets have pushed in the days following Trump's astonishing Election Day victory: whether or not the Russians affected voting outcomes. In addition, Carter said he wasn't bothered particularly with Trump's desire to cultivate a stronger and more diplomatic relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""At the Carter Center,"" the former president said, ""we deal with Putin and the Russians quite frequently concerning Syria.""

Carter added: ""I don't think there's any evidence that what the Russians did changed enough votes, or any votes"" during the 2016 presidential election.

Noting that he and his wife, Rosalynn, both voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the primaries, Carter didn't have many kind words to offer the Clintons. When The Times' Maureen Dowd compared the Carter Center to the Clinton Foundation, Carter bristled.

""Rosie and I put money in the Carter Center. We never take any out,"" Carter noted.

The Times appeared surprised that Carter ""was harder on [former President Barack] Obama during the interview than he was on Trump."" Although Carter said, ""I don't care if [Obama] gets rich or Clinton gets rich"" earning hundreds of thousands of dollars per speeches they give, he appeared to frown on making money that way.

""But I announced when I was defeated I was not going to be on corporate boards, I was not going to try to enrich myself with speeches. I was patterning my policy after Harry Truman,"" Carter said.

Carter knocked Obama on his foreign policy as president, saying that Obama ""made some very wonderful statements, in my opinion, when he first got in office, and then he reneged on that."" Although the former president said that Trump may be ""escalating"" a negative image of the U.S. among the rest of the world, Carter argued, ""but I think that precedes Trump.""

Saying that Obama ""refused"" to talk to North Korea and push for a solution to the nuclear crisis, Carter offered some approval for Trump's more direct and forceful approach. Carter even offered to help Trump by going to North Korea himself to engage in diplomatic relations.

""I would go, yes,"" Carter said. ""I'm afraid, too, of a situation ... I don't know what they'll do. Because they want to save their regime.""

Carter said that he spoke with Trump's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, earlier in the year.

The airline also confirmed that all the women pictured were employees of Southwest, who were operating a flight from St. Louis to San Francisco.

From a group photo of staffers in the aisle to shots of the two pilots in the cockpit (and also hamming it up in front of an engine), the sweet images clearly struck a chord with the Twitterverse, who blew up Southwest’s post with 20,000 likes and 300 comments. Some praised the airline for celebrating its female staffers, while other bemoaned the fact that all-female flight crews were so scarce that their existence had to be lauded.

“Congrats, @SouthwestAir! However, I am somewhat shocked that it took 114 years of flight for this to happen,” wrote one user.

“Good God it is 2017 and this is a FIRST??” questioned another.

Southwest has actually staffed an entire plane with female employees in the past, though not on a Max 8 aircraft. The company even says it's ""not uncommon"" to see an all-female crew on one of its flights, as women make up 40 percent of its workforce.

Rose, now 69, served as a medic in the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group, an elite division of the Special Forces. It was so secret that, for more than four decades, he never spoke about it to anyone – not even the people he served with.

Those that served with him, however, never forgot the bravery he showed during a four-day mission, called “Operation Tailwind,” in the landlocked country in September 1970.

Rose, then a sergeant, ran through a hail of gunfire to treat more than 50 soldiers who were fighting the North Vietnamese Army – using one hand to hoist wounded men onto his back while he fired on the enemy with his other hand.

In spite of his own injuries, he didn’t sleep for days to make sure all 16 American soldiers deployed with him made it home.

They did.

Forty-seven years later, his heroism will finally be commemorated on Monday when he receives the Medal of Honor during a special ceremony with President Trump at the White House.

“This medal and the presidential citation, it honors what the [Vietnam-era veteran] had done,” Rose told reporters on Friday. “They were asked to do a very difficult thing and they did it. They fought hard and, unfortunately, many didn’t make it back. This honors them. We stand up for them and are a focal point in that honor.”

Rose enlisted in April 1967 at the urging of his father – to avoid getting drafted by the Navy or the Marine Corps. In 1968, he graduated as a Special Forces medic and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group before being reassigned to the 46th Special Forces Company headquartered in Thailand a year later.

It was there, in April 1970, that Rose was assigned to the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group. The unit’s real purpose was to join forces with local fighters to attack North Vietnamese forces in Laos – officially off limits for combat, USA Today reported.

On Sept. 11, 1970, the unit – comprised of Americans, Vietnamese and indigenous paramilitary Montagnard personnel – were sent deep into enemy territory. As soon as they made contact, two Americans and two Montagnards were wounded, and Rose jumped into action.

The Army said the gunfire got so intense Rose had to crawl from position to position to treat the wounded.

“The actions that Mike performed during that operation, you can’t imagine it, you can’t put it into words,” said retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley, who was in charge of the unit, on Friday. “We were going into an area that U.S. forces had not been in….Had we not come out the day we were extracted, we probably would not have left.”

During the extraction of the troops, one of the helicopters crashed to the ground, injuring many on board and killing one.

Ignoring his own injuries – sustained earlier in the mission – Rose re-entered the destroyed helicopter to pull a solider to safety. McCarley said the soldier shouldn’t have survived, but did, thanks to Rose.

“I had the opportunity to meet with him [years later]…it had not affected him in any way,” he added. “Mike did a miraculous job.”

Despite the many who were wounded, only three men died during the four days of almost constant gunfire deep in enemy territory.

“My job was to focus on the individuals that were hurt,” he said on Friday. “When you focus, you don’t concern yourself on getting hurt or killed. You just have to do your job and keep going down the road.”

For his bravery, Rose earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation’s second-highest award for valor.

But what happened during those four days in Laos were never mentioned.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more. I’m proud of him, [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.” - Retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley

“When we left MAG SOC, the unit did not exist. If anyone asked me, I was going to be a mail clerk during the Vietnam War,” Rose said.

That is until 1998, when a report by CNN and Time magazine revealed Rose and the soldiers in Operation Tailwind were sent to Laos to capture American defectors and had used deadly Sarin nerve gas during the attack.

A Pentagon investigation dismissed the report, saying the mission focused on collecting intelligence on the logistics of the North Vietnamese army and destroying their supplies.

While the story of Rose’s valor has now led to a Medal of Honor, however, the covert operations by the U.S. in Laos are still obscured as somewhere “deep in enemy-controlled territory.”

McCarley said he was disappointed Rose had previously only received the Distinguished Service Cross, saying he deserved the top honor.

For more than 40 years, McCarley and others in the military and government fought to get the award upgraded.

Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more,” McCarley said. “I’m proud of him [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.”

Rose, who will be joined by his wife, Margaret Rose, and their three children -- as well as 12 of the men who served with him in Laos -- on Monday, said he considers it a privilege to be part of the small group of service members who have received the Medal of Honor.

“We cannot forget these men and women who served this country valiantly,” he said.","Army Capt.

The 61-year-old appeared on “Piers Morgan’s Life Stories” Monday where the star revealed she considered in vitro fertilization (IVF) with third husband Mark Levinson in 1998, the same year “Sex and the City” premiered on television.

“That was my early 40s and I had just started filming ‘Sex and the City,’ the chances of getting pregnant with these procedures was, everyone was talking about it,” she explained, as reported by the UK’s Daily Mail.

“But I thought to myself, ‘Wow, I have 19-hour days on this series,” added Cattrall. ""I have weekends where I finish at Saturday morning. My Monday morning would start at 4:45 a.m. and go to one or two in the morning. How could I possibly continue to do that, especially in my early 40s?

A post shared by SEX & THE CITY in SPAIN (@sexandthecity_es) on Oct 18, 2017 at 1:31pm PDT

""And then I realized what a commitment it was just to do the procedures. I thought, ‘I don’t think this is going to happen.’ It was the first moment, it was extraordinary, in my life where I thought maybe I’m just not going to do this.”

Cattrall’s marriage to Levinson ended after six years and she never had children. Cattrall told the host befriending younger actresses in Hollywood helped her cope with those yearnings of wanting to become a parent.

“… That’s when I started mentoring young actresses, in particular, that’s where I thought I have a place to be a mom here, not a biological mom, but a mom and an auntie and a friend,” she said. “And that has really given me so much, as much as I give I get twofold back.”

A post shared by SEX & THE CITY in SPAIN (@sexandthecity_es) on Oct 18, 2017 at 1:24pm PDT

Despite Cattrall’s newfound calling, she never developed a close relationship with her co-stars.

“We’ve never been friends,” explained Cattrall. “We’ve been colleagues and in some ways it’s a very health place to be because then you have a clear line between your professional life and relationship and your persona.

""They all have children and I am ten years older and since specifically the series ended I have been spending most of my time outside of New York so I don’t see them. The common ground that we had was the series and the series is over.”

A post shared by Kim Cattrall (@kimcattrall) on Sep 27, 2017 at 8:56am PDT

Cattrall also claimed she couldn’t recall the last time she spoke with any of her former co-stars.

“… And that’s another thing that’s really disappointing is that nobody ever picks up the phone and tries to contact you and say, ‘How you doing?’” she said.

As for dreams of “Sex and the City 3” for the film franchise? Cattrall has zero regrets turning it down, despite the outpouring of fans pleading for Samantha to make a final appearance on the big screen.

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

“Aaron experienced a chaotic and horrendous existence in many respects, due to his undiagnosed brain injury,” according to the complaint obtained by People Magazine.
Boston University’s CTE Center announced in September that experts found the former football player suffered from stage three CTE.
“Hernandez had early brain atrophy and large perforations in the septum pellucidum, a central membrane,” the university’s center said in a statement.
The initial federal lawsuit claimed the NFL and the Patriots failed to ""disclose, treat or protect"" Hernandez from so-called ""repetitive impact injuries.""","Aaron Hernandez had a “horrendous existence” because he suffered from the severe chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease that caused his aggressive and explosive behavior, his lawyers said in a refiled lawsuit against the NFL and a helmet manufacturer.

The civil complaint filed on Monday accused the NFL of hiding the dangers of football and also named Riddell, the company that previously manufactured the league’s helmets that Hernandez wore when he was playing for the New England Patriots.

“Aaron experienced a chaotic and horrendous existence in many respects, due to his undiagnosed brain injury,” according to the complaint obtained by People Magazine.

The Hernandez estate also said CTE caused “aggression, explosive behavior, loss of concentration, mood swings, depression, apathy, and cognitive impairment.”

Riddell, an Illinois-based manufacturer, said it intends to vigorously defend its products and its reputation against concussion-related lawsuits

Hernandez hanged himself in his Massachusetts prison cell in April, five days after he was acquitted of the 2012 double murder of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. He was serving life in prison for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd.

Boston University’s CTE Center announced in September that experts found the former football player suffered from stage three CTE. The disease has been shown to cause depression, violent mood swings and other cognitive problems in people.

“Hernandez had early brain atrophy and large perforations in the septum pellucidum, a central membrane,” the university’s center said in a statement.

The lawyers are seeking the damages on behalf of Hernandez’s 4-year-old daughter. The case was refiled in state court after the federal case was dismissed last Friday. The initial federal lawsuit claimed the NFL and the Patriots failed to ""disclose, treat or protect"" Hernandez from so-called ""repetitive impact injuries."" The Patriots have since been dropped from the lawsuit.

During his early high school years, Hernandez was known as a gifted athlete, but was also seen with a “rough-and-tumble” crowd, the New York Times reported. His father, Dennis Hernandez, kept him grounded until his death in 2006. His mother told reporters that she was worried the death would derail her son’s life.

Erin was recently discharged, but Abby remains in recovery.

“Nearly five months after separation, we are happy to announce that both Erin and Abby Delaney are doing well as they continue to recover from this very complex surgery,” Gregory Heuer, the girls’ neurosurgeon who co-led the 30-member surgical team, said.

WOMAN'S 'MISSING' IUD TURNS UP IN HER BLADDER

Heather and Riley Delaney were told that their daughters were craniopagus conjoined twins during a prenatal ultrasound. It’s considered the least common type of conjoined twins, and only accounts for about 2 percent of cases, Fox 29 reported. They were born 10 weeks early via C-section in July 2016, and weighed 2 lbs., 1 ounce each.

“Although this has been a long journey, with many ups and downs, Riley and I are thrilled to see how well the girls are doing today,” Heather said, according to Fox 29. “We are so grateful for the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia team, and for the support and encouragement that our families, our friends and the community have given us during this long journey.”

While the hospital has performed 24 separation surgeries, the girls were considered the earliest separation of craniopagus conjoined twins ever recorded, Dr. Jesse Taylor, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon said.

“We know that children heal better and faster the younger they are, therefore our goal for Erin and Abby was separation as soon as possible with minimum number of surgeries,” Taylor said, according to Fox 29.

The twins will require additional surgeries in the future to address missing bone areas at the tops of their heads and to minimize scarring, but for now, they are working on crawling and practicing rolling over.

“The girls are inspiring,” Heather said. “As their parents, it is very neat for Riley and me to have a front row seat to this and watch them overcome these incredible obstacles. We cannot wait to see what their future holds.”",Formerly conjoined twins thriving after separation surgery,https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/10/23/formerly-conjoined-twins-thriving-after-separation-surgery.html

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates.
Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart.
Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch.

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

Investigators eventually found his body in an underground water-holding tank inside the park. The tank was large enough for a small child to fall in, according to FOX30 Jacksonville Action News.

Authorities found the boy's body after draining the tank, the news station said. An autopsy was set to be performed Monday.

Dingee says there are covers for the tanks but was unsure if they were on properly.

“And it was reported that George W. Bush, as it ends, says, ‘That was some weird s—t,’” she said on BBC’s “Graham Norton Show” with a laugh, to which host Graham Norton replied, “And it was.”

Clinton said she had called more than one previous president to see if they were attending the inauguration.

“I really tried to get out of going,” Clinton recalled after Norton said her attendance was “Shakespearean.”

“We thought, maybe others aren’t going. So we called the Bushes, and the elder Bushes were in the hospital, which I think was legitimate,” Clinton said to a laughing crowd.

The former Democratic presidential candidate recalled not knowing what to expect before attending Trump’s inauguration, referring back to what she wrote in her book, “What Happened,"" about that morning.

“What I wanted to have happen [at the inauguration] was despite the kind of campaign he ran, I wanted [Trump] to rise to the occasion of being our president and being the president for everybody, not just people who supported him,” she said.

But she was left disappointed, Clinton said. She said Trump’s inauguration speech was “dark and divisive” and was a “cry from the white nationalist’s gut.”

Clinton was a guest on the show as she continues to promote her book. She was seen with a surgical boot on stage after she broke her toe days earlier. She praised the care she received under England’s health care system. Clinton also revealed she “ignores” most of Trump’s tweets because “there are so many of them.” She admitted she responds when she feels like Trump’s tweets were “hurtful and unfair and really causing problems for people.”

Allen told the BBC that the allegations against Weinstein are “very sad for everybody involved,” but cautioned the public to avoid a “witch hunt atmosphere” where ""every guy in an office who winks at a woman is suddenly having to call a lawyer to defend himself.”

That's an assault. It's not just Hollywood it's all of society and we're going to have to come to terms with it because we haven't yet.”

The actor also said it was “infuriating” to hear that stories about sexual assault allegations were quashed previously until now and that the issue remained not only in Hollywood.

Days after the New York Times published its bombshell report on Weinstein, Clooney admitted he heard “rumors” about the producer’s alleged sexual misconduct for years but took them “with a grain of salt.” He then added Weinstein’s alleged actions were “indefensible.”

The document release was titled “Drafts of Director Comeys July 5, 2016 Statement Regarding Email Server Investigation Part 01 of 01.”

The contents of the email were largely unclear as nearly all of it was redacted. The now-public records show the email titled “Midyear Exam --- UNCLASSIFIED” was sent by Comey on May 2, 2016, to Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, general counsel James Baker and chief of staff and senior counselor James Rybicki.

On May 16, the documents showed a response email from Rybicki, saying “Please send me any comments on this statement so we may roll into a master doc for discussion with the Director at a future date. Thanks, Jim.”

The existence of the documents, reported by Newsweek, were first brought to light by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., also a member of the committee, after they reviewed transcripts of interviews with top Comey aides who alluded to the email’s existence. The Senate Judiciary Committee is investigating Comey in his role as FBI director and President Trump’s decision to fire him in May.

The senators penned a letter on Aug. 30 to newly-appointed FBI Director Christopher Wray noting their findings, saying that “it appears that in April or early May of 2016, Mr. Comey had already decided he would issue a statement exonerating Secretary Clinton. That was long before FBI agents finished their work,” the letter said. “The outcome of an investigation should not be prejudged while FBI agents are still hard at work trying to gather the facts.”

Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, was investigated by the FBI for using a private email address and server to handle classified information while serving as secretary of state.

In July 2016, Comey famously called Clinton’s email arrangement “extremely careless” though he decided against recommending criminal charges.

The existence of such an email draft raised questions about Comey’s Senate testimony in June 2017 regarding his decision to go public with findings in the Clinton email investigation.

At the time, Comey testified that he was inclined to publicly announce the results of the probe to “protect the credibility of the investigation,” after then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton had an unscheduled meeting on a tarmac in Arizona.

He also said “other things” encouraged him to make the announcement, including Lynch allegedly urging him to refer to the email scandal as a “matter” and not an “investigation.”

Just four years removed from their third straight 100-loss season in 2013, the Astros shut down the Yankees for two straight games after dropping three in a row in the Bronx.

Next up for the Astros: Game 1 of the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday night. Los Angeles opened as a narrow favorite, but Houston aces Dallas Keuchel and ALCS MVP Justin Verlander will have plenty of rest before the matchup begins at Dodger Stadium.

Houston has never won even a single World Series game. The only previous time the Astros made it this far, they were a National League team when they were swept by the Chicago White Sox in 2005.

Now, manager A.J. Hinch's club has a chance to win that elusive first title, while trying to boost a region still recovering from Hurricane Harvey.

Houston improved to 6-0 at Minute Maid Park in these playoffs and became the fifth team in major league history to win a seven-game postseason series by winning all four of its home games.

Morton bounced back from a loss in Game 3 to allow two hits over five scoreless innings. Starter-turned-postseason reliever McCullers limited the Yankees to just one hit while fanning six over the next four.

Combined, they throttled the wild-card Yankees one last time in Houston. Aaron Judge, Gary Sanchez and their New York teammates totaled just three runs in the four road games.

CC Sabathia entered the game 10-0 with a 1.69 ERA in 13 starts this season after a Yankees loss. But he struggled with command and was gone with one out in the fourth inning.

Houston was up 2-0 in fifth when former Yankees star Brian McCann came through for the second straight game by hitting a two-run double after snapping an 0-for-20 skid with an ground-rule RBI double to give Houston its first run on Friday night.

The Yankees, trying to reach the World Series for the first time since 2009, lost an elimination game for the first time this season after winning their first four in these playoffs. New York struggled on the road this postseason, with this loss dropping the team to 1-6.

After going 0 for 5 with runners in scoring position through the first three innings, the Astros got on the board with no outs in the fourth with the 405-foot shot by Gattis off Sabathia which made it 1-0.

Altuve launched a ball off Tommy Kahnle into the seats in right field with one out in the fifth for his fifth homer this postseason. It took a while for him to see that it was going to get out, and held onto his bat until he was halfway to first base before flipping it and trotting around the bases as chants of ""MVP"" rained down on him.

Altuve finished 8 for 25 with two homers and four RBIs in the ALCS after hitting .533 with three homers and four RBIs in the ALDS against Boston.

Carlos Correa and Yuli Gurriel hit consecutive singles after that before Kahnle struck out Gattis. McCann's two-strike double, which rolled into the corner of right field, cleared the bases to push the lead to 4-0. Gurriel slid to avoid the tag and remained on his belly in a swimming pose at the plate for a few seconds after he was called safe.

It was just the second Game 7 in franchise history for the Astros, who dropped Game 7 to the Cardinals in the 2004 NLCS 13 years ago today.

Sabathia allowed five hits and one run while walking three in 3 1/3 innings. He wasn't nearly as sharp as he was in a Game 3 win and just 36 of the 65 pitches he threw were strikes.

Morton got into trouble in the fifth, and the Yankees had runners at the corners with one out. Bregman fielded a grounder hit by Todd Frazier and made a perfect throw home to allow McCann to tag Greg Bird and preserve Houston's lead. McCann held onto the ball despite Bird's cleat banging into his forearm. Chase Headley grounded out after that to end the inning.

A night after Springer kept Frazier from extra-bases with a leaping catch, Judge returned the favor on a ball hit by Yuli Gurriel. Judge sprinted, jumped and reached into the stands to grab his long fly ball before crashing into the wall and falling to the ground for the first out of the second inning.

Springer had another nifty catch in this one, jumping in front of Marwin Gonzalez at the wall in left-center to grab a ball hit by Bird for the first out of the seventh inning.","Astros beat Yankees 4-0, head to World Series",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/21/astros-beat-yankees-4-0-head-to-world-series.html

The show's format pivoted to focus on victims of the shooting, as well as those recovering from hurricanes and wildfires, with a night of somber tributes, inspirational anthems and voices lifted in harmony.

Aldean, who was on stage at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when the shooting occurred Oct. 1, stood side-by-side with the night's other award winners, including Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, Chris Stapleton and Keith Urban, to dedicate the night to music fans. The honorees did not accept awards or give speeches as usual, but some chose to perform or other musicians performed in their honor.

""We've been tested beyond our worst nightmare these past few months,"" Aldean said during the live broadcast from Nashville, Tennessee. ""Heartbroken doesn't even begin to describe how some of us feel. But we have proven time and again in this country that we have the power to overcome anything that threatens our way of life, or our freedom. We dedicate this night to you and everyone who has experienced loss or tragedy in the last few months.""

Aldean closed out the night with a defiant and rollicking group performance of ""I Won't Back Down"" by Tom Petty with Urban, Stapleton and Little Big Town.

Andra Day kicked off the awards show with her anthem ""Rise Up,"" in a beautiful harmony duet by Little Big Town. Then Lee Ann Womack, Danielle Bradbury and rapper Common joined them for a performance of ""Stand Up For Something.""

""On this night when we usually celebrate a year of music, we also want to celebrate a year of incredible human spirit, the spirit we see in our fans every night,"" Stapleton said.

""So in some small way we want to thank you for your resolve and perhaps lift your spirits for just a moment,"" Urban said.

The names of the 58 victims from Las Vegas were listed during an in memoriam segment, along with the names of Petty, Gregg Allman, Glen Campbell, Don Williams and Troy Gentry.

Other performances including Bryan singing his single ""Fast,"" and Stapleton singing his song ""Broken Halos,"" a song that he's dedicated to victims of the Vegas shooting.

The Backstreet Boys sang Florida Georgia Line's emotional ballad ""H.O.L.Y."" and Keith Urban performed a jazzy version of his song ""Blue Ain't Your Color.""

Phillip Phillips added some blues licks to Sam Hunt's mega hit ""Body Like a Back Road,"" which was named song of the year by CMT.

Near the end of the night, Bryan took a moment to honor his friend Aldean.

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

RELATED: Start With These Gorgeous Low-Maintenance Indoor Plants

Turn the lights down. If you’ve got absolutely no time to get ready for guests, you can try this last-ditch technique: Turn the lights down low, or close the blinds. The darker the room, the less dirt your guests will see. The darkness will hide many of your sins.",8 tricks to speed-clean your house before unexpected guests arrive,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/8-tricks-to-speed-clean-your-house-before-unexpected-guests-arrive.html

After spotting the Chrysler 200, which had been reported missing a few weeks earlier, a patrol officer called for backup and then tried to pull it over, but the driver sped away onto the interstate.

Fox 25 reports that the chase reached speeds over 100 mph, and when a spike strip was placed in the road ahead the Chrysler swerved toward the officer waiting to pull it out of the way after the car passed by. Two police cars then drove over the strip and suffered flat tires while other vehicles picked up the pursuit.

The chase finally ended after about 20 miles and the four occupants of the car were arrested.

The three passengers then claimed that they were victims of a kidnapping, before investigators were able to tie them to the driver, Joshua McMillan, who was charged with assaulting a police officer, eluding capture and unauthorized operation of a vehicle.

The judge, Army Col. Jeffery R. Nance, will hear at a sentencing hearing at Fort Bragg from one soldier involved in the search for Bergdahl who must now use a wheelchair, unable to speak because of a head wound. Another is still unable to use his right hand.

A third searcher sustained a leg wound from enemy fire that ended his career as a Navy SEAL.

At the hearing Monday, Bergdahl's defense showed a video from President Trump's comments from the Rose Garden on Oct. 16 and the campaign trail in Dec. 2015, questioning whether the judge could do his job in an unbiased manner.

Federal prosecutors, however, said Trump was only answering questions asked by reporters.

Judge Nance said Trump saying “but” in his statement to reporters negated his previous statement where he said he wouldn’t comment on the case.

Nance added that no one has ask him to recuse himself from the case, as Bergdahl's defense lawyer said they want to review the motion to dismiss the case. Nance then ordered the court into recess, adding that the hearing will continue Wednesday at 10 a.m. and may go into Monday of next week.

Bergdahl, who was held for five years by Taliban allies, could face life in prison on charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy after he pleaded guilty to the charges last week.

Here are the stories of the wounded searchers who are part of the case against Bergdahl.

'ALL OF THE SUFFERING'

Retired Senior Chief Petty Officer James Hatch is expected to testify about a leg wound he sustained on a search mission that ended his career as a Navy SEAL.

""Senior Chief Hatch has always said he wants him to have a fair trial and a fair sentence, with the understanding of all the suffering that he caused by trying to support his own agenda,"" Buddy Rake, Hatch's lawyer, told the Associated Press.

Hatch has said his team had 90 minutes to plan a separate search mission under poor conditions, but felt the mission was crucial.

""I did not want Sgt. Bergdahl's mother to see her son executed on YouTube,"" Hatch said in a statement.

The team's helicopters came under fire as they were landing to search near the Pakistan border.

Hatch testified his leg was hit by AK-47 fire, and a military dog that helped locate enemy fighters was killed. Hatch now runs a nonprofit providing care and support for military and law enforcement dogs.

He credits survival to team members who quickly applied a tourniquet.

""They saved me from bleeding to death,"" said Hatch, who entered the pretrial hearing limping.

Rake, himself a Navy veteran, declined to say what level of punishment Hatch thinks is appropriate, but said he believes Bergdahl should, at a minimum, be deprived of an honorable discharge.

""As you go through life you get all sorts of trophies and awards, but the most important that I've ever received is the one that says 'honorable discharge,'"" he said.

'THE BEST AMERICA HAS TO OFFER'

Army National Guard Master Sgt. Mark Allen had already served in Iraq and could have begged off another deployment, a family friend told the AP.

""He told me that he was coming back to a frontline unit because they were going to be deployed and he didn't want his guys to go alone,"" Robert Stokely said.

Allen was shot in the head in July 2009 while searching for Bergdahl in Afghanistan. The traumatic brain injury dramatically changed life for Allen, his wife and two children. Once an avid outdoorsman, Allen now depends on a wheelchair and can't speak.

Allen's wife, Shannon, declined to be interviewed, but the toll was evident as she sat crying in the courtroom the day Bergdahl pleaded guilty.

Before being wounded, Allen gave words of support to Stokely after his son — National Guard Sgt. Michael Stokely — died in Iraq in 2005.

""If you want to look at the best America has to offer, look at the Allen family,"" Robert Stokely said.

'I MANNED THOSE MISSIONS'

When he was recalled to be deployed in Afghanistan, Jonathan Morita, of California, who served as an Army corporal, was a reservist and Iraq veteran taking college classes.

""Every time I hit my finger on something, there's only one image that pops in my head -- and it's him."" - Jonathan Morita

""I was at home enjoying life as a civilian — going to school, working at a job,"" he told the AP in a phone interview earlier this year.

During the search mission for Bergdahl that left Allen wounded, a rocket-propelled grenade shattered Morita's hand. While, the projectile didn't explode, he needed multiple surgeries that left him unable to bend the thumb or index finger on his right hand.

""Imagine doing things with your three fingers,"" Morita said. ""I can't even change the oil on my car.""

As he's trying to learn again how to brush his teeth and write, Morita still feels anger towards Bergdahl.

""Every time I hit my finger on something, there's only one image that pops in my head, and it's him,"" he said.

In a second interview with the AP, Morita said he was struck by Bergdahl's comment in court that he didn't think such a large search would be mounted for him.

""I manned those missions,"" he said. ""I mean anybody who's ever watched 'Black Hawk Down' would know that we do that.""

On Thursday, John W. Kelly, the White House Chief of Staff and a retired four-star Marine general, rightly told the world that America’s troops deserved their countrymen’s respect, falsely and wrongly trashed Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, and arrogantly refused to take questions from reporters who lacked a nexus to a fallen American soldier or a Gold Star family. A day later, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders proclaimed that ex-generals should be immune from criticism, or as she put it, “If you want to get into a debate with a four-star Marine general, I think that’s something highly inappropriate.”

Well, scientists believe that our canine friends really are attempting to communicate using that pout or those irresistible pleading eyes.

Researchers found that dogs raise their eyebrows when they are looked at, a mechanism which makes their eyes appear bigger.

But the clever clogs canines won't do the same when handed food - suggesting their brow waggling is more than just excitement and could be an attempt to tell us something.

There is plenty of evidence that primates adopt facial expressions when they are in front of an audience.

But there has been little research into how our pets might be manipulating us using their eyes and facial movements.

Experts at the University of Portsmouth found that dogs produced significantly more facial movements when being watched than not.

They increased the frequency of certain expressions as a way of communicating.

This included puppy dog eyes, unromantically described as movement AU101, which was used more when being watched by a person.

This was because dogs know it can bring them what they want, study lead Professor Juliana Kaminski and her colleagues concluded.

Writing in the study, which was published in Scientific Reports, Prof Kaminski stated: ""Another possibility is that the AU101 lets the eyes of the dogs appear bigger and more infant-like.

""Regardless of the exact mechanism, it seems that humans are particularly responsive to this facial movement in dogs.

""Increased production of this movement in response to human attention could benefit dogs in their interaction with humans, therefore.""

The team tested 24 different breeds of dogs including German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers and mongrels.

They were observed while interacting with a human demonstrator facing them, with their back to them and with or without food.

It has been a big week for dog research in the science world.

In addition to learning of their potentially manipulative ways, scientists have also discovered that our beloved pets know when we are afraid and that it, in turn, makes them feel fear too.

Biagio D’Aniello of the University of Naples discovered that pooches exposed to fear smells (formed in our sweat) showed more signs of stress than those exposed to happy or neutral smells.

Sen. John McCain appeared to take a swipe at President Trump in an interview that aired Sunday when he called out the “highest income” Americans at the time who found a doctor to say they had a “bone spur” so they could avoid the Vietnam draft.

McCain was interviewed on C-CPAN3, American TV and talked about the war. The interview was wide ranging, but he mentioned the draft.

“We drafted the lowest income level of America and the highest income level found a doctor that would say that they had a bone spur,” McCain said “That is wrong. That is wrong. If we are going to ask every American to serve, every American should serve.”

The New York Times reported last year that Trump received a total of five military deferments during the war. Four were for education and one—in 1968—was the bone spurs in his heels. During that time, the U.S. inducted about 300,000 men into the military.

“I had a doctor that gave me a letter, a very strong letter on the heels,” Trump told the paper.

Charleston Hartfield, 34, was buried Friday following private graveside services. His burial came after a funeral that drew more than 2,000 family members, friends and police and military officers, with honors that included a motorcade down the Las Vegas Strip.

The married father of two was off-duty and attending the Oct. 1 concert where a gunman opened fire from a hotel room.

LAS VEGAS SHOOTING DETAILS STILL MURKY AS MANDALAY BAY ORDERED TO KEEP EVIDENCE

However, a year before his death, Hartfield began a computer file detailing the instructions for his funeral.

“If you’re reading this, then I’ve been called home,” Hartfield’s note read. The file was found by his wife, Veronica, following his death.

“Nothing I type will make this any easier, so I will get to the facts. My largest request: Please do not allow anyone to wear black. Black is totally depressing and I don’t want anyone expressing their sorrow over my passing,” Hartfield’s instructions read.

Hartfield asked that Nina Simone and Johnny Cash songs also be played during his funeral.

“I would like for everyone to enjoy themselves. And remember me for who I was. The truth only. None of that stuff about how great I was. Only real stories,” the officer wrote.

Everyone broke that rule over the next hour.

Friends, his cousin, brother and sister, and police and military officials including Brig. Gen. Zachary Doser, the head of the Nevada Army National Guard, characterized the man most called ""Chucky"" as an inspiration, a mentor and a quick wit.

Doser praised Hartfield, who at age 34 had accumulated 17 years of military service in Iraq and with a quartermaster unit in the Nevada Guard, as the epitome of ""everything good about being an American.""

Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo called Hartfield, an 11-year police veteran, a “remarkable officer” killed by “an unremarkable person.”

COUNTRY STARS HONOR LAS VEGAS SHOOTING VICTIMS AT CMT ARTISTS

Investigators have not determined what motivated the shooter, Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired accountant, real estate investor and high-stakes gambler, to plan and execute his attack.

Lombardo said Hartfield 's death was considered on-duty because he tried to shield, protect and shepherd people in a concert crowd from danger.

""That night, in a hail of gunfire, Charlie's last actions spoke for him,"" Lombardo said. ""He took actions to save lives.""

Hartfield asked to be buried in a veteran’s area so he could continue to “protect” the U.S. with the other buried veterans.

“The only way I would like to be placed in the ground is if it’s in a veteran’s area. That way myself and the crusty old vets can hold formations and continue to protect and serve our great country once more,” Hartfield wrote.

But, it also reflects one of the most highly debated issues within Christian churches: ""What does the Bible have to say about homosexuality? Is it condemned as a sin? Is it part of the human condition that was never properly understood? Or, is the Bible just not up to date?

I asked two pastors who hold different views on the issue to join me in studio in New York City to talk about this. Stan Mitchell, senior pastor of Gracepointe Church in Nashville, TN... and Shane Idleman, lead pastor of Westside Christian Fellowship in Lancaster, California. Pastor Idleman has received death threats over his traditional preaching on marriage. While Pastor Mitchell has seen his congregation dwindle in size once he began performing same sex marriages. Each is firm in their beliefs of what constitutes the Truth. However, each expressed a loving kindness towards the other despite having different views on how to interpret their Holy Scripture on the topic of homosexuality.",What Does the Bible Say about Homosexuality?,https://radio.foxnews.com/2017/10/20/what-does-the-bible-say-about-homosexuality/

""This dog eventually took care of her, was her only family and pulled her wheelchair,"" Sharon Henderson told FOX7 Austin.

The canine's owner made a plea to Henderson and another woman, known as ""Miss Jane,"" to take care of Ladybird before the woman died -- but another man took off with the pooch before they could get to her.

“The neighbor in the living facility called this other homeless guy and he came and took ladybird in the middle of the night knowing that her wishes were that he not have her,” Henderson said.

Ladybird had a chip in her neck, which Henderson and the other woman tracked all the way to Portland, Ore. They believe the man hitchhiked the entire way there with the dog.

'Trick-or-treat' is right around the corner and one way to help keep Halloween safe is to make sure kids can see and be seen.

""Costumes should be as bright and colorful as possible, especially since a lot of trick or treating happens in the evening hours,"" Dr. Omar Baker says. ""And we always recommend to our patients if the costume is dark to consider using reflective tape.""

Dr. Baker also says make sure younger kids can't trip on their costumes, use a flashlight, walk in large groups with parents, if under age 12 and watch where kids are walking.

""Kids get extremely excited during Halloween, sometimes in unpredictable ways, so pay close attention to the sidewalks,"" Dr. Baker says.

He also urges homeowners to clear a path, keep lights on and pets inside and to help avoid a sore tummy.

""You want kids to be kids, but obviously with guidelines and limitations.""

He also says a good meal before they go out can help curb the appetite for candy when they get home.

Some familiar advice still holds true. Dr. Baker says remind kinds not to eat any candy that's not in its original wrapper. He also encourages homeowners to keep kids with allergies in mind and to only offer treats that don't contain nuts. For young children, he suggests non-toxic face paint as an alternative to masks, but says don't forget to wash it off before bedtime.

Last week’s episode was instructive about the state of our disunion. That the deaths of four soldiers, ambushed in Niger, would be reduced to political fodder for the bonfire reveals the depths of depravity.

The first false charge was that Trump “lied” when he said recent presidents did not always make condolence calls to the next of kin. He was correct, though he could die waiting for an apology.

The second false charge was that Trump had been “disrespectful” when he called the widow of one of the fallen soldiers. Made by a Democratic congresswoman from Florida who listened to the call, the charge had the earmarks of a hit job from impeachment wing nuts.

Roughly half the taxpayers in the U.S. pay no income taxes.
As a practical matter, most taxpayers need to make around $39,000 before they’re hit by the income tax.
When critics of tax reform claim it’s a tax cut for the rich, that’s of course because it’s only middle-income and upper-income people who pay income taxes.
When critics of tax reform claim it’s a tax cut for the rich, that’s of course because it’s only middle-income and upper-income people who pay income taxes.","Of all the tall tales told about taxes, the tallest is that the rich don’t pay their fair share.

The Internal Revenue Service this month released its latest numbers and they show that not only do the rich, along with the middle-class, pay the most in income taxes, but their burden has been going up, not down.

Our tax system is unfair, at least if you measure fairness by the fact that a very small number of taxpayers carry almost all the income tax burden.

The top ten percent of earners, those making more than $138,000 in 2015, made 47 percent of the nation’s income, but they paid 71 percent of the nation’s income tax. The top 1 percent, the people former President Obama decried the most, made 21 percent of the nation’s income in 2015, but they paid 39 percent of the nation’s income tax.

Not only are these people paying their fair share, they’re picking up other people’s shares as well.

Roughly half the taxpayers in the U.S. pay no income taxes. As a practical matter, most taxpayers need to make around $39,000 before they’re hit by the income tax. All taxpayers pay the payroll tax, but according to a recent study by the Urban Institute, when workers retire, Social Security and Medicare give taxpayers their money back. The less money you make, the more likely you are to get all your payroll taxes back, and then some.

When critics of tax reform claim it’s a tax cut for the rich, that’s of course because it’s only middle-income and upper-income people who pay income taxes. And it’s been that way for a long time.

Income taxes are different. You don’t get them back. They pay for the military, nuclear weapons upkeep, environmental protection, food stamps, housing assistance, welfare, Medicaid and a myriad of other services and transfer payments.

There are 140,000 million taxpayers in the United States. Half of them make less than $39,275, the cutoff point that divides the top 50 percent from the lower 50 percent. Because taxes are so high on upper income Americans, that means that 70 million Americans – 50 percent of the country – pay 97 percent of the income tax. The other half pay less than 3 percent.

When critics of tax reform claim it’s a tax cut for the rich, that’s of course because it’s only middle-income and upper-income people who pay income taxes. And it’s been that way for a long time.

In 2001, the top 10 percent made 43 percent of the money and they paid 64 percent of the income tax. The top 1 percent made 17 percent of the money and paid 33 percent of the income tax.

The proposed tax reform pending in the Congress will likely continue this trend because the doubling of the standard deduction and the increase in the child credit mean more people will pay no taxes, shifting the burden even more to the few people who do. As for upper income people, so long as their share of the tax cut is in proportion to their share of the taxes they pay, it’s hard to argue that the tax cut is unfair.

But what about Warren Buffet’s secretary? Remember her? We were told she pays a higher tax rate than her boss. Perhaps Mr. Buffet reduced his tax rate thanks to an abundance of charitable giving combined with other reasons, but examples like this, according to the IRS, are exceptions to the rule. It’s bad policy to legislate by rare anecdote, especially when the facts run contrary to the anecdote.

The system is incredibly progressive. According to the IRS, in 2015, the top 1 percent paid an average tax rate of 27.1 percent, the top 10 percent paid an average rate of 21.4 percent, the top 30 percent paid an average rate of 17.4 percent and the top 50 percent paid an average rate of 15.7 percent. The bottom 50 percent paid an average rate of 3.6 percent.

Average Tax Rate:

Top 1% 27.1% Top 10% 21.4% Top 30% 17.4% Top 50% 15.7% Bottom 50% 3.6%

Not only do middle-income and upper-income Americans pay the most, they make it possible for their fellow Americans to receive quite a bit of government largesse. According to a study from the American Enterprise Institute, 60 percent of U.S. households, those making less than about $51,000, receive more in transfer payments than they pay in federal taxes.

The bottom 20 percent of earners, according to AEI, received $9600 in government transfer payments in 2013 and paid only $800 in federal taxes. They got back twelve times what they paid in.

The United States is a generous nation. A small group of people pay an awful lot of money which gets redistributed to their fellow citizens.

As Congress considers tax reform, the best policy would be a new tax code with lower rates that stimulates the economy to create more jobs and lift wages. When the economy booms again, fewer workers will need government payments and instead, they can join the ranks of taxpayers who earn enough to see the merits and fairness of income tax rate cuts.","Taxes and the rich -- yes, they pay their fair share, and they will after tax reform, too",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/23/taxes-and-rich-yes-pay-their-fair-share-and-will-after-tax-reform-too.html

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, we were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse. To love each other well is to love our children well.",What happened when my daughter saw me kiss my wife,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/what-happened-when-my-daughter-saw-me-kiss-my-wife.html

No location or cause of death were reported.

Young was born Nov. 6, 1946, in Glasgow, Scotland. After emigrating with his family to Sydney in 1963, Young made a splash as guitarist and principal songwriter for the Easybeats, a wildly popular Beatles-styled unit. They enjoyed several top-10 singles in their home country, including “She’s So Fine,” “Wedding Ring” and “Sorry.” They burst into international prominence with the smash “Friday On My Mind,” co-written with bandmate Harry Vanda, which reached No. 16 in the U.S. in early 1967.

Further stateside success eluded the band, which split in 1969. However, Young’s Easybeats material went on to be championed internationally by such acts as Australia’s Divinyls and INXS, David Bowie (who included “Friday On My Mind” on his 1973 covers album “Pin Ups”) and such punk-era American acts as the Plimsouls and the Three O’Clock.

During the early ‘70s, Vanda and Young became Australia’s most prominent producing duo, helming the first five studio albums by AC/DC, which featured Young’s siblings, lead guitarist Angus and rhythm guitarist Malcolm, behind lead vocalist Bon Scott. They produced the band’s 1975 debut set “High Voltage” and its four successors, which featured such early staples of the band’s repertoire as “Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap,” “Whole Lotta Rosie” and “Let There Be Rock.” They also worked with contemporaneous Aussie hard rock acts like Rose Tattoo and the Angels.

In 1976, Young and Vanda returned to performing with the pseudonymous studio project Flash and the Pan. The overtly quirky duo reached the U.S. top 100 with their debut single “Hey, St. Peter,” while Grace Jones covered the pair’s “Walking in the Rain.”

Young retired from the music business in the late ‘90s, but returned to the studio in 2000 to produce AC/DC’s album “Stiff Upper Lip,” which reached No. 3 in Australia and No. 7 in the U.S.

Young was inducted twice into ARIA, Australia’s pop music hall of fame: with Vanda in its inaugural year of 1988 and as a member of the Easybeats in 2005.

The star can be seen in the video below addressing her crowd from her seat atop a planet that was, presumably, supposed to lower her onto the stage for her next song. Unfortunately, something went wrong and the star got stuck in the air with the crowd gawking at her. Known for her elaborate performances, the future “American Idol” judge had to vamp a bit noting that this was the first time she’d experienced this in her long career.

“This is the first time I’ve been stuck in space,” the 32-year-old singer joked. “You’d better pick your phone up because this is a Youtube-able moment!”

Eventually, the star received word through an earpiece that the crew would be lowering her straight down. While she seemed thrilled at first, she quickly realized that it would be impossible for her to be lowered all the way to the ground without squashing a handful of her adoring fans.

“You know what, I guess I’m just going to have to get down and walk amongst my people. I love this so much,” she said, tentatively standing up. “Should I just like… jump?”

With a roar of approval from the crowd, the video ends with Perry leaping from her platform and safely getting set back down by fans and employees of the venue.

We’ve got good news for you — scientists are working on an injection that blocks your hunger for junk food.

And in doing so it can help you slim down by stopping you from eating as much.

The injection has also been shown to reduce the risk of obesity-related diseases like diabetes in fat monkeys — more good news!

A protein, called GDF15, has been found to naturally regulate body weight in humans and animals.

When it’s injected into mice it made them eat less and lose weight, reports New Scientist.

Several teams have tried to use it as an obesity treatment before but were unsuccessful as the protein broke down too quickly in the body for it to have any effect.

But now a team from pharmaceutical company Amgen has found a way to make it last longer in the body.

They used an antibody and added it to the protein, which made it take longer to break down.

When it was used on obese monkeys it made them eat 40 percent less.

And when given weekly injections they lost an incredible 10 percent of their body fat over a six week period.

They were also more tolerate of glucose, or sugar, which meant their risk of developing type 2 diabetes was reduced.

There are currently five obesity medications that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

These have been found to help patients lose an average of seven to 12 percent of their body weight over the course of a year.

But none have been as successful as the new drug looks like it could be.

Study author Murielle Véniant said the GDF15 hybrid injection did not appear to cause any adverse side effects in monkeys.

Clinical trials will be needed to see how the drug works on people before it is available.

Other studies have found that when injecting the protein into mice it binds to neurons in the stomach and intestines and sends signals to the part of the brain responsible for appetite.

That same part of the brain is responsible for your cravings.

The protein caused mice to keep food in their stomachs for twice as long, making them feel fuller for longer.

As the investigation heats up and key players like former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and press secretary Sean Spicer are interviewed by investigators, several attorneys with experience in federal cases spoke out with their concerns this week.

Harvey Silverglate, a criminal defense attorney in Massachusetts, wrote an opinion piece accusing Mueller of once trying to entrap him when Mueller was acting U.S. attorney in Boston.

“I have known Mueller during key moments of his career as a federal prosecutor,” Silverglate wrote for WGBH News. “My experience has taught me to approach whatever he does in the Trump investigation with a requisite degree of skepticism or, at the very least, extreme caution.”

According to Silverglate, Mueller once sent someone into Silverglate's office offering to give false testimony for a client. Silverglate said he turned the offer down and noticed the man was wearing a wire.

“Years later I ran into Mueller, and I told him of my disappointment in being the target of a sting where there was no reason to think that I would knowingly present perjured evidence to a court,” Silverglate wrote. “Mueller, half-apologetically, told me that he never really thought that I would suborn perjury, but that he had a duty to pursue the lead given to him.”

A spokesman for the special counsel’s office declined to comment.

Sidney Powell, a former federal prosecutor, also took aim at Andrew Weissmann, the prosecutor tapped by Mueller to help lead the investigation, in a piece this week titled, “Judging by Mueller's staffing choices, he may not be very interested in justice.”

Powell accused Weissmann, once the director of the Enron Task Force, of “prosecutorial overreach” in past cases and said it could signal what’s to come for President Trump and his associates in the Russia probe.

“What was supposed to have been a search for Russia’s cyberspace intrusions into our electoral politics has morphed into a malevolent mission targeting friends, family and colleagues of the president,” Powell wrote in The Hill. “The Mueller investigation has become an all-out assault to find crimes to pin on them — and it won’t matter if there are no crimes to be found. This team can make some.”

Powell cited several cases where Weissmann won convictions that were later overturned.

Powell, who also spoke to Fox News last month, was so outraged after one case involving Weissmann that, in 2012, she filed a formal complaint of prosecutorial misconduct with the Texas bar and the DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility.

The complaint alleged witness threatening, withholding exculpatory evidence, and the use of “false and misleading summaries.” After reviewing the complaint, the Obama administration’s OPR found no ethical violations.

MUELLER TEAM UNDER FIRE FOR ‘BRASS-KNUCKLE’ TACTICS IN BID TO SQUEEZE MANAFORT

In her op-ed, Powell criticized Weissmann over the FBI’s raid of the home of Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman.

“Mueller’s rare, predawn raid of Manafort’s home — a fearsome treat usually reserved for mobsters and drug dealers — is textbook Weissmann terrorism,” she wrote.

While Mueller’s team is facing scrutiny for its tactics and handling of past cases, federal scrutiny of Manafort predates the Mueller investigation. He had been investigated by the feds due to his past dealings in Ukraine, for which he didn’t file as a foreign agent until June 2017. Mueller later incorporated that investigation into his Russia probe.

A recent NBC News report also claimed Manafort has stronger ties to a powerful Russian oligarch than previously known.

The intensity of the current focus on Manafort was widely seen as a potential effort by Mueller’s team to pressure him into providing information on others, possibly Trump himself, in the Russia probe.

Opinion polls show Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for nearly two decades, will win reelection comfortably if he decides to seek what would be his fourth term in March.

However, a significant minority of voters accuse him of overseeing a corrupt system that has isolated Russia from the rest of the world.

Many of them have taken part in mass protests organized by Putin critic Alexei Navalny.

Russian officials say Navalny is ineligible to run for president due to a criminal conviction which has left an opening for a genuine opponent.

Sobchak is seen by many as an alternative option to those that have had enough of Putin.

The reality TV star, who has been described by Vogue magazine as the Russian version of socialite Paris and is the daughter of Putin’s former mentor, said she had decided to run because she was tired of the same politicians, including Putin, running year after year.

The 35-year-old said she had the right to run for Russia’s top political job under the country’s constitution, which stipulates that all candidates must be 35 or older.

“I decided to exercise that right because I am against all of those (candidates) who usually exercise that right,” she said.

“When I was 18 and was studying in university, Vladimir Putin became president of Russia. Children who were born that year will go and vote themselves this year. Just think about that.”

But some Russian liberals fear Sobchak’s participation will play into the Kremlin’s hands by splitting the opposition vote.

Sobchak is the daughter of Anatoly Sobchak, the reformist former mayor of St. Petersburg who hired Putin as an official in City Hall in the 1990s.

Before the action could kick off full-tilt, a little bit of establishment needed to happen. The episode opens with a rousing speech from Rick, along with King Ezekiel and Maggie, the respective leaders of The Kingdom and The Hilltop. With their combined forces behind Alexandria, war was declared on Negan and his Savior in the last season. Now, it’s time for the good guys to take the fight to the enemy.

“When I first met him, Jesus said my world was going to get a whole lot bigger,” Rick says. “Well, we found that world. We found each other. That ‘bigger world’ is ours by right,” Rick declares in an effort to fire up his troops.

As he talks, the audience is treated to a few jumps through time, including an old-man Rick with a cane, and a version of Rick from what looks like the not-too-distant future that’s standing over two graves. He explains that the new rule of law, as these three civilizations see it, is that those who want to control the world for their own benefit must go. With that, the battles lines were drawn, and the wheels got in motion for an offensive.

Morgan, Carol, Carl and Tara all work together to fortify cars and stealthily take out guards stationed at strategic outposts for the Saviors. Daryl, meanwhile, is communicating with Dwight through notes wrapped around arrows. It seems the two archers are leaning into their gimmick. Rick says goodbye to Michonne, who is still injured from the last encounter, and Carl before setting off to dispatch a guard himself and link up with the two other factions. Their numbers and fortifications seem good, but it’s all going a little too according to plan. Rick’s promise that this all ends today was more than enough to set the average viewer on edge. After all, it’s only the premiere episode.

The plan takes a while to get into full swing, but eventually Rick’s plot comes into focus. Carol and the gang set off a bomb to draw the Saviors' big guns away to investigate. Later, the search party is taken out thanks to a well-placed trap. Meanwhile, Rick and the army pull up right in front of Negan’s front door and fire 5 times into the air to get the big man himself outside.

When he comes, he’s too confident about their ability to whether whatever storm Rick has planned. Rick offers The Savior’s generals one chance - surrender now and survive. Negan, however, makes a pretty interesting counter-offer. He reveals that Gregory, former leader of “The Hilltop,” which makes up one third of Rick’s army, has turned to the Saviors. He lets it be known that anyone from the colony who continues to resist the Saviors will be banished. Additionally, their families will be kicked out and forced to fend for themselves.

It’s a tense moment behind Rick’s line, but the members of the Hilltop stay strong. Eventually, Jesus declares his and the rest of the Hilltop’s loyalty to their new leader, Maggie. With that, Rick returns to his original ultimatum. He starts counting backwards from 10 until he reaches 7. After that, an impatient Rick opens fire and the battle is on.

They trade bullets with the Saviors, but it becomes clear that a firefight is not what’s going to win the day, nor is that the extent of Rick's plan. Daryl begins leading a walker herd right into the Savior’s gates, while Father Gabriel sets an explosive-filled RV on a collision course with the fortified front. Apparently, the plan is to make the Saviors homeless. However, Rick is brought to a decision point when he notices that he has Negan pinned down and injured. Sadly, he’s not able to get a shot and has to settle for leaving him to the walkers. Thanks to Father Gabriel's wise words, Rick remembers that this isn't all about his vengeance. Following his lead, the army makes a tactical retreat.

Just when it looked like things were going off without a hitch, Father Gabriel spots Gregory. Being of no use to the Saviors or the Hilltop, he’s been left to fend for himself in the battle. Unfortunately, the former priest isn’t able to let die another man he has a chance of saving. He exits his armored car and runs over to Gregory.

In his worst act of cowardice yet, the former leader panics and runs to the car, leaving Gabriel behind. He makes his way into a trailer, the only safe haven, as the Savior’s compound gets overrun. He’s not inside for more than a second before the low, scary voice of Negan greets him. It's hard to think of anyone worse to be trapped in a small space with.

Meanwhile, Carol and Ezekiel are leading some members of The Kingdom against an outpost when a Savior lets loose a lucky grenade. With Father Gabriel, members of The Kingdom and several Saviors’ lives all in question, the episode ends with the finale of Rick’s speech from the beginning, unifying everyone in their hope for a better tomorrow.

As part of the investigation, the prosecutor's office issued a subpoena seeking company records on harassment complaints and legal settlements to determine whether any civil rights and anti-discrimination laws were broken.

""No New Yorker should be forced to walk into a workplace ruled by sexual intimidation, harassment or fear,"" said Schneiderman, a Democrat. ""If sexual harassment or discrimination is pervasive at a company, we want to know.""

The New York City-based company fired Weinstein on Oct. 8 after The New York Times and The New Yorker exposed allegations of sexual assault and harassment spanning decades.

More than three dozen women, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, have publicly accused the entertainment mogul of abuse. Weinstein has denied allegations of nonconsensual sex.

A woman who answered the phone in The Weinstein Co.'s media relations office said the company had no comment on the subpoena or news of the investigation.

Police in Los Angeles, New York City and London are also investigating Harvey Weinstein over allegations of sex abuse in those cities.

The allegations have prompted calls in Albany to use the power of the state to crack down on harassment. Democratic Assemblywoman Nily Rozic of Queens proposed legislation that would make designers, photographers, retailers and others liable for harassment experienced by models.

Actress Valerie Bertinelli, who America watched grow up on the hit show One Day at a Time, is now a fixture in the food world. The Golden Globe award-winning actress with her own Food Network show, sits down with Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo to talk about recipes from her new book Valerie's Home Cooking.

Take a LISTEN:

Back when we had a house in Park City, Utah, we frequented an Italian restaurant so often they put a sign above our regular table that said, ""Wolfie's Booth."" The reason we were at the restaurant so often? Their bacon-wrapped jalapeño shrimp. (Hold on a moment while I savor the memory of them. Seriously, my mouth is watering.) Sadly, the restaurant closed before I was able to get their recipe, so I developed this particular one on my own and have tinkered with it over the years to the point where I look for excuses to make it. A party, Sunday night football, a birthday, Tuesday night . . . I'm in, and so is my entire family, along with a few of my neighbors. The sauce is sweet with a hint of Cherry Coke, and once it connects with the jalapeño, it sits on the tongue with an exciting contrast of hot and sweet and savory. It goes well with a cold cocktail or even a light beer. These will disappear quickly.

Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Shrimp with Cherry Cola BBQ Sauce

Serves 16 Hands-on 35 minutes Total 45 minutes

CHERRY COLA BBQ SAUCE

1½ tablespoons bacon drippings

1/2 large red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)

2 garlic cloves, chopped

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon garlic powder

¼ teaspoon dry mustard

2 cups cherry cola soft drink

½ cup red wine vinegar

1 cup ketchup

SHRIMP

16 extra-large shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed (about 12 ounces)

1 jalapeño chile, stem removed, seeded, and cut lengthwise into 16 thin strips

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon black pepper

8 bacon slices, halved crosswise

Make the BBQ Sauce: Heat the bacon drippings in a small saucepan over medium-high. Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic, and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Stir in the salt, garlic powder, and dry mustard, and cook, stirring often, until the spices are toasted and fragrant and the onions are a deep maroon color, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cherry cola and vinegar, and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Stir in the ketchup. Bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until reduced to about 2 cups and the mixture coats the back of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Shrimp: Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium. Cut a long 1/4-inch-deep slit in the inner curve of each shrimp; insert 1 jalapeño strip. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Wrap each shrimp tightly with 1 bacon piece. Set on a plate, seam sides down.

Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp, seam sides down, in the hot skillet, and cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon is crisp and the shrimp are just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Serve the shrimp with the BBQ sauce.

Make Ahead: The BBQ sauce will hold up to 2 weeks in the fridge. If you're prepping for a party, the shrimp can be wrapped ahead of time and cooked later.

Trick Technique: If you're someone who loves their bacon in the morning, start saving the drippings in a jar for uses like this one!

Hamburger Helpa

Don't laugh. This dish might give you more insight into my culinary history than almost anything else. It's a throwback to my childhood and it speaks directly to my more-than-occasional desire for quickness and efficiency, in that I love a good casserole or one-skillet dish. No fuss, no muss, easy cleanup, and get-right-to-it dinner. I made this for Wolfie and his friends when they came home after soccer or Little League practice. I can still picture everyone at the kitchen table, doing homework, while I simmered the beef in the mélange of spices and added macaroni, cheese, and breadcrumbs, and then announced to a sea of smiling faces, ""Dinner's ready."" Years later, I whipped out this dish when Tom's kids entered the picture and everyone came home from college during breaks. We all know the store-bought mix; this homemade version is even better than the classic, I promise.

Serves 4 Hands-on 10 minutes Total 35 minutes

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 pound ground 90% lean beef

¼ teaspoon black pepper

1 teaspoon kosher salt

8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni

2 cups whole milk

1¼ cups warm water

1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

1/4 teaspoon paprika

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

11/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

½ cup chopped American cheese

2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives

1/4 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)

1 scallion, green part sliced

Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add the beef, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring to crumble, until browned, about 5 minutes. Preheat the broiler with the oven rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat. Reduce the stovetop heat to medium, and stir in the macaroni. Add the milk, warm water, mustard, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. 3. Bring to a low simmer; cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the macaroni is tender, about 12 minutes. Add the cheeses, and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheeses melt. Stir in the chives. Sprinkle the panko over the macaroni mixture. Broil until the panko is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with the scallion, and serve immediately.

Variation: Add some slices of jalapeño for extra kick.

The boy was diagnosed with Stage 4 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma last year. He has been undergoing chemotherapy and will be done with his treatment in August 2018.

The special day was set up by the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society’s Random Acts of Light Campaign. The campaign’s mission is to “bring light to the darkness of cancer and create awareness for the critical need to find new treatments and cures for blood cancer patients,” according to its website.

Bloom called the day at the Northwell Health Ice Center in East Meadow “a dream come true” and revealed he was scared at first but “had a lot of fun.”

Bloom was given ice skates and a custom-made jersey with his name stitched on the back, ABC 7 reported.

The boy was able to perform drills on the ice and shoot a hockey puck with the team’s players. Bloom also scored a goal, which prompted the Islanders to celebrate around their new teammate. One of the players, Casey Cizikas, wrapped up the puck Bloom shot with tape and wrote on it “1st NHL goal” before giving it to the boy.

""The one constant was always, 'I want to see my girls grow up, and I want to walk them down the aisle,'"" said Cheryl Shelton.

With seven daughters, the family realized it was unlikely the U.S. Army veteran would be able to accomplish that, so they came up with a plan to make his dream a reality.

With last minute help from hospice; David's Bridal; Taylor Elchert Photography in Tiffin, Ohio; a local hair studio, and others, the plan came together in just days.

""We had this idea we put together in three days. We got all the wedding gowns for the girls and hospice helped us out a great deal with some of the planning,"" said Cheryl.

""What girl doesn't want to get in a wedding dress and her hair and makeup done? So I was all in but more so for the reasoning behind it,"" said Candice Talbot.

The plan was kept a secret from Willie who was asked only to give away Emily Flinn, the only one of his daughters who was already married, so she could renew her vows.

""We got maried at a courthouse so there wasn't the formality to it where he could actually give me away,"" said Flinn.

""He had no clue that this was going on and everybody got dressed, so I said, 'she is going to have all the girls be the bridesmaids and everything for her;' little did he know that they were all going to be brides,"" said Cheryl.

""Actually, it was my sister, Candice, that texted me and said, 'hey, you need to pick out a wedding dress and give me your measurements because we are going to pick one out for you; you are going to walk down the aisle on Saturday,"" said Jennifer Talbot.

Three days later, with Willie in his dress uniform in a backyard ceremony, each of his daughters came out of the house, one at a time, all in wedding gowns.

""He looked a little confused , and then it was just great to see everybody,"" said Flinn.

""This was very touching for him and it was a dream that we could fulfill to the best or the closest we could possibly do,"" said Cheryl.

In a father-daughter ceremony performed by Millersburg Christian Church Pastor Wes McElravy, the girls got to see the gleam in their father's eye they would expect to see at their actual wedding.

And Willie was helped out of his wheelchair to stand with his daughters and experience his greatest wish.

""I always assumed that my dad would be there to walk me down the aisle and when the possibility was there that he wasn't going to be able to -- this was everything,"" said Lindsey Shelton.

Less than two weeks after the ceremony, on Monday, October 16, Willie Shelton passed away.

The girls will each now also have something of their own to keep for their actual weddings.

All seven will have a locket in which they will have a photo of their father with them in a wedding dress, and the words, ""a father's love never ends,"" engraved on the back.

Every year, Big Shanty Elementary School in Kennesaw invites their fifth graders to participate in “Civil War Day,” an activity where the children dress in Civil War-era costumes.

But this year, the activity created conflict after a white student dressed as a plantation owner approached a black child and allegedly said, “You are my slave,” FOX5 Atlanta reported.

Corrie Davis, the mother of the 10-year-old boy who was called a slave during the activity last month, brought attention to the incident by posting an emotional video to Facebook. The video garnered nearly 70,000 views.

“What I want them to understand is the pain it caused my son,” Davis said of her child, who did not dress up that day. “This is bringing them back to a time when people were murdered, when people died, when people owned people.”

STUDENTS MISS SCHOOL AFTER TEACHER POSTS 'I'M BUYING A GUN'



Following the incident, Davis scheduled a meeting with the school’s principal, during which she requested the district cancel the activity altogether. The school initially refused her request, saying that costumes were optional.

“No student was required to dress in period attire and any student that did so was not instructed, nor required, to dress in any specific attire,” school system spokesman John Stafford said in a brief statement.

However, a flyer about the event was sent to parents, explaining costumes would help create a more accurate portrayal.

“It creates a more realistic simulation when dressing in Civil War clothing,” the note read.

Davis was particularly upset by the flyer’s suggestion to dress in overalls, which she felt alluded to slave attire.

SUBSTITUTE TEACHER BANNED FROM SCHOOL AFTER REPORTEDLY TAPING STUDENTS' MOUTHS



“If they’re requiring that the costume be as accurate as possible...some kid is going to come to school dressed as a plantation owner,” Davis said in her video. “My son is going to be looked upon as a slave at the school.”

Davis says she does not object to the school's teaching of the Civil War, but rather, she objects to its methods.

“I’m simply saying the way in which you are going about teaching this standard is offensive,” she said.

Davis received a letter from a Cobb County assistant superintendent late last week, who wrote the school system planned to end the activity altogether.",'You are my slave:' School ends Civil War dress-up activity,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/23/are-my-slave-school-ends-civil-war-dress-up-activity.html

Compound this mess with old photos stored in albums and shoeboxes. It’s best to digitize these before time takes its toll. Click here for the easiest way to scan and save your old photos.

Organizing digital photos takes time and patience, but just follow a few simple steps, and everything should fall nicely into place.

1. Upload your photos to your computer

This should always be your first step. Even in this cloud-based era, most people have a desktop or laptop that serves as their primary computer, and you should dump your images there first.

Mac: The go-to program for Mac is simply called Photos, and it comes free with macOS. Photos works the same way on any Mac, and the photos also save easily to iCloud. Once you’ve attached your camera or inserted a memory card, go to Files >> Import and you should be in business. Photos downloads images directly into the program.

Windows: Unlike Mac, Windows doesn’t have a standard photo editor that everybody uses, but there are plenty of free and powerful options. Microsoft also offers a free photos app, Microsoft Photos, that you can use to import your photos and videos from your camera or phone. You can edit your photos with a wide range of editing tools and create fun slideshows. Click here to get the Microsoft Photos app for Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.

If you're passionate about photography, you probably love editing photos as much as you love taking them. Photoshop is one of the best editing programs out there, but it's also expensive. Click here for a free alternative that doesn't skimp out on the features you want.

2. Don’t be a photo hoarder

Trigger-happy photographers end up with countless bad pictures. They snap away, not caring about framing or the Rule of Thirds, because they’re just hoping one of those shots ends up perfect.

Luckily, you can delete those extra shots, especially the ones you took to test the exposure or are obscured by your thumb. In fact, you should delete them, not just because they’re embarrassing, but because they clog your hard drive with needless images and make your albums harder to organize.

3. Use face recognition

If you’re using Apple Photos, the face recognition feature is extremely easy to use. Just go to “Faces” and find the row of “Suggested Faces.” Double-click on any of the people you see, and you can confirm or deny which faces belong to that friend or family member. This is an easy way to create albums based on people who are close to you.

Apple doesn’t have the monopoly on face recognition, but many Windows programs require an extra step or an additional plugin.

Tip in a tip: Whether you're attending a wedding, birthday party, family reunion or other special event, one of the best things is sharing the photos you've captured. Rather than email your photos back and forth to each other, click here for a much better method.

4. Add keywords and tags

Looking for a document is easy. Just type its title into your finder, and the document should appear. But images are harder to sift through. How do you make your photos searchable? Change their metadata.

Metadata is basically the hard information that is embedded in every photo, such as the date and location that it was taken. Many photos document the type of camera, lens and exposure, too. Adding keywords and tags makes your photos easier to track down. If you’ve visited the Grand Canyon on several occasions, you can tag all of these with “Grand Canyon,” and you’ll be able to track them all down, even if they’re located in different files.

In Photos, you just click a picture and then hit the “i” icon at the top of the screen. A small window will show you the metadata, and you can instantly add keywords and tags.

When looking at a photo file’s name, you can usually right click for “info.” This will reveal the photo’s metadata, and you can add specific tags there.

5. Create files that are easy to identify

Putting together files is an art because you have to anticipate what photos you’ll be seeking in the future. Keywords help enormously, but sometimes you want to find a whole batch of photos that aren’t exactly related.

You know yourself well, and you know how you’ll end up looking for things. You’ll likely end up putting all the photos from your Cancun vacation in a file marked “Cancun,” and if you travel a lot, the “Cancun” and “Virgin Islands” and “NYC” photos will all end up in a file called “Travel,” and so on.

6. Save the images online

Even if you have plenty of gigabytes available, you’ll want to back up the pictures that you have online. Here are a few ways.

Apple: When you sign up for iCloud, you automatically get 5GB of free storage. If you use all of your iCloud storage, you can buy more, starting at 50GB for $0.99 a month. To see how much iCloud storage you are using, go to Apple menu > System Preferences. Then, select iCloud to view your total and available storage.

Google Drive: This virtual storage site comes with every Google account. Once you open your Gmail, find the features icon in the upper right-hand corner (it looks like nine interlocking squares) and find Google Drive. This will grant you 15 GB of space, which is the equivalent of about 1,500 high-res photos of 10 MB each. Alternatively, use Google Photos, which is designed specifically for images. When uploading, select “High Quality,” and you have unlimited photo storage. These images can be no more than 16 megapixels in size.

Amazon Photos: Among the many perks of an Amazon Prime membership is Prime Photos, which provides unlimited photo storage. The service also offers its own app, which can help you organize your photos on the go. Remember, a Prime membership costs $99, so it’s far from free. But aside from its capacity to organize, Prime Photo is also compatible with Alexa, so you can give commands like, “Play a slideshow,” and “Show me photos of Jane.”

Tip in a tip: Like most people, you probably signed up for Amazon Prime for one reason. Maybe it was the free shipping. Maybe it was the streaming videos or the free music. But even now, several years after Amazon Prime was founded, few people know the full breadth of their membership perks. Click here for a master list of everything you get with your Amazon Prime account.

Flickr: I’m very suspicious of Flickr. Yahoo owns the site and it’s been having epidemic security problems lately. But Flickr helped create the online photo phenomenon, and it’s still a high-quality venue with lots of sharing options. Flickr offers 1TB of storage, which is a colossal amount of space. Like Google Photos, you can easily create physical portraits, photos on canvas and photo books.

And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts.
Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts?
Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts.","Sitting at my usual corner table in the back of Buzzy’s 8-Ball Tavern and Pool Room, It occurred to me on Thursday night that there are any number of serious issues and current crisis that we could talk about for this week’s dispatch from the front lines.

But setting all those issues aside, let me tell you something that may have escaped your attention while you’ve been busy digging a backyard bomb shelter or getting up to speed on which starlets haven’t been groped by Weinstein. Apparently, and I did not see this coming, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) leadership has decided to open the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts to, wait for it… girls.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts. Boys whittled wood into sharp, pointy things and set fire to stuff, while girls generated an incredible amount of revenue selling delicious cookies. I’m particularly fond of Samoas.

My oldest boy Scooter is in the Cub Scouts, and I can vouch for the fact that he and his Den cohorts love to whittle. They can take a 400 pound oak log and turn it into a sharp, pointy twig in less time than it takes to whistle the theme to ""The Andy Griffith Show."" To be honest, they’re a pack of smelly, loud boys with a remarkable ability to recite the entire Scout oath while actually burping. I can see why girls would be clamoring to join.

In reality, most are not. And the Girl Scouts of America, which after taking into account global cookie sales, I believe is the country’s 7th largest corporation, have criticized what they see as a blatant effort to increase membership dues by the BSA. Membership numbers are down in general for youth groups across America so this may be less about gender and more about dough. Which reminds me, I also like the Thin Mints.

Back in August of this year, the president of the Girl Scouts sent a letter to the BSA president stating “…I formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 per cent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts… and not consider expanding to recruit girls.” That, my friends, is how you win a merit badge for subtle insult.

At this point, It would be fairly easy to morph this into a high brow column about gender fluidity and the need to be considerate over what pronouns someone uses when referring to their particular identification. Or perhaps turn to the subject of gender equality and how girls and boys are really no different and so no association or organization should exclude one or the other.

But I’m a guy, raising a houseful of little guys, and so my thinking isn’t particularly complicated. I’m guessing the BSA’s decision is partly driven by a need for additional revenue, as suggested by the Girl Scouts leadership, and likely in part out of concern that they might be sued by some overly sensitive soul who wants to prove a point that most folks really don’t care about.

I admit to being a bit old fashioned. Believing that there’s a place for a Boy Scouts organization and a Girl Scouts organization that focus on their respective genders doesn’t make me a misogynist or a sexist or anything else ending in “ist” or even an “ism.” I happen to believe that there’s value and benefit in girls having their own space and boys having their own space on occasion…as long as they offer equal space and opportunity.

I know that Scooter and his pals at their current stage of life would prefer to keep the “no girls allowed” sign on their clubhouse door. And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts. Give them a couple years and they’ll see things differently…they may even realize girls don’t find it attractive when you make farting noises. Although to be fair, I didn’t have that epiphany until my mid 20s.

Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts? I would have done that research but it seems like a lot of work and I’ve been busy whittling.

Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts. For their part, the BSA leadership claims the change was designed to provide more options for parents. According to BSA’s Chief Scout Executive, “We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.”

So there you have it. Sally can now be a Cub Scout. And soon, Sally can join the Boy Scouts and eventually earn the coveted Eagle Scout award. I haven’t raised this development with Scooter yet. He may or may not care, it’s hard to tell what a 10-year-old boy’s response will be. But I’ll bet you a box of cookies there’ll be a fart noise involved.",There’s a place for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

Pots and pans sure look gleaming and gorgeous coming out of the box, but after years of spaghetti dinners, roast chickens and holiday feasts, a well-used cookware arsenal is bound to show its age. Make your sauté pans, stockpots and skillets worthy of the hanging pot rack once again with a little elbow grease and a couple of easy-to-find, mild cleaning products (including ketchup, of all things) — and learn how keep the glow once you've got it back.

Below you'll find daily care and stain removal tips for cookware made of stainless steel, copper, enameled cast iron and more.

Good practices for all cookware. No matter the type of cookware, it is best to wash it as soon as possible after cooking (cleaning as you go is ideal), and use the least abrasive cleaning method you can. Washing by hand is always preferable, even for pots and pans that claim to be dishwasher safe. Washing by hand will prevent the scratches and discoloration that can happen in a dishwasher over time.

The tips and techniques that follow are good general guidelines, but you may also want to check the manufacturer's suggestions. If your cookware is under warranty, using the wrong cleaning product can void your agreement, so it pays to do your homework.

Stainless Steel

Everyday care: Ideally, wash your stainless steel pots and pans by hand soon after use, using regular dish soap. That said, stainless steel pans are one of the few types that can handle a trip through the dishwasher — so if you are in a rush, don't worry about tossing it in with the dishes. Regular cleaning in the dishwasher may create spots or a cloudy surface.

Stain removal: To brighten up cloudy or spotty stainless steel, rub the surface with a rag dampened with white vinegar. To treat stains on the bottom of the pan caused by high heat, sprinkle a gentle scouring powder (like Barkeeper's Friend) on a wet sponge or rag to create a paste, and rub it onto the stained area. Rinse with water.

Copper

Everyday care: Wash copper pots and pans by hand, using warm, soapy water.

Stain removal: Bring that lustrous finish back to discolored copper by covering your pan with ketchup (yes, ketchup) or lemon. Let the ketchup sit on your pan for at least 10 minutes, then rub the discoloration away with a rag or sponge. Rinse clean with warm water.

Enameled Cast Iron

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool before washing it — a sudden temperature change may crack the enamel. Soak the pan in warm water first, then use a soft sponge and a mild dishwashing detergent to clean it. Do not use abrasive scrubbing pads, as they can damage the enamel finish.

Stain removal: Treat discoloration on the outside of the pan using a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. For tough stains on the inside surface, fill the pan with white vinegar and water and bring to a boil on the stovetop. Turn off the heat and let the pan soak with the vinegar solution, then wash as usual.

RELATED: How to Clean Your Whole House With Vinegar

Hard Anodized Aluminum

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool completely before washing it, and never place a hot pan in cold water, which can cause warping. Wash by hand, using a mild dishwashing detergent and warm water — putting your hard anodized pans in the dishwasher may void your warranty.

Stain removal: For stains on the outside only, use a paste of baking soda or a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. Rinse with warm water.

Nonstick

Everyday care: Use low to medium heat only — higher temperatures can permanently damage nonstick pans. Wash promptly with a soft sponge and warm, soapy water. If scratches or flakes begin to appear on the nonstick surface of your pan, recycle or toss it immediately. Otherwise those flakes will end up in your food ... not something you want to happen!

Stain removal: On the outside only, try using a paste of Barkeeper's Friend or a similar scouring powder.

Cast Iron

Initial seasoning: When you buy a new cast iron pan, wash it by hand in warm, soapy water. Dry the pan with a towel, then put it in a 300-degree oven for about five minutes to dry it completely — even a bit of remaining moisture can cause rust to form on cast iron pans. Next, using a paper towel, rub about a tablespoon of olive or vegetable oil over the surface of the pan, inside and out. Wipe away excess oil — you are aiming for a thin coat. Put the pan in a 300-degree oven for an hour, let it cool, then rub it all over with a clean rag.

Everyday care: Never use soap on your cast iron pan. Promptly after each use, wipe out the pan using a paper towel and a bit of oil. If food is stuck on, run the pan under hot water and scrub the food off with a soft brush or plastic scouring pad — remember, no soap! Soap will remove the seasoning, which is what creates that wonderful nonstick surface.

Stain removal and long-term care: For really tough, stuck-on food, boil water in your pan on the stovetop for a few minutes, then clean it as usual. Reseasoning occasionally will help maintain the finish.

Clay Pot

Everyday care: Most clay pots must be soaked in water for 15 to 30 minutes before each use. Always place your clay pot in a cold oven so the pot can come up to temperature gradually. Do not use your clay pot on the stovetop or under a broiler, and never put a hot pot on a cold surface — any sudden temperature changes can break it.

Clean it promptly, using a paste of baking soda; rinse with warm water. Soap is not recommended for unglazed clay pots, though you may be able to use a mild soap on clay pots that have been glazed; check with the manufacturer.

Stain removal: Try leaving a paste of baking soda on the discolored area for at least 10 minutes, then wipe away and rinse with water. Do not use abrasive sponges or harsh cleaning products on a clay pot.",Essential cleaning tips for the 7 most popular cookware materials,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/essential-cleaning-tips-for-7-most-popular-cookware-materials.html

Emergency landing in Knoxville.","A Delta plane flying from Atlanta to Cleveland on Sunday morning had to make an emergency landing in Knoxville, Delta spokesperson Anthony Black confirmed to FOX 8 News.

Black said the plane experienced engine trouble, forcing it to divert to Knoxville .

The plane landed without incident and taxied to the gate on its own, Black said. None of the 139 passengers or six crew members were injured during the incident.

Another plane was sent to pick up the passengers and bring them to Cleveland. It landed in Cleveland about three hours later than its original arrival time.

Shaken passengers spoke to Fox 8.

""When I saw the stewardesses looking at emergency manuals, I knew it was pretty serious,"" said Greg Mosko, a passenger.

""I just knew there was something wrong with the engine, that's all I knew,"" said passenger, Tracy Mettler, who was trying to speak through her tears.

According to the Knoxville News Sentinel, Tennessee Network Sports Columnist Joe Rexrode was aboard the plane on his way to cover Sunday's matchup between the Tennessee Titans and the Cleveland Browns. Rexrode told the newspaper that the engine trouble began around 15 or 20 minutes after the plane had taken off in Atlanta and that the smell of burning oil was overwhelming in the cabin.

He later tweeted, ""Just want to thank God right now. Flight from Atlanta to Cleveland blew an engine. Emergency landing in Knoxville.

In the song released ahead of his full album, the rapper hits back at Trump over the NFL kneeling controversy and mentions former San Francisco 49ers player Colin Kaepernick's struggle to sign with a team since he first took a knee during the national anthem.

“The president said he wants to make America great again. F--k that s--t, we gon’ make America Crip again,” Snoop Dogg raps. ""As I look around I see so many millionaires with skin like mine, don't pretend that I'm with that bulls--t your president been tweeting.""

“This still America with three K's, believe that s--t,” he adds.

The album is expected to be released on Oct. 27. The Crips is a street gang that was founded in Los Angeles in the late 1960s. Snoop Dogg told Billboard that his new album was not a “statement or a political act.”

“It's just good music. Certain people feel like we should make America 'great again,' but that time they’re referring to always takes me back to separation and segregation so I'd rather Make America Crip Again,” the rapper said.

Earlier this year, Snoop Dogg released a music video for his song, “BADBADNOTGOOD” showing him using a toy gun to shoot a clown resembling Trump. The president addressed the video in a tweet saying the rapper had a “failing career.”

""Can you imagine what the outcry would be if Snoop Dogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama? Jail time,"" Trump tweeted.

Snoop Dogg’s song comes just two weeks after Eminem released a scathing video attacking Trump, calling him a “racist 94-year-old grandpa” and a “b---h.” Eminem also addressed the NFL national anthem kneeling and showed support for Kaepernick.

The tech company recently tested a feature that showed users how many calories they would burn walking from point A to point B, along with a note that equated those calories to mini cupcakes. For example, as Buzzfeed pointed out in one example, a four and a half mile walk would burn around 406 calories: “that’s almost 4 mini cupcakes,” the app reads, alongside a pink cupcake graphic.

The feature also included additional info about how those numbers were calculated. “The average person burns 90 Calories by walking 1 mile. To help put that into perspective, we’ve estimated how many desserts your walk would burn. One mini cupcake is around 110 Calories.”

Google began testing this feature with some iPhone users about a week ago, but not everyone was happy with it. While some welcomed it as motivation to walk rather than take a car or public transit, others accused it of being potentially harmful to those with an eating disorder, pointing out that an obsession with calorie-counting can be a warning sign. There was also no opt-out option available, forcing anyone who used the app to see the built-in feature.

""This is reinforcing behaviors that we’re trying to stop when we're treating a patient for an eating disorder,"" Michelle Lupkin, Ph.D., clinical director of the Eating Disorders Program at Montefiore Medical Center, tells SELF. And, according to Jennifer J. Thomas, Ph.D., codirector of the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, using exercise as a way to compensate for calories consumed is a hallmark of eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, SELF reports.

In addition to the potentially harmful side effects of the feature, as the Washington Post points out, Google’s measurements of both calories burned and calories per cupcake were questionable.

“Lunatic Trump is running headlong into ruin, taking America with him, and the poor puppet forces are following him, at the peril of their lives,” the regime’s state-run Korean Central News Agency said in an editorial. “It would be needless to regret when they are about to fall off a cliff of era, together with their master.”

The Hermit Kingdom ridiculed countries backing the U.S. as “puppet forces” that were “being treated as a street girl.”

“What is ridiculous is the puppet forces' poor plight of being treated as a street girl even though they play the coquette with the U.S. and serve it with devotion,"" the statement read, adding that countries, including South Korea, have been “brainwashed” and are unable to think independently without the U.S.’ help.

Over the weekend, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also received an “unprecedented” letter from North Korea, issuing a blistering warning to countries following the U.S.’ mission to end the regime’s nuclear program.

“If Trump thinks he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation"" as ""the DPRK has emerged as a fully-fledged nuclear power,” the letter, published by The Sydney Morning Herald, stated.

North Korea also said if Trump thought it could bring Kim Jong Un’s regime “to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance.”

Turnbull told Melbourne Radio 3AW on Friday the letter was sent to “a lot of countries” and dismissed it as a “rant” against Trump.

The KCNA editorial and Australia letter come as a new report released by Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfar Center for Science and International Affairs detailed North Korea’s other, non-nuclear weapons, that could cause widespread devastation. The report, “North Korea’s Biological Weapons Program: The Known and Unknown,” stated the dictatorship may have “anthrax and smallpox” pathogens that could be turned into weapons.

North Korea is believed to have started its chemical and biological weapons program in the early 1960s and began possibly weaponizing biological agents in the 1980s, according to the report. However, it’s unclear if Kim and his scientists have already weaponized biological agents that could be loaded onto missiles. The ROK Defense White Paper often refers to anthrax and smallpox, leading officials to believe they are more likely to turn to those agents first.

The report also stated concerns that a Pyongyang Bio-technical Institute is being used to produce “military-sized batches of biological weapons.” Photos released by North Korean state media in 2015 showed modern equipment that could convert the facility, said to be producing organic fertilizers, into one producing anthrax for weapons.

North Korea’s National Defense Commission issued a statement strongly refuting the claim that the Biotechnology Institute is an anthrax production facility, according to the study.

The teenager, who loved nothing more than writing and performing her own songs, believed that a radio tour would allow her to follow in the footsteps of her heroes like Patsy Cline, Linda Ronstadt, Martina McBride and all of the other female artists who came before her.

But Armiger told Fox News she would soon learn that the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry came with a hefty price.

Years before pop superstar Taylor Swift was groped by a radio DJ from Denver, Colo., Armiger says she was fending off a different handsy DJ while she was underage.

""I was at a radio station in Texas and was taking a promo photo with one of the on-air DJs after doing my performances and he grabbed my butt during the photo,"" Armiger told us. ""And at the same time he was whispering in my ear, 'When are you going to be legal?'""

Armiger told us she ""was shocked"" and ""terrified"" but had no one to lean on for support.

""I brought up my fears and I was told that's how it was and if I wanted to be in music, I'd have to get over it,"" she said.

Armiger decided to keep her mouth shut after that, but things came to a head in June 2016 when the singer was sued by her record label, Cold River, and filed a counterclaim alleging the label told her to ""sex it up"" in order to become successful.

According to the lawsuit, Armiger said she was asked to ""purchase 'hot, game-changing' clothes,"" ""hug, kiss and flirt"" with radio programmers. Armiger said she was told she needed to make the programmers ""wish you would take them home with you.""

Cold River Record head Pete O'Heeron told Fox News at the time the suit was ""baseless"" and ""an attempt to try and smear good people.""

Armiger said she can't comment on her battle with Cold River after a settlement was made, but said she now wants to share her stories of sexual harassment after hearing the bombshell sexual abuse allegations against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that have rocked Hollywood.

""There's something really horrible going on behind the scenes,"" she told us, saying the country music community has its fair share of Weinstein-like behavior.

The now-26-year-old detailed several other stories of sexual harassment that she's encountered. Armiger recalled taking a radio programmer and his team to lunch when the program director asked everyone to share their ""top five list of women they would want to sleep with.""

After sharing his first choice, Armiger said a radio programmer turned to her, ""looking me in the eyes, he said, 'But you would absolutely be my No. 2.'""

Armiger said he then turned to her guitar player and said, ""Surely you've been f--king her. Where is she on your list?""

The guitar player suggested the group change the subject to something more appropriate, but Armiger said she still ""got flack"" for the exchange.

""The programmer called and said if I ever brought that guitar player back again he'd never play my music again,"" she recalled.

The singer said she was similarly rebuked after a radio DJ was interviewing her about her album ""Confessions of a Nice Girl"" at the 2010 ACM Awards.

""As we were doing the interview, he is trying to feel me up under the table -- this is on air -- trying to ask me whether or not my album title was true because surely I couldn't be a nice girl. I had to be a naughty girl,"" Armiger said.

When the DJ later asked her what her least favorite interview question was, Armiger was ""pissed"" and curtly said, ""The worst question is that you're asking me if I'm a nice girl or a naughty girl because what kind of person asks that?""

She said ""that didn't go over well"" and she learned ""not to talk back"" after that.

When Armiger filed her lawsuit against Cold River, she said many people in the country music world would not work with her anymore.

""When my story first became public and in the aftermath when I was finally to start looking for other opportunities in the industry, we went to [publishing houses] but we would be met with, 'We're not going to sign you, but we're really a big fan and we just want to know your story and how are you?'""

She continued, ""That was the consensus; that was everywhere I went. I would talk to booking agents and they were scared to work with me because they either thought somehow the tour would be canceled or I was a liability to work with.""

Armiger said she does not want to name her harassers out of fear of retribution, but she hopes coming forward with her story of harassment in the country music world will make a difference because ""it has to change.""

""I don't think it will change until people start speaking out, and for the most part they're too scared,"" she told us. ""Look at my story -- they'll see that I spoke out and spoke my truth and thought for the most part people would believe my story. I didn't ever think that it would be met with doubt or disdain.""",Katie Armiger says she was blacklisted from country music after sexual harassment allegations,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/katie-armiger-says-was-blacklisted-from-country-music-after-sexual-harassment-allegations.html

The account created a stir earlier this year when Gizmodo reported that it likely belonged to Comey. At the time the account used the handle @projectexile7. The account’s name has remained Reinhold Niebuhr.

TWITTER AIMS TO BOOST USER SAFETY, UPDATES ITS RULES

While the origins of the @FormerBu handle are unclear, Reinhold Niebuhr was an American theologian who died in 1971. Comey wrote a thesis on Niebuhr while a student at the College of William and Mary.

The account’s first tweet was sent out on March 30 – a meme of Will Ferrell saying “actually I’m not even mad – that’s amazing” and a link to the FBI jobs website.

A second tweet – a photo of the Hudson River, was sent out on Oct. 18. A photo of Little Round Top, Gettysburg, was tweeted the following day with the message “good place to think about leadership and values.”

A photo tweeted on Oct. 20 showed a figure in a cornfield accompanied by the message “Good to be back in Iowa.”

With speculation again mounting that Comey was behind the account, a photo of migrating birds was tweeted Sunday. “Watching migrating white pelicans in Iowa thinking about Niebuhr’s Serenity Prayer,” read the accompanying message.

Comey was finally unmasked on Monday when he tweeted an image of himself standing on any empty road, apparently in Iowa. “Goodbye Iowa. On the road home. Gotta get back to writing. Will try to tweet in useful ways,” he wrote.

Journalist Benjamin Wittes, a close friend of Comey’s who had long refused to confirm the identity of @FormerBu, admitted Monday that the account belongs to the former FBI chief.

“OK, in light of this latest tweet, I will confirm that @FormerBu is, in fact, James Comey himself,” he tweeted.

President Trump took a swing at Comey last week when he tweeted that the former FBI director “totally protected Hillary Clinton” in the private email case.

But it turns out the joke’s on everyone who made one — including me — because it’s been the brand’s best-seller ever since.

Cut us some slack, though. Back then, there weren’t many subcompact crossovers on the road, so it did seem a little odd. But as the segment filled out over the years, it’s become clear that quirky styling is the norm, and no one does quirky like Mini. It really was a perfect fit.

Now there’s an all new one, and guess what. It’s even bigger! (A little.) It’s also much better.

The original had good looks, but economy class accommodations. The 2017 version is built on the same bones as the BMW X1, and the quality shows.

Prices start at $27,450 for a front-wheel-drive Cooper with a 139 hp three-cylinder turbocharged engine and run up to $38,650 for an all-wheel-drive John Cooper Works powered by the X1’s 228 hp four-cylinder turbo. A plug-in hybrid version is also available, but the right one — as with all Minis — is the Cooper S, which costs $32,550 with all-wheel-drive before you start getting frisky with the extensive options sheet.

That price spread puts the Countryman in a crowd that includes the Buick Encore, Mercedes GLA and Audi Q3. It deserves to be among them.

My tester rang up at $35,400 with a six-speed manual transmission and a technology package that includes a head-up display projected onto a small screen that rises from the dashboard. Radar cruise control with automatic emergency braking and an eight-speed automatic are some of the other features on offer.

The interior of the Countryman is classic Mini, with floating round gauges on the steering column, a circular housing for the infotainment system and toggle switches all over the place. Everything feels as good as it looks.

There’s an abundance of room for both passengers and stuff. The cabin easily passes the four 6-foot passenger test, and the cargo area is a very decent size that can be expanded further by flipping up the floor or sliding the rear seats forward … a feature all small crossovers should offer.

Few offer this much driving enjoyment. The Countryman is at once solid, nimble and limber. I wouldn’t take it too far off-road, but the pseudo-SUV is in its element on a twisty, bumpy, paved one. There’s even a computer game built into it that encourages this behavior by giving you points for driving on rough stuff. Meanwhile, its German roots show through as it drills down the highway with the smoothness and stability of a small freight train.

The Countryman may be quirky, but it’s no joke.

The post reportedly has been shared as a screenshot on Twitter.

Johnson’s pregnant widow, Myeshia Johnson, told ABC News that she did not write the post blasting Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., and defending President Trump. Wilson and Trump have been locked in a war of words about a phone call the president made to Myeshia Johnson.

The fake post says: “I want to set the record straight! I’m getting sick and tired of this so-called politician using my husband as a political platform. Even buy [sic] her own words she did not hear all of the conversation; she only heard part of it.”

Johnson, 25, was one of four U.S. Special Forces – or Green Berets – killed in Niger when they were attacked Oct. 4 by militants tied to the Islamic State.

The row between Wilson and Trump began Oct. 17 when the Miami-area Democrat said Trump told Myeshia Johnson in a phone call that her husband ""knew what he signed up for"" and didn't appear to know his name, a version later backed up by Johnson's aunt. Wilson was riding with Johnson's family to meet the body and heard the call on speakerphone. She was principal of a school Johnson's father attended.

SGT. LA DAVID T. JOHNSON, US SOLDIER SUBJECT OF POLITICAL FRACAS, LAID TO REST

Trump tweeted Wilson ""fabricated"" his statement and the fight escalated through the week. Trump in other tweets called her ""wacky"" and accused her of ""SECRETLY"" listening to the phone call.

ABC News reported Sunday that Myeshia Johnson did not write the post, which resembled a post from a Facebook timeline.

Fact-checking website Snopes also noted that the post is ‘dated’ Oct. 17 at 3:27 p.m., about an hour before the reported time of Trump’s call to Johnson. Additionally, the profile picture accompanying the post is square. “The social media site implemented an update in August 2017 that changed the shape of users’ profile pictures in the Facebook newsfeed from square to round,” Snopes explained.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" Monday, Myeshia Johnson said that Wilson’s version of the phone call was “100 percent correct.”

Johnson was laid to rest in Florida Saturday.

Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, 35, of Puyallup, Washington; Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson, 39, of Springboro, Ohio; and Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright, 29, of Lyons, Georgia, were killed along with Johnson in Niger.

UAE Ambassador to the United States Yousef Al Otaiba announced the operation in a statement released by the UAE Embassy in Washington, D.C. “Earlier today, Yemeni government armed forces launched a major operation against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) militants in the Shabwah Governorate of Yemen. The operation is being closely supported by a combined UAE and US enabling force.”

The statement continued, “The UAE is participating in this operation as part of a broader Arab coalition. Today’s action continues the coalition’s sustained counterterrorism mission in Yemen against AQAP, in order to disrupt the terrorist organization’s network and degrade its ability to conduct future attacks.”

A senior defense official tells Fox News the U.S. special operations forces are acting in a supporting role in what the official described as a multi-day “clearing operation” in Yemen against AQAP.

“This is not a one-day thing,” the official said describing the mission.

Meantime, Yemen's ambassador to the U.S., Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak, told Fox News Yemen welcomed “political and logistical support” from the U.S. -- but not ground troops.

YEMEN AMBASSADOR TO U.S.: NO AMERICAN GROUND TROOPS NEEDED

U.S. special operations forces are assisting Yemeni and UAE forces in an advisory capacity but could engage in direct combat if needed. However, UAE is primarily in the lead, according to the official.

U.S. Navy SEALs have participated in these types of operations since President Trump took office.

The U.S. military typically supports these types of operations by providing transport aircraft, refueling planes and -- if needed -- a ready medical team to evacuate any wounded. A “quick reaction force” held in reserve off shore would be on alert to go in as necessary, but it’s not immediately clear how many U.S. assets are being used. The official declined to comment on this aspect of the operation.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will travel Friday to Dam Neck, Virginia, home to SEAL Team Six, and will receive an update on the operation, according to officials.

There have been more than 80 U.S. airstrikes in Yemen since President Trump took office, double the average over the past five years.

Days after Trump took office, Navy SEAL Ryan Owens was killed in a raid in Yemen against AQAP. A rescue aircraft, MV-22 Osprey, was dispatched from a Navy warship offshore landing near the battle. A crash-landing of the aircraft injured three crewmembers attempting to rescue three SEALs wounded in the firefight.

A total of 14 fighters from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula were killed in the assault, and U.S. service members captured ""information that will likely provide insight into the planning of future terror plots,"" the military said at the time.

In addition to the rescue operation, Marine Corps Harrier jets and helicopter gunships from USS Makin Island, a Navy amphibious assault ship, bombed the Al Qaeda stronghold.

The U.S.-backed Yemen operation comes on heels of the Qatari ambassador to the United States' visit to U.S. Central Command based in Tampa, Florida, responsible for all U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan. It’s possible Qatar’s ambassador, Sheikh Meshal bin Hamad Al-Thani, wanted attention to this current operation to counter or compete with the message of solidarity the visit showed.

Yemen was the home of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American Islamic terror cleric linked to a chain of attacks targeting the United States. A drone strike killed him in 2011, according to the Pentagon.

In 2009, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian recruit to Al Qaeda’s Yemen branch, tried and failed to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day with explosives in his underwear. Investigators say he trained under al-Awlaki.

The previous month, Nidal Malik Hasan, a U.S. Army Medical Corps psychiatrist, killed 13 people at Fort Hood in Texas. Hasan launched the attack three weeks before he was due to deploy to Afghanistan. He had previously sent emails to al-Awlaki, investigators said.

Saudi Arabia along with other Gulf nations, including UAE, have severed diplomatic ties and imposed a boycott against Qatar since early June, claiming the tiny Gulf nation supports and terrorist groups including the Taliban and Hamas. In an interview with the Tampa Bay Times, Al-Thani said he wanted to convey to the commanding general of U.S. Central Command, Army Gen. Joseph Votel, “the commitment between Qatar and the U.S. It is not only political and economic, but most importantly military. Qatar is a long-standing ally of the U.S. in difficult times and good times.”

In February 2015, the State Department ordered an evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Yemen. U.S. Marine guards were forced to leave behind some their weapons and vehicles in order to evacuate on a civilian chartered airline from the capital city of Sanaa.

Iran-backed Houthi forces swept into the capital, joining forces loyal to the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh and have fought a bitter civil war against the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, based in Aden. A Saudi-led coalition which has received support from the United States has been battling the Houthis since 2015.

Now, he needs to address nonprofit health care providers, and just like he did last week, he doesn’t need the do-nothing-Congress to actually do it.
As strange as it might sound on first blush, Trump can use for profit companies to bring reform to health care in America.","In the oath most medical school graduates take, there is a line they say: “I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability.” If only executives at health care and pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, and hospitals took a similar oath.

In all the talk of repealing failed ObamaCare and replacing it with a well-functioning, fiscally responsible and consumer-friendly set of policies, health insurance providers have taken a beating. Drug manufacturers haven’t gotten off easy, and neither have doctors.

But one area of the health care industry that hasn’t been examined hard enough is where the bulk of health care takes place: hospitals, especially nonprofit hospitals.

Just as technology is driving changes in the economies of health care, so are the types of hospitals that provide that health care. First, what is it we’re talking about: nonprofit hospitals are designated as such by the IRS for complying with not for profit guidelines, such as who owns the hospital (a religious order, a charitable organization, or a state-run university), how much “free care” they provide to indigent patients, and other benefits the hospital shares with the community. They don’t pay federal income or state and local property taxes.

As Politico recently noted, the nation’s top seven U.S. hospitals collected more than $33.9 billion in revenue in 2015. But their spending on free treatment for low-income patients shrank from $414 million in 2013 to $272 million in 2015.

While for-profit hospitals tend to get dinged by the public for being bottom-line-driven or owned by big, faceless corporations or investor groups, nonprofit hospitals aren’t simply owned by an order of nuns in the poorest part of town. Ascension, the largest nonprofit hospital network in America runs more than 140 hospitals, 30 senior care facilities and overall claims to have more than 1200 health care facilities in 22 states. In 2016 the nonprofit Ascension made almost a half-billion in profits. Such hospitals are able to make that kind of money, not only from patients who pay, but also from for-profit ventures with for-profit partners, research programs, wellness programs, even their dining facilities.

But Ascension pales in comparison to other nonprofits. We're not talking hundreds of millions of revenue, but billions upon billions in patient revenue. Chicago's Northwestern Hospital pocketed almost $4 billion in patient revenue in 2015, and the ""business"" sitting on the most cash reserves in Oregon? Not Nike, a global shoe and athletic outfitter, but Provident Health and Services, sitting on nearly $6 billion in cash.

How does this happen? Price inflation for those patients paying for their health care, whether through private insurance or other medical coverage, with the rationale being that those fees help those who need charitable care. But it’s just not working out that way, and even ObamaCare, which was supposed to help lower costs and increase access to care, didn’t help. As Politico recently noted, the nation’s top seven U.S. hospitals collected more than $33.9 billion in revenue in 2015. But their spending on free treatment for low-income patients shrank from $414 million in 2013 to $272 million in 2015.

Take in all those numbers and consider that about two-thirds of the hospital systems in America that are enjoying record revenues operate as tax exempt, nonprofit health care providers. When such a significant part of the health industry is acting as a charity, we as taxpayers and consumers are simply begging for health care price inflation.

An investigation by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and the investigative arm of the U.S. Congress found that not for profit hospitals went out of their way to raise the cost of health care using their charitable works as the rationale, while also not fully disclosing either their actual costs or their profits.

Yet, shockingly, in all the debate about reforming health care, no one really wants to talk about the real problem: costs, and their main driver, health care facilities. Call the almost non-existent conversation about all of this Example A of the power of the special interests; that and the campaign re-election donations hitting elected officials’ campaign accounts.

President Donald Trump made a bold and strong move with his executive orders last week that enabled consumers to buy insurance coverage across state lines and end of payments to insurance companies under the Affordable Care Act, which in polite company were called subsidies, but in the real world are known as illegal bribes paid for by the long suffering American taxpayer to insurance companies already enjoying massive profits. Now, he needs to address nonprofit health care providers, and just like he did last week, he doesn’t need the do-nothing-Congress to actually do it.

The president should instruct Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to change the charity regulations to require tax-exempt hospitals to post their prices for care. Further, the regulation changes should require that anything over $20 million in revenue will not be treated as tax exempt unless the providers post prices, have complete cost transparency, and can have real evidence that at least ten percent of their care is charitable. If they will not post prices, they will have their tax-exempt status withdrawn. It’s that simple.

By bringing pricing transparency, Trump can unleash some of the best negotiators in the world: American businesses. As one of the largest consumers of health care products, American businesses can gain the ability to negotiate and drive down both the underlying costs as well as insurance premiums with pricing transparency. As strange as it might sound on first blush, Trump can use for profit companies to bring reform to health care in America. Ultimately, pricing transparency is the only way to get to consumer-centered policy. If Trump were to enforce that transparency, it would revolutionize health care in America and make the industry patient- and doctor-centric once again.",The charitable health care racket -- Trump should slap new regulations on nonprofit hospitals,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/23/charitable-health-care-racket-trump-should-slap-new-regulations-on-nonprofit-hospitals.html

Country star Alan Jackson, the late guitarist and singer Jerry Reed and songwriter Don Schlitz were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on Sunday.

Country icon Loretta Lynn returned to the Hall of Fame for the first time since she suffered a stroke in May to formally induct Jackson. Lynn, who cancelled her tour dates this year to recover, said Jackson was the only person that could make her leave her house.

She recalled meeting Jackson when he was a nervous young artist decades ago and knowing then that he would ""be one of the greatest singers in country music.""

""He hadn't let me down,"" said Lynn, who is also a member of the Hall of Fame.

The 59-year-old Jackson is still one of country music's most successful solo artists, having sold nearly 45 million albums in the United States and had 26 singles reach the top of the Billboard country charts.

With his baritone voice and knack for telling stories about small town Southern life, the Newnan, Georgia-born singer was among a wave of neo-traditionalists that broke through in the 1990s.

He joked that when he was signed to Arista Nashville, a label started by Clive Davis, they had no idea how popular he would become.

""I was just a token country singer they signed for that label and bam, I took off,"" Jackson said.

Many of his hits became instant classics, from the barroom staple ""Chattahoochee"" to the somber ""Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)"" written after the Sept. 11 attacks.

But he's also been characterized as shy and uneasy in the media spotlight.

""I am not really shy, just socially awkward,"" Jackson said. ""I just don't like to talk too much.""

Instead, he let his songs speak for him, often writing about his father, his wife and the everyday joys and sorrows of the average man. Other hits include ""It's Five O'Clock Somewhere,"" ''A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'Bout Love)"" and ""When Somebody Loves You.""

George Strait, Alison Krauss and Lee Ann Womack each performed one of Jackson's songs in his honor.

Reed, who died at age 71 in 2008, was first known as an in-demand studio musician with a unique finger picking style on the guitar. He played for and wrote songs for stars like Elvis Presley and Porter Wagoner.

Reed, originally from Atlanta, became more popular when his songs began charting. His hit song ""When You're Hot, You're Hot"" earned him a Grammy award.

In later years, he started appearing in TV and movies, most notably playing Burt Reynolds' sidekick in ""Smokey and the Bandit."" He also sang many of the songs on the soundtrack, including ""East Bound and Down.""

His daughters, Seidina Hubbard and Lottie Zavala, accepted the honor on his behalf.

Hubbard said one of her fondest memories of growing up was listening ""to the beautiful sound of that guitar in the house all the time.""

Performing some of his songs were guitarists Tommy Emmanuel, John Knowles and Steve Wariner, while Jamey Johnson performed one of his personal favorites, ""East Bound and Down.""

Schlitz, 65, from Durham, North Carolina, had his first songwriting hit in 1978 when Kenny Rogers recorded his song, ""The Gambler,"" which became Rogers' signature song throughout his career.

Other songs he helped write include ""On the Other Hand"" and ""Forever and Ever, Amen,"" both sung by Randy Travis; ""When You Say Nothing at All,"" recorded by both Keith Whitley and Alison Krauss; and ""Strong Enough to Bend,"" by Tanya Tucker.

He was elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012 and helped to create the popular songwriters in the round format at Nashville's famed Bluebird Café.

Aloe Blacc and Vince Gill sang a duet version of ""The Gambler,"" while singers Charlie Worsham and Mary Chapin Carpenter also performed his songs in his honor.

Schlitz gave some advice to his grandchildren seated in the audience from what he had learned in his career.

""No one does this alone. In your life, be a part of something bigger than yourself,"" Schlitz said.",Loretta Lynn returns after stroke to honor Alan Jackson,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/loretta-lynn-returns-after-stroke-to-honor-alan-jackson.html

The beautiful island of Cuba, once a hotspot for American tourists in the 1940's and 1950's, is now an oppressed nation of 11 million people governed by a ruthless communist dictator. In this gripping episode of ""War Stories with Oliver North,"" you'll see how Fidel Castro brought a country together with promises and hope, and then tore it apart in one swift grab for power.

You'll witness how Castro committed this ultimate betrayal through a campaign of murder, mayhem and lies to his fellow countrymen. Learn how as a Catholic schoolboy, who once wrote letters to President Roosevelt, Castro rose to command an army of idealistic revolutionaries to overthrow Fulgencio Batista. You'll bear witness to Castro's 1959 victorious entrance into the city of Havana from the man who rode alongside him. In a rare firsthand account, Oliver North interviews Huber Matos, one of Castro's most trusted commanders. Matos was betrayed, tortured and jailed by Castro for 20 years.

A high school football team is playing for more than touchdowns and stats after a relative reached out and asked if they could honor a 3-year-old girl facing a terminal illness. In response, the Dixon High School varsity team in California took the field last week with “Frankie Strong” stickers on their helmets, and played for the girl who is headed to New York for further treatments, Fox 40 reported.

Frankie, whose last name was not disclosed, was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma last year, and will have surgery to remove three of the tumors in the near future. Her uncle, Craig Militano, whose son Jake plays on the Dixon football team, said that several other tumors cannot be removed.

“She just wants to play and be a kid,” Militano told the news outlet. “It’s hard to do that when you have a tube in your nose.”

Though Frankie was unable to attend the game because of her fragile immune system, the family said the support has made a large impact on them.

“It makes me proud that I have the stage and platform for her, and make her feel happy for one night,” Jake Militano told Fox 40.

Head coach Wes Besseghini said the decision to honor Frankie was easy.

Could be real steamy, too. It's supposed to be almost 100 degrees at Dodger Stadium for the opener Tuesday night, maybe the hottest temperature ever at a World Series game.

""Now we chase the ultimate prize,"" Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. ""There's two teams standing. It's a race to four wins now. At the start there's a race to 11, we've got seven of them down.""

At least the familiar October chill that makes players and fans shiver shouldn't be an issue outdoors in sun-baked California or under the retractable roof at Minute Maid Park.

Not that young stars Cody Bellinger and Carlos Correa would mind, nor would old pros Carlos Beltran and Chase Utley, nor top starters Dallas Keuchel and Yu Darvish.

Because a chance to win a ring doesn't come very often — these teams that have already played more than 700 games against each other over the years already know that.

The Astros have never won the crown. They're playing for a whole region, with the Houston Strong patches on their uniforms representing an area hit hard by Hurricane Harvey.

""There's a lot of people that are really hurting right now in this city,"" said Verlander, the ALCS MVP. ""And it gives the city something to rally around and gives people something to cheer for that otherwise may not have a lot to be hopeful for.""

The Dodgers haven't been in the World Series since 1988, when Kirk Gibson's bat, Orel Hershiser's arm and Tommy Lasorda's moves outdid Oakland for the crown.

Now with Lakers great Magic Johnson as a part-owner, this LA team that led the majors with 104 wins is hoping to bring back the glory days that began in Brooklyn.

""I just want to win a World Series,"" Kershaw said after the Dodgers dethroned the Chicago Cubs in Game 5 of the NL Championship Series. ""I know more than anybody how hard it is to get there. So, I'm definitely not taking this one for granted.""

Said mercurial outfielder Yasiel Puig: ""The trophy's coming soon.""

The Astros, the major leagues' highest-scoring team this year, have never even won a World Series game. They only time they made it this far was 2005, when a club that included Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio, Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte got swept by the White Sox.

In fact, a World Series prize is the one piece of hardware missing from the trophy case from the Lone Star State. Texas teams have won the Super Bowl and championships in the NBA, NHL, college football and men's and women's basketball, but never in baseball.

Under the leadership of executive Nolan Ryan, the Texas Rangers came within one strike in 2011 before losing to St. Louis. The Ryan Express, who once pitched a no-hitter for Houston against the Dodgers, is currently an Astros exec.

The Astros posted 101 wins this year — not since Baltimore (108) and Cincinnati (102) in 1970 has the World Series matched teams who reached triple-digits.

These teams last met in 2015, when the Astros swept a three-game series at home. But they'd seen a lot of each other in the past.

Overall, the Dodgers are 388-323 vs. the Astros. Houston debuted as the Colt .45s as a National League expansion team in 1962, beat the Dodgers in a one-game playoff for the NL West championship in 1980 and eventually moved to the AL in 2013.

That first year in the AL, the young Astros got pounded and lost 111 times. But with smart drafts and player development, Houston emerged as a power. Hinch's club capped its rise by beating Boston in the AL Division Series, then stopping the Yankees 4-0 Saturday night in Game 7 of the ALCS.

The Dodgers, with a major league-high $226 million payroll, won their fifth straight NL West title this year, then 7-1 in the playoffs against the Diamondbacks and Cubs under manager Dave Roberts.

The result? Their first pennant since 1988 — the year Kershaw was born.","Hot World Series on deck: Altuve, Houston Astros vs Kershaw, Los Angeles Dodgers",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/22/hot-world-series-on-deck-altuve-houston-astros-vs-kershaw-los-angeles-dodgers.html

President Trump on Sunday slammed Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson for disclosing his phone conversation with an Army widow, again calling her “wacky” and a “disaster” for Democrats.

Trump has pummeled Wilson, of Florida, on social media since Tuesday, the day after Wilson listened to his call to the widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson, then told the public that Trump said, “He knew what he signed up for.”

Johnson was one of four American servicemen killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger.

“Wacky Congresswoman Wilson is the gift that keeps on giving for the Republican Party, a disaster for Dems. You watch her in action & vote R!,” Trump tweeted Sunday.

About 20 Orthodox believers in Russia have sung prayers to protest the release of a movie about the last Russian czar's affair with a ballerina.

They gathered outside the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, where ""Matilda"" was shown Monday to a selected audience ahead of its release this week.

The film loosely tells the story of Nicholas II's infatuation with ballerina Matilda Kshesinskaya.

It has angered hard-line nationalists, and some Orthodox believers see it as blasphemous. The czar is glorified as a saint in the Russian Orthodox Church.

Nicholas and his family were executed by Bolsheviks in 1918.

Chevrolet won't say why.

The Bowling Green factory where the Corvette has been manufactured since 1981 has been shut down the past few months for the installation of a new paint shop and other upgrades, so the model year was already truncated.

Chevy is still scheduled to build around 9,700 of the coupes and convertibles by January, according to the newspaper, so 2018 cars won’t exactly be rare, but they may end up being among the last of their kind.

Although the folks at Chevy haven’t admitted it, they are hard at work on a next-generation sports car that’s believed to be a mid-engine successor to the Corvette.

Phil Murphy and Kim Guadagno -- the state’s two top contenders -- are competing to replace Republican Gov. Chris Christie, the only governor to serve two full terms since Tom Kean in the 1980s.

Here’s what you need to know about the candidates ahead of the Nov. 7 race.

Phil Murphy, Democrat

Phil Murphy, 60, is a former Goldman Sachs executive and U.S. ambassador to Germany. Prior to serving as ambassador, he was the Democratic National Committee’s finance chair.

Murphy was born to a family in Boston who lived “paycheck to paycheck,” according to Murphy’s campaign website. He graduated from Harvard in 1979 with a degree in economics and later received his MBA from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.

Murphy, who is married with four children, has never held elected office. However, the Democrat is the unexpected front-runner in the race partly because of Christie’s approval rating, which hit 15 percent in June -- the lowest of any governor in the state’s history. Christie’s ratings have dropped due to the Bridgegate scandal and his time spent out of state to prepare for the 2016 presidential election, Ross Baker, a professor of American politics at Rutgers University, told Fox News.

As a result, political experts have Murphy favored to win the election.

“Where we stand now, he’s the presumptive favorite. The public is looking for someone different,” Benjamin Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, said.

And the prediction could be right: According to a Quinnipiac University poll from June, Murphy led his Republican opponent 55 to 25 percent.

Additionally, the state’s changing demographics also increase Murphy's chances of winning, Dworkin said. To give that some context: In 2007, there were 200,000 more registered Democrats in New Jersey than Republicans. By 2017, there were 800,000 more, according to Dworkin.

“The state has become much more democratic since Christie was first elected,” he said.

OBAMA RETURNS TO CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN NEW JERSEY, VIRGINIA

The results of the 2016 presidential election may also help Murphy succeed. Some voters who don’t agree with the current administration “want to go out there and send a message to Washington -- and this is how they’re going to do it,” Dworkin said.

The Democratic front-runner has been gobbling up endorsements from elected officials, faith leaders and various organizations. An extensive list of Murphy’s endorsements can be found here. But some of the most notable include: Former Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.

Additionally, former President Barack Obama, who named Murphy to his ambassador position, began campaigning for Murphy on Oct. 19.

Murphy is running on a promise to better New Jersey infrastructure, make housing in the state more affordable, tackle the opioid epidemic, crack down on gun violence and open a state-run bank that would be owned by New Jersey taxpayers, among other proposals.

NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE FRUIT, VEGGIES, TAXES

The bank -- which would be the second of its kind in the U.S. -- would give some state tax money to community banks. The community banks would then give loans to small business owners, infrastructure projects in the state and student loans. The profits would be returned to the people of New Jersey as non-tax revenue.

“Jump starting the economy-- that’s his play,” Dworkin said. “It’s an intriguing idea- but that’s it. It’s not something that’s galvanized voters.”

Kim Guadagno, Republican

Kim Guadagno, 58, served as Christie’s lieutenant governor during both terms. Prior to that, she worked as an assistant United States attorney for the District of New Jersey in Newark before accepting the role of assistant attorney general for the State of New Jersey.

Guadagno was born in Waterloo, Iowa, and is the middle of five children. She obtained a political science degree from Ursinus College before graduating in 1983 from the American University College of Law. She is married with three children, according to her campaign website.

Guadagno has repeatedly tried to distance herself from Christie, attempting to “run as her own person,” Dworkin said. But her ties to the current governor are hurting her.

Indeed, the Quinnipiac University poll found that 54 percent of New Jersey voters have a negative opinion of her because she served as Christie’s lieutenant governor.

DEMS' EFFORTS TO TIE GOP CANDIDATE TO CHRISTIE COULD BACKFIRE

“She’s a talented and qualified candidate, but this race is a tremendously uphill battle for her,” Dworkin said.

Unlike Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate in Virginia's gubernatorial race this year, Guadagno hasn’t been endorsed by President Trump-- possibly hurting her chances of getting ahead.

""Trump wants to stay away from the Republican Party in New Jersey right now, which is dragged down by the Christie brand name, and the administration thinks it has a better chance to swing things in Virginia,"" Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public policy at Princeton University, told NJ.com.

""She’s a talented and qualified candidate, but this race is a tremendously uphill battle for her.""

Guadagno is running on the promise to end the opioid epidemic, fix New Jersey transportation, grow jobs in the state, fix pension and health benefits, make the state more military and veteran friendly, and cut property taxes by as much as $3,000. New Jersey's property taxes are the highest in the nation.

If elected, Guadagno has said she won’t run for re-election if she can’t lower property taxes in her first term. But only 23 percent of voters believe her promise, according to the Quinnipiac poll.

Overall, both candidates need to encourage New Jerseyans to get out and vote, as most residents are “vaguely aware” of this year’s gubernatorial election, said Ross.",New Jersey governor race: Who are Phil Murphy and Kim Guadagno?,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/23/new-jersey-governor-race-who-are-phil-murphy-and-kim-guadagno.html

“Lunatic Trump is running headlong into ruin, taking America with him, and the poor puppet forces are following him, at the peril of their lives,” the regime’s state-run Korean Central News Agency said in an editorial. “It would be needless to regret when they are about to fall off a cliff of era, together with their master.”

“What is ridiculous is the puppet forces' poor plight of being treated as a street girl even though they play the coquette with the U.S. and serve it with devotion,"" the statement read, adding that countries, including South Korea, have been “brainwashed” and are unable to think independently without the U.S.’ help.

Over the weekend, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also received an “unprecedented” letter from North Korea, issuing a blistering warning to countries following the U.S.’ mission to end the regime’s nuclear program.

“If Trump thinks he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation"" as ""the DPRK has emerged as a fully-fledged nuclear power,” the letter, published by The Sydney Morning Herald, stated.

North Korea also said if Trump thought it could bring Kim Jong Un’s regime “to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance.”

Turnbull told Melbourne Radio 3AW on Friday the letter was sent to “a lot of countries” and dismissed it as a “rant” against Trump.

The KCNA editorial and Australia letter come as a new report released by Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfar Center for Science and International Affairs detailed North Korea’s other, non-nuclear weapons, that could cause widespread devastation. The report, “North Korea’s Biological Weapons Program: The Known and Unknown,” stated the dictatorship may have “anthrax and smallpox” pathogens that could be turned into weapons.

However, it’s unclear if Kim and his scientists have already weaponized biological agents that could be loaded onto missiles. The ROK Defense White Paper often refers to anthrax and smallpox, leading officials to believe they are more likely to turn to those agents first.

The report also stated concerns that a Pyongyang Bio-technical Institute is being used to produce “military-sized batches of biological weapons.” Photos released by North Korean state media in 2015 showed modern equipment that could convert the facility, said to be producing organic fertilizers, into one producing anthrax for weapons.

NBC News first reported that Podesta and his Democratic lobbying firm are now subjects in the special counsel’s Russia investigation, after inquiries regarding former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s finances.

The Podesta Group was co-founded by Tony and his brother John Podesta, who is a longtime Clinton aide and served as chairman of her 2016 presidential campaign.

CLINTON CAMPAIGN GLOSSING OVER ITS OWN RUSSIA CONNECTIONS

According to Monday’s NBC News report, Manafort organized a PR campaign for a pro-Ukraine nonprofit called the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine (ECMU), which reportedly was backed by a pro-Russia party. The Podesta Group reportedly was one of many firms that worked on the campaign.

According to NBC News, Mueller's team began looking at Podesta and his company and is now pursuing a criminal inquiry into whether the company violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).

Under FARA, people in the United States who lobby on behalf of foreign entities must register through the Justice Department as a foreign agent and disclose their work. Podesta's firm eventually filed a registration for the ECMU work, after the media reported on the business and Congress started asking questions.

But in a statement on Monday, a spokesperson for The Podesta Group claimed the company was in compliance -- citing a series of filings dating back years -- and is “fully” cooperating with the special counsel’s office.

“The Podesta Group fully disclosed its representation of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine (ECFMU), and complied with FARA by filing under the lobbying disclosure act over five years ago and within weeks of starting our work,” the spokesperson said. “Any insinuation to the contrary is false. The Podesta Group has fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s office and taken every possible step to provide documentation that confirms compliance with the law. Based on our due diligence and on the recommendation of definitive legal experts, the firm immediately filed the appropriate public disclosures of its representation of the ECFMU over five years ago, and in eight subsequent public filings.”

The spokesperson said the work for ECMU “was in support of Ukraine’s admission to the EU, a position supported by foreign policy experts at the time. The ECFMU provided formal certification that it was neither funded by nor directed by a government or political party.”

The special counsel’s office declined to comment on whether Mueller’s team is investigating Tony Podesta and his firm. John Podesta left the company years ago.

The development, though, would speak to how the Mueller probe may be expanding well beyond the original focus on Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential collusion with Trump associates -- ensnaring Democratic figures in the process.

“It’s a cliché, but a good cliché – prosecutors go where the evidence leads them,” former high-ranking DOJ official James Trusty, now with Ifrah Law LLC, told Fox News on Monday. “When you define the mission broadly, there is a lot of room for [an independent prosecutor’s] exploration.”

Trusty said Mueller’s investigation was broad, leaving “a lot of room to legitimately poke around and find information, on one party or another.”

“If you define it very narrowly, it is much easier to say the special counsel is a rogue elephant, but if you define the mission broadly, it is all fair game to look into any violation of federal law and relationships with Russia,” Trusty told Fox News. “You’ll find there are prosecutions no one would have anticipated at the start, or corruption from a different party than were initially looked at.”

Watson was promoted from assistant to interim coach of the Suns after Jeff Hornacek was fired Feb. 1, 2016.
Watson was the 17th Suns coach in the franchise's history.
This was the first NBA season where every coach who started one year had the same job to begin the next.","The Phoenix Suns have fired coach Earl Watson just three games in to the NBA season.

The Suns announced the firing Sunday night after hours of meetings at the team's headquarters.

Assistant coach Jay Triano, a former head coach of the Toronto Raptors, was named interim coach. Triano was an assistant at Portland before coming to Phoenix last year.

Watson was promoted from assistant to interim coach of the Suns after Jeff Hornacek was fired Feb. 1, 2016. The interim tag was removed on April 19 of that year. With an extremely young team, the Suns struggled under Watson. He compiled a 33-85 record. Watson's only full season was 2016-17, when the team went 24-58.

The 38-year-old Watson played collegiately at UCLA and in the NBA for 10 seasons. He often spoke of his long talks with John Wooden, emphasized togetherness and a family atmosphere to nurture the young squad but wins were hard to come by.

And owner Robert Sarver apparently didn't like what he saw. Phoenix is 0-3 and two of the losses were especially ugly. The Suns were blown out 124-76 by the Portland in their season opener Wednesday night, the most one-sided loss in franchise history and the most one-sided season opener for any NBA team.

Phoenix was routed by the Clippers in Los Angeles 130-88 on Saturday night.

""I Dont wanna be here,"" point guard Eric Bledsoe tweeted Sunday, just as the news of Watson's firing surfaced in an ESPN report. The tweet by Bledsoe, a former Clipper, was followed by one from the Clippers' DeAndre Jordan saying ""Come back home bro.""

Bledsoe has been rumored in possible trades for months.

Watson's dismissal is the first NBA coaching change in well over a year. Hornacek's hiring by the New York Knicks, which was finalized in June 2016, had been the most recent change -- and the irony there is that Watson got the job in Phoenix with 33 games left in the 2015-16 season, after the Suns fired Hornacek.

Watson was the league's second-youngest active coach behind the Lakers' Luke Walton, and the Suns were tied with the Chicago Bulls as having the youngest opening-night roster in the NBA this season.

""I'd like to see the fight be a little bit more,"" Watson said after the blowout loss to the Clippers. ""Or a lot more, until you know they're just fatigued.""

The Suns came into this season with only four losses by 40 or more points in franchise history. They've had two in the first three games of this season. Phoenix has not made the playoffs in seven years, the longest drought in the franchise's 49-year history.

Watson was the 17th Suns coach in the franchise's history.

By Ginny Kosola

Life is starting to return to normal in parts of California wine country, where fires destroyed lives, homes and businesses. Pam Starr, co-owner of Crocker and and Starr in St. Helena, Napa County was evacuated from her home by the fires, and she didn't know whether her business was ruined.

""Both Napa and Sonoma were filled with smoke. We didn't know what was going on,"" Starr said.

But then the skies cleared, her business was intact, and they were able to get back to work ""we had a little fruit left, we picked what was left on the Crocker estate in St. Helena.""

Starr says there are many wineries, like hers, that survived. She was touched to see first responders from as far away as Canada, and Australia, coming to California wine country to save lives and preserve homes and businesses.

Now, survivors are helping their neighbors, and wineries that are still in operation are picking up employees from the businesses that were destroyed by the fires. Starr says now that things are returning to normal, ""Napa Valley is ready for visitors, we're getting into business again.""

Starr is among those working to help get other businesses, and people's lives, back to normal. She and other winemakers are raising money and supplies to help the fire victims through a number of sites.

Universal national service would mean that more Americans would have skin in the game the next time politicians suggest another “excellent” overseas adventure.
General Kelly was right in one very important sense, too few privileged Americans bear the burdens of war.","On Thursday, John W. Kelly, the White House Chief of Staff and a retired four-star Marine general, rightly told the world that America’s troops deserved their countrymen’s respect, falsely and wrongly trashed Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, and arrogantly refused to take questions from reporters who lacked a nexus to a fallen American soldier or a Gold Star family. A day later, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders proclaimed that ex-generals should be immune from criticism, or as she put it, “If you want to get into a debate with a four-star Marine general, I think that’s something highly inappropriate.”

Sorry, but kiss the ring, bend the knee, hail Caesar’s Praetorian is not the American Way. We, the People, pay these pols’ salaries, and they owe us the very same respect that they themselves expect. They also owe us answers. Indeed, when Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority Leader, is unaware of there being 1,000 U.S. troops in Niger we deserve the truth, like yesterday.

Past-held rank and nexus to power should not be shields from inquiry. As Gen. H.R. McMaster, the current National Security Adviser and Kelly’s colleague wrote in his book “Dereliction of Duty:” “Failure in Vietnam was the result of a uniquely human failure, a responsibility shared by LBJ, his principal military and civilian advisors. The failures were many and reinforcing: arrogance, weakness, lying in the pursuit of self-interest and above all, the abdication of responsibility to the American people.” In the words of General David Petraeus, generals are “fair game.” It doesn’t get any simpler than that.

Against this backdrop, it is time for us to take a hard look at compulsory national service. Indeed, if the political cacophony surrounding the condolences extended to the family of Sgt. La David Johnson did anything, it was to lay bare the gap between the other one-percent, those Americans who actively serve in our armed forces, and the rest of us. As one lieutenant colonel stationed in Iraq said over a decade ago “we’re at war, America’s at the mall.”

As the tectonic shifts of diversity bring their own political challenges, national service could yield a badly needed common experience. It would also remind us that we all are part of America at a time when political rancor is the rule.

Sadly, with the exceptions of Vermont and Maine, military service has morphed into the province of Red State America, while the chasm in the ethos and demographics of our nation’s service academies on the one hand, and our elite universities on the other, grows ever larger. As retired General Dennis Laich and Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson recently observed, military “deployment burden” crystalizes the “urban/suburban vs. rural divide.”

Let’s be real. Scarsdale isn’t sending their best and brightest to West Point, while there aren’t too many kids from Havre, Montana, roaming the Ivy League. To quote Abraham Lincoln and Jesus, “A house divided against itself cannot stand.”

Practically speaking, national service would mean that once again Americans from all walks of life would get to know each other, North, South, the Coasts, the Great Plains, and the Mississippi Delta. As the tectonic shifts of diversity bring their own political challenges, national service could yield a badly needed common experience. It would also remind us that we all are part of America at a time when political rancor is the rule, and the word “secession” gets bandied about as a threat or an applause line.

National service could also bring the role of the military into proper perspective, as deserving something greater than a shoulder-shrug, but also less than awe. The abstract morphing into reality has a way of doing that.

Universal national service would mean that more Americans would have skin in the game the next time politicians suggest another “excellent” overseas adventure. Fewer op-ed writers and congressmen urging that others make the supreme sacrifice while they sit safely out of harm’s way would be a welcome change.

“I know that timing can sound bad, but it's a historical component for what the choir department had to use for their curriculum,” Geha said.

The short song includes the lyrics: “Cotton needs pickin' so bad, we're going'na pick all over this field.”

Maulsby told The Blade the performance came “a little bit too close” to when a racial slur was “being used directly across the street in the parking lot.”

Earlier this month, about a dozen male students affiliated with a Christian youth organization called Young Life recorded themselves with a Confederate flag during what has been described as a rally. Some images of the rally posted on Snapchat reportedly included racial slurs.

Later, he shared a video of himself walking around his house with the new ink, which features a skeleton, gargoyles, an eagle and more underneath a previously-drawn cross.

By Anna Eliopoulos

A New York family discouraged, after getting a letter from their insurer, that their nine-month-old's cancer treatment is denied.

Connor Richardson is the newborn of a retired NYPD officer, Wayne. He tells Fox News Radio, that up until two months ago, he was a smiling normal baby.

But then he was rushed to a Long Island hospital after exhibiting symptoms that Richardson says weren't normal for his son... and that's when they found out about the cancer

""He was in the operating room. They had to relieve the fluid,"" Richardson says."" The tumor in his brain was preventing the fluid from circulating to his spine.""

A cat scan and MRI confirmed that an aggressive and rare form of cancer was affecting Connor.

""They made an attempt to remove the tumor the first time and they got approximately 85% of it, bleeding started by the pituitary gland, and they had to wait approximately a week to go back in, and the doctor believes he got it all.""

However, doctors at Saint Jude's Childrens Hospital in Memphis, who had accepted him for chemo, said that they noticed that the cancerous cells had come back.

Connor continues to remain in their care, and to receive treatment.

Richardson says though that on October 11, he didn't expect to get a letter from his insurance provider that coverage for his son's treatment was denied.

""They're not covering because one of the chemo treatments is clinical,"" he says.

The experimental trial that their son was undergoing, with a mix of medications was considered by the letter ""investigational"" with no evidence of being effective.

""It's like a form letter, and the bold faced part is the part they fill on their own, and it wasn't medically necessary.""

Saint Jude's provides free care to patients. So while no one is really footing the bill for treatment, Richardson says it's the principal that bothers him.

""I believe Saint Jude's should get paid for this. It's going to come out to millions of dollars I'm sure.""

And Richardson adds that money is crucial to finding out how to treat and prevent cancer and other life-threatening diseases in children.

""It's taking literally millions of dollars away from their research development.""

Richardson says he plans on contesting the denial.

""You have insurance but you don't really. It's really for disasters and this is a disaster and they're not willing to cover it.""

According to Richardson, Connor is responding well to treatment.",Insurer Allegedly Sends Coverage Denial Letter to 9-month-old with Brain Cancer,https://radio.foxnews.com/2017/10/20/insurer-allegedly-sends-coverage-denial-letter-to-9-month-old-with-brain-cancer/
