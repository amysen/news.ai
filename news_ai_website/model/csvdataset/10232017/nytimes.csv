“We’ve got a health crisis in London caused directly by the poor-quality air,” Mayor Sadiq Khan said in an interview with the BBC on Monday. “Roughly speaking, more than 9,000 Londoners die prematurely because of the poor quality air.”

Mr. Khan said air pollution contributed to the underdevelopment of children’s lungs and the development of maladies like asthma, dementia and strokes in adults. In a statement, the mayor said he himself had recently begun to suffer from asthma.

The mayor’s office posted a flurry of statistics online in support of the fee. It said drivers made roughly six million trips in London each day and roughly a third of them drove less than two kilometers, or about 1.2 miles.

Roughly 40 percent of air pollution in the city comes from diesel vehicles, Mr. Khan’s office said. Many of those are being driven short distances or for less-than-urgent reasons like “shopping, leisure and personal business,” it said.

“Many of these trips could be made in other ways,” it said. “Unnecessary car use is putting our health at risk.”

London’s action is likely to embolden other European cities to impose similar restrictions. Paris, Madrid and Athens have announced plans to ban diesels beginning in 2025. In Germany, numerous cities, including the automaking centers Stuttgart and Munich, are considering bans of older diesel vehicles.

Despite assertions by automakers that diesel is clean, studies by the German, French and British governments have found that virtually all manufacturers took advantage of loopholes in European Union regulations. That allowed them to weaken a vehicle’s emissions controls during everyday driving to reduce wear and tear on the car’s antipollution equipment.

As a result, levels of harmful nitrogen oxides in urban areas have remained high despite emissions standards that, on paper, have grown progressively more rigorous. City governments are under pressure to ban diesel in order to avoid sanctions for excess pollution.

The backlash against diesel has even become a threat to Germany’s economy, which is dependent on automaking. Until recently more than half of new cars sold in Europe had diesel engines, largely because of tax breaks that ensure that diesel fuel is less expensive at the pump.

Season 3, Episode 6: ‘A. Malcolm’

In a show in which a single relationship is the crux of the story, every scene that puts the two main characters together carries weight. And since “Outlander” waited half a season — and 20 years in story time — to bring Jamie and Claire back together, our expectations were through the roof. The success of this episode depends almost entirely on how you feel about their reunion.

For me, that reunion was most interesting when dealing with perspective. We open with a glimpse of Jamie’s everyday life, complete with an amorous landlady and a meditative printmaking montage. It’s an interesting move because it recasts Claire’s return not as a triumph for her, but as an interruption for him. A welcome one, of course (our hero wouldn’t swoon otherwise), but after 20 years, it would be harder to believe a passionate embrace than to believe the fond, loaded awkwardness between them. They’ve lived so long apart that this is, in some ways, less a reunion than a renegotiation.

Caitriona Balfe does a great job with a thankless task. Claire has been the de facto villain of the season so far. Jamie has built a life despite her absence, while her life has mostly happened around his absence. And opening the episode with Jamie means looking at her romantic hopes from a certain remove. In the face of Jamie’s reserve, Balfe plays Claire as restless, nervous and jealous by turns. It offers us a chance to sympathize with her without making her particularly sympathetic — quite a trick, but it works. Balfe sells it, and while we know “Outlander” won’t let her suffer long at Jamie’s hands, we also want her to feel, just for a while, what it’s like to worry that the person you love doesn’t love you back anymore.

Don’t worry: Jamie does. But his reluctance works without its feeling as if the show were dragging out the big clinch. He has more secrets from Claire than she does from him, and after trying so hard to accept her loss and move on, we see how painful it is to accept such a seismic shift in his life, however welcome. Jamie attempts some Santa-level faux cheerfulness about Brianna, but that’s because he palpably doesn’t know how to reach the old comfort they shared. Their awkwardness is so overwhelming that, despite Claire’s obvious longing, he eventually has to ask point-blank why she came back.

Parallels to their wedding night are everywhere, from the impersonal lodgings to the intimacy of sharing a meal. (It’s not helped by voice-over about “savoring each other as much as the meal,” and the aside that they “began to know each other again” seems a little too convenient, but it’s still a nice callback.) And when things turn amorous, the first-time awkwardness lingers a moment — their charming nose-knocking also feels like an echo of their wedding jitters.","‘Outlander’ Season 3, Episode 6: Time Doesn’t Matter",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/arts/television/outlander-recap-a-malcolm-reunion.html

The Nuevo Amanecer Mariachi Academy is one of those places where the traditions of Mexico are passed onto new generations. Students between the ages of 6 and 20 meet in a church basement in East Elmhurst, Queens, to learn violin, trumpet or guitar, while more experienced students rehearse for gigs in local restaurants and churches.

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

“They are a generation in transition since they are the first to be born here, yet they have not lost their roots,” said Ms. Vincenti, 28. “They are American, but they consider themselves Mexican, too.”

The young people, she said, approach their studies eagerly, unlike those of us who balked at weekly piano lessons as children. Even in their spare time, they kick back and play their instruments just for the fun of it. Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

People who call the agency’s help line at 1-800-621-FEMA have waited on hold for two, three or four hours before they even speak to a FEMA representative.

Nearly two months after Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas on Aug. 25, and six weeks after Hurricane Irma hit Florida on Sept. 10, residents are still waiting for FEMA payments, still fuming after the agency denied their applications for assistance and still trying to resolve glitches and disputes that have slowed and complicated their ability to receive federal aid.

Brian and Monica Smith, whose home in the northern Houston suburb of Kingwood had two feet of water inside after Harvey, said they had received more help from their church, their neighbors and their relatives than from FEMA. A $500 payment from FEMA to help them with their immediate needs was delayed by three weeks. And they waited 34 days for the agency to inspect the damage to their home, pushing back repairs.

“You feel abandoned,” Mr. Smith, 42, said. “You feel like it came and went, and everybody’s focused on the storm in Florida and now in Puerto Rico.’’

Ron and Rita Perreault, a retired couple whose South Florida mobile home was damaged by the flooded Imperial River, call FEMA twice a day to check on the status of their application and inspection. Mrs. Perreault said she had spent so many hours on the phone on hold that she learned, as other callers have, to put the phone on speaker and go about her day.

“I thought I was going to get brain cancer,” Mrs. Perreault said. “They give you the runaround.”

Inspection Backlog

One of the most significant problems FEMA has had in Texas and Florida is the backlog in getting damaged properties inspected. Contract inspectors paid by the agency must first inspect and verify the damage in order for residents to be approved for thousands of dollars in aid. FEMA does not have enough inspectors to reduce the backlog, and the average wait for an inspection is 45 days in Texas and about a month in Florida, agency officials said.

The officials, including Brock Long, the FEMA administrator, acknowledged the long waits for both inspections and phone assistance. They said they were in the process of hiring hundreds of people in the next few weeks, including additional contract inspectors. They attribute the delays to “staffing challenges” after three major hurricanes in quick succession struck the Gulf Coast and the Southeast, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, as well as the devastating wildfires in California.

“Resources are stretched, particularly when it comes to inspections,” Mr. Long said. “Obviously it’s frustrating.”

The wait times for the help line and inspections far exceed those during past disasters.

People who called FEMA in the immediate aftermath of Katrina waited an average of 10 minutes before speaking with a representative, and weeks later that wait dropped to five minutes, according to a 2006 report by the inspector general’s office for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA. In addition, the report stated, the agency has historically tried to complete the entire inspection-and-approval process within 10 days after an application is filed. After Hurricane Rita in 2005, many home inspections were completed less than two weeks after homeowners applied.

But given the extraordinary impact of three major storms, many experts say FEMA’s relief efforts deserve high marks.

“I think they have done a terrific job,” said Paul M. Rosen, who worked in the Obama administration as the former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. “You just have to tune out the political noise and let them do their jobs.”

Strides Since Katrina

In 2005, FEMA became the face of the bungled federal response to Hurricane Katrina, and the agency’s poor handling of the disaster in New Orleans led to the resignation of Michael D. Brown, the director at the time. FEMA has since improved its image, and former federal officials praised its response in recent weeks to a staggering string of hurricanes, wildfires and other disasters. Over all, about 8,200 people in FEMA’s nearly 10,000-person work force are deployed in the field, responding to more than 20 natural disasters around the country.

“The whole response-and-recovery industry is maxed out,” said Michael Coen, the former chief of staff at FEMA in the Obama administration.

The Trump administration has been publicly criticized for its response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. While the problems there with power, gas and water are far worse than those in the continental United States, FEMA’s response to Harvey and Irma has also quietly frustrated flood victims on the mainland, from low-income neighborhoods to trailer parks to wooded suburban enclaves. Some have turned to their elected officials to complain and ask for help navigating the multiagency disaster bureaucracy, including FEMA’s federal insurance arm, which manages the National Flood Insurance Program.

In Kingwood, Tom and Lisa Slagle asked Senator Ted Cruz’s office for help after a $25,000 flood-insurance payment they were counting on was delayed for more than a month. “This has been more a disaster, trying to deal with insurance, than it was when our house flooded,” said Ms. Slagle, 49, a retired Houston firefighter.

In South Florida, officials in Collier County, which includes Naples, are waiting for FEMA R.V.’s known as travel trailers, which flooded residents can use as temporary housing. Only 15 of the trailers have been approved by FEMA statewide since Wednesday. “It’s a process, a long, arduous process,” said William L. McDaniel Jr., a Collier County commissioner. “But it can’t come quick enough.”

In East Texas, a FEMA mobile disaster center was scheduled to assist flooded residents one day last month in a courthouse parking lot in the town of Orange. “FEMA didn’t show up that day,” said Stephen Brint Carlton, a Republican who is the county judge and the top elected official in Orange County. “They don’t show up and we have a bunch of elderly people sitting out in a parking lot, and no one’s there to help them.”

Harvey sent about two feet of water into Jesse Altamirano’s home in northeast Houston near Greens Bayou. On a recent afternoon, as a contractor repaired the walls, he pulled out his phone and scrolled through his call history. One call Mr. Altamirano made to FEMA, on Oct. 6 at 10:27 a.m., lasted 4 hours 54 minutes 20 seconds. For all but about 10 minutes of that time, he said, he was on hold, trying to get the agency to extend his hotel stay. But a FEMA representative eventually told him it was too early to complete his extension. He was told to call back in two days.

Asked how much time he has spent on hold with FEMA since Harvey wrecked his home, Mr. Altamirano replied: “I’ve called them probably like eight, nine times. I’m thinking a good 16 hours maybe.”

Residents Still Uprooted

In some ways, hard-hit areas in Texas and Florida have made progress since Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. In Texas alone, nearly 7.5 million cubic yards of debris has been collected and more than 120,000 people have visited FEMA’s disaster recovery centers. The agency has supplied money, housing and other resources to residents as well as local governments. In Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, FEMA has provided about $2 billion in individual assistance to residents.

Yet in other ways, the rebuilding seems to have only just started. Three shelters remain open in Texas, and Florida closed its last one on Saturday. As part of a FEMA program, 61,135 people in Texas are staying in hotels. Some residents are living in their moldy, half-repaired or even condemned homes and apartments. Other residents remain uprooted. Shirlene Hryhorchuk, a high school teacher in the East Texas town of Deweyville, sleeps several nights each week on a cot in her home-economics classroom while her house undergoes repairs.

In the days after Irma tore through Florida, Ernestino Leon, 48, met and shook hands with Gov. Rick Scott when the governor toured the emergency shelter where he was staying. Mr. Leon works in golf course maintenance and came to the United States 30 years ago from Oaxaca, one of Mexico’s poorest states. His house in the Gulf Coast town of Bonita Springs is a torn-out shell surrounded by piles of debris and the few chairs he and his wife Lucia could salvage.

“He asked me if I liked this country and I say yes,” Mr. Leon said of Mr. Scott. “That’s why I’m here. I pay taxes. I’m a U.S. citizen. He told me not to worry and said that help would be on the way.”

Mr. Leon is still waiting for much of that help. Five weeks after asking FEMA for assistance, the Leons were in limbo. They moved out of a shelter on Saturday and into a hotel, while waiting for the agency to provide $10,000 to repair their home, a process tied up by a delayed home inspection. “This won’t be enough,” Mr. Leon said of the still-awaited money.

In Houston, Tim Wainright, 47, filed with FEMA on Aug. 28 after floodwaters damaged two bedrooms, but more than 50 days later, he and his wife are still waiting for an inspection.

“My hope is that they’re busy with people that really, really need their assistance,” Mr. Wainright said. “By now our walls are painted. All our drywall is back in place. If they came by, they wouldn’t have anything to inspect.”

Some residents are angry after being turned down by FEMA for assistance, often for reasons that they dispute. Of the 2.9 million applications for individual assistance the agency has received after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, FEMA has denied 23 percent of them — 678,160 — with the majority of those denials in Florida, where 432,000 applications out of 1.8 million have been rejected after Irma.

FEMA officials say the number of denials in Florida is high because the agency determined that many homes were not significantly damaged by the storm.

Jason Brunemann’s application for FEMA assistance was rejected because the agency concluded that he had adequate insurance. But his homeowners’ insurance does not cover flood damage, Mr. Brunemann said, and his flood-insurance claim remains in limbo. The rebuilding of his small house on the banks of the Imperial River in Bonita Springs has stalled, and he is recovering from a pre-Irma motorcycle accident in which he broke his hand and a bone in his neck. He plans to appeal his denial.

“A lot of people are appealing, but I don’t think I’ll get anything at all,” said Mr. Brunemann, 35, an air-conditioning installer who has been living in his truck and his gutted house. “I’m not optimistic.”",Still Waiting for FEMA in Texas and Florida After Hurricanes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/us/fema-texas-florida-delays-.html

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle.
PhotoFew have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said.
A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Photo

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

Photo

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Photo

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own.

Fear can hold people back in many facets of their lives, but it’s especially true when it comes to learning to solve puzzles. For some reason, many people have surprisingly little faith in their abilities, and I wish I could convince them that they know so much more than they think they do and can do so much more than they believe they can.

Aisha Tyler, actress and co-host of CBS’s “The Talk,” demonstrates this by regaling readers of her book, “Self-Inflicted Wounds: Heartwarming Tales of Epic Humiliation,” with tales of mistakes she has made and decisions she has deeply regretted. All of these are told to let us in on the wisdom she has learned along the way, and might serve to make people feel a lot better about themselves. Nothing binds us like our shared human foibles.

“He communicated that my son was no longer welcome back to the den,” she said.

Ms. Mayfield said the den leader’s response might have been fueled by her decision to post the videos of the senator’s interaction with the scouts online, where they were picked up by the local news media.

She also said she was told the den leader had been upset by other references in Ames’s long question, such as pointing out that the senator was a Republican and that gun ownership was considered a right while health care was seen as a privilege.

On Friday, in response to questions about why Ames was removed from the den, the Boy Scouts of America said only that Ames was now in another unit.

“The Boy Scouts of America and the Denver Area Council are pleased that the family will continue their participation in Scouting,” the statement said.

“We are committed to working with families to find local units that best fit their needs,” it said.

The organization declined to respond to multiple requests for more details about what Ms. Mayfield had been told by the local pack leader.

But the meeting and its backlash sent ripples through the organization and the community. The local Boy Scouts group in Broomfield distanced itself in a short statement at the top of its website.

“Our Troop was NOT involved in the Mayfield incident,” it said. “As part of the Boy Scouts of America and the World Scouting Organization, we are an inclusive group regardless of politics, religion, gender and race.”

The incident was also covered extensively by news outlets in Colorado, partly because, in addition to gun control, Ames had asked Ms. Marble about remarks she made in 2013 about the causes of health issues among black people.

“I was astonished that you blamed black people for poor health and poverty because of all the chicken and barbecue they eat,” Ames said.

“I didn’t,” Ms. Marble responded. “That was made up by the media. So, you want to believe it? You believe it. But that’s not how it went down. I didn’t do that. That was false. Get both sides of the story.”

Ms. Marble then offered context for the remarks, which were made at a poverty-reduction meeting with other legislators in 2013. She also told Ames she had a multicultural family, of which she was “proud.”

After the Cub Scout event, local news outlets reported on the gun question but also resurfaced Ms. Marble’s remarks from 2013 and the controversy they posed at the time. Among the objections were those of an African-American state legislator, Representative Rhonda Fields.

“When you look at life expectancy, there are problems in the black race,” Ms. Marble said in 2013. “Sickle-cell anemia is something that comes up. Diabetes is something that’s prevalent in the genetic makeup, and you just can’t help it.

“Although I’ve got to say, I’ve never had better barbecue and better chicken and ate better in my life than when you go down South and you, I mean, I love it,” she said.

“I will not tolerate that,” Ms. Fields, a Democrat, said in response in 2013, according to The Denver Post. “This is not what this committee is all about.” She added, “What we are trying to do is come up with meaningful solutions. This is not about eating chicken.”

Last week The Post published separate editorials about Ms. Marble’s comments and Ames’s dismissal. In one, it said Ms. Marble should have seen the event and Ames’s questions as an educational opportunity. “We’re sad to see her trying to lie them away now,” it said.

Ms. Mayfield said she had chosen a new pack for Ames, who is set to become a Boy Scout in February. She said Ames had felt let down by the den leader’s decision because he thought they shared a close relationship.

Nearly a month has passed since Stephen Paddock opened fire on a country music festival at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more — yet the shooting continues to confound the public and investigators alike. Little is known about Mr. Paddock’s motives. And investigators have revised parts of the timeline of the shooting on three occasions, raising further questions about what exactly happened.



During continuing investigations into major events, traditional reporting often relies in part on official statements from law enforcement officers. But in this case, faced with shifting reports, The New York Times wanted to try to establish a timeline independent of that offered by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.

The Times’s video unit, where I am a producer focused on visual and open data investigations, turned to a relatively new technique: investigative video reporting, or so-called video forensics, pioneered and developed by a small community of human rights groups and niche social journalism outlets over the last decade. Its greatest value is in documenting hard-to-reach places like war zones, but the tools can be used wherever there’s an abundance of visual evidence. (In May, a Times video debunked Syria and Russia’s claims about a chemical weapons attack; in June, another video identified 24 men, including members of the Turkish president’s security detail, who attacked protesters outside the Turkish ambassador’s Washington residence.)

The approach makes use of every available piece of data in a given set of video files: the videos themselves and every pixel we see in the images, but also the audio tracks and the metadata — timestamps, geolocation information — embedded in the files. The files can come from social media uploads or submissions from witnesses themselves (most cellphone videos log the hour, minute and second they were recorded in file data).

“Coffee With Polio Experts” will not be picked up by Hulu anytime soon, but there is something compelling in these short videos put out by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

The formula is simple: Doctors who have spent years fighting polio in the world’s most remote regions sit down over coffee with a World Health Organization representative to tell war stories.

The production values are amateurish — cups rattle, the bustle of the coffee shop intrudes. But the tales can be gripping, and they are recalled by soldiers who save lives rather than taking them.

When the eradication drive began in the 1980s, polio paralyzed 1,000 children a day. Now, fewer than 100 a year suffer that fate. But the virus is never quite extinguished. Field commanders explain how the battle must be fought, literally village-to-village and house-to-house.

In the most recent video, Dr. Naveed Sadozai describes pulling off a highway in Afghanistan, hoping to vaccinate sheepherders in a camp. To avoid land mines, he drives only in recent tire tracks; because the herders have huge attack dogs, he cajoles them from inside the car.

To win over a father skeptical of the vaccine, Dr. Sadozai offers to buy a sheep and chooses an emaciated one with a withered leg. When the herder explains why his choice is bad, Dr. Sadozai turns the tables, saying he will let the herder be the sheep expert if he can be the medical expert. He prevails: All the father’s children are vaccinated.

In another video, Christopher Maher describes how the eradication campaign stopped the assassinations of vaccinators by the Pakistani Taliban: staffers recruited additional vaccinators from the same clans as the attackers.

In a third, Dr. Ousmane Diop, a laboratory expert, explains how, as the virus became ever more rare, the campaign shifted from taking stool samples from crippled children to sampling the sewage of entire neighborhoods for signs of the virus.

And while it has nothing to do the eradication campaign, a startling polio-related video can be seen on the website Sweatpants and Coffee: Dergin Tokmak, a child of Turkish immigrants in Germany whose legs were withered by childhood polio, does a leaping, spinning break-dance routine on a pair of bright red crutches.

Undoubtedly, the term “fascism” has an effective anti-authoritarian ring to it, so perhaps that is why it is thrown around so much these days. But from what I can tell, much of what students are protesting, both at the University of Oregon and elsewhere, is the expression of viewpoints or ideologies that offend them and make them feel marginalized. They are fed up with what they see as a blanket protection of free speech that, at its extreme, permits the expression of views by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. I am opposed to all these groups stand for, but offensive speech can never be the sole criterion for shutting down a speaker.

The students’ own tactics reveal just how malleable the concept of offensiveness can be. For example, the word “fascism” has deep emotional connotations for me. It’s the reason for great suffering in my family. Two generations ago, members of my extended family were thrown into concentration camps and murdered in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust.

So, when students accuse me of leading an institution that harbors and promotes fascism, it offends me. But does that justify my censoring their speech? Clearly the answer is no.

Without the freedom to express ideas, even those that offend, we cannot challenge the status quo nor move society forward. But student protesters can still change and reform institutions. In 2015, I had been president of the University of Oregon for all of three months when protests erupted around the country over the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. A group called the Black Student Task Force organized a protest right outside my office. I invited the students in for a discussion, and although the matters we discussed, about systemic racism and educational opportunity, were emotionally charged, we established a respectful dialogue. More important, the discussion led to change.

The University of Oregon engaged in a searching and difficult historical examination of racism at the school. We doubled the number of black faculty members, created new programs to enroll more black students, started an African-American lecture series, and raised $1.6 million to build a new black student cultural center. We also invested in symbolic change by removing the name of a former Ku Klux Klan leader from one of our residence halls and replacing it with the name of an illustrious black alumnus.

Educators and students must learn from each other, and nothing is more important to this exchange than free speech. Our future as a university, and more broadly, our future as a nation, depends upon our willingness to hear voices different from our own and engage in meaningful discussion.

We in academia have a lot of big issues to tackle. One such topic — what to do about speech that offends vulnerable populations and how to protect speech and safety at the same time — presents a difficult challenge, but that makes the issue that much more important.

Other projects include a series for the NBCUniversal cable network Oxygen that is based on an article about the gruesome death of Jessica Chambers, a teenager who was burned alive in Mississippi, and an adaptation of the online cooking show “Mom vs. Chef” for USA, another NBC cable network.

Mr. Henick grew up in Great Neck, N.Y., and spent his childhood riding forklifts around his father’s floor-covering business at a warehouse in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood that has since been converted into an apartment building. His interest in media and technology began early.

When he was 14, he and his best friend created an MP3 website that drew a cease-and-desist letter from the Recording Industry Association of America because it hosted the “Titanic” soundtrack.

Several years later, Mr. Henick and his friend started one of the first ringtone sites in the United States. They bought the domain name NokiaUSA.net in the hope that Nokia customers would stumble on their site. Nokia was not pleased — it served the teenagers a cease-and-desist letter in the halls of their high school, after which they changed the company’s name to MobileSmarts. The business, Mr. Henick said, made a lot of money, although he wouldn’t specify how much.

“He’s an entrepreneur who knows how to build new things and new companies,” Jonah Peretti, the founder and chief executive of BuzzFeed, said in an interview. “I’m always amazed at the way he’s able to switch between these different models in his head and see the same things through a totally different lens.”

Mr. Henick’s experience as a teenage ringtone magnate gave him the idea to go west for college. “I was sort of already on that trajectory of wanting to head at least somewhere close to Silicon Valley, to figure out what was going on there,” he said.

He enrolled at Stanford, where he wrote for the campus humor magazine and played bass in a band called North of Cuba with his Theta Delta Chi fraternity brothers. After graduating with a degree in science, technology and society, he stayed at Stanford another year, earning a master’s in digital media studies, which he now calls “completely useless.”

“The professor would want to talk to us about LiveJournal and Myspace to a certain extent, and the students in the class would raise their hand and say, ‘Well, what do you think about Facebook?’” Mr. Henick said. “And they didn’t even know about it.”

From there, Mr. Henick studied producing at the University of Southern California’s film school in Los Angeles. During summer break, he attended a talk at the Skirball Cultural Center by the comedy producer Judd Apatow.

“I just went up to him and told him as much of my story as I could,” Mr. Henick said. “We were both from Long Island, both went to U.S.C., and I was looking for a gig.”

Mr. Apatow brought him on as an intern before hiring him as an assistant, so Mr. Henick spent his second year at U.S.C. balancing classes with reading scripts and checking out sets. After graduation, he worked on movies like “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” and “Step Brothers” before going out on his own as a writer, script doctor and start-up consultant.

Along the way, he and Ms. Killoch, who met at U.S.C., started a clothing company. They also got married.

“I clearly get bored very easily, because I do too many things,” Mr. Henick said. “I was literally sitting in my apartment writing movies, doing all right — that’s sort of the dream for some people — and I was like, ‘What else can I be doing?’”

Before Mr. Henick started at BuzzFeed, he was worried that he might end up restless yet again. But so far, he said, “I haven’t been bored once.”

When he joined three years ago, Tasty, the site’s popular food division, did not exist, and the company had yet to secure funding from NBCUniversal, which has since plowed in $400 million.

During Mr. Henick’s tenure, many digital media companies that once raked in millions of investment dollars found themselves struggling. A so-called pivot to video — a term sometimes used to cover layoffs of text-oriented staff members — swept the industry. Increasingly wary of the outsize influence of Facebook and Google — and hoping to siphon away some of the billions of advertising dollars still devoted to television — new media companies rediscovered old media, setting off a race into TV and film.

Cue Mr. Henick.

His mission is to help diversify BuzzFeed’s revenue stream: Executives expect that partnerships with production studios may bring in a third of the company’s revenue in the coming years.

Since it was founded in 2006, BuzzFeed, which is now valued at about $1.7 billion, has anticipated trends in the media business. Its move into the entertainment industry could be viewed as prescient — but the company is also said to be pursuing an initial public offering of stock, and associating itself with a glamorous business may have the side benefit of attracting investors and bolstering valuations.

“I don’t think we do anything specifically for that reason, but it’s always a byproduct,” Mr. Henick said. “If our business is stronger and it’s growing exponentially because we keep finding brand-new businesses to get into, it’s going to allow us to hopefully go public or invest in a lot more stuff elsewhere in the company.”

During a weekly check-in meeting at the old BuzzFeed lot on Sunset Boulevard, Mr. Henick swiveled around on his desk chair, a hand under his chin. He wore jeans, a light blue button-down and retro Air Jordan sneakers. Staff members talked about projects or possible deals with Netflix, MTV and Facebook.

The talk turned to a recent article about the right-wing website Breitbart and one of its former star employees, the rabble-rouser Milo Yiannopoulos. Did anyone see a film opportunity there? Someone suggested the Oscar-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin.

Mr. Henick’s eyes sparkled.

While Cashman seems unlikely to be going anywhere — the principal owner Hal Steinbrenner has shown little inclination to fire people with far less merit — the case of Girardi is more complicated.

He just completed his 10th season with the Yankees, and though he shepherded the club through several transitional years while keeping the team competitive and was duly praised for his work this season, questions remain about whether his relentless style — amid the attendant scrutiny of New York — has a shelf life.

And at a time when the ability to relate to players is becoming more valued, it is fair to wonder how deeply the 53-year-old Girardi connects on that level. Girardi became so frustrated this season over catcher Gary Sanchez’s inattentiveness in blocking pitches that he publicly called him out, something Girardi rarely — if ever — had done in the past.

Asked to assess Girardi’s work this season, Cashman said: “I think everybody did everything they possibly could to get where we wanted to go — to be the last team standing — and we fell short.”

Asked if he would recommend bringing Girardi back, Cashman said, “My recommendation will be to talk to our owner and sit down and find out what’s next.”

While the barrage of criticism over a rare tactical blunder by Girardi – he chose not to ask for a video replay that might have stemmed Cleveland’s comeback victory in Game 2 of the division series — largely subsided once the Yankees dispatched the Indians and went on to nearly win the A.L.C.S., it left Girardi shaken.

In the wake of incident, there were even moments where Girardi seemed somewhat fatalistic about his future with the team.

And Girardi, too, will be asking some questions — not just of Steinbrenner and Cashman, but of his family. It is a ritual each time Girardi’s contract expires, most recently occurring after the 2013 season. Back then, he had a quick conversation with his wife and three children — the oldest is now a college freshman — to hear what they had to say about his job. He will do so again.

“I’m not living my kid’s lives; I’m not living my wife’s life,” he said recently. “I’m living, in a sense, my life, so I don’t know what changes for them.”

Girardi said Saturday night that he would speak with Cashman after gauging his family’s feelings. “That’s not my concern right now,” he said. “I’ve had 10 great years here. I feel extremely blessed. God has been good to me and we’ll see what the future holds.”

The same can be said for several other Yankees. Sabathia, who is 37, said Saturday night that he wanted to return to the Yankees in 2018 — “Of course,” he said — but at what price? It will be nowhere near the $25 million he earned in the final year of his contract, but Sabathia is extremely prideful and, after his recent resurgence, he may find suitor willing to pay more than the Yankees next season.

Another free agent who wants to return is third baseman Todd Frazier, a midseason acquisition who quickly established himself as a voice in the clubhouse and who played with aplomb in the playoffs. But with top prospect Gleyber Torres likely to make his debut at some point next season, the Yankees do not seem eager to commit to a multiyear deal to keep Frazier around.

Tanaka’s performance in the playoffs — he had three dominant outings — may have raised his value enough after a lackluster regular season to prompt him to opt out of the remaining three years and $66 million on his contract.

“It’s the first time for me being in this situation,” Tanaka said through an interpreter on Saturday night. “I don’t fully understand how it’s going to work out, but obviously, I’m going to talk to my agent.”

How the financial pieces fit together has rarely been as great a concern for the Yankees as it is now. Steinbrenner has said getting below the luxury-tax threshold for the first time — it will be $197 million next year — is an objective, if not an edict. It would allow the Yankees to shed the onerous new penalties for repeat offenders that go into effect next year.

The Yankees, who carried a payroll of close to $220 million this season, will shed nearly $70 million with the expiration of the contracts of Sabathia ($25 million), Matt Holliday ($13 million), Alex Rodriguez ($21 million) and Michael Pineda ($7.4 million).

They could pare payroll even further if they find a suitor for Chase Headley, who has one year and $13 million left on his contract, or a taker for Jacoby Ellsbury, even if they have to eat a large chunk of the three years and $66 million remaining on his deal. (Ellsbury has a full no-trade clause, but it is hard to imagine him not being open to waiving it to get to a place where he could play regularly.)

On the other side of the ledger, eight players are due for raises through arbitration.

It is those young, talented and mostly affordable players, though, who form the foundation of the Yankees’ optimism.

“There’s a lot of pieces that are here that have a chance to have exciting times ahead,” Cashman acknowledged. And then he added a cautionary note: “I think people in my chair, if you’re trying to be good at what you do, you never assume anything.”

The team down the hallway on Saturday night is proof of that.

The Astros arrived ahead of schedule in 2015, knocking off the Yankees in the wild-card game before a crushing collapse against the Kansas City Royals in the division series. Though the Astros returned for the 2016 season both optimistic and resolute, they got off to an awful start and never fully recovered, missing the postseason entirely.

“Ultimately, the future is never promised,” Cashman said, as promising as it may be.",The Yankees Have a Consolation Prize: The 2018 Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/sports/baseball/new-york-yankees-joe-girardi.html

Some shows are just too odd to be appreciated in their time. That’s a good chunk of the case the loving documentary “Too Funny to Fail,” about the 1996 sketch series “The Dana Carvey Show,” lays out, through interviews and impressively amassed archival footage. For a show in which a faux Bill Clinton nurses puppies and kittens from a gruesome teat-covered prosthetic, the question is not, how did it get canceled? It’s, how did it ever made it to ABC in the first place?

The answer is through high hopes and occasional mistakes in judgment, the same things that ushered the show,, like other brilliant but doomed projects, into an early grave. The cast and writers speak about the experience with a befuddled reverence, and the youthful determination captured in the old clips radiates so powerfully it almost sends us all back to our didn’t-know-better-yet selves of 20 years ago.

When North Korea reneged on its promise to forgo nuclear weapons in the early 1990s, President Bill Clinton’s administration put together the “Agreed Framework” that paved Pyongyang’s path to nuclearization. When North Korea’s leader at the time, Kim Jong-il, withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 2003, confirming that he intended to build a nuclear weapon, President George W. Bush pushed for the China-led six-party talks with North Korea. When the country tested its second nuclear weapon in 2009, President Barack Obama opted for “strategic patience.” Three subsequent tests showed just how misguided this was.

It is time to acknowledge that North Korea may never be interested in negotiating away its nuclear deterrent. Of course we should continue to leave the door open for serious discussions if the situation changes, but the United States government does our citizens — and the world — a disservice if it continually discounts the centrality of nuclear weapons to the Kim regime.

They are not a mere insurance policy for survival. They are a means to a more sweeping end: reunification of the Korean Peninsula on Pyongyang’s terms. We must seriously consider the possibility that the North’s current leader, Kim Jong-un, is preparing to use nuclear weapons to drive American forces out of South Korea and coerce Seoul — even at the risk of fighting a limited nuclear war.

Given this, the United States must approach North Korea with sobriety and urgency. The Trump administration has the opportunity to join both houses of Congress in acknowledging the truth about North Korea and using it to open new opportunities to maximize pressure.

Among North Korea’s many significant forms of illicit financing are foreign slave labor and money laundering. From Africa to Europe, North Korean diplomats exploit their consular posts to launder money at the expense of international comity. If North Korea is relisted, these nations would face a significant decision: Is continuing diplomatic and economic relations with a state that uses diplomacy and finance to export and foment terrorism in their interest?

It would pose an even deeper question to the United States: Will we continue our diplomatic overtures to the Kim regime on the flawed assumption that it is interested in a future without nuclear weapons? It is because of America’s bipartisan belief in North Korea’s potential amenity in a political settlement, captured in the 2008 delisting, that North Korea can now marry a miniaturized warhead to an intercontinental ballistic missile. Relisting Pyongyang is the first step toward a strategic vision based on facts rather than aspirations.

We must tell the truth about the dangerous ambitions of North Korea and once again list it as a state sponsor of terrorism, a move that only strengthens our hand and weakens that of Kim Jong-un.

The president’s response seemed certain to keep alive the extraordinary squabble, which erupted a week ago when Mr. Trump was asked about the deadly ambush in Niger and asserted wrongly that previous presidents had not called the families of American troops killed in action. He then proceeded to call relatives of the soldiers killed in Niger, only to have Representative Frederica S. Wilson, a Florida Democrat who listened to Mr. Trump’s conversation with Ms. Johnson, criticize the president publicly for his words.

On Monday, Ms. Johnson supported Ms. Wilson, who has been feuding with both Mr. Trump and Mr. Kelly over the call.

“Whatever Ms. Wilson said was not fabricated,” Ms. Johnson said. “What she said was 100 percent correct.”

Ms. Johnson said that on the call, she let Mr. Trump do most of the talking as her anger grew. When asked if she wanted to say anything to Mr. Trump, the young widow decided against delivering a message.

She did, however, say that she was desperate to know more details about the disappearance and death of her husband, and described him as “caring” and a “great soldier.” The couple had known each other since she was 6 years old.

“I want to know why it took them 48 hours to find my husband,” Ms. Johnson said.

She also shared a deep concern over not being allowed to view her husband’s remains.

“They won’t show me a finger, a hand,” she said. “I know my husband’s body from head to toe and they won’t let me see anything,” she said. “I need to see my husband.”

After a service member is killed on the battlefield, the military’s mortuary affairs personnel often do everything they can to prepare the deceased for a potential viewing. In some cases, however, if the wounds are too grievous or the body is extremely disfigured, the military might suggest that the coffin remain sealed.

Tech. Sgt. Holly Roberts-Davis, who is in charge of public affairs at Dover Air Force Base’s mortuary affairs division, said that families were not allowed to see the remains of their loved ones until after the body is inspected and cleared by the division’s medical examiner. Once that is complete, the family is free to open the coffin.

The back and forth began after Sergeant Johnson and three Americans were killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger. The president called Ms. Johnson and said that her husband “knew what he signed up for,” and referred to the soldier as “your guy.” Ms. Wilson, a longtime family friend who accompanied Ms. Johnson and heard the call, recounted what the president said to several reporters and lamented that the president had offended the young widow, who was upset that the president did not seem to know Sergeant Johnson’s name.

Mr. Trump angrily disputed that account, saying that he “had a very nice conversation with the woman, with the wife, who sounded like a lovely woman.”

Last week, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that Ms. Wilson’s account was “totally fabricated,” although the woman who raised Sergeant Johnson said it was accurate. And Mr. Trump has continued to target the congresswoman, calling her “wacky.”

In a White House briefing, Mr. Kelly harshly criticized Ms. Wilson, who had known Sergeant Johnson’s family since he was in elementary school, for listening to the call. Mr. Kelly called the lawmaker an “empty barrel” and also misrepresented her remarks when he accused her of bragging about securing $20 million for an F.B.I. building in South Florida and twisting President Barack Obama’s arm.

Video of Ms. Wilson’s speech, released by The Sun Sentinel, a newspaper in South Florida, showed that during her nine-minute speech, Ms. Wilson never took credit for getting the money for the building, only for helping pass legislation to name the building after two fallen federal agents. She also never mentioned pleading with Mr. Obama, and she acknowledged the help of several Republicans, including John A. Boehner, then the House speaker; Representatives Mario Diaz-Balart and Carlos Curbelo; and Senator Marco Rubio.

On Monday, Ms. Johnson also pushed back against Mr. Kelly’s criticism of Ms. Wilson for hearing the call. The widow said she had asked the military official accompanying her family to put the call from President Trump on speakerphone so others could also hear his words.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Kelly “absolutely” stands by his Thursday remarks.

“General Kelly said he was ‘stunned’ that Representative Wilson made comments at a building dedication honoring slain F.B.I. agents about her own actions in Congress, including lobbying former President Obama on legislation,” Ms. Sanders said in a statement. “As General Kelly pointed out, if you’re able to make a sacred act like honoring American heroes about yourself, you’re an empty barrel.”

Over the weekend, the dispute continued with Mr. Trump posting Sunday on Twitter, “Wacky Congresswoman Wilson is the gift that keeps on giving for the Republican Party, a disaster for Dems. You watch her in action & vote R!”

Several women from the Congressional Black Caucus also wrote a letter demanding an apology from Mr. Kelly.

“We were appalled by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly’s statements where he called Congresswoman Wilson an ‘empty barrel’ and accused her of taking credit for securing funding for a new F.B.I. Building,” the lawmakers said.

“General Kelly’s comments are reprehensible,” the letter stated. “Congresswoman Wilson’s integrity and credibility should not be challenged or undermined by such blatant lies.

“He communicated that my son was no longer welcome back to the den,” she said.

Ms. Mayfield said the den leader’s response might have been fueled by her decision to post the videos of the senator’s interaction with the scouts online, where they were picked up by the local news media.

She also said she was told the den leader had been upset by other references in Ames’s long question, such as pointing out that the senator was a Republican and that gun ownership was considered a right while health care was seen as a privilege.

On Friday, in response to questions about why Ames was removed from the den, the Boy Scouts of America said only that Ames was now in another unit.

“The Boy Scouts of America and the Denver Area Council are pleased that the family will continue their participation in Scouting,” the statement said.

“We are committed to working with families to find local units that best fit their needs,” it said.

The organization declined to respond to multiple requests for more details about what Ms. Mayfield had been told by the local pack leader.

But the meeting and its backlash sent ripples through the organization and the community. The local Boy Scouts group in Broomfield distanced itself in a short statement at the top of its website.

“Our Troop was NOT involved in the Mayfield incident,” it said. “As part of the Boy Scouts of America and the World Scouting Organization, we are an inclusive group regardless of politics, religion, gender and race.”

The incident was also covered extensively by news outlets in Colorado, partly because, in addition to gun control, Ames had asked Ms. Marble about remarks she made in 2013 about the causes of health issues among black people.

“I was astonished that you blamed black people for poor health and poverty because of all the chicken and barbecue they eat,” Ames said.

“I didn’t,” Ms. Marble responded. “That was made up by the media. So, you want to believe it? You believe it. But that’s not how it went down. I didn’t do that. That was false. Get both sides of the story.”

Ms. Marble then offered context for the remarks, which were made at a poverty-reduction meeting with other legislators in 2013. She also told Ames she had a multicultural family, of which she was “proud.”

After the Cub Scout event, local news outlets reported on the gun question but also resurfaced Ms. Marble’s remarks from 2013 and the controversy they posed at the time. Among the objections were those of an African-American state legislator, Representative Rhonda Fields.

“When you look at life expectancy, there are problems in the black race,” Ms. Marble said in 2013. “Sickle-cell anemia is something that comes up. Diabetes is something that’s prevalent in the genetic makeup, and you just can’t help it.

“Although I’ve got to say, I’ve never had better barbecue and better chicken and ate better in my life than when you go down South and you, I mean, I love it,” she said.

“I will not tolerate that,” Ms. Fields, a Democrat, said in response in 2013, according to The Denver Post. “This is not what this committee is all about.” She added, “What we are trying to do is come up with meaningful solutions. This is not about eating chicken.”

Last week The Post published separate editorials about Ms. Marble’s comments and Ames’s dismissal. In one, it said Ms. Marble should have seen the event and Ames’s questions as an educational opportunity. “We’re sad to see her trying to lie them away now,” it said.

Ms. Mayfield said she had chosen a new pack for Ames, who is set to become a Boy Scout in February. She said Ames had felt let down by the den leader’s decision because he thought they shared a close relationship.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — I like to think of myself as a “word person” — someone who knows and loves words — but every once in a while, that perception gets jolted. As in most areas of life, we soon learn that no matter how smart we think we are, there are always those who are smarter. There are word people and then there are people who really, really know their words.

I bring this up because I was fortunate to have a few rounds of email correspondence with one of the constructors of today’s puzzle — he happens to be making his New York Times Crossword debut. Each time he wrote, I found myself running to the dictionary to look up at least one of the words that flowed effortlessly from his fingers. And the thing is, he wasn’t doing it to look smart. John Lithgow just is smart.

But at least I now know what a “Savoyard” is. If that makes no sense to you right now, wait until you get to 41D.

So thank you, Mr. Lithgow. I’m a smarter person because of you.

As part of the 75th anniversary of The New York Times Crossword, editor Will Shortz is running a series of puzzle collaborations between people of note and veteran Times constructors. Today’s puzzle — though Mr. Lithgow’s first, it is the 175th Times puzzle for his collaborator, Brendan Emmett Quigley — is a fun and entertaining strut upon the stage of Mr. Lithgow’s life, both the comic and the dramatic.

The editors, who started brainstorming in April, eventually whittled the list down to seven “greats”: Mr. Sondheim, the singer Nicki Minaj, the designer Dries van Noten, the writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the artist Claes Oldenburg, the actress Amy Adams and the director Park Chan-wook. They paired these figures with writers and photographers who would provide a unique perspective. Lin-Manuel Miranda interviewed Stephen Sondheim; Roxane Gay wrote on Nicki Minaj; and Dave Eggers profiled Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

But perhaps most unusual for a celebrity profile, the goal was not to pry into the private lives of these individuals. “I think our writers don’t make the mistake of thinking they are getting to the heart of anything,” Ms. Yanagihara said. “It’s more about answering the question of, ‘Why is this person so moving to me?’ ”

By pairing the subjects with fellow leaders in their field, T’s editors hoped to give readers a unique perspective on how both approach their work, and on how they think about each other’s contributions. (Mr. Miranda first met Mr. Sondheim when the playwright spoke to his high school class.)

This approach offered artists and intellectuals an opportunity to engage in larger cultural conversations within the pages of the magazine. For example, the artist Carrie Mae Weems — who penned a letter to Michelle Obama for last year’s Greats issue — photographed Ms. Adichie. “Weems’s work deals with issues of gender and race, so we thought it would be interesting to see how she would envision Chimamanda,” explains Nadia Vellam, T’s photo editor. “I liked the idea of having two women from two different cultures living in America connect through shared experiences.”

The issue also offers a different view of Ms. Minaj. Patrick Demarchelier’s photographs for her cover story reveal an unadorned side of the singer, and Ms. Gay had a similar goal: to present a neglected aspect of her subject. “I was thinking about the many sides of Nicki Minaj — the rapper, the fashionista, the woman whose love life is often tabloid fodder, the businesswoman,” Ms. Gay said. “We generally only see one or two sides of her discussed, instead of the whole package.”

On Thursday in New York, a number of those involved in the issue, including Ms. Adams, Mr. Miranda and Mr. Van Noten, gathered for a celebration. Ms. Minaj addressed a beaming assemblage of students from the Stagedoor Manor performing-arts camp, who were there to perform a medley of Sondheim tunes, and brought the theme of the issue full circle.

“You are doing what you’re supposed to be doing — chasing your dreams,” she said. “Don’t let anyone tell you that you’re not amazing. You’re epic. You’re Great.”

WASHINGTON — President Trump said early on Monday that his proposed tax plan would not prompt any changes to Americans’ tax-deferred retirement plans, pushing back against reports that the Republicans are weighing a proposal that would significantly reduce the income workers can save in these popular programs.

Mr. Trump’s shutdown of the proposal is the first of what many Republicans privately fear could be a presidential pattern that disrupts their efforts to pass a sweeping overhaul of the tax code. In it, Mr. Trump appeared to rule out a politically difficult idea, which, if enacted, would have provided some revenue to help pay for the tax plan.

Republicans’ ability to win passage of a tax package hinges on its ability to survive a complex set of legislative restrictions in the Senate. Republicans are attempting to cut business tax rates deeply, and also to cut individual tax rates, using a legislative route that allows them to bypass a Democratic filibuster and pass a bill with a simple Senate majority. To do that, they will need to make some tough political choices, eliminating some popular tax breaks, or employing some budgetary accounting tricks, in order to offset lost revenues from rate cuts.

Mr. Trump’s tweet concerned one of those accounting maneuvers, which would have allowed Republicans to effectively borrow tax revenues from the future to offset some rate cuts today. Reducing 401(k) contribution limits would force retirement savers to pay more in taxes today, as they sock away money, but less in the future, when they began withdrawing retirement funds tax-free.

Unfortunately, nearly all utilities forbid this. In fact, Florida Power and Light lobbied the Legislature hard this year to restrict their customers from access to home-based solar systems when the grid goes down.

We should use this opportunity in Puerto Rico and other places hit hard by recent storms to do two things: Rebuild damaged or destroyed homes and businesses to be as energy efficient as possible, and rebuild the grid so that alternative energy systems like solar and wind, whether on a home or in a microgrid, can operate independently when the larger grid is damaged or shut down. (Microgrids are small networks of electricity users who rely on a local generating source like solar that is usually attached to the larger grid but can operate independently.)

The need for affordable, clean, reliable, resilient power is most acute for the majority of people of Caribbean island nations who pay high prices for electricity generated by burning imported oil and often paid for by imported capital. A nation like the Bahamas can spend a substantial part of its tourist industry’s earnings just to run its electricity system, and other islands are even worse off.

Our organization, the Rocky Mountain Institute, works with the Clinton Foundation, international and regional partners, governments and utilities to help Caribbean island nations switch to modern and regionally abundant solar and wind power. Those efforts were going well before the latest hurricanes. Solar arrays in the Turks and Caicos Islands and on Cooper Island in the British Virgin Islands, among others, survived the hurricanes without damage and were able to provide electricity to nearby communities.

With those storms behind us, we must work to rebuild stronger, fuel-free, stormproof power systems based on decentralized and resilient renewables like solar. We need to use 21st century innovation, not 20th century technology. Importing fossil fuels costs these island nations enormous sums. Yet the sun shines and the wind blows on these islands for free. We’re optimistic we can do this. But we’ll have to resist our own impulses to carry on with business as usual.

We can learn from the experience of another Caribbean nation — Cuba. Most electricity in the country was restored within a week after Irma struck in early September; in Havana, took just three days. More than a decade ago, Cuba modernized its Soviet-era power plants and centralized grid. In 2005 serious blackouts occurred on 224 days. In 2007 the island’s move to decentralized energy cut that to zero. Now, when hurricanes like Irma hit, many parts of Cuba can sustain vital services.

What was Cuba’s resilient formula? First, the efficient use of power, which helped renewables do more at lower cost. Millions of efficient light bulbs, fans, rice cookers, pressure cookers, refrigerators, air-conditioners and pumps were sold nationwide, reducing power usage.

Most important, Cuba added over 1,800 decentralized diesel and fuel-oil-fired electrical plants across the island and upgraded the infrastructure of the grid itself. Cuba lets these local plants or microgrids disconnect from the island’s grid during storms or blackouts and generate their own electricity for local needs. This allows these microgrids to serve their own customers, then reconnect to the larger grid later.

Microgrids are becoming proven and popular around the world from India (where record floods couldn’t stop solar power) to the University of California at San Diego, whose microgrid (powering 92 percent of the campus and saving $8 million a year) reversed flow and sent power back to the utility in less than a half-hour (until wildfires ate a power line).

Some traditional utilities oppose microgrids as a threat to their beleaguered monopoly. But giant electrical equipment firms like Siemens, Schneider and General Electric now offer microgrids, and nearly 2,000 projects were underway worldwide at the end of 2016.

Simple, sensible improvements like these can make our families, communities and nations more secure and durable, while saving money and creating important new value in the electricity, fuel and real-estate industries.

“Shannon, Rosie the Riveter has nothing on you,” commented a woman from Vermont.","I did my best to convince Shannon that I would protect her identity until she’d received her final paycheck from the company. It was a risky promise. Nobody knew when that would be.

“I’m a stranger and you have no reason to trust me,” I wrote her on Facebook. “But I do want to tell the story of Rexnord and I want to tell it all the way through. I want to find out six months from now or even a year from now what happened to everybody. I want to follow certain people to see where they ended up. I’d love for you to be one of them.”

Luckily, Shannon did walk through the door at Cracker Barrel, wearing her signature blue eyeliner. She sat down to lunch and told me the story of her life, which was unlike anything I had ever heard.

It was a tale of overcoming sexual abuse and domestic violence to become the first female “heat treat” operator at the plant‚ responsible for hardening with fire the small rings of steel that would eventually be joined together, one inside the other, to form bearings. Yet Shannon didn’t view herself as a victim or a survivor. She was simply a single mom trying to make it.

I followed Shannon and several of her co-workers until September, making eight trips to Indianapolis over a period of eight months. Many of the workers were at the factory seven days a week. They didn’t have much free time to talk. Sometimes I drove to work with Shannon and hopped out of the car just before she got to the factory. Sometimes I met her at the end of her shift — at 10 p.m. — at a Burger King nearby and drove home with her. A few times, I fell asleep waiting for her to get home after her shift.

The reality that Shannon and her co-workers showed me flew in the face of so many assumptions I had about class, free trade and globalization.

I had always been told that unskilled jobs moved abroad. Yet Shannon’s job was complicated. It had taken her years to master. Could I do what she did? I honestly wasn’t sure.

I had always been told that automation, not trade, was the reason factory workers like Shannon were losing their jobs. But the two are intimately linked, as U.S. factories trying to compete with cheap labor overseas are forced to automate to stay profitable. Far from seeing herself as a competitor to machines, Shannon viewed herself as a loving caretaker of the machines she’d spent years learning to operate and repair.

I had always been told by economists, diplomats and academics that workers like Shannon were the few who had to be sacrificed so that the rest of us could be better off: They were the martyrs of globalization. But the more I delved into economic theory, the more I began to question whether people like Shannon were really “the few.” Our economy is designed for (and by) people with college degrees — a credential that two-thirds of American adults lack.

For those of us who are lucky enough to have graduated from good colleges, globalization and unfettered trade have expanded our horizons and boosted our incomes, as the world opened up to our talent and capital. We rarely think about the downsides to our fellow Americans, the most vulnerable among us. Too often, we just repeat the ubiquitous platitude, “The factories are never coming back.”

Getting to know Shannon and her co-workers helped me understand why so many Americans feel let down by both major political parties in this country. But this story has also given me a huge amount of hope that, despite our many differences, Americans still really do care about one another.

After the article ran, people from all walks of life reached out to me, to Shannon and to The New York Times.

“Shannon, Rosie the Riveter has nothing on you,” commented a woman from Vermont. “If ever we are to succeed as a country again, it is because of people like you. Your tenacity, grit, love, humanity, devotion to family and work ethic are what make America thrive.”

A man who identified himself as a former manager in tech manufacturing, from Dallas, wrote: “I have seen this story play out over and over again. It is going to take a new breed of committed, smart and courageous leaders both political and in business to turn around this mess.”

A judge in California sent me a message saying that the story “affirmed for me how we as Americans are all in this together and should behave that way more.”

Look to this age alone.

But however self-confident Mao’s early dreams of glory, his supreme leadership was far from preordained. On the eve of his coming out as a Marxist at age 27, he was an unsophisticated provincial nationalist. He gloomily dismissed the chances of the new Chinese republic surviving, wondered about Hunan becoming an American state and advocated that all of the Chinese provinces should become separate countries.

It was only in November 1920 that he admitted defeat: The Hunanese did not have the vision to appreciate his ideas. He wrote to his activist friends in the provincial capital to say that he would henceforth be a socialist. He was just in time.

Communist cells had been organized in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities, and in mid-1921, the first congress of the Chinese Communist Party was held. Mao, who had quickly organized a Communist group in Hunan, achieved the cachet of being one of only 12 delegates to attend. He was thus an early tiger.

The Soviet agents who funded and masterminded the organization of the early C.C.P. reported to the Comintern, the agency for spreading Soviet ideas and influence abroad. With memories of defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5, and competing with Japan for influence in Manchuria, the Soviets needed a strong China as an ally against Japanese expansionism.

The fledgling C.C.P. was too weak. The Soviets decided to bolster the well known revolutionary who had helped bring down the Manchu dynasty but had then been pushed aside by warlords: Sun Yat-sen.

They provided him with funds, reorganized his Nationalist party, known as the K.M.T., and helped him to train an army. C.C.P. members were instructed by Comintern agents to back the K.M.T., and even become members, but to retain their allegiance to the Communists. The plan was for the C.C.P. to take over the K.M.T. from within after the Chinese warlords were conquered by this united front.

Most of the C.C.P. leadership opposed the Comintern policy; they thought collaboration with the “bourgeois” K.M.T. would demoralize their members. But the piper called the tune, and they joined the K.M.T., few more readily than Mao.

Two events set Mao off on a new, career-shaping course. The first was Chiang Kai-shek’s attack on the Communist Party. By 1927, after Sun Yat-sen’s death, Chiang Kai-shek had taken over the leadership of the K.M.T., and he had conquered much of the southern half of the country. Aware of the Soviets’ long-term aim for a C.C.P. takeover of the K.M.T., he short-circuited the plan in May 1927 by ordering the slaughter of Communists, mainly in Shanghai. Communist leaders scattered in flight.

The other event was Mao’s experience with peasant power. After the death of their parents, Mao and his two brothers owned a valuable property back in their home village that had been built up by their father. The family had made the transition from poor to rich peasants. And though he had grown up surrounded by the miseries of rural life, as a fledgling Communist, Mao had been focusing on the urban proletariat until Moscow, realizing that China was different, ordered more attention be paid to the peasantry.

Mao became active in peasant affairs, and his transformative experience was witnessing and chronicling an uprising in his native Hunan. In a famous passage, he rejected allegations that the peasants had gone too far:

A revolution is not the same as inviting people to dinner or writing an essay or painting a picture or embroidering a flower; it cannot be anything so refined, so calm and gentle.

Witnessing the bloodshed in the Hunanese countryside, Mao was discovering his other persona. As the scholar-diplomat Richard Solomon first pointed out, Mao reveled in “luan,” or upheaval. When young, Mao had written that for change to come about, China must be “destroyed and reformed.” He now realized that only the peasantry could bring that about. Mao would be the monkey king to lead that destruction.

The primary source for the monkey king is the classic Chinese novel “The Journey to the West.” Ostensibly about the famous Chinese monk Xuan Zang, who made the arduous crossing of the Himalayas to seek out original Buddhist scriptures in India, “Journey” is a fantastical tale in which Sun Wukong, the monkey king, plays a major role as the monk’s escort. In the early 1960s, when the C.C.P.’s quarrel with the Soviet Communist Party was underway, Mao praised the monkey king:

A thunderstorm burst over the earth,

So a devil rose from a heap of white bones.

The deluded monk was not beyond the light,

But the malignant demon must wreak havoc.

The Golden Monkey wrathfully swung his massive cudgel

And the jade-like firmament was cleared of dust.

Today, a miasmal mist once more rising,

We hail Sun Wu-kung, the wonder-worker.

Mao then rose from guerrilla chief in the late 1920s to a party leader in the mid-1930s on the Long March, the flight of the C.C.P. from the southeast to the northwest to escape Chiang Kai-shek’s attacks. This was an epic event in Communist annals because it took a year, covered some 6,000 miles and reduced the 85,000 who had set out to a mere 8,000 by the time they reached the northwest. He absorbed two lessons: All power grew out of the barrel of a gun; and most of the time peasants were very difficult to organize because they had fields to tend and families to feed.

From the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s, Mao played his tiger role. He led an increasingly strong and efficient party and army that survived the anti-Japanese war and then defeated Chiang and the K.M.T. in the civil war of the late 1940s. From 1949 until 1956, Mao presided over the installation of the Communist dictatorship in China, rooting out all opposition, real or imagined, and transforming the ownership of the means of production from private hands to socialist control.

It was then that he dabbled in the monkey business for the first time. From the point of view of a dutiful C.C.P. cadre, “monkey business” could be defined as any measure that would disrupt the party’s standard operating procedures. Cadres did not appreciate it when Mao in 1956 exhorted intellectuals to “Let a hundred flowers bloom” and a year later again encouraged intellectuals to criticize the conduct of the party. As members of the ruling elite, the cadres resented being criticized, and Mao, having promised that the criticisms would only be like a light rain, quickly wound up the campaigns when they turned into a typhoon, and purged the critics.

Mao truly became the monkey king by starting the Cultural Revolution in 1966 to dispel the “miasmal mist” of Soviet-style “revisionism” from the C.C.P. Now, it was the youth of China, not the peasants, who were to be his agents of destruction, as major party and government departments were trashed and their officials humiliated and purged.

For Mao, the Cultural Revolution ended in 1969 with the appointment of a new, and hopefully more revolutionary, leadership. But though he had dealt the age-old bureaucratic system of China a terrible blow, he knew that it could rise again from the ashes. He always emphasized that China would have to experience regular Cultural Revolutions.

But when Mao’s chosen successor, Hua Guofeng, repeated that dictum, he sealed his fate. Deng Xiaoping and his fellow survivors did not want any more monkey kings plunging the party and the country into chaos again.

And yet today, China’s current ruler, Xi Jinping, with his relentless anticorruption drive to make officials more honest, has unleashed another Cultural Revolution against the bureaucracy, albeit one that is controlled from the center not from the streets.

This is the action of a monkey king. There is no chaos today, but there surely is widespread fear and resentment as his mighty cudgel claims more victims.

The 19th Communist Party Congress currently underway will confirm that Mr. Xi is top tiger, the most powerful ruler since Mao. But Mr. Xi will have to ensure that his alternate persona as monkey king does not loom too large. As the revolutionary founder, Mao could never have been toppled.

Until 2023, passengers can pay their fares the new way or the old way, with a MetroCard. The new system will also process fares for the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North commuter lines.

The most obvious difference will be what passengers do to go through a subway turnstile or board a bus: wave or tap a smartphone or a credit or debit card, instead of swipe a MetroCard.

The system will work through apps like Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay as well as “contactless cards” — credit or debit cards with embedded chips that rely on a wireless technology known as near field communication, or N.F.C.

“The millennial generation, those who are more prone to new technology, will be our greatest users in the early stages,” Mr. Lhota said. He added that card issuers “are going to want to be a part of it” and would add the near-field technology “when they realize that 5.8 to 6 million people in New York City are getting on the subway every day.”

Mr. Lhota said another potential advantage was that fare readers could be installed by the back doors on buses to “allow for all-door boarding.” That would let buses pull away from bus stops sooner than they do now, reducing travel times.

The transit agency is hiring the same company that designed the system in London, which is also the company that developed MetroCards a generation ago. But the new system will let passengers pay as they go, in contrast to the MetroCard system, which requires them to pay in advance, whether they want a single ride or a month’s worth.

The new system will not mean the end of the flat fare that has defined the New York subway system since it opened in 1904. Fares on the London Underground are based on distance, as they are in some other cities that use similar technology, like Washington. But Mr. Lhota said he was not contemplating changing the fare structure for the subways. (The Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North do charge by distance, using zones that usually include several stations.)

Thomas K. Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association, an influential nonprofit group, praised the move to the new system, predicting that ridership would increase once the new fare system was widely available, just as it did after the MetroCard was introduced.

He called the new fare system “a real win-win and an important step for the M.T.A. to be taking.”

The transit agency has been talking for years about replacing the MetroCard, which made its debut when Bill Clinton was president (and the basic fare was $1.25, $1.50 less than it is now and $1.75 less than with a single-ride MetroCard).

The transit agency ran a pilot program for a successor to the MetroCard in 2006. Officials hoped to do away with MetroCards by 2012 and believed that contactless bank cards would be the way to the future. But while such cards were popular in Europe, they did not immediately catch on in this country.

Mr. Lhota said there had been “a firm commitment on high, first from Tom Prendergast” — his predecessor, Thomas F. Prendergast — “and now myself, to get this done.”

“It just takes focus from on high to see it get done,” he said, “and it’s going to get done.”

If the transit authority’s finance committee approves the contract for the new fare system on Monday, the plan will go to the agency’s board for a vote on Wednesday.

The transit authority sought bids for the new system and chose Cubic Transportation Systems, the company behind the MetroCard, from among five proposals.

Cubic signed a licensing deal in 2016 with Transport for London, the transit agency for greater London, that allowed Cubic to take the technology developed for London to other cities.

But calls about New York’s new fare payment system, once it is installed, will be answered nearly 400 miles away, in Buffalo. Cubic plans to open a call center there, putting jobs in an area that is struggling economically but is important politically to state officials like Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the transit agency.",New York to Replace MetroCard With Modern Way to Pay Transit Fares,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/nyregion/metrocard-subway-new-york.html

Back in April, Facebook provided users with “Tips to Spot False News” in an article that was linked above users’ news feeds.","Since the 2016 presidential campaign, Facebook has taken a number of actions to prevent the continued distribution of false news articles on its platform, most notably by labeling articles rated as false or misleading by fact checkers as “disputed.”

But how effective are these measures?

To date, Facebook has offered little information to the public other than a recent email to fact checkers asserting that labeled articles receive 80 percent fewer impressions. But more data is necessary to determine the success of these efforts. Research (including my own) suggests the need to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of Facebook’s interventions.

Yale’s Gordon Pennycook and David Rand offer two principal warnings. First, the effects of exposure to false information are not easily countered by labeling, as they find in a paper they wrote with Tyrone D. Cannon. False information we have previously encountered feels more familiar, producing a feeling of fluency that causes us to rate it as more accurate than information we have not seen before. This effect persists even when Facebook-style warnings label a headline “disputed.” We should be cautious about assuming that labels tagging articles as false are enough to prevent misinformation on social media from affecting people’s beliefs.

In a second paper, Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand find that the presence of “disputed” labels causes study participants to rate unlabeled false stories as slightly more accurate — an “implied truth” effect. If Facebook is seen as taking responsibility for the accuracy of information in its news feed through labeling, readers could start assuming that unlabeled stories have survived scrutiny from fact checkers (which is rarely correct — there are far too many for humans to check everything).

Encouragingly, my students at Dartmouth College and I find that the effects of Facebook-style “disputed” banners on the perceived accuracy of false headlines are larger than those Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand observed. The proportion of respondents rating a false headline as “somewhat” or “very accurate” in our study decreased to 19 percent with the standard Facebook “disputed” banner, from 29 percent in the unlabeled condition. It goes down even further, to 16 percent, when the warning instead states that the headline is “rated false.” (We find no evidence of a large “implied truth” effect, though we lack the statistical precision necessary to detect effects of the size Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand measure.)

Other results suggest further reason for caution. Back in April, Facebook provided users with “Tips to Spot False News” in an article that was linked above users’ news feeds. We find that general warnings of this sort are also potentially counterproductive. When we showed a warning reminding users to “remain skeptical” and “think critically” to spot misleading articles, it did reduce belief in the accuracy of false news headlines somewhat — but it also somewhat reduced the perceived accuracy of news articles that were not false. Readers seemed to become more skeptical of all the headlines that they encountered. (A similar effect was not observed for the fact-check banners.)",Why the Fact-Checking at Facebook Needs to Be Checked,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/upshot/why-the-fact-checking-at-facebook-needs-to-be-checked.html

“Congressional investigations unfortunately are usually overtly political investigations, where it is to one side’s advantage to drag things out,” said Mr. Gowdy, who made his name in Congress as a fearsome investigator of Democrats. He added, “The notion that one side is playing the part of defense attorney and that the other side is just these white hat defenders of the truth is laughable.”

Instead, he said, he is looking to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, to conduct an apolitical investigation.

None of the challenges have thus far stopped the committees. And given the closed-door nature of their work, prominent new avenues of inquiry could always emerge, such as Russia’s use of social media to sow chaos and discord, capable of influencing the public discourse.

But all three are up against a ticking clock, with Republicans in both chambers eager to wrap up the investigations before too long.

Particularly in the House, partisan fighting is likely to undermine whatever conclusions the committee reaches. One lawmaker said the committee would probably produce two reports. The first, written by Republicans, is expected to forcefully say there is no proof that anyone around Mr. Trump worked with Russia to tip the election. A Democratic report will probably raise unanswered questions and say that the committee was never fully committed to answering them.

The panel has been on rocky ground for months, with much of the controversy surrounding the committee’s chairman, Representative Devin Nunes of California. Mr. Nunes was forced to step aside from leading the investigation in April after it was disclosed that he had received classified information from the White House that showed that Mr. Trump and his associates were incidentally swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies.

Mr. Nunes handed control to three of the committee’s Republicans, Representatives K. Michael Conaway of Texas, Tom Rooney of Florida and Mr. Gowdy. Mr. Conaway, a well-liked accountant, helped put the investigation back on track and has maintained a productive relationship with Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the panel’s top Democrat.

But Democrats say Mr. Nunes, whose signature is required to issue subpoenas, has continued to meddle around the edges of the investigation, driving Republican inquiries into who financed a dossier of unsubstantiated information on purported links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr. Nunes, they say, is also participating in an investigation into the revealing of Trump associates caught up in American surveillance by Obama administration officials.

“Frankly, I have been doing everything I can to try to get us to do a credible investigation and to reach a common conclusion,” Mr. Schiff said. “I view these things as obstacles that are in the way to overcome, and I am doing my best to overcome them almost daily.”

A spokesman for Mr. Nunes did not reply to a request for comment.

Democrats were also incensed by Mr. Gowdy’s remarks to Mr. Kushner in July, which they said were representative of efforts by some Republicans to cut the investigation short. Shortly after the meeting, Mr. Schiff publicly accused Mr. Gowdy of playing defense attorney for the administration.

Republicans have returned the biting words, sharply criticizing Mr. Schiff, whose frequent television appearances irk them. Mr. Rooney used a vulgarity when he called Mr. Schiff’s comments about the Kushner interview nonsense. And Mr. Gowdy said on Friday that he had been compelled to weigh in by the Democrats’ repetitive and meandering questions — and that a transcript would show his own questions to have been appropriately aggressive.

The Republican said it had become clear where the committee was headed.

“Will our private conclusions be the same? Yes,” Mr. Gowdy said. “Will our public pronouncements be the same? No, of course not.”

“This is politics,” he added.

Across Capitol Hill, the tone has been different. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and its top Democrat, Mark Warner of Virginia, have worked to project a collaborative rapport that committee members insist is real.

At a rare news conference this month, the two senators said they had already expended significant resources verifying the conclusions of America’s spy agencies about Russia’s efforts to meddle in the election and were now taking steps to better understand its use of social media campaigns and to investigate the collusion question.

“At the end of the day, what we owe the American people is the truth,” Mr. Warner said in an interview on Thursday. “And if there’s something there, then they should know that. And if there’s not something there, I’ll be the first to acknowledge that.”

But other committee members have sought to contain expectations. At the news conference, Mr. Burr said investigators had “hit a wall” in their work on the dossier, which holds some of the most salacious allegations of collusion, because its author, Christopher Steele, would not meet with the committee. Mr. Burr also said he did not have a mandate to look for criminal activity.

“The special counsel is focused on criminal acts; we’re not focused on criminal acts,” he said. “If we find one, then they’re the first phone call we make.”

Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and a former chairwoman of the committee, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” this month that Mr. Mueller stood a much better chance of reaching a definitive conclusion about collusion than the committees did.

“There’s no proof yet that it’s happened, and I think that proof will likely come with Mr. Mueller’s investigation,” Ms. Feinstein said. “He’s got the ability to use a grand jury. He’s got the ability to use the power of subpoena without question. And he’s got the ability to do a criminal investigation.”

Both intelligence committees will also face questions about how much of what they find can be declassified and shared with the public. Mr. Burr said on Wednesday that his goal was to have the “meat of our business” done by late spring, in time for state governments to make changes to their voting systems before next year’s midterm elections. He said he would push to declassify the findings as much as possible.

The Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, has struggled to get a fledgling investigation off the ground. Ms. Feinstein, the committee’s top Democrat, and its chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, agreed this summer to begin investigating a cluster of topics related to the firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, including Mr. Comey’s handling of the Clinton email case and the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia.

Given its jurisdiction over the Justice Department, the panel is the best positioned on Capitol Hill to unravel the Comey saga, including possible obstruction of justice. But after a brief flurry of activity earlier this fall — including a closed-door interview with the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. — investigators reached an impasse in recent weeks, as Democrats and Republicans haggled over the next witnesses to call and documents to request.

Mr. Grassley has spent weeks negotiating with the Justice Department on the committee’s behalf to try to gain access to two key F.B.I. officials who worked closely with Mr. Comey, Carl Ghattas and James Rybicki. Hopes of interviewing Paul J. Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, collapsed over the summer after prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller warned Mr. Manafort that they planned to seek criminal charges against him.

On Wednesday, Mr. Grassley unilaterally sent a flurry of letters requesting interviews with and information from current and former Justice Department officials, as well as Mr. Kushner and others involved in a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer said to be offering incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton.

Senators said they were still hopeful that the committee would break through the logjam, but a deal had not been reached as of Friday.

Mr. Arbesfeld debuts a puzzle called “Walls and Doors,” and the idea behind it is that we are given nine 5x5 “rooms” that need to be filled in. Each answer is five letters long and the clues are not hard to solve. The roadblock occurs because the clues are not given in any particular order, so it is up to us to figure out where each word goes.

For me, that was the hardest part of the puzzle. One letter in each grid is filled in (spelling out the phrase “floor plan”), but that was only of nominal help to me. After much erasing — you want to do this one in pencil — I was able to get the central grid No. 5. That was encouraging, but then I needed to start all over again and solve another grid. I knocked out No. 8. And so on, until I had experienced seven of the nine “Aha!” moments.

FRANKFURT — Antitrust investigators conducted a surprise raid on the headquarters of BMW in Munich as part of an investigation into possible illegal collusion among German automakers, the company acknowledged Friday.

European antitrust authorities said in July that they were looking into allegations that Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW conspired to hold down prices of crucial technology, possibly including emissions equipment. The raid, which took place on Monday but did not come to light until Friday, is a sign that the investigation — which has not led to any formal charges — may be intensifying.

BMW sought to dispel any implication it was embroiled in an emissions scandal that has badly damaged Volkswagen’s reputation and spread to other carmakers.

“The BMW Group wishes to make clear the distinction between potential violations of antitrust law on the one hand and illegal manipulation of exhaust gas treatment on the other hand,” the company said. “The BMW Group has not been accused of the latter.”

In a related development, Daimler said Friday that it had offered to provide evidence about the suspected conspiracy to antitrust investigators in return for lower penalties. Under its so-called leniency policy, the European Commission can reduce the fines imposed on companies if they volunteer information.

European carmakers are trying to cope with a public backlash against diesel engines, until recently the most popular powertrain option in Europe. Research by Germany and other European governments has revealed that almost all diesel cars produce far more harmful nitrogen oxide emissions in everyday use than in official tests.

Such discussions might be illegal if, for example, the manufacturers agreed among themselves to limit competition in certain areas, such as the effectiveness of emissions systems.",BMW Headquarters Are Raided in Collusion Inquiry,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/business/bmw-raid.html

The episode doesn’t beat around the booby-trapped bush, placing the newly allied forces on a collision course with Negan and his Saviors that comes to a head before the end credits roll. After outfitting their cars with protective plating — a sight reminiscent of the caravans of covered wagons common in early America, the latest example of the show’s continuing fixation on Western imagery — the protagonist band takes the fight to Negan and offers him one last chance of surrender. He, rather impolitely, rebuffs them.

A full-on firefight breaks out once the Hilltop folks pledge their allegiance to Maggie over the craven Gregory, and everyone reaffirms that the time for diplomacy has long since passed. And that’s only one prong of this episode’s multiple-front climax, a carefully orchestrated set piece synchronizing the long-awaited Negan showdown with an elaborate scheme executed by Daryl and his skeleton crew.

While Rick brings an active offensive to Negan, Daryl joins forces with Morgan, Carol and Tara in order to round up and funnel the zombies toward the enemy compound. Nicotero capitalizes on this thread for some of the hour’s more striking photography; one diagonally bisected frame shows Carol and a Twizzler-snacking Tara casually lounging on a roof while zombies swarm below them.

In the sequence most likely to inspire cheers among fans, Daryl lures the undead herd in the direction of the fray by using a trail of ignited gas cans. Valiantly sharpshooting each target from his motorcycle, tearing on unfazed by the explosions like the post-apocalyptic cowboy he is — that’s the “Walking Dead” that fans were demanding more of during last season’s doldrums. Just when stringing along a patient, devoted fan base appeared to emerge as this show’s modus operandi, the writers have recommitted to shorter-term gratification. If moving chess pieces around the board is to be an episode’s main work, it’s got to have its fun doing so.

The conflict between Rick and Negan will clearly provide the backbone of the season to come, this hour’s skirmish being the opening salvo in a longer and more grueling campaign. The friction between the two groups of humans even threatens to eclipse the zombies themselves, turning the decomposing mob into a variable that one camp can direct against the other. The impending encounters between the armies have tilted the show’s entire axis, instantly creating new partnerships and altering the overall dynamics of power. (“We all just met each other,” one young soldier states. They have no choice but to place faith in one another.)

The days ahead look dark and lethal. There’s no way Negan will be bested as easily as he seemed to be during this episode’s brief run-in, and the tricks up his sleeve are sure to be grisly. On “The Walking Dead,” a new season guarantees a few things: some major character deaths, long passages of unbearably charged silence, gallows wisdom about the value of life.

A Few Thoughts While We Survey the Wreckage

• As fans online have already noted from a preview clip, this episode’s footage of Carl wandering though a zombie-remains-strewn auto graveyard in search of fuel mirrors a similar scene from the show’s pilot, shot for shot. While Nicotero has confirmed that he mounted the homage as a special treat for the show’s hundredth episode, there’s something to be said here about Carl’s inheriting cycles of violence and tragedy from his father. Throughout the series, Rick has been motivated by the hope of leaving a better world for his son. This may be the season he accepts that his dream has become impossible.

• The episode is dedicated to the memory of two men: John Bernecker, a 33-year-old stuntman who tragically died in an accident while shooting the new season in July; and filmmaker George Romero, whose zombie ur-text “Night of the Living Dead” laid much of the rusted, blood-spattered track this program has followed.

• Gabriel is left in dire straits at the conclusion of the episode, escaping the zombie horde only to find himself trapped with Negan in a grim “out of the frying pan, into the fire” scenario. Whether Negan’s line about Gabriel having worn the proper pants for soiling himself amuses or not will vary by viewer.",‘The Walking Dead’ Season Premiere Recap: A World at War,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/arts/television/the-walking-dead-recap-mercy-season-8-premiere.html

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Yes, hi, remember yesterday, when I said that you might as well solve the Friday because it wasn’t as hard as you would imagine it to be and besides, the Saturday puzzle would be much harder? Well, they don’t pay me the medium-sized bucks for nothing. Today’s puzzle by Samuel A. Donaldson and Brad Wilber is a real ... let’s just call it a learning experience, O.K.?

The bottom line on this very worthy puzzle: It’s tough, but it’s not tougher than you. Forget the horse-drawn carriage at 15A and the sainted archbishop of Canterbury at 19A for a second and drop in REID for TARA of the “Sharknado” films. There is no shame in knowing that. It will help you get the crossings. Maybe. If you know that Adobe makes the software that creates PDFs, put that in at 27A. Now you’ve got _ _ _ _ RP at 1D, which is a musical note. That’s got to be a SHARP note, right? Fill that in to help you get started on the northwest. You can come back for the first letter later. Now continue on like that until you get your toehold.

As tough as it is, it is also as close to a perfect Saturday crossword as they come. The grid is pristine, even if you are not familiar with some of the answers. The entries fluctuate between highly entertaining (HOSTESS TWINKIES) and hard to reach without help (IMARETS, which I feel like I should have known), but each of them are exquisite gems and they are all clued nearly perfectly. It just may take some reliance on outside references. The cluing is ramped up to 11, as evidenced, for one, by “Jet launcher” for GEYSER. That Kellogg brand at 40A is EGGO, of course.

Kudos to Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Wilber for debuting seven fabulous entries, the best of which, in my opinion, is COSMIC JOKE.

WASHINGTON — President Trump said early on Monday that his proposed tax plan would not prompt any changes to Americans’ tax-deferred retirement plans, pushing back against reports that the Republicans are weighing a proposal that would significantly reduce the income workers can save in these popular programs.

Mr. Trump’s shutdown of the proposal is the first of what many Republicans privately fear could be a presidential pattern that disrupts their efforts to pass a sweeping overhaul of the tax code. In it, Mr. Trump appeared to rule out a politically difficult idea, which, if enacted, would have provided some revenue to help pay for the tax plan.

Republicans’ ability to win passage of a tax package hinges on its ability to survive a complex set of legislative restrictions in the Senate. Republicans are attempting to cut business tax rates deeply, and also to cut individual tax rates, using a legislative route that allows them to bypass a Democratic filibuster and pass a bill with a simple Senate majority. To do that, they will need to make some tough political choices, eliminating some popular tax breaks, or employing some budgetary accounting tricks, in order to offset lost revenues from rate cuts.

Mr. Trump’s tweet concerned one of those accounting maneuvers, which would have allowed Republicans to effectively borrow tax revenues from the future to offset some rate cuts today. Reducing 401(k) contribution limits would force retirement savers to pay more in taxes today, as they sock away money, but less in the future, when they began withdrawing retirement funds tax-free.

Mr. Raniere acknowledged giving “five women permission to do something,” but did not elaborate, other than to say he would investigate, Mr. Vicente said.
Mr. Vicente said he suspected Mr. Raniere was lying to him and might have done so before.

For hours, muffled screams and the smell of burning tissue filled the room.

“I wept the whole time,” Ms. Edmondson recalled. “I disassociated out of my body.”

Since the late 1990s, an estimated 16,000 people have enrolled in courses offered by Nxivm (pronounced Nex-e-um), which it says are designed to bring about greater self-fulfillment by eliminating psychological and emotional barriers. Most participants take some workshops, like the group’s “Executive Success Programs,” and resume their lives. But other people have become drawn more deeply into Nxivm, giving up careers, friends and families to become followers of its leader, Keith Raniere, who is known within the group as “Vanguard.”

Both Nxivm and Mr. Raniere, 57, have long attracted controversy. Former members have depicted him as a man who manipulated his adherents, had sex with them and urged women to follow near-starvation diets to achieve the type of physique he found appealing.

Now, as talk about the secret sisterhood and branding has circulated within Nxivm, scores of members are leaving. Interviews with a dozen of them portray a group spinning more deeply into disturbing practices. Many members said they feared that confessions about indiscretions would be used to blackmail them.

Mark Vicente, a filmmaker and former top Nxivm official, said that after hearing about the secret society, he confronted Mr. Raniere.

“I said, ‘Whatever you are doing, you are heading for a blowup,’” Mr. Vicente said.

Several former members have asked state authorities to investigate the group’s practices, but officials have declined to pursue action.

In July, Ms. Edmondson filed a complaint with the New York State Department of Health against Danielle Roberts, a licensed osteopath and follower of Mr. Raniere, who performed the branding, according to Ms. Edmondson and another woman. In a letter, the agency said it would not look into Dr. Roberts because she was not acting as Ms. Edmondson’s doctor when the branding is said to have happened.

Separately, a state police investigator told Ms. Edmondson and two other women that officials would not pursue their criminal complaint against Nxivm because their actions had been consensual, a text message shows.

State medical regulators also declined to act on a complaint filed against another Nxivm-affilated physician, Brandon Porter. Dr. Porter, as part of an “experiment,” showed women graphically violent film clips while a brain-wave machine and video camera recorded their reactions, according to two women who took part.

The women said they were not warned that some of the clips were violent, including footage of four women being murdered and dismembered.

“Please look into this ASAP,” a former Nxivm member, Jennifer Kobelt, stated in her complaint. “This man needs to be stopped.”

In September, regulators told Ms. Kobelt they concluded that the allegations against Dr. Porter did not meet the agency’s definition of “medical misconduct,” their letter shows.

Mr. Raniere and other top Nxivm officials, including Lauren Salzman, did not respond to repeated emails, letters or text messages seeking comment. Dr. Roberts and Dr. Porter also did not respond to inquiries.

Former members said that, inside Nxivm, they are being portrayed as defectors who want to destroy the group.

It is not clear how many women were branded or which Nxivm officials were aware of the practice.

A copy of a text message Mr. Raniere sent to a female follower indicates that he knew women were being branded and that the symbol’s design incorporated his initials.

“Not initially intended as my initials but they rearranged it slightly for tribute,” Mr. Raniere wrote, (“if it were abraham lincolns or bill gates initials no one would care.)”

From the Message Below is an excerpt of a text message Mr. Raniere sent to a female follower, which suggested that he knew women were being branded and that the symbol’s design incorporated his initials. “... Not intended initially as my initials but they rearranged it slightly for tribute (if it were abraham lincolns or bill gates initials no one would care). The primary meaning and design of the brand symbol has nothing to do with my initials ...”

Joining the Sisterhood

Ms. Edmondson, who lives in Vancouver and helped start Nxivm’s chapter there, was thrilled when Lauren Salzman arrived in January to teach workshops.

The women, both in their early 40s, were close and Ms. Edmondson regarded Ms. Salzman as a confidante and mentor.

“Lauren was someone I really looked up to as a rock star within the company,” said Ms. Edmondson, an actress who joined Nxivm about a decade ago.

During her visit, Ms. Salzman said she had something “really amazing” she wanted to share. “It is kind of strange and top secret and in order for me to tell you about it you need to give me something as collateral to make sure you don’t speak about it,” Ms. Edmondson recalled her saying.

The proposition seemed like a test of trust. After Ms. Edmondson wrote a letter detailing past indiscretions, Ms. Salzman told her about the secret sorority.

She said it had been formed as a force for good, one that could grow into a network that could influence events like elections. To become effective, members had to overcome weaknesses that Mr. Raniere taught were common to women — an overemotional nature, a failure to keep promises and an embrace of the role of victim, according to Ms. Edmondson and other members.

Submission and obedience would be used as tools to achieve those goals, several women said. The sisterhood would comprise circles, each led by a “master” who would recruit six “slaves,” according to two women. In time, they would recruit slaves of their own.

“She made it sound like a bad-ass bitch boot camp,” Ms. Edmondson said.

Ms. Edmondson and others said that during training, the women were required to send their master texts that read “Morning M” and “Night M.” During drills, a master texted her slaves “?” and they had 60 seconds to reply “Ready M.”

Trainees who failed had to pay penalties, including fasting, or could face physical punishments, two women said.

In March, Ms. Edmondson arrived for an initiation ceremony at Ms. Salzman’s home in Clifton Park, N.Y., a town about 20 miles north of Albany where Mr. Raniere and some followers live. After undressing, she was led to a candlelit ceremony, where she removed a blindfold and saw Ms. Salzman’s other slaves for the first time. The women were then driven to a nearby house, where the branding took place.

In the spring, the sorority grew as women joined different circles. Slaves added compromising collateral every month to Dropbox accounts, and a Google Document was used to list a timetable for recruiting new slaves, several women said.

Around the same time, an actress, Catherine Oxenberg, said she learned her daughter had been initiated into the sorority.

“I felt sick to my stomach,” said Ms. Oxenberg, who starred in the 1980s television series “Dynasty.”

Ms. Oxenberg had become increasingly concerned about her 26-year-old daughter, India, who looked emaciated from dieting. She told her mother that she had not had a menstrual period for a year and that her hair was falling out.

Ms. Oxenberg said she invited her daughter home in late May to try to get her away from the group.

When Ms. Oxenberg confronted her about the sorority, her daughter defended its practices.

“She said it was a character-building experience,” Ms. Oxenberg said.

‘Humans Can Be Noble’

By the time the secret group was taking shape, Mark Vicente, the filmmaker, had been a faithful follower of Mr. Raniere for more than a decade.

Mr. Vicente said he had been contacted by Ms. Salzman’s mother, Nancy, a co-founder of Nxivm who is known as “Prefect,” after the 2004 release of a documentary he co-directed that explored spirituality and physics.

Soon, Mr. Vicente was taking courses that he said helped him expose his fears and learn strategies that made him feel more resolute.

He also made a documentary called “Encender el Corazón,” or “Ignite the Heart,” which lionized Mr. Raniere’s work in Mexico.

“Keith Raniere is an activist, scientist, philosopher and, above all, humanitarian,” Mr. Vicente says in the film.

Mr. Raniere has used those words to describe himself. On his website, he said he spoke in full sentences by age 1, mastered high school mathematics by 12 and taught himself to play “concert level” piano. At 16, he entered Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.

Before Nxivm, he helped run a company called Consumers’ Buyline Inc., which offered discounts to members on groceries and other products.

In the mid-1990s, several state attorneys general investigated it as a suspected pyramid scheme; Mr. Raniere and his associates agreed to shut it down.

Through Nxivm, Mr. Raniere transformed himself into a New Age teacher with long hair and a guru-like manner of speaking.

“Humans can be noble,” he says on his website. “The question is: will we put forth what is necessary?”

By many accounts, Mr. Raniere sleeps during the day and goes out at night to play volleyball or take female followers for long walks. Several women described him as warm, funny and eager to talk about subjects that interested them.

Others saw a different side. Nxivm sued several former members, accusing them of stealing its trade secrets, among other things.

Mr. Vicente said he was aware of the negative publicity, including a 2012 series by The Albany Times-Union that described alleged abuses inside Nxivm.

Mr. Vicente’s views began to change this year after his wife was ostracized when she left Nxivm and he heard rumors about the secret sorority.

Photo

Mr. Vicente said he got evasive answers when he asked Mr. Raniere about the group. Mr. Raniere acknowledged giving “five women permission to do something,” but did not elaborate, other than to say he would investigate, Mr. Vicente said.

Mr. Vicente said he suspected Mr. Raniere was lying to him and might have done so before. Suddenly, self-awareness techniques he had learned felt like tools that had been used to control him.

“No one goes in looking to have their personality stripped away,” he said. “You just don’t realize what is happening.”

Followers Start to Flee

In May, Sarah Edmondson began to recoil from her embrace of the secret society.

Her husband, Anthony Ames, who was also a Nxivm member, learned about her branding and the couple both wanted out.

Before quitting, Mr. Ames went to Nxivm’s offices in Albany to collect money he said the group owed him.

He had his cellphone in his pocket and turned on its recorder.

On the recording, Mr. Ames tells another member that Ms. Edmondson was branded and that other women told him about handing over collateral. “This is criminal,” Mr. Ames says.

The voice of a woman — who Mr. Ames said is Lauren Salzman — is heard trying to calm him. “I don’t think you are open to having a conversation,” she said.

“You are absolutely right, I’m not open to having a conversation,” he replied. “My wife got branded.”

A few days later, many of Mr. Raniere’s followers learned of the secret society from a website run by a Buffalo-area businessman, Frank R. Parlato Jr. Mr. Parlato had been locked in a long legal battle with two sisters, Sara and Clare Bronfman, who are members of Nxivm and the daughters of Edgar Bronfman, the deceased chairman of Seagram Company.

In 2011, the Bronfman sisters sued Mr. Parlato, whom they had hired as a consultant, alleging he had defrauded them of $1 million.

Four years later, in 2015, the Justice Department indicted him on charges of fraud and other crimes arising from alleged activities, including defrauding the Bronfmans. Mr. Parlato has denied the claims and the case is pending.

Mr. Parlato started a website, The Frank Report, which he uses to lambaste prosecutors, Mr. Raniere and the Bronfmans. In early June, Mr. Parlato published the first in a torrent of salacious posts under the headline, “Branded Slaves and Master Raniere.”

A Nxivm follower, Soukaina Mehdaoui, said she reached out to Mr. Raniere after reading the post. Ms. Mehdaoui, 25, was a newcomer to Nxivm, but the two had grown close.

She said Mr. Raniere told her the secret sorority began after three women offered damaging collateral to seal lifetime vows of obedience to him.

While Ms. Mehdaoui had joined the sorority, the women in her circle were not branded. She was appalled.

“There are things I didn’t know that I didn’t sign up for, and I’m not even hearing about it from you,” she texted Mr. Raniere.

Mr. Raniere texted back about his initials and the brand.

By then, panic was spreading inside Nxivm. Slaves were ordered to delete encrypted messages between them and erase Google documents, two women said. To those considering breaking away, it was not clear whom they could trust and who were Nxivm loyalists.

Late one night, Ms. Mehdaoui met secretly with another Nxivm member. They took out their cellphones to show they were not recording the conversation.

Both decided to leave Nxivm, despite concerns that the group would retaliate by releasing their “collateral” or suing them.

Ms. Mehdaoui said that when she went to say goodbye to Mr. Raniere, he urged her to stay.

“Do you think, I’m bad, I don’t agree with abuses,” she recalled him saying. He said the group “gives women tools to be powerful, to regain their power for the sake of building love.”

Nxivm recently filed criminal complaints with the Vancouver police against Ms. Edmondson and two other women accusing them of mischief and other crimes in connection with the firm’s now-closed center there, according to Ms. Edmondson. The women have denied the allegations. A spokesman for the Vancouver police declined to comment.

Ms. Edmondson and other former followers of Mr. Raniere said they were focusing on recovering.

America’s operations in conflict zones like Africa are expanding: 400 American Special Forces personnel in Somalia train local troops fighting the Shabab Islamist group, providing intelligence and sometimes going into battle with them. One member of the Navy SEALs was killed there in a mission in May. On Oct. 14, a massive attack widely attributed to the Shabab on a Mogadishu street killed more than 270 people, which would show the group’s increased reach. About 800 troops are based in Niger, where four Green Berets died on Oct. 4.

Many of these forces are engaged in counterterrorism operations — against the Taliban in Afghanistan, for instance; against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria; against an affiliate of Al Qaeda in Yemen. So far, Americans seem to accept that these missions and the deployments they require will continue indefinitely. Still, it’s a very real question whether, in addition to endorsing these commitments, which have cost trillions of dollars and many lives over 16 years, they will embrace new entanglements of the sort President Trump has seemed to portend with his rash threats and questionable decisions on North Korea and Iran.",America’s Forever Wars,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/opinion/americas-forever-wars.html

Undoubtedly, the term “fascism” has an effective anti-authoritarian ring to it, so perhaps that is why it is thrown around so much these days. But from what I can tell, much of what students are protesting, both at the University of Oregon and elsewhere, is the expression of viewpoints or ideologies that offend them and make them feel marginalized. They are fed up with what they see as a blanket protection of free speech that, at its extreme, permits the expression of views by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. I am opposed to all these groups stand for, but offensive speech can never be the sole criterion for shutting down a speaker.

The students’ own tactics reveal just how malleable the concept of offensiveness can be. For example, the word “fascism” has deep emotional connotations for me. It’s the reason for great suffering in my family. Two generations ago, members of my extended family were thrown into concentration camps and murdered in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust.

So, when students accuse me of leading an institution that harbors and promotes fascism, it offends me. But does that justify my censoring their speech? Clearly the answer is no.

Without the freedom to express ideas, even those that offend, we cannot challenge the status quo nor move society forward. But student protesters can still change and reform institutions. In 2015, I had been president of the University of Oregon for all of three months when protests erupted around the country over the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. A group called the Black Student Task Force organized a protest right outside my office. I invited the students in for a discussion, and although the matters we discussed, about systemic racism and educational opportunity, were emotionally charged, we established a respectful dialogue. More important, the discussion led to change.

The University of Oregon engaged in a searching and difficult historical examination of racism at the school. We doubled the number of black faculty members, created new programs to enroll more black students, started an African-American lecture series, and raised $1.6 million to build a new black student cultural center. We also invested in symbolic change by removing the name of a former Ku Klux Klan leader from one of our residence halls and replacing it with the name of an illustrious black alumnus.

Educators and students must learn from each other, and nothing is more important to this exchange than free speech. Our future as a university, and more broadly, our future as a nation, depends upon our willingness to hear voices different from our own and engage in meaningful discussion.

We in academia have a lot of big issues to tackle. One such topic — what to do about speech that offends vulnerable populations and how to protect speech and safety at the same time — presents a difficult challenge, but that makes the issue that much more important.

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

Photo

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.

So it’s not surprising that we humans are unable to make something like time or the marking of time bend to our collective wills. For centuries, different countries used different calendars, and even the old Julian calendar had its problems.

That is why, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII ordered that everyone stop messing around and use one calendar. Even then, the later a country switched over, the more days had to be dropped in order to stay in sync with the vernal equinox and the winter solstice. This resulted in a lot of confusion for a while, including the month of September 1752 in North America, which looked like this and which children across the continent still whisper about as “The Best Start to the School Year Ever.”

But when researchers put an Elmo sticker on the apple, more than a third chose it. That’s a significant result, and from a cheap, easily replicated intervention.

While the intervention seems simple, any study like this is anything but. For many reasons, doing research in nutrition is very, very hard.

First, the researchers have to fund their work, which can take years. Then the work has to be vetted and approved by an Institutional Review Board, which safeguards subjects from potential harm. I.R.B.s are especially vigilant when studies involve children, a vulnerable group. Even if the research is of minimal risk, this process can take months.

Then there’s getting permission from schools to do the work. As you can imagine, many are resistant to allowing research on their premises. Often, protocols and rules require getting permission from parents to allow their children to be part of studies. If parents (understandably) refuse, figuring out how to do the work without involving some children can be tricky.

Finally, many methodological decisions come into play. Let’s imagine that we want to do a simple test of cookies versus apples, plus or minus stickers — as this study did. It’s possible that children eat different things on different days, so we need to make sure that we test them on multiple days of the week. It’s possible that they might change their behavior once, but then go back to their old ways, so we need to test responses over time.

It’s possible that handing out the cookie or apple personally might change behavior more than just leaving the choices out for display. If that’s the case, we need to stay hidden and observe unobtrusively. This matters because in the real world it’s probably not feasible to have someone handing out these foods in schools, and we need the methods to mirror what will most likely happen later. It’s also possible that the choices might differ based on whether children can take both the apple and the cookie (in which case they could get the sticker and the treat) or whether they had to choose one.

I point out all these things to reinforce that this type of research isn’t as simple as many might initially think. Without addressing these questions, and more, the work may be flawed or not easily generalized.

These difficulties are some of the reasons so much research on food and nutrition is done with animals, like mice. We don’t need to worry as much about I.R.B.s or getting a school on board. We don’t have to worry about mice noticing who’s recording data. And we can control what they’re offered to eat, every meal of every day. But the same things that make animal studies so much easier to perform also make them much less meaningful. Human eating and nutrition are typically more complex than anything a mouse would encounter.

Overcoming these problems and proving spectacular results in preteens are some of the reasons this study on cookies and apples, and others like it, are so compelling. The authors have transformed this work into popular appearances, books and publicity for the Food and Brand Lab.

But cracks began to appear in Mr. Wansink’s and the Food and Brand Lab’s work not long ago, when other researchers noted discrepancies in some of his studies. The numbers didn’t add up; odd things appeared in the data, including the study on apples and cookies. The issues were significant enough that JAMA Pediatrics retracted the original article, and the researchers posted a replacement.

The problems didn’t end there. As Stephanie Lee at BuzzFeed recently reported, it appears that the study wasn’t conducted on 8-to-11-year-olds as published. It was done on 3-to-5-year-olds.

Just as mice can’t be easily extrapolated to humans, research done on 3-to-5-year-olds doesn’t necessarily generalize to 8-to-11-year-olds. Putting an Elmo sticker on an apple for a small child might matter, but that doesn’t mean it will for a fifth grader. On Friday, the study was fully retracted.

Making things worse, this may have happened in other publications. Ms. Lee has also reported on a study published in Preventive Medicine in 2012 that claimed that children are more likely to eat vegetables if you give them a “cool” name, like “X-ray Vision Carrots.” That study, too, may be retracted or corrected, along with a host of others.

As a researcher, and one who works with children, I find it hard to understand how you could do a study of 3-to-5-year-olds, analyze the data, write it up and then somehow forget and imagine it happened with 8-to-11-year-olds. The grant application would have required detail on the study subjects, as well as justification for the age ranges. The I.R.B. would require researchers to be specific about the ages of the children studied.

I reached out to the authors of the study to ask how this could have happened, and Mr. Wansink replied: “The explanation for mislabeling of the age groups in the study is both simple and embarrassing. I was not present for the 2008 data collection, and when I later wrote the paper I wrongly inferred that these children must have been the typical age range of elementary students we usually study. Instead, I discovered that while the data was indeed collected in elementary schools, it was actually collected at Head Start day cares that happened to meet in those elementary schools.”

This is a level of disconnect that many scientists would find inconceivable, and I do not mean to suggest that this is the norm for nutrition research. It does, however, illustrate how an inattention to detail can derail what might be promising work. The difficulties of research in this area are already significant. Distrust makes things worse. The social sciences are already suffering from a replication problem; when work that makes a big splash fails to hold up, it hurts science in general.

We want to believe there are easy fixes to the obesity epidemic and nutrition in general. We want to believe there are simple actions we can take, like putting labels on menus, or stickers on food, or jazzing up the names of vegetables. Sadly, all of that may not work, regardless of what advocates say.

Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, I express myself with images.”

It’s a crowded play, and O’Neill layers its abundant dialogue with the racing thoughts of his characters, who speak their anxieties and suspicions aloud for the audience’s benefit. However many people Mr. Greenspan is playing in a given scene, he is operating on double that number of tracks — and following along, so are we. This takes some getting used to, but it’s like the way your ear has to adjust to Shakespeare. Give it a little time, and you’ll ease right in.

The straightforwardness of the design — sets and costume by Dane Laffrey, lighting by Jen Schriever — helps here. Mr. Greenspan wears a classic three-piece suit throughout, and the playing spaces for the first seven acts are intimate, contained within a wooden structure that Mr. Laffrey has nestled inside the cavernous theater.

But sound is a stubborn obstacle to this delicately modulated performance. Ceiling fans whir softly over the audience in those initial spaces, making it difficult to hear, especially when Mr. Greenspan lowers his voice to a whisper or moves upstage.

Well into the show on Friday night, the fans were turned off, and the difference was remarkable: Act VI — featuring Nina; Ned; and my two favorites, the aw-shucks Sam and the petty, surprisingly sympathetic Charlie — actually rollicked. For the final two acts, though, we migrated upstairs to the mezzanine, where echoey acoustics and a sudden distance from Mr. Greenspan, separated from us by the balcony railing, got in the way.

“Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself.","The video is now TED’s second-most popular, having been seen, to date, by some 43 million viewers. In the years after the talk, Cuddy became a sought-after speaker, a quasi celebrity and, eventually, the author of a best-selling book, “Presence,” in 2015. The power pose became the sun salutation for the professional woman on the cusp of leaning in. Countless hopefuls, male and female, locked themselves in bathroom stalls before job interviews to make victory V’s with their arms; media trainers had their speakers dutifully practice the pose before approaching the stage. Cuddy has gone on to give talks on power and the body (including power posing) and stereotyping to women’s groups in Australia, at youth homeless shelters, to skin-care workers by the thousands, to employees at Target and agents at State Farm Insurance. Cuddy’s fans approach her in airports, on ski slopes in Telluride, in long lines after her talks, to hug or to thank her, filled with their own power-posing stories — sharing how bold body language helped them get their jobs or win some match or confront a bully at work.

But since 2015, even as she continued to stride onstage and tell the audiences to face down their fears, Cuddy has been fighting her own anxieties, as fellow academics have subjected her research to exceptionally high levels of public scrutiny. She is far from alone in facing challenges to her work: Since 2011, a methodological reform movement has been rattling the field, raising the possibility that vast amounts of research, even entire subfields, might be unreliable. Up-and-coming social psychologists, armed with new statistical sophistication, picked up the cause of replications, openly questioning the work their colleagues conducted under a now-outdated set of assumptions. The culture in the field, once cordial and collaborative, became openly combative, as scientists adjusted to new norms of public critique while still struggling to adjust to new standards of evidence.

Cuddy, in particular, has emerged from this upheaval as a unique object of social psychology’s new, enthusiastic spirit of self-flagellation — as if only in punishing one of its most public stars could it fully break from its past. At conferences, in classrooms and on social media, fellow academics (or commenters on their sites) have savaged not just Cuddy’s work but also her career, her income, her ambition, even her intelligence, sometimes with evident malice. Last spring, she quietly left her tenure-track job at Harvard.

Some say that she has gained fame with an excess of confidence in fragile results, that she prized her platform over scientific certainty. But many of her colleagues, and even some who are critical of her choices, believe that the attacks on her have been excessive and overly personal. What seems undeniable is that the rancor of the critiques reflects the emotional toll among scientists forced to confront the fear that what they were doing all those years may not have been entirely scientific.

One of the seminal social-psychology studies, at the turn of the 20th century, asked a question that at the time was a novel one: How does the presence of other people change an individual’s behavior? Norman Triplett, a psychologist at Indiana University, found that when he asked children to execute a simple task (winding line on a fishing rod), they performed better in the company of other children than they did when alone in a room. Over the following decades, a new discipline grew up within psychology to further interrogate group dynamics: how social groups react in certain circumstances, how the many can affect the one.

The questions grew even more profound, using experiments to tease out universal susceptibilities, raising the possibility that behavior was more easily swayed by outside forces than personality researchers previously believed. The field reached a moment of unusual visibility in the mid-20th century, as practitioners, many of them Jewish refugees or first-generation immigrants from Europe, explored, post-World War II, the way group pressures or authority figures could influence human behavior. In one simple study on conformity in 1951, the social psychologist Solomon Asch found that people would agree that one drawn line matched the length of another — even if it clearly did not — if others around them all agreed that it did. In subsequent years, researchers like Stanley Milgram (who tested how people weighed their consciences against the demands of authority) and Philip Zimbardo (who observed the effect of power on students assigned as either prison guards or prisoners) rejected the traditional confines of the lab for more theatrical displays of human nature. “They felt the urgency of history,” says Rebecca Lemov, a professor of the history of science at Harvard. “They really wanted to make people look.”

Since the late 1960s, the field’s psychologists have tried to elevate the scientific rigor of their work, introducing controls and carefully designed experiments like the ones found in medicine. Increasingly complex ideas about the workings of the unconscious yielded research with the charm of mesmerists’ shows, revealing unlikely forces that seem to guide our behavior: that simply having people wash their hands could change their sense of culpability; that people’s evaluations of risk could easily be rendered irrational; that once people have made a decision, they curiously give more weight to information in its favor. Humans, the research often suggested, were reliably mercurial, highly suggestible, profoundly irrational, tricksters better at fooling ourselves than anyone else.

Already relatively accessible to the public, the field became even more influential with the rise of behavioral economics in the 1980s and 1990s, as visionaries like Richard Thaler, (who won the Nobel Prize in economics this month) found applications for counterintuitive social-psychology insights that could be used to guide policy. In 2000, Malcolm Gladwell, the author of the best-selling “Tipping Point,” applied irresistible storytelling to the science, sending countless journalists to investigate similar terrain and inspiring social psychologists to write books of their own. In 2006, Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard, published the best seller “Stumbling on Happiness” — a book that tried to explain why we plan so poorly for our own future. That same year, TED started airing its first videos, offering a new stage for social psychologists with compelling findings, ideally surprising ones. The field was experiencing a visibility unknown since the midcentury; business schools, eager for social psychologists’ insights into leadership and decision-making, started pursuing social psychologists, with better pay and more funding than psychology graduate schools could offer.

This moment of fizziness for the discipline was already underway when Cuddy arrived at Princeton’s graduate program in 2000, transferring there to follow her adviser, Susan Fiske, with whom she first worked at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She moved to Princeton with her husband at the time — they later divorced — and in her second year there, she had a child. Her academic work continued to thrive as she collaborated with Fiske on research on stereotyping, which found that groups of people (for example of a particular ethnicity) who were judged as nice were assumed to be less competent and vice versa. (“Just Because I’m Nice Don’t Assume I’m Dumb,” was the headline of a Harvard Business Review article by Cuddy.) Fiske and Cuddy’s resulting papers are still heavily cited, formulating a framework for stereotyping that proved hugely influential on the field.

And yet, especially early on at Princeton, Cuddy felt uncertain of her place there. She feared that her brain simply could not function at a high-enough level to power her through the program. Cuddy suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident the summer after her sophomore year in college, when a friend of hers fell asleep at the wheel while Cuddy was asleep in the back seat. In the months after the accident, Cuddy was told she should not expect to finish college; her fog was so deep that she remembers being retaught how to shop for groceries. Even after Cuddy recovered, her friends told her that she had changed, that she was not the same person — but she could not remember who she had been before. It took her four years and multiple false starts before she could return to college. Even after she was accepted to graduate school at University of Massachusetts, she confessed to Fiske that she feared she would not be able to keep up with the work.

Cuddy was trained as a ballet dancer — in between her stints at college, she danced as an apprentice with the Colorado Ballet — but her interest in studying the body and its relationship to power did not begin until 2009, her first year as a teacher at Harvard Business School. At the invitation of her department chair, she joined a small circle of academics meeting with Joe Navarro, a former F.B.I. agent who had written a book about body language. The invited parties, which included Dana Carney, a professor at Columbia University who studied body language and power, all spoke briefly about their work. In the conversation that followed, Navarro pointed out that Cuddy’s own body language, during her presentation, signaled insecurity: She was fiddling with her necklace, wrapping her arms around her torso.

Carney and Cuddy had been noticing the same kinds of body language in their female students, who performed well on written materials but lost points, compared with their male counterparts, on class participation. Their body language was constricted; they raised their hands with their elbows cradled in their other hands; they made themselves physically small; they spoke less often.

The two researchers wondered whether people whose physical cues looked like their female students’ — self-protective, insecure — would feel more powerful or even change their behavior if they simply adopted more expansive body positions.

Carney and Cuddy brainstormed a research project to test this question. At Columbia, Carney recruited students, telling them that they were part of a study intended to measure the effects of placing an electrocardiograph’s electrodes either above or below the heart. In the study of 42 subjects that they eventually published, experimenters arranged half the students into positions associated with high power (leaning back in a chair with feet crossed on a desk, for example) and half the students into positions associated with low power (like crossing arms in front of the body). Before and after the poses, experimenters took saliva swabs from the students to measure how the positions affected cortisol and testosterone levels. They also asked the students to report (before and after the poses) how in charge and powerful they felt on a scale of one to four (a measurement known as “self-reported feelings of power”). And they measured whether that feeling had what researchers call a “downstream effect” — a resulting behavior. People who feel power, the literature suggests, are more likely to engage in a range of certain behaviors, including risk-taking; so the experiment also measured the subjects’ willingness to bet on a roll of the dice.

“I remember how happy we were when Dana called me with the results,” Cuddy says. “Everything went in the direction it was supposed to.” The abstract that they eventually wrote — that their editors approved — reflects the incautious enthusiasm that characterized the era: “That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful, has real-world, actionable implications.”

In 2014, on a podcast called “Story Collider,” Cuddy connects the study that made her so famous with the accident that subtly shifted her identity. After the crash, she recalled, she felt as if she were merely passing for herself, an inauthentic version of who she used to be. It made sense, then, that she ended up “studying how people can become their aspirational selves,” she said. “How can you become a self that you are not now?”

The year that Amy Cuddy published her power-posing paper, Joseph Simmons, who attended graduate school at Princeton with Cuddy, was starting to think about his own seminal paper, one that would, unknown to either of them, have as much influence on her life as it would on his own; it would, in fact, change not just their lives but the field as they knew it, with wildly differing consequences for each of them.

Cuddy and Simmons, each of whom came from working-class backgrounds, had been fond of each other at Princeton, even if they did not socialize often: Cuddy was a new mother, and Simmons was five years younger and heavily committed to his softball team. Simmons considered Cuddy a friend, someone he was always happy to see at a party, despite their obvious differences: Cuddy, who used to follow the Grateful Dead, would have been the one dancing at the party, while Simmons would have been the one laughing with his close friend, a fellow graduate student named Leif Nelson, about the latest buzzy journal article that seemed, to them, ridiculous.

Having arrived at Princeton wide-eyed, straight from Mount St. Mary’s College in Maryland, Simmons, within a few years, appeared to some of his classmates to have lost some of his idealism about academia; maybe he exhibited his idealism about science in a way that could be mistaken for cynicism. Simmons had an unusual interest in statistics, the way its airtight logic could neatly prove, or disprove, the worth of an extravagant idea. He and Nelson were endlessly critical of other studies’ findings, an intellectual exercise they enjoyed and considered essential. The two of them, Nelson says, were “into thinking about subtleties in data collection and analysis.”

After finishing a postdoctoral program at Princeton, Simmons lost touch with Cuddy, who was by then teaching at Northwestern. He remained close to Nelson, who had befriended a behavioral scientist, also a skeptic, Uri Simonsohn. Nelson and Simonsohn kept up an email correspondence for years. They, along with Simmons, took particular umbrage when a prestigious journal accepted a paper from an emeritus professor of psychology at Cornell, Daryl Bem, who claimed that he had strong evidence for the existence of extrasensory perception. The paper struck them as the ultimate in bad-faith science. “How can something not be possible to cause something else?” Nelson says. “Oh, you reverse time, then it can’t.” And yet the methodology was supposedly sound. After years of debating among themselves, the three of them resolved to figure out how so many researchers were coming up with such unlikely results.

Over the course of several months of conference calls and computer simulations, the three researchers eventually determined that the enemy of science — subjectivity — had burrowed its way into the field’s methodology more deeply than had been recognized. Typically, when researchers analyzed data, they were free to make various decisions, based on their judgment, about what data to maintain: whether it was wise, for example, to include experimental subjects whose results were really unusual or whether to exclude them; to add subjects to the sample or exclude additional subjects because of some experimental glitch. More often than not, those decisions — always seemingly justified as a way of eliminating noise — conveniently strengthened the findings’ results. The field (hardly unique in this regard) had approved those kinds of tinkering for years, underappreciating just how powerfully they skewed the results in favor of false positives, particularly if two or three analyses were underway at the same time. The three eventually wrote about this phenomenon in a paper called “False-Positive Psychology,” published in 2011. “Everyone knew it was wrong, but they thought it was wrong the way it’s wrong to jaywalk,” Simmons recently wrote in a paper taking stock of the field. “We decided to write ‘False-Positive Psychology’ when simulations revealed it was wrong the way it’s wrong to rob a bank.”

Simmons called those questionable research practices P-hacking, because researchers used them to lower a crucial measure of statistical significance known as the P-value. The P stands for probable, as in: How probable is it that researchers would happen to get the results they achieved — or even more extreme ones — if there were no phenomena, in truth, to observe? (And no systematic error.) For decades, the standard of so-called statistical significance — also the hurdle to considering a study publishable — has been a P-value of less than 5 percent.

To examine how easily the science could be manipulated, Simmons and Simonsohn ran a study in which they asked 20 participants their ages (and their fathers’ birthdays). Half the group listened to the Beatles song “When I’m Sixty-Four”; the other listened to a control (the instrumental music “Kalimba”). Using totally standard methodology common to the field, they were able to prove that the participants who listened to the Beatles song were magically a year and a half younger than they were before they had heard the music. The subject heading of the explanation: “How Bad Can It Be? A Demonstration of Chronological Rejuvenation.” It was witty, it was relatable — everyone understood that it was a critique of the fundamental soundness of the field.

“We realized entire literatures could be false positives,” Simmons says. They had collaborated with enough other researchers to recognize that the practice was widespread and counted themselves among the guilty. “I P-hacked like crazy all through my time at Princeton, and I still couldn’t get interesting results,” Simmons says.

The paper generated its fair share of attention, but it was not until January 2012, at a tense conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology in San Diego, that social psychologists began to glimpse the iceberg looming ahead — the sliding furniture, the recriminations, the crises of conscience and finger-pointing and side-taking that would follow. At the conference, several hundred academics crowded into the room to hear Simmons and his colleagues challenge the methodology of their field. First, Leslie John, then a graduate student, now an associate professor at the Harvard School of Business, presented a survey of 2,000 social psychologists that suggested that P-hacking, as well as other questionable research practices, was common. In his presentation, Simonsohn introduced a new concept, a graph that could be used to evaluate bodies of research, using the P-values of those studies (the lower the overall P-values, the better). He called it a P-curve and suggested that it could be used, for example, to evaluate the research that a prospective job candidate submitted. To some, the implication of the combined presentations seemed clear: The field was rotten with the practice, and egregious P-hackers should not get away with it.

Journal-paper presentations on statistics are usually unremarkable affairs, but this one precipitated a sequence of exchanges so public that the field had to take notice. The first took place during that event, with Norbert Schwarz, an eminent social psychologist, in the audience. Schwarz, as he listened, grew furious: He believed that the methodology of the survey was flawed, and he indignantly objected to the idea of the P-curve as a kind of litmus test aimed at individuals. He would not let these ideas go uncontested; he interrupted loudly from the front row, violating standard academic etiquette. “The whole room was like, ‘Oh, my God, what just happened?’ ” recalls Brian Nosek, a social psychologist who now runs the Center for Open Science, intended to encourage and normalize replications. Others quietly thanked Schwarz for bravely speaking up.

Not content to stop there, Schwarz followed up four days later with an open letter to 5,000 members of the society’s listserv, explaining in further detail, and with some condescension, his reservations. Although Simonsohn was angry, he still hoped to cool down the conversation. He emailed Schwarz asking if they could talk, so that they could come to a sort of understanding, in the name of science, and release a joint statement. Schwarz agreed but told Simonsohn, over the course of several email exchanges, that he needed more time. Simonsohn lost patience after three weeks: He posted large parts of the email exchange on his personal website, then posted a blistering attack on Schwarz on the society’s listserv, filled with bold caps and underlines, in which he said, among other things, that he knew firsthand that Schwarz had engaged in P-hacking.

“I regret it,” Simonsohn says now about posting the emails. Since then, Simmons, Simonsohn and Nelson say they have given a lot of thought to codes of conduct for communicating responsibly when conveying concerns about a scientist’s work. But the academic blowup between Simonsohn, then a relative unknown in social psychology, and Schwarz, the standard-bearer, signaled from the beginning that leaders on each side would ignore the norms of scientific discourse in an effort to discredit the other. One imminent shift in methods would bring another shift — one of tone — that would affect the field almost as drastically.

After 2012, questions of methodology started dominating every social-psychology conference, as did the topic of replications. Across disciplines, a basic scientific principle is that multiple teams should independently verify a result before it is accepted as true. But for the majority of social-psychology results, even the most influential ones, this hadn’t happened. Brian Nosek, who started the Reproducibility Project (now called the Center for Open Science), an effort to test 100 important social-psychology papers, said that recognition of potential flawed methodology only fueled interest in his project. “The paper shone a light on how easily things could go wrong,” Nosek says. “Knowing that possibility in concept made the Reproducibility Project a test case in some people’s mind of ‘Does it?’ ”

For years, researchers treated journal articles, and their authors, with a genteel respect; even in the rare cases where a new study explicitly contradicted an old one, the community assumed that a lab error must account for the discrepancy. There was no incentive to replicate, in any case: Journals were largely not interested in studies that had already been done, and failed replications made people (maybe even your adviser) uncomfortable.

But in the years after that Society of Personality and Social Psychology conference, a sense of urgency propelled a generation of researchers, most of them under 40, to re-examine the work of other, more established researchers. And politeness was no longer a priority. “All of a sudden you have people emailing other people, asking for their data and then writing blog posts accusing them of shoddy practices,” says Eli Finkel, a social psychologist at Northwestern. “That was unheard-of. Now it was happening all the time.” Some blog posts took on the impact of journal articles, as interested parties weighed in with an impromptu peer review. In 2014, Psychological Science started giving electronic badges, an extra seal of approval, to studies that made their data and methodologies publicly available and preregistered their design and analysis ahead of time, so that researchers could not fish around for a new hypothesis if they turned up some unexpected findings.

Not surprisingly, replicators sometimes encountered the kind of outraged resistance that Simmons and Simonsohn initially did. The same month that Simmons and Simonsohn gave their talk, Stéphane Doyen, a social psychologist in Belgium, published a paper challenging a classic study in the field of priming, which holds that small cues, like exposure to certain words, can subconsciously trigger behaviors. The original study found that research subjects walked more slowly after being exposed to words associated with old age; the replicators found no such effect and titled their journal article “Behavioral Priming: It’s All in the Mind; but Whose Mind?” John Bargh, a professor at Yale, a luminary who published the original study, responded with a combative post on Psychology Today’s blog, claiming that discrepancies in the experiment design accounted for the difference and calling the researchers “incompetent or ill informed.” When other priming studies failed to replicate later that year, the Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, who discussed priming in his book “Thinking Fast and Slow,” wrote a letter to social psychologists who studied the effect, urging them to turn their attitude around. “To deal effectively with the doubts, you should acknowledge their existence and confront them straight on,” he wrote.

The intention of replicators was now unassailably noble — who could argue with better science? — but there was also, for the first time, status to be found in topplings, as journals started publishing more replications, many of which received lavish press attention. It was also inevitable that those being challenged would read envy into their attackers’ motivations. (In a tweet, Gilbert described those he deemed the worst offenders as “shameless little bullies.”)

Jay Van Bavel, a social psychologist at New York University, has tweeted openly about a published nonreplication of one of his studies and believes, as any scientist would, that replications are an essential part of the process; nonetheless, he found the experience of being replicated painful. “It is terrifying, even if it’s fair and within normal scientific bounds,” he says. “Because of social media and how it travels — you get pile-ons when the critique comes out, and 50 people share it in the view of thousands. That’s horrifying for anyone who’s critiqued, even if it’s legitimate.”

The field, clearly, was not moving forward as one. “In the beginning, I thought it was all ridiculous,” says Finkel, who told me it took him a few years before he appreciated the importance of what became known as the replication movement. “It was like we had been having a big party — what big, new, fun, cool stuff can we discover? And we forgot to double-check ourselves. And then the reformers were annoyed, because they felt like they had to come in after the fact and clean up after us. And it was true.”

In August 2014, the day before her second marriage, Amy Cuddy learned that a replication of her 2010 study led by a 34-year-old economist at the University of Zurich named Eva Ranehill had failed to yield the same results. “I remember thinking, Oh, bummer,” Cuddy says. But she was not distraught; often there was some perfectly good reason for a discrepancy in two studies of the same concept.

There were several key differences — Ranehill’s sample size, at 200, was much bigger, and she had designed a double-blind setup. Ranehill had her subjects hold two poses for three minutes each. She did not find an increase in either risk-taking behavior or the expected hormone changes.

Cuddy thought it was likely that the difference in time — six minutes of standing versus two — was a crucial one and probably accounted for the disparity in the results. “It’s not a crazy thing to test,” Cuddy says. “I guess under the theory that more is better? But it could go the other way — three minutes is a really, really long time to be holding a pose like that. It seems likely to me that it would be really uncomfortable, but sure, study it, and let’s see.”

She was relieved to see that the “feelings of power” finding had replicated. But Ranehill used language in her write-up that played down that finding’s importance. Although in one study of her own, Cuddy also played down the finding, she has otherwise consistently, in interviews, been enthusiastic about the idea that a body posture could change someone’s feelings. “We’re psychologists,” she says. “We try to change how people feel.” She also, at the time of the Ranehill replication, still anticipated that other research would probably show downstream effects — more risk taking, or more competitiveness, or better performance in job interviews.

By the time Cuddy got word of Ranehill’s replication, she had given her TED talk, developed a significant speaking career and was writing a book. Simmons had received tenure at Wharton and was writing, with Simonsohn, a blog called Data Colada, in which they sometimes tried to replicate other people’s work. By 2014, there was near-unanimous agreement the Data Colada team had profoundly changed the field’s research techniques for the better. But for the average researcher, an email from someone at Data Colada signaled unpleasantness ahead. “It’s like the police knocking on your door in the middle of the night,” one psychologist said.

In the wake of Ranehill’s failed replication, Cuddy and Carney set to work on a response. Carney, who is now a tenured associate professor of management at the University of California, Berkeley, tried to chart a P-curve of all 33 studies they were mentioning in their paper (which was already under review). Carney sent the paper and the P-curve to Nelson for some feedback, but he sent it on to Simmons and Simonsohn, as they were the experts.

The letter Simmons wrote back to Carney was polite, but he argued that her P-curve had not been executed correctly. He and Simonsohn had each executed P-curves of the 33 studies, and each found that it was flat, suggesting that the body of literature it reflected did not count as strong evidence. He did write that “conceptual points raised before that section are useful and contribute to the debate” but that they should take the P-curve out. “Everybody wins in that case.” According to Cuddy, she and Carney thought the P-curve science was not as settled as Simmons believed it to be. But afraid of public recrimination, they did exactly as he said — they took out the P-curve.

A few weeks after the paper was published, Cuddy learned from Simmons and Simonsohn that they were writing a blog post on the paper. A mutual friend of Cuddy and Simmons’s from graduate school, Kenworthey Bilz, a professor of law at the University of Illinois, tried to reassure Cuddy. “He’ll say his piece, and you’ll say yours, and that will be the end of it,” Bilz told Cuddy. “It’s not like you’re going to become the poster girl for this kind of thing.”

Cuddy was at her home office in Boston when she received an email from Simmons and Simonsohn. They showed her a draft of the post they planned to put online criticizing the paper; they invited feedback on anything the authors felt was incorrect or unfair. “We embrace trying to be as civil as possible but understanding that at some point you are going to say, ‘You were wrong,’ ” Simonsohn said. “People won’t like that, no matter how you much you dress it up. It’s not something people want to hear.”

The post criticized the new paper, as well as the 2010 study. It showed Simmons and Simonsohn’s own unfavorable P-curve and essentially argued that the original published findings on hormones and risk-taking were probably a result of chance. They did not include a feelings-of-power measure in the P-curve they showed. But the blog post did mention in its last footnote that there was a significant effect of power posing on “self-reported power,” although the language made it clear that it didn’t count for much: Simmons believes that self-reports of power generally reflect what is called a demand effect — a result that occurs when subjects intuit the point of the study. Cuddy believes that studies can be constructed to minimize that risk and that demand effects are often nuanced.

Cuddy responded to Simonsohn with a few points that they incorporated into the post but said she preferred to write a longer response in a context in which she felt more comfortable.

Cuddy felt ill when Simmons and Simonsohn published the post with the headline: “Reassessing the Evidence Behind the Most Popular TED Talk.” As illustration, they used a picture of Wonder Woman. Cuddy felt as if Simmons had set them up; that they included her TED talk in the headline made it feel personal, as if they were going after her rather than the work.

The post, which Simonsohn distributed to his email list of hundreds, quickly made the rounds. “People were sending me emails like I was dying of cancer,” Cuddy says. “It was like, ‘We send our condolences,’ ‘Holy crap, this is terrible’ and ‘God bless you; we wish we could do something, but obviously we can’t.’ ” She also knew what was coming, a series of events that did, in fact, transpire over time: subsequent scrutiny of other studies she had published, insulting commentary about her work on the field’s Facebook groups, disdainful headlines about the flimsiness of her research. She paced around, distraught, afraid to look at her email, afraid not to. She had just put together a tenure package and worried that the dust-up would be a continuing distraction.

Cuddy did not like seeing her work criticized in a non-peer-reviewed format, but she wrote a bland statement saying, essentially, that she disagreed with their findings and looked forward to “more progress on this important topic.” Carney reassured Cuddy in the months after the Data Colada post that their paper would eventually be vindicated — of course the effects were real; someone would prove it eventually.

Eventually, the Data Colada post caught the eye of another influential blogger, Andrew Gelman, a professor of statistics and political science at Columbia University, whose interest in Cuddy’s work would prove durable, exacting and possibly career-changing for Cuddy. Gelman wields his sizable influence on the field from afar, on his popular blog andrewgelman.com, where he posts his thoughts on best statistical practices in the sciences, with a frequent emphasis on what he sees as the absurd and unscientific. Gelman, who studied math and physics at M.I.T. before turning to statistics, does not believe that social psychology is any more guilty of P-hacking than, say, biology or economics. But he has devoted extensive attention to the field, especially in more recent years, in part because of the way the media has glorified social-psychology research. He is respected enough that his posts are well read; he is cutting enough that many of his critiques are enjoyed with a strong sense of schadenfreude.

Four months after the Data Colada post, Gelman, with a co-author, published an article in Slate about Carney and Cuddy’s 2010 study, calling it “tabloid fodder.” Eventually, Cuddy’s name began appearing regularly in the blog, both in his posts and in comments. Gelman’s writing on Cuddy’s study was coolly dismissive; it bothered him that Cuddy remained fairly silent on the replication and the Data Colada post. For all he knew, Cuddy was still selling the hormone effect in her speaking gigs and in her best-selling book, “Presence,” which he had not read. Had he looked, he would have been annoyed to see that Cuddy did not include a mention of the Ranehill replication. But he might have been surprised to see how little of the book focused on power posing (just a few pages).

On his site, Cuddy’s name, far from the only one he repeatedly invoked, became a go-to synecdoche for faulty science writ large. When he saw that Cuddy had been invited to speak at a conference, he wondered why the organizers had not invited a bunch of other famous figures he clearly considered bad for science, including Diederik Stapel, who had been accused of outright fraud.

His site became a home for frequently hostile comments from his followers. “She has no serious conception of ‘science,’ ” one posted. Another compared Cuddy to Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos chief executive under investigation for misleading investors. Though Gelman did encourage his readers to stick to the science, he rarely reined anyone in. In one exchange in July 2016, a commenter wrote, “I’ve wondered whether some of Amy Cuddy’s mistakes are due to the fact that she suffered severe head trauma as the result of a car accident some years ago.” Gelman replied, “A head injury hardly seems necessary to explain these mistakes,” pointing out that her adviser, Fiske, whom he has also criticized, had no such injury but made similar errors.

Gelman, whom I met in his office in late June, is not scathing in person; he is rather mild, soft-spoken even. Gelman was vague when asked if he felt there was anything unusual about the frequency of his comments on Cuddy (“People send me things, and I respond,” he said). He said it was Cuddy who was unrelenting. He later emailed me to make sure I was aware that she attacked him and Simmons and Simonsohn on a private Facebook page, without backing up her accusations with evidence; he was still waiting for a clear renunciation of the original 2010 paper on the hormonal effects of power posing. “I would like her to say: ‘Jeez, I didn’t know any better. I was doing what they told me to do. I don’t think I’m a bad person, and it didn’t get replicated’ — rather than salvaging as much as she can.”

Gelman considers himself someone who is doing others the favor of pointing out their errors, a service for which he would be grateful, he says. Cuddy considers him a bully, someone who does not believe that she is entitled to her own interpretation of the research that is her field of expertise.

Cuddy has asked herself what motivates Gelman. “Why not help social psychologists instead of attacking them on your blog?” she wondered aloud to me. “Why not come to a conference or hold a seminar?” When I asked Gelman if he would ever consider meeting with Cuddy to hash out their differences, he seemed put off by the idea of trying to persuade her, in person, that there were flaws in her work.

“I don’t like interpersonal conflict,” he said.

On Sept. 26, 2016, Amy Cuddy woke up and checked her phone to find a chilling text from a friend. “I’m so sorry,” it said. “Are you O.K.?” She felt a familiar dread, something closer to panic. For the past year, she had mostly stopped going to social-psychology conferences, feeling a chill from her community. Another social psychologist had told her that a graduate student asked if she really was friends with Cuddy. When she responded, “Yes,” the young woman asked, “Why?”

It was the kind of information Cuddy wished she did not have; her closest friends were told to stop passing on or commenting about that kind of thing, but acquaintances still did it. She felt adrift in her field. She worried about asking peers to collaborate, suspecting that they would not want to set themselves up for intense scrutiny. And she felt betrayed, not just by those who cut her down on social media, in blog posts, even in reviews (one reviewer called her “a profiteer,” not hiding his contempt), but also by some of those who did not publicly defend her. She was not wrong to think that at least in some cases, it was fear, rather than lack of support for her, that kept people from speaking up. Two tenured psychology professors at Ivy League universities acknowledged to me that they would have publicly defended some of Cuddy’s positions were they not worried about making themselves targets on Data Colada and elsewhere.

Two days before Cuddy received that text from a friend, Gelman once again posted about the power-posing research, but this time he issued a challenge to Dana Carney. “When people screw up or cheat in their research, what do their collaborators say?” he wondered in the post. For Carney, he wrote, “it was not too late.” Unknown to Cuddy and Gelman, Carney had already linked, in her C.V., to Simmon and Simonsohn’s critique of that first, influential 2010 study, but she hadn’t made the kind of statement or gesture that Gelman expected from Cuddy.

That morning of the troubling text, Cuddy logged onto her computer and discovered that Carney had posted on her website a document (then quickly published on New York magazine’s site) that seemed intended to distance its author forever, in every way, from power posing. “I do not believe that ‘power pose’ effects are real,” she said. Not only had she stopped studying power poses, “I discourage others from studying power poses.”

She listed a number of methodological concerns she had, in retrospect, about the 2010 paper, most of which, Cuddy says, Carney had never raised with her. In an email a few months earlier, Carney had clearly told Cuddy that she thought the study’s data was flimsy, the sample was tiny, the effects were barely there. But Cuddy said she had never received notice that this kind of renunciation was coming. Carney declined to comment for this article, but Nelson, who is in her department, said she was clearly in a tough position, saddled with all the negatives of the work — the hit to her reputation — with none of the upside: the speaking fees and the positive feedback from teary fans who no doubt fuel Cuddy’s conviction in the research.

For much of the scientific world, Carney’s statement was an act of integrity and bravery. “Whoa! This is how to do it!” tweeted Michael Inzlicht, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Toronto who had eloquently written about his own crisis of confidence about his field of research, ego depletion.

To Cuddy, Carney’s post seemed so sweeping as to be vague, self-abnegating. Even Simonsohn, who made clear his support for Carney’s decision, thought the letter had a strangely unscientific vehemence to it. “If I do a bad job proving there’s a ninth planet, I probably shouldn’t say there’s a ninth planet,” he says. “But I shouldn’t say there is no ninth planet, either. You should just ignore the bad study and go back to base line.”

Cuddy wrote a lengthy response to Carney that New York magazine published. (New York, Slate and The Atlantic have closely reported on the replication movement.) Then she stopped taking phone calls and went almost completely offline. She found that she couldn’t eat; at 5-foot-5, Cuddy went down to 100 pounds.

Less than two weeks after Carney’s disavowal, Cuddy got on a plane so she could meet her commitment to speak to a crowd of 10,000 in Las Vegas. As frail as she had been since her accident, she headed to an arena in Las Vegas and roused the crowd, a tiny woman on a giant stage, taking up space, making herself big, feeling the relief of feeling powerful.

When I emailed Joe Simmons in July and asked to meet with him, he readily agreed but warned me that he does not check his email often. “I had to take email off my phone,” he explained when we met at a coffee shop across the river from Wharton. A lot of his work these days was stressful — sometimes the emailer was angry, sometimes he was — so if he looked at his phone before bed, “that was it — I wouldn’t sleep all night.”

When Simmons and I met, I asked him why he eventually wrote such a damning blog post, when his initial correspondence with Carney did not seem particularly discouraging. He and Simonsohn, he told me, had clearly explained to Cuddy and Carney that the supporting studies they cited were problematic as a body of work — and yet all the researchers did was drop the visual graph, as if deliberately sidestepping the issue. They left in the body of literature that Simmons and Simonsohn’s P-curve discredited. That apparent disregard for contrary evidence was, Simmons said, partly what prompted them to publish the harsh blog post in the first place.

But the email that Simmons and Simonsohn had sent was, in fact, ambiguous: They had explicitly told her to drop the P-curve and yet left the impression that the paper was otherwise sound. At my request, Simmons looked back at his original email. I watched as he read it over. “Oh, yeah,” he said quietly. He had a pained look on his face. “We did say to drop the graph, didn’t we?” He read it over again, then sat back. “I didn’t remember that. This may be a big misunderstanding about — that email is too polite.”

Cuddy and Carney had taken their advice literally. Simmons stood by his analysis but recognized that there was confusion at play in how they interpreted the events that transpired. Simmons says he harbored no ill will toward Cuddy before criticizing her paper; if anything, he remembered her warmly. “She was great,” he said, smiling at the memory. “We published the blog post despite my history with Amy. Because I realized that once we pulled the trigger on this. … ” He did not finish the sentence. Cuddy had, in fact, become the poster girl for this kind of work, which even he thought was not fair. “The original study wasn’t particularly egregious,” he said. “It was published in 2010 before anyone was thinking about this.”

For a moment, the scientist allowed the human element to factor into how he felt about his email response to that paper. “I wish,” he said, “I’d had the presence of mind to pick up the phone and call Amy.”

The public nature of the attacks against Cuddy have reverberated among social psychologists, raising questions about the effects of harsh discourse on the field and particularly on women. Earlier this year at the conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology, there was a presentation of a 2016 survey of 700 social psychologists, assessing their perceptions of the influence of social media on their careers. The subsequent conversation on popular Facebook groups was so combative that Alison Ledgerwood, a social psychologist at the University of California, Davis, felt the need to respond in a blog post. In it, she argued that if scientists keep having hostile conversations on social media, women are more likely to be driven away from the field. (Women in the profession, the survey presented at the conference reported, participated less than their male colleagues in social-media discussions.)

Even people who believe that the methodological reforms are essential say its costs to science are real. “It’s become like politics — we’ve created two camps of people who shouldn’t be in two camps in the first place,” says Jay Van Bavel, the social psychologist at N.Y.U. “It’s perceived slights and defensiveness, and everybody has some history or grievance — and it will never end because there is that history of perceived grievances, of one of your colleagues who has been put through it, or criticized your friend in a public forum. It’s terrible for science. It’s not good.”

If Amy Cuddy is a victim, she may not seem an obvious one: She has real power, a best-selling book, a thriving speaking career. She did not own up fully to problems in her research or try to replicate her own study. (She says there were real hurdles to doing so, not least of which was finding a collaborator to take that on.) But many of her peers told me that she did not deserve the level of widespread and sometimes vicious criticism she has endured. “Amy has been the target of mockery and meanness on Facebook, on Twitter, in blog posts — I feel like, Wow, I have never seen that in science,” Van Bavel says. “I’ve only been in it for 15 years, but I’ve never seen public humiliation like that.”

As a result, the breadth of the accusations — how diffuse they are — could easily be mistaken for the depth of her scientific missteps, which at the outset were no different from those of so many of her peers. “We were all being trained to simplify, to get our message out there — there were conferences and panels on how to do it,” says Richard Petty, a social psychologist at Ohio State. “One of the ironies is that Amy just did it more successfully.”

I was surprised to find that some of the leaders in the replication movement were not Cuddy’s harshest critics but spoke of her right to defend her work in more measured tones. “Why does everyone care so much about what Amy says?” Brian Nosek says. “Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself. Leif Nelson, one of the three pioneers of the movement, says Cuddy is no different from most other scientists in her loyalty to her data. “Authors love their findings,” he says. “And you can defend almost anything — that’s the norm of science, not just in psychology.” He still considers Cuddy a “very serious psychologist”; he also believes the 2010 paper “is a bunch of nonsense.” But he says, “It does not strike me as at all notable that Amy would defend her work. Most people do.”

Every researcher has a threshold at which he or she is convinced of the evidence; in social psychology, especially, there is no such thing as absolute proof, only measures of probability. In recent months, Cuddy reached the threshold needed to alter her thinking on the effect of hormones. She mentioned, at a psychology conference where she was presenting her work, that a study had recently been conducted on power posing. “They found no hormonal effects,” she said before taking a breath. “That study is done very well, and I trust those results.” Although 11 new papers have recently been published that do not show the downstream effects of power posing on behaviors, Cuddy is still fighting for power posing. The research, she says, still shows its effect on feelings of power: At the conference, she presented a comprehensive meta-analysis, a version of which, she says, she will soon publish, with a strong P-curve supporting that, and she also presented a P-curve suggesting that power posing had a robust effect on self-evaluations, emotions and moods.

Cuddy now seems ready to move on to a new phase. We met near her home in Newton, Mass., in August. Cuddy, smiling, fresh from physical therapy for a torn ACL, was in a tennis skirt, looking young and more lighthearted than I had ever seen her. She had abandoned the dream of tenure. She was planning a new project, a new book, she told me. It was coming together in her mind: “Bullies, Bystanders and Bravehearts.” It would be personal; there would be research; she would write, and she would talk, and she would interview people who had suffered fates worse than her own and bounced back. She would tell their stories and hers, and because she is a good talker, people would listen.",When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html

LOS ANGELES — A sassy church lady, a group of elite firefighters, an alcoholic detective, some do-gooder Texans and a renegade scientific genius walked into multiplexes on Friday.

Only one grabbed the attention of ticket buyers.

“Tyler Perry’s Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,” with Mr. Perry reprising his gun-toting, moralizing granny, took in about $21.7 million at North American theaters over the weekend. That total gave Mr. Perry his sixth No. 1 opening, bolstering his status as one of the most reliable crowd pullers in moviedom. Even so, initial ticket sales for “Boo 2” (Lionsgate) fell 24 percent behind those for “Boo! A Madea Halloween” last year. “Boo 2” cost roughly $24 million to make.

Ticket sales were terrible for the other newcomers — “Geostorm,” “Only the Brave,” “The Snowman” and “Same Kind of Different as Me” — adding to worries that moviegoing is falling out of fashion, as Americans curl up at home with their Netflix accounts. On the other hand, all of those films but one, “Only the Brave,” a dramatization of a wildfire that killed 19 responders, received abysmal reviews.

“Geostorm” (Warner Bros.) was second for the weekend, taking in an estimated $13.3 million, a failing total for a film that cost roughly $130 million to make, not including tens of millions of dollars in marketing costs, and was released in 3,246 theaters. “Geostorm,” starring Gerard Butler as a scientist racing to save the planet from environmental destruction, likely suffered from a sense of been-there, done-that, coming across as another “The Day After Tomorrow.”

“Geostorm” was cofinanced by Skydance Media, a company founded by the Oracle heir David Ellison.

Next among the newcomers was “Only the Brave,” which collected about $6 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Black Label Media, a company co-founded by the FedEx heiress Molly Smith, spent about $38 million to make this firefighter drama, which was distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment. (It has been a bad month for the FedEx family at the movies: Alcon, backed by Ms. Smith’s father, Fred Smith, had a major box office misfire with “Blade Runner 2049.”)

Tricky Clues

1A: “Agcy. for Kennedy and Reagan” is TSA because the clue is referring to the airports, not the presidents after which they are named.

28A: PREGGERS makes its New York Times crossword debut today, clued as “With child, informally.”

122A: This was too good to pass up. At first, I thought these were the kind of chocolate cups you make using a balloon and melted chocolate, but it turns out that we’re talking about the universe’s gift to personkind, the REESE’s peanut butter cup. And the man who first got peanut butter in his chocolate was H.B. REESE. I made sure to indulge in a few of these cups, just to make absolutely sure they were still a thing. No need to thank me. I’m happy to do the research so you don’t have to.

11D: A pun that rhymes. “Divine bovine?” is a SACRED COW.

39D: I think this clue is a nod to Brendan Emmett Quigley’s 2001 debut of the entry “WHY, YOU LITTLE ...” and it’s a great one. The answer, “SON OF A ...,” is also fairly unique, as it was used once in a 1965 puzzle as a fill-in-the-blank clue referring to a biblical quote.

43D: Clue of the Day, in my opinion. “Several quarter turns?” does not refer to actually turning something manually or screwing something in. It refers to the action of a COIN TOSS, when a quarter is turning in the air. I love visually evocative clues like that.

80D: A “System of roots?” sounds on the surface like it refers to a plant. Today it refers to ETYMOLOGY, the study of the origins of words, their roots, and how language has changed over time.

Constructor Notes

Erik Agard: Music and wordplay are but two of Alex’s superpowers (you can see some of her punny drawings on her Instagram), so when this puzzle’s then-half-formed theme needed rescuing, I knew who to shine the Bat Signal for. Through a couple revisions and upwards of a hundred emails, the collaboration was always fun, and I’m looking forward to her next puzzle. Alex Briñas: Erik was the true superhero here — he zipped nimbly through the bulk of the work and picked up after all my snafus. I’m a super-newbie to everything in the crossword world, but I do enjoy myself a good pun every now and then, so this was fascinating and foreign and exciting and daunting all at once. And I owe much thanks to Erik for inviting me to sidekick this mission in the first place. For your enjoyment (we hope), here are some of the theme answers from the cutting room floor: [Human Torch’s favorite band?] (3,7,4) [Blade’s favorite band?] (7,7) [Wonder Twins’ favorite band?] (5) [Storm’s favorite rapper?] (6) [Beast’s favorite singer?] (6) [Wolverine’s favorite guitarist?] (5) [Lady Deathstrike’s favorite band?] (13) [Banshee’s favorite band?] (5,5)

Robert Lee de Zafra was born on Feb. 15, 1932, in Scarsdale, N.Y., and grew up there and in New Milford, Conn. His father, Carlos, was an engineering professor at New York University, and his mother, Ellen Knox, was a seamstress in a design house.

The ozone hole, a seasonal thinning of the ozone layer in the atmosphere over Antarctica that allows harmful ultraviolet rays to reach the Earth’s surface, had recently been detected, but whether it was a natural phenomenon or caused by human activity remained under debate.

Dr. de Zafra and other researchers, led by Susan Solomon of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, were able to confirm that chlorofluorocarbons, used in refrigerants and as propellants in aerosol cans, were causing chemical reactions in the atmosphere that depleted ozone.

“Bob and his colleagues were the first to measure chlorine monoxide in the region of the ozone hole over Antarctica in 1986,” Dr. Solomon, now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an email. “They showed that this chemical was present in much larger amounts than at other latitudes, and this and subsequent work firmly established that the ozone hole is due to human production of chlorofluorocarbon chemicals.

“These chemicals are now no longer produced anywhere in the world,” she added, “and the Antarctic ozone hole is expected to heal slowly over the next 50 years or so. Bob’s work was key in helping save the planet’s ozone layer.”

Louisa Emmons, now a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, was one of Dr. de Zafra’s graduate students then and made three trips to McMurdo with him, as well as joining him for field work in Hawaii and Greenland.

“Bob always loved those expeditions as an opportunity to focus on making measurements and figuring out what those observations told us about how the atmosphere worked,” Dr. Emmons said by email. He put in long hours, she said, but also liked to explore the exotic locales with students and other colleagues, hiking up the steep Observation Hill next to the McMurdo Station or cross-country skiing out on the ice shelf.

Among the honors and accolades accumulated by Dr. de Zafra over the years was an unusual one: In 1999 — Ms. Atwell thought it might have been a sort of retirement present — a ridge in the Cook Mountains of Antarctica was named after him by the United States Board of Geographic Names.

Dr. de Zafra’s first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Julia M. Phillips-Quagliata, whom he married in 1981.

Dr. de Zafra had bought and renovated two historic buildings in Setauket — one was his home — and in recent years had purchased a third, which he was still rehabilitating at his death. He served on various civic boards and was a leader in preserving the history of the Setauket area. The area’s claims to fame include being the center of the Culper spy ring, which George Washington deployed against the British and which was the subject of the recently concluded AMC series “Turn.”

Mr. Englebright said that just as Dr. de Zafra had helped sound the alarm on ozone depletion, he had also alerted him and many others to preservation issues.

The thought experiment’s framing, however, circumvented my usual concerns about unjust sanctions. I know what my rapist did to me, so I know he is guilty. Worries about the inhumanity of capital punishment were also blunted in part because this was purely hypothetical and in part because of the inhumanity he exhibited those long years with his penchant for violence.

Although the death sentence seemed wholly appropriate, I still considered how I would feel if a judge gave my rapist a less severe punishment: a natural life sentence — a life sentence with no chance for parole without a successful appeal.

After reporting back to my therapist, she offered another thought experiment. “What if,” she said, “your rapist had been sentenced to death, but then had been pardoned?” I did not have to mull this question over. I knew I would feel exactly as I do now, exactly as I have felt for the past two decades: that the world is a terribly unjust place. It is a place where my life can be irrevocably transformed because a man could exert control, manipulation and violence over me for years without repercussion. It is a place where my rapist and others like him are enabled at both societal and local levels. His mother, for example, simply told us to quiet down whenever she heard my screams — a response as horrifying as it is understandable given the many ways society tolerates violence against women.

A hypothetical pardon would allow him to escape repercussions just as he has escaped them in reality. Nearly 20 years later as I began trauma therapy again, he has a secure job, an accomplished and beautiful wife, and a healthy daughter. He is living a life many dream of, while my life is disrupted as I continue to heal from the wounds he inflicted when I was a child. E.M.D.R. begins with the choice of reliving either the earliest traumatic memory or the most painful, rendering it as harrowing as it is effective; E.M.D.R. is not for the faint of heart.

IN FEBRUARY 2016 — only weeks after the thought experiments with my therapist — the philosopher Jennifer Lackey published an opinion piece in The Stone. In the article, she uses her experience teaching philosophy to inmates to argue for the irrationality of natural life sentences. Lackey bases her argument against natural life sentences on two reasonable claims: (1) people (criminals, specifically) can and do change in profoundly transformative ways, and (2) we cannot know the future.

For Lackey, the fact that we have good statistical evidence that criminals can and do change is especially problematic given our vast epistemic limitations regarding the future. “Natural life sentences,” she wrote, “say to all involved that there is no possible piece of information that could be learned between sentencing and death that could bear in any way on the punishment the convicted is said to deserve, short of what might ground an appeal.”Citing the possibility of prisoner transformation, Lackey then puts her question about rationality directly: “How is it rational,” she asks, “to screen off the relevance of this information? How, that is, is it rational to say today that there can be no possible evidence in the future that could bear on the punishment that a decades-from-now prisoner deserves?”

Natural life sentences, Lackey notices, are a “glaring exception” to the way we think about rational decision making in other contexts. Natural life sentences “permit binding, life-altering decisions to be made in a state of radical epistemic impoverishment.”

Lackey’s argument strongly suggests that transformation is an exceedingly important consideration for sentencing. This is not an alien notion; the criminal justice system often takes good behavior and contrition as evidence of transformation that is relevant to one’s sentence. This occurs not just under the direction of theories that value rehabilitation, but in all but the “crudest forms of retributive justice.” Rehabilitation, then, is one aspect that many believe separates crude justice theories from other, presumably better, justice theories.

I read Lackey’s article very soon after the thought experiments with my therapist. I noticed that Lackey’s argument easily applied to the death penalty, and I realized that the sentences I desired for my rapist were precisely the ones Lackey condemns as irrational. Since nothing in her argument prevented me from applying her logic to my own desires, I had to wonder if her argument also concluded that I was irrational for desiring permanent punishments. If it is irrational for the state to prescribe a permanent punishment given our epistemic limitations and prisoners’ likelihood for change, wouldn’t it be similarly irrational for victims to ignore these considerations?

There are, of course, crucial differences between victim’s desires and punishments carried out by the state. While sometimes the criminal justice system considers the wishes of victims and their families, the criminal justice system’s central aim is to protect the interests of the state and the community. This aim does not always coincide with the interests or wishes of the victim. Admittedly, there are often very good reasons for the state to ignore the wishes of victims. But my concern is less about what the state should do in practice and more about what arguments that prioritize transformation say about victims who desire permanent punishments.

Here I will be blunt: it matters very little to me whether my rapist is transformed at some point in his life. It matters to me only to the extent that I will readily agree that it would be better if he became the sort of person who did not inflict violence upon others. I would be very happy hearing that no other women would be harmed by him. But in terms of the punishment that he deserves? Transformation does not matter to me. And this is not irrational: There are many carefully considered reasons one might want a natural life sentence for perpetrators of egregious and irrevocable harm.

Desiring death or a natural life sentence for those who inflict traumatic violence is a rational response because whether or not my particular rapist transforms is irrelevant to whether or not I will ever have the chance to be the sort of person I might have been. His transformation is irrelevant to whether or not I will be able to live the sort of life I could have were it not for the injustice done to me. I desire a death or natural life sentence for my rapist because that is what seems appropriate given the amount of damage he wrought in my life.

Rape is itself a transformative experience. I will never be the same, and I have no idea how my life might have been different without the experience. My rapist expertly dismantled my sense of self as he isolated me from friends and family. He manipulated me so that he could more effectively inflict violence and exert power and control over me. I know that I have suffered, that I have struggled, and that I might not have survived. I’ve read about the neurological effects of prolonged trauma, and I know that I am now — and perhaps always will be — affected in some capacity by the things he did to me. After plenty of rational consideration, I cannot imagine any personal transformation that would make me think he deserves anything less than a permanent punishment.

In response, one might call my stance a crude form of retributive justice. Perhaps it is. I know that expressing desire for retribution is a risky move in its unpopularity. Social narratives have long praised forgiveness and love especially for those who have wronged us. Theories of justice have also moved beyond ones that emphasize retribution — and for good reason in many cases. I understand this perspective: For many years it was abhorrent for me to think of responding to the violence I suffered with more violence. But calling the desire for permanent punishment crude does not render it irrational however unpopular it might be.

One might, in the end, respond by saying that arguments like Lackey’s are proposing only policy change. These arguments, we might say, are not meant to prescribe the appropriate feelings for victims. If so, we might think that my worries about what arguments can say to individual victims is off the mark. While it’s clear that policy change can be a central aim, audiences of such arguments include victims of traumatic crimes. Yet it is not clear that such arguments always take victims into account.

Although my attitude is in no way representative of all victims, epistemic arguments that prioritize criminal transformation must contend with the implication that they can be used to paint trauma victims irrational when they desire retribution.

It’s certainly important to advocate for prisoners who are wrongly incarcerated and for those who were victims of the overzealous war on crime era. The injustices in our criminal justice system are too numerous and too serious to ignore. But criminal justice reform should not be so myopic that it compounds trauma survivors’ victimization. Those who manage to survive traumatic crimes have enough to battle without arguments that undermine their rational considerations. Advocates for criminal justice reform can, and should, do better.",Is There a ‘Rational’ Punishment for My Rapist?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/opinion/rape-punishment-rational.html

“The American people deserve a public investigation,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, noting that the Judiciary Committee could work more publicly than the intelligence panels.","Nine months into the Trump administration, any notion that Capitol Hill would provide a comprehensive, authoritative and bipartisan accounting of the extraordinary efforts of a hostile power to disrupt American democracy appears to be dwindling.

“Congressional investigations unfortunately are usually overtly political investigations, where it is to one side’s advantage to drag things out,” said Mr. Gowdy, who made his name in Congress as a fearsome investigator of Democrats. He added, “The notion that one side is playing the part of defense attorney and that the other side is just these white hat defenders of the truth is laughable.”

Instead, he said, he is looking to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, to conduct an apolitical investigation.

None of the challenges have thus far stopped the committees. And given the closed-door nature of their work, prominent new avenues of inquiry could always emerge, such as Russia’s use of social media to sow chaos and discord, capable of influencing the public discourse.

But all three are up against a ticking clock, with Republicans in both chambers eager to wrap up the investigations before too long.

Particularly in the House, partisan fighting is likely to undermine whatever conclusions the committee reaches. One lawmaker said the committee would probably produce two reports. The first, written by Republicans, is expected to forcefully say there is no proof that anyone around Mr. Trump worked with Russia to tip the election. A Democratic report will probably raise unanswered questions and say that the committee was never fully committed to answering them.

The panel has been on rocky ground for months, with much of the controversy surrounding the committee’s chairman, Representative Devin Nunes of California. Mr. Nunes was forced to step aside from leading the investigation in April after it was disclosed that he had received classified information from the White House that showed that Mr. Trump and his associates were incidentally swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies.

Mr. Nunes handed control to three of the committee’s Republicans, Representatives K. Michael Conaway of Texas, Tom Rooney of Florida and Mr. Gowdy. Mr. Conaway, a well-liked accountant, helped put the investigation back on track and has maintained a productive relationship with Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the panel’s top Democrat.

But Democrats say Mr. Nunes, whose signature is required to issue subpoenas, has continued to meddle around the edges of the investigation, driving Republican inquiries into who financed a dossier of unsubstantiated information on purported links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr. Nunes, they say, is also participating in an investigation into the revealing of Trump associates caught up in American surveillance by Obama administration officials.

“Frankly, I have been doing everything I can to try to get us to do a credible investigation and to reach a common conclusion,” Mr. Schiff said. “I view these things as obstacles that are in the way to overcome, and I am doing my best to overcome them almost daily.”

A spokesman for Mr. Nunes did not reply to a request for comment.

Democrats were also incensed by Mr. Gowdy’s remarks to Mr. Kushner in July, which they said were representative of efforts by some Republicans to cut the investigation short. Shortly after the meeting, Mr. Schiff publicly accused Mr. Gowdy of playing defense attorney for the administration.

Republicans have returned the biting words, sharply criticizing Mr. Schiff, whose frequent television appearances irk them. Mr. Rooney used a vulgarity when he called Mr. Schiff’s comments about the Kushner interview nonsense. And Mr. Gowdy said on Friday that he had been compelled to weigh in by the Democrats’ repetitive and meandering questions — and that a transcript would show his own questions to have been appropriately aggressive.

The Republican said it had become clear where the committee was headed.

“Will our private conclusions be the same? Yes,” Mr. Gowdy said. “Will our public pronouncements be the same? No, of course not.”

“This is politics,” he added.

Across Capitol Hill, the tone has been different. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and its top Democrat, Mark Warner of Virginia, have worked to project a collaborative rapport that committee members insist is real.

At a rare news conference this month, the two senators said they had already expended significant resources verifying the conclusions of America’s spy agencies about Russia’s efforts to meddle in the election and were now taking steps to better understand its use of social media campaigns and to investigate the collusion question.

“At the end of the day, what we owe the American people is the truth,” Mr. Warner said in an interview on Thursday. “And if there’s something there, then they should know that. And if there’s not something there, I’ll be the first to acknowledge that.”

But other committee members have sought to contain expectations. At the news conference, Mr. Burr said investigators had “hit a wall” in their work on the dossier, which holds some of the most salacious allegations of collusion, because its author, Christopher Steele, would not meet with the committee. Mr. Burr also said he did not have a mandate to look for criminal activity.

“The special counsel is focused on criminal acts; we’re not focused on criminal acts,” he said. “If we find one, then they’re the first phone call we make.”

Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and a former chairwoman of the committee, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” this month that Mr. Mueller stood a much better chance of reaching a definitive conclusion about collusion than the committees did.

“There’s no proof yet that it’s happened, and I think that proof will likely come with Mr. Mueller’s investigation,” Ms. Feinstein said. “He’s got the ability to use a grand jury. He’s got the ability to use the power of subpoena without question. And he’s got the ability to do a criminal investigation.”

Both intelligence committees will also face questions about how much of what they find can be declassified and shared with the public. Mr. Burr said on Wednesday that his goal was to have the “meat of our business” done by late spring, in time for state governments to make changes to their voting systems before next year’s midterm elections. He said he would push to declassify the findings as much as possible.

The Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, has struggled to get a fledgling investigation off the ground. Ms. Feinstein, the committee’s top Democrat, and its chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, agreed this summer to begin investigating a cluster of topics related to the firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, including Mr. Comey’s handling of the Clinton email case and the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia.

Given its jurisdiction over the Justice Department, the panel is the best positioned on Capitol Hill to unravel the Comey saga, including possible obstruction of justice. But after a brief flurry of activity earlier this fall — including a closed-door interview with the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. — investigators reached an impasse in recent weeks, as Democrats and Republicans haggled over the next witnesses to call and documents to request.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Grassley has spent weeks negotiating with the Justice Department on the committee’s behalf to try to gain access to two key F.B.I. officials who worked closely with Mr. Comey, Carl Ghattas and James Rybicki. Hopes of interviewing Paul J. Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, collapsed over the summer after prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller warned Mr. Manafort that they planned to seek criminal charges against him.

On Wednesday, Mr. Grassley unilaterally sent a flurry of letters requesting interviews with and information from current and former Justice Department officials, as well as Mr. Kushner and others involved in a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer said to be offering incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton.

Senators said they were still hopeful that the committee would break through the logjam, but a deal had not been reached as of Friday.

“The American people deserve a public investigation,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, noting that the Judiciary Committee could work more publicly than the intelligence panels. “They deserve witnesses who will give an accounting in public under oath.”",Hopes Dim for Congressional Russia Inquiries as Parties Clash,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/us/politics/russia-investigation-congress-intelligence-committees-gowdy.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

For hours, muffled screams and the smell of burning tissue filled the room.

“I wept the whole time,” Ms. Edmondson recalled. “I disassociated out of my body.”

Since the late 1990s, an estimated 16,000 people have enrolled in courses offered by Nxivm (pronounced Nex-e-um), which it says are designed to bring about greater self-fulfillment by eliminating psychological and emotional barriers. Most participants take some workshops, like the group’s “Executive Success Programs,” and resume their lives. But other people have become drawn more deeply into Nxivm, giving up careers, friends and families to become followers of its leader, Keith Raniere, who is known within the group as “Vanguard.”

Both Nxivm and Mr. Raniere, 57, have long attracted controversy. Former members have depicted him as a man who manipulated his adherents, had sex with them and urged women to follow near-starvation diets to achieve the type of physique he found appealing.

Now, as talk about the secret sisterhood and branding has circulated within Nxivm, scores of members are leaving. Interviews with a dozen of them portray a group spinning more deeply into disturbing practices. Many members said they feared that confessions about indiscretions would be used to blackmail them.

Mark Vicente, a filmmaker and former top Nxivm official, said that after hearing about the secret society, he confronted Mr. Raniere.

“I said, ‘Whatever you are doing, you are heading for a blowup,’” Mr. Vicente said.

Several former members have asked state authorities to investigate the group’s practices, but officials have declined to pursue action.

In July, Ms. Edmondson filed a complaint with the New York State Department of Health against Danielle Roberts, a licensed osteopath and follower of Mr. Raniere, who performed the branding, according to Ms. Edmondson and another woman. In a letter, the agency said it would not look into Dr. Roberts because she was not acting as Ms. Edmondson’s doctor when the branding is said to have happened.

Separately, a state police investigator told Ms. Edmondson and two other women that officials would not pursue their criminal complaint against Nxivm because their actions had been consensual, a text message shows.

State medical regulators also declined to act on a complaint filed against another Nxivm-affilated physician, Brandon Porter. Dr. Porter, as part of an “experiment,” showed women graphically violent film clips while a brain-wave machine and video camera recorded their reactions, according to two women who took part.

The women said they were not warned that some of the clips were violent, including footage of four women being murdered and dismembered.

“Please look into this ASAP,” a former Nxivm member, Jennifer Kobelt, stated in her complaint. “This man needs to be stopped.”

In September, regulators told Ms. Kobelt they concluded that the allegations against Dr. Porter did not meet the agency’s definition of “medical misconduct,” their letter shows.

Mr. Raniere and other top Nxivm officials, including Lauren Salzman, did not respond to repeated emails, letters or text messages seeking comment. Dr. Roberts and Dr. Porter also did not respond to inquiries.

Former members said that, inside Nxivm, they are being portrayed as defectors who want to destroy the group.

It is not clear how many women were branded or which Nxivm officials were aware of the practice.

A copy of a text message Mr. Raniere sent to a female follower indicates that he knew women were being branded and that the symbol’s design incorporated his initials.

“Not initially intended as my initials but they rearranged it slightly for tribute,” Mr. Raniere wrote, (“if it were abraham lincolns or bill gates initials no one would care.)”

Not intended initially as my initials but they rearranged it slightly for tribute (if it were abraham lincolns or bill gates initials no one would care). The primary meaning and design of the brand symbol has nothing to do with my initials ...”

Joining the Sisterhood

Ms. Edmondson, who lives in Vancouver and helped start Nxivm’s chapter there, was thrilled when Lauren Salzman arrived in January to teach workshops.

The women, both in their early 40s, were close and Ms. Edmondson regarded Ms. Salzman as a confidante and mentor.

“Lauren was someone I really looked up to as a rock star within the company,” said Ms. Edmondson, an actress who joined Nxivm about a decade ago.

During her visit, Ms. Salzman said she had something “really amazing” she wanted to share. “It is kind of strange and top secret and in order for me to tell you about it you need to give me something as collateral to make sure you don’t speak about it,” Ms. Edmondson recalled her saying.

The proposition seemed like a test of trust. After Ms. Edmondson wrote a letter detailing past indiscretions, Ms. Salzman told her about the secret sorority.

She said it had been formed as a force for good, one that could grow into a network that could influence events like elections. To become effective, members had to overcome weaknesses that Mr. Raniere taught were common to women — an overemotional nature, a failure to keep promises and an embrace of the role of victim, according to Ms. Edmondson and other members.

Submission and obedience would be used as tools to achieve those goals, several women said. The sisterhood would comprise circles, each led by a “master” who would recruit six “slaves,” according to two women. In time, they would recruit slaves of their own.

“She made it sound like a bad-ass bitch boot camp,” Ms. Edmondson said.

Ms. Edmondson and others said that during training, the women were required to send their master texts that read “Morning M” and “Night M.” During drills, a master texted her slaves “?” and they had 60 seconds to reply “Ready M.”

Trainees who failed had to pay penalties, including fasting, or could face physical punishments, two women said.

In March, Ms. Edmondson arrived for an initiation ceremony at Ms. Salzman’s home in Clifton Park, N.Y., a town about 20 miles north of Albany where Mr. Raniere and some followers live. After undressing, she was led to a candlelit ceremony, where she removed a blindfold and saw Ms. Salzman’s other slaves for the first time. The women were then driven to a nearby house, where the branding took place.

In the spring, the sorority grew as women joined different circles. Slaves added compromising collateral every month to Dropbox accounts, and a Google Document was used to list a timetable for recruiting new slaves, several women said.

Around the same time, an actress, Catherine Oxenberg, said she learned her daughter had been initiated into the sorority.

“I felt sick to my stomach,” said Ms. Oxenberg, who starred in the 1980s television series “Dynasty.”

Ms. Oxenberg had become increasingly concerned about her 26-year-old daughter, India, who looked emaciated from dieting. She told her mother that she had not had a menstrual period for a year and that her hair was falling out.

Ms. Oxenberg said she invited her daughter home in late May to try to get her away from the group.

When Ms. Oxenberg confronted her about the sorority, her daughter defended its practices.

“She said it was a character-building experience,” Ms. Oxenberg said.

‘Humans Can Be Noble’

By the time the secret group was taking shape, Mark Vicente, the filmmaker, had been a faithful follower of Mr. Raniere for more than a decade.

Mr. Vicente said he had been contacted by Ms. Salzman’s mother, Nancy, a co-founder of Nxivm who is known as “Prefect,” after the 2004 release of a documentary he co-directed that explored spirituality and physics.

Soon, Mr. Vicente was taking courses that he said helped him expose his fears and learn strategies that made him feel more resolute.

He also made a documentary called “Encender el Corazón,” or “Ignite the Heart,” which lionized Mr. Raniere’s work in Mexico.

“Keith Raniere is an activist, scientist, philosopher and, above all, humanitarian,” Mr. Vicente says in the film.

Mr. Raniere has used those words to describe himself. On his website, he said he spoke in full sentences by age 1, mastered high school mathematics by 12 and taught himself to play “concert level” piano. At 16, he entered Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.

Before Nxivm, he helped run a company called Consumers’ Buyline Inc., which offered discounts to members on groceries and other products.

In the mid-1990s, several state attorneys general investigated it as a suspected pyramid scheme; Mr. Raniere and his associates agreed to shut it down.

Through Nxivm, Mr. Raniere transformed himself into a New Age teacher with long hair and a guru-like manner of speaking.

“Humans can be noble,” he says on his website. “The question is: will we put forth what is necessary?”

By many accounts, Mr. Raniere sleeps during the day and goes out at night to play volleyball or take female followers for long walks. Several women described him as warm, funny and eager to talk about subjects that interested them.

Others saw a different side. Nxivm sued several former members, accusing them of stealing its trade secrets, among other things.

Mr. Vicente said he was aware of the negative publicity, including a 2012 series by The Albany Times-Union that described alleged abuses inside Nxivm.

Mr. Vicente’s views began to change this year after his wife was ostracized when she left Nxivm and he heard rumors about the secret sorority.

Mr. Vicente said he got evasive answers when he asked Mr. Raniere about the group. Mr. Raniere acknowledged giving “five women permission to do something,” but did not elaborate, other than to say he would investigate, Mr. Vicente said.

Mr. Vicente said he suspected Mr. Raniere was lying to him and might have done so before. Suddenly, self-awareness techniques he had learned felt like tools that had been used to control him.

“No one goes in looking to have their personality stripped away,” he said. “You just don’t realize what is happening.”

Followers Start to Flee

In May, Sarah Edmondson began to recoil from her embrace of the secret society.

Her husband, Anthony Ames, who was also a Nxivm member, learned about her branding and the couple both wanted out.

Before quitting, Mr. Ames went to Nxivm’s offices in Albany to collect money he said the group owed him.

He had his cellphone in his pocket and turned on its recorder.

On the recording, Mr. Ames tells another member that Ms. Edmondson was branded and that other women told him about handing over collateral. “This is criminal,” Mr. Ames says.

The voice of a woman — who Mr. Ames said is Lauren Salzman — is heard trying to calm him. “I don’t think you are open to having a conversation,” she said.

“You are absolutely right, I’m not open to having a conversation,” he replied. “My wife got branded.”

A few days later, many of Mr. Raniere’s followers learned of the secret society from a website run by a Buffalo-area businessman, Frank R. Parlato Jr. Mr. Parlato had been locked in a long legal battle with two sisters, Sara and Clare Bronfman, who are members of Nxivm and the daughters of Edgar Bronfman, the deceased chairman of Seagram Company.

In 2011, the Bronfman sisters sued Mr. Parlato, whom they had hired as a consultant, alleging he had defrauded them of $1 million.

Four years later, in 2015, the Justice Department indicted him on charges of fraud and other crimes arising from alleged activities, including defrauding the Bronfmans. Mr. Parlato has denied the claims and the case is pending.

Mr. Parlato started a website, The Frank Report, which he uses to lambaste prosecutors, Mr. Raniere and the Bronfmans. In early June, Mr. Parlato published the first in a torrent of salacious posts under the headline, “Branded Slaves and Master Raniere.”

A Nxivm follower, Soukaina Mehdaoui, said she reached out to Mr. Raniere after reading the post. Ms. Mehdaoui, 25, was a newcomer to Nxivm, but the two had grown close.

She said Mr. Raniere told her the secret sorority began after three women offered damaging collateral to seal lifetime vows of obedience to him.

While Ms. Mehdaoui had joined the sorority, the women in her circle were not branded. She was appalled.

“There are things I didn’t know that I didn’t sign up for, and I’m not even hearing about it from you,” she texted Mr. Raniere.

Mr. Raniere texted back about his initials and the brand.

By then, panic was spreading inside Nxivm. Slaves were ordered to delete encrypted messages between them and erase Google documents, two women said. To those considering breaking away, it was not clear whom they could trust and who were Nxivm loyalists.

Late one night, Ms. Mehdaoui met secretly with another Nxivm member. They took out their cellphones to show they were not recording the conversation.

Both decided to leave Nxivm, despite concerns that the group would retaliate by releasing their “collateral” or suing them.

Ms. Mehdaoui said that when she went to say goodbye to Mr. Raniere, he urged her to stay.

“Do you think, I’m bad, I don’t agree with abuses,” she recalled him saying. He said the group “gives women tools to be powerful, to regain their power for the sake of building love.”

Nxivm recently filed criminal complaints with the Vancouver police against Ms. Edmondson and two other women accusing them of mischief and other crimes in connection with the firm’s now-closed center there, according to Ms. Edmondson. The women have denied the allegations. A spokesman for the Vancouver police declined to comment.

Ms. Edmondson and other former followers of Mr. Raniere said they were focusing on recovering.

Early the next morning, with Mrs. Royer under general anesthesia, the surgery began in an overheated operating room ideal for the fetus but sweltering for doctors and nurses in caps, gloves and surgical gowns.

During the standard prenatal surgery for spina bifida, surgeons cut open the woman’s abdomen and uterus to reach the fetus. But the newer, experimental approach is different.

Dr. Belfort opened Mrs. Royer’s lower abdomen, but not her uterus. Instead, he eased the uterus out of her body and inserted the fetoscope, and then, through another slit, surgical tools. The doctors drained out the amniotic fluid and pumped in carbon dioxide to keep the uterus expanded, giving them room to work and allowing them to see better and cauterize when needed.

They gave the fetus an anesthetic injection and then, guided by images on the video screens, began to operate on him, tugging skin and membranes over the naked spinal cord and sewing them tightly shut with five stitches to seal out amniotic fluid.

Because the defect was so large, they made “relaxing incisions” along his sides, to loosen the skin so they could pull it across his back. The cuts would heal, though they would leave scars.

Every few minutes, a pediatric cardiologist called out the fetal heart rate, which held steady at a normal rate of about 150 beats a minute. When the surgery was finished, the doctors replaced the amniotic fluid with saline.

The surgery took three hours. The standard, open operation is faster and easier, but Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead think their method will prove safer for both the mother and the fetus.

With the open procedure, the cut into the uterus increases the risk of early labor and premature birth, which puts the fetus at risk for a host of complications.

The incision also raises the risk of uterine rupture during labor, and requires that the mother give birth by cesarean section, which is generally riskier for women than a vaginal birth.

The scarring on the uterus from the two operations makes it likely that she will need cesareans for future births, and also increases the risk of placental problems that can be life-threatening. The small slits for the fetoscopes are thought to reduce these risks.

To develop their fetoscopic procedure, Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead operated on sheep and spent several hundred hours over the course of two years practicing on a simulator that they had created. It consisted of a rubber kickball, about the size of a basketball — like a uterus at 24 weeks of pregnancy — with a doll inside, wrapped in chicken skin that they cut to mimic the defect in spina bifida.

They would insert fetoscopes into the ball and, eyes on the monitor, work together to sew up the chicken skin. They completed more than 30 simulated operations, including two sessions in an operating room, with a full surgical team assembled. They still use the simulator at least twice a month to keep up their skills, Dr. Belfort said.

They operated on their first patient in July 2014. In August, in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, they reported on their first 28 cases. So far, the results have been good, though the numbers are small.

No fetuses have died, few have needed shunts, and some of the mothers have been able to have vaginal deliveries. Their pregnancies appear to last longer, coming closer to full-term than with the open procedure. More research is needed, but other medical centers have begun adopting the technique. Surgeons at Johns Hopkins have used it to treat five patients, and Dr. Belfort is helping to train colleagues at Stanford.

Doctors who practice the open procedure are critical, and warn that the carbon dioxide pumped into the uterus may harm the fetus and cause neurological problems. Dr. Belfort said there has been no evidence of harm. But time will tell.

Mrs. Royer, who will stay in an apartment in Houston for the rest of her pregnancy, had a painful recovery from the surgery. But she has no regrets.

“It’s not done by any means, but I definitely feel it’s the right thing for us,” she said. “Seeing the ultrasound and how good he’s doing, moving his ankles and feet, it’s such a happy moment.

“I can’t imagine going on further in the pregnancy not knowing every day what damage is being done and if he’s getting worse. It’s such a relief to move forward.”

The first sign of unsettlement is when Carl starts bringing mismatched chairs to Jody’s shop, where the play takes place, claiming his own apartment is too small. As the chairs progressively take over the space, we learn that Jody has stopped going home. He hasn’t been tested, he tells Carl, and does not want to leave the comfort of his familiar, mapped-out little universe anymore.

Mr. Dietz never says what Jody has not been tested for, but the two protagonists are gay men in the early 1990s, and conclusions are easy to draw that it is AIDS. This is par for the course in “Lonely Planet,” which makes liberal use of symbols and metaphors, yet manages to be heavy-handed while not spelling things out.

Most obviously, Jody uses cartography to evoke the way he sees the world, as when he talks about the flat Mercator map — which misrepresents the size of countries, with those farther away from the Equator appearing larger — and makes us accept “the distortion as fact.”

Jody is also seen reading Ionesco’s absurdist, despairing, agonizingly elliptical play “The Chairs.” “Is it the one with the hippos?” Carl quips. But under his flip exterior — and Mr. McGrath makes hay of Carl’s wit — the show’s resident jester is angry at the disease that is killing his friends.

The chairs he is amassing in Jody’s store belonged to people who just died; they are totems of snuffed-out lives. At least Carl confronts the plague in his own way, and he is getting frustrated and scared by Jody’s denial of reality.

Worries about the inhumanity of capital punishment were also blunted in part because this was purely hypothetical and in part because of the inhumanity he exhibited those long years with his penchant for violence.

Although the death sentence seemed wholly appropriate, I still considered how I would feel if a judge gave my rapist a less severe punishment: a natural life sentence — a life sentence with no chance for parole without a successful appeal.

After reporting back to my therapist, she offered another thought experiment. “What if,” she said, “your rapist had been sentenced to death, but then had been pardoned?” I did not have to mull this question over. I knew I would feel exactly as I do now, exactly as I have felt for the past two decades: that the world is a terribly unjust place. It is a place where my life can be irrevocably transformed because a man could exert control, manipulation and violence over me for years without repercussion. It is a place where my rapist and others like him are enabled at both societal and local levels. His mother, for example, simply told us to quiet down whenever she heard my screams — a response as horrifying as it is understandable given the many ways society tolerates violence against women.

A hypothetical pardon would allow him to escape repercussions just as he has escaped them in reality. Nearly 20 years later as I began trauma therapy again, he has a secure job, an accomplished and beautiful wife, and a healthy daughter. He is living a life many dream of, while my life is disrupted as I continue to heal from the wounds he inflicted when I was a child. E.M.D.R. begins with the choice of reliving either the earliest traumatic memory or the most painful, rendering it as harrowing as it is effective; E.M.D.R. is not for the faint of heart.

IN FEBRUARY 2016 — only weeks after the thought experiments with my therapist — the philosopher Jennifer Lackey published an opinion piece in The Stone. In the article, she uses her experience teaching philosophy to inmates to argue for the irrationality of natural life sentences. Lackey bases her argument against natural life sentences on two reasonable claims: (1) people (criminals, specifically) can and do change in profoundly transformative ways, and (2) we cannot know the future.

For Lackey, the fact that we have good statistical evidence that criminals can and do change is especially problematic given our vast epistemic limitations regarding the future. “Natural life sentences,” she wrote, “say to all involved that there is no possible piece of information that could be learned between sentencing and death that could bear in any way on the punishment the convicted is said to deserve, short of what might ground an appeal.”Citing the possibility of prisoner transformation, Lackey then puts her question about rationality directly: “How is it rational,” she asks, “to screen off the relevance of this information? How, that is, is it rational to say today that there can be no possible evidence in the future that could bear on the punishment that a decades-from-now prisoner deserves?”

Natural life sentences, Lackey notices, are a “glaring exception” to the way we think about rational decision making in other contexts. Natural life sentences “permit binding, life-altering decisions to be made in a state of radical epistemic impoverishment.”

Lackey’s argument strongly suggests that transformation is an exceedingly important consideration for sentencing. This is not an alien notion; the criminal justice system often takes good behavior and contrition as evidence of transformation that is relevant to one’s sentence. This occurs not just under the direction of theories that value rehabilitation, but in all but the “crudest forms of retributive justice.” Rehabilitation, then, is one aspect that many believe separates crude justice theories from other, presumably better, justice theories.

I read Lackey’s article very soon after the thought experiments with my therapist. I noticed that Lackey’s argument easily applied to the death penalty, and I realized that the sentences I desired for my rapist were precisely the ones Lackey condemns as irrational. Since nothing in her argument prevented me from applying her logic to my own desires, I had to wonder if her argument also concluded that I was irrational for desiring permanent punishments. If it is irrational for the state to prescribe a permanent punishment given our epistemic limitations and prisoners’ likelihood for change, wouldn’t it be similarly irrational for victims to ignore these considerations?

There are, of course, crucial differences between victim’s desires and punishments carried out by the state. While sometimes the criminal justice system considers the wishes of victims and their families, the criminal justice system’s central aim is to protect the interests of the state and the community. This aim does not always coincide with the interests or wishes of the victim. Admittedly, there are often very good reasons for the state to ignore the wishes of victims. But my concern is less about what the state should do in practice and more about what arguments that prioritize transformation say about victims who desire permanent punishments.

Here I will be blunt: it matters very little to me whether my rapist is transformed at some point in his life. It matters to me only to the extent that I will readily agree that it would be better if he became the sort of person who did not inflict violence upon others. I would be very happy hearing that no other women would be harmed by him. But in terms of the punishment that he deserves? Transformation does not matter to me. And this is not irrational: There are many carefully considered reasons one might want a natural life sentence for perpetrators of egregious and irrevocable harm.

Desiring death or a natural life sentence for those who inflict traumatic violence is a rational response because whether or not my particular rapist transforms is irrelevant to whether or not I will ever have the chance to be the sort of person I might have been. His transformation is irrelevant to whether or not I will be able to live the sort of life I could have were it not for the injustice done to me. I desire a death or natural life sentence for my rapist because that is what seems appropriate given the amount of damage he wrought in my life.

Rape is itself a transformative experience. I will never be the same, and I have no idea how my life might have been different without the experience. My rapist expertly dismantled my sense of self as he isolated me from friends and family. He manipulated me so that he could more effectively inflict violence and exert power and control over me. I know that I have suffered, that I have struggled, and that I might not have survived. I’ve read about the neurological effects of prolonged trauma, and I know that I am now — and perhaps always will be — affected in some capacity by the things he did to me. After plenty of rational consideration, I cannot imagine any personal transformation that would make me think he deserves anything less than a permanent punishment.

In response, one might call my stance a crude form of retributive justice. Perhaps it is. I know that expressing desire for retribution is a risky move in its unpopularity. Social narratives have long praised forgiveness and love especially for those who have wronged us. Theories of justice have also moved beyond ones that emphasize retribution — and for good reason in many cases. I understand this perspective: For many years it was abhorrent for me to think of responding to the violence I suffered with more violence. But calling the desire for permanent punishment crude does not render it irrational however unpopular it might be.

One might, in the end, respond by saying that arguments like Lackey’s are proposing only policy change. These arguments, we might say, are not meant to prescribe the appropriate feelings for victims. If so, we might think that my worries about what arguments can say to individual victims is off the mark. While it’s clear that policy change can be a central aim, audiences of such arguments include victims of traumatic crimes. Yet it is not clear that such arguments always take victims into account.

Although my attitude is in no way representative of all victims, epistemic arguments that prioritize criminal transformation must contend with the implication that they can be used to paint trauma victims irrational when they desire retribution.

It’s certainly important to advocate for prisoners who are wrongly incarcerated and for those who were victims of the overzealous war on crime era. The injustices in our criminal justice system are too numerous and too serious to ignore. But criminal justice reform should not be so myopic that it compounds trauma survivors’ victimization. Those who manage to survive traumatic crimes have enough to battle without arguments that undermine their rational considerations. Advocates for criminal justice reform can, and should, do better.",Is There a ‘Rational’ Punishment for My Rapist?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/opinion/rape-punishment-rational.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Some principals have chosen to introduce science- and math-based creativity classes or experiential learning projects, while one Shanghai administrator simply lets out school early a day a week to encourage kids to “explore.”

“Students must develop a personality,” Dai Chong, a Beijing schoolteacher, said, uttering a priority unthinkable two decades ago for a nation of rote-learning math fanatics.

As Mr. Dai ushered me through the hallways of Beijing National Day School, I noted practices that seemed more American than Chinese: Rankings were not be posted. Textbooks were left at school instead of toted home for study. Class sizes had been whittled down to a maximum of 25. A mental health club was advertised as a release valve for academic pressure. Choice was also on the menu — students could pick electives such as swimming, rock climbing and Frisbee.

“We have found traditional authoritarian Chinese teaching has many ill effects and deviates from the essence of education, which is to serve individuals,” Mr. Dai said. “Our teachers are like friends.”

An abrupt reversal, indeed, for a school that at one time didn’t provide hot water for showers because cold water would enhance “willpower and endurance.”

Reformers are also loosening the shackles of entrance-exam testing. Some students in Shanghai will have two chances at the college entrance exam, while universities are beginning to consider volunteering, interviews and regular high school tests as part of the admissions process.

For all its faults, the Chinese system provides some benefits that critics tend to dismiss. It imparts an early foundation of knowledge that can prepare a child for lifelong success. Cognitive scientists say that real learning doesn’t happen unless knowledge is imprinted on long-term memory. Once children lock away key information, they can free up the active memory for thinking deeply — and for being creative.

And the system produces success stories. On the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 2012 problem-solving test, students in Shanghai — a pilot district where reforms are tested — finished sixth, well above the O.E.C.D. average. And highly skilled Chinese can thrive in environments that encourage originality and entrepreneurship.

When such skilled Chinese emigrate, the results are impressive: Ethnic Chinese immigrants are founding Silicon Valley start-ups and are securing American patents at a disproportionate rate. China is a global leader in industries like artificial intelligence, drone manufacturing and mobile payments. China’s start-up sector has produced nearly as many tech unicorns as the United States (and surpassed Europe) so far this year.

Significant obstacles stand in the way of reform. Deeply rooted authoritarianism and exam pressure dampen individual will, as does the Communist Party’s increasingly heavy political agenda in the classroom. How can China’s leadership cultivate critical-thinking skills while also pushing political indoctrination?

Further, change is largely confined to urban Chinese schools with the will, special designation or clout to experiment, while rural students are more likely to founder in a system that perpetuates inequality. Meanwhile, families with the financial means continue to prefer secondary and university education abroad.

For Ms. Faris, the breakup creates an added wrinkle for an already anxiety-inducing moment in her career, as she prepares to promote the book in television appearances and bookstore events where, inevitably, the subject of her marriage and separation will come up.

“The book release would have been terrifying regardless,” she said, adding that it was even more so “with the new complications in my life.”

“I’ve never done anything like this,” she added. “I get to hide behind characters.”

She’s resigned herself to fielding questions about the split, and says that if she had published the memoir a year from now, she would have had time to reflect on and address their separation in the book. “The story is kind of dull,” she said. “It’s a little bit like, two incredibly busy people that care a lot for each other got really busy.”

Ms. Faris’s editor at Dutton, Jill Schwartzman, said she was confident that the memoir wouldn’t be overshadowed by Ms. Faris’s separation because it’s ultimately a funny and revealing look at Ms. Faris, through the lens of her relationships.

Ms. Faris chronicles the highs and lows, but mostly the highs, of their courtship and marriage. In a chapter titled, “Take Me Home Tonight. Literally,” Ms. Faris recalls developing a crush on Mr. Pratt while working on the comedy “Take Me Home Tonight,” when she was still married to the actor Ben Indra. (After realizing she was attracted to Mr. Pratt, Ms. Faris told Mr. Indra over the phone that she wanted a divorce, then announced to everyone on set that she had left her husband.)

Later on, she describes how, on one of her first dates with Mr. Pratt, she ate a fly to impress him. She also reveals trying moments, like the wrenching weeks after their son Jack was born prematurely and had to spend about a month in the neonatal intensive care unit. In what would have been a stressful time for any parents, Ms. Faris and Mr. Pratt had the additional burden of facing paparazzi who stalked them at the hospital entrance.

With characteristic self-effacement, Ms. Faris also addresses the downsides of being a famous Hollywood couple, including her feelings of insecurity when Mr. Pratt starred with Jennifer Lawrence in the sci-fi epic “Passengers” and the tabloids speculated that they were a couple: “Of course it’s hurtful and also embarrassing when people are saying your husband is cheating on you — even if it’s patently untrue,” Ms. Faris writes.

Mr. Pratt — who went from playing a lovable, dimwitted side character on the NBC sitcom “Parks and Recreation” to full-blown movie stardom, with leading roles in blockbusters like “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “Jurassic World” — is a looming presence in “Unqualified,” from the first page to the acknowledgments. Ms. Faris dedicated the book to him, and thanks him for “being just about the best person I know.”

In his foreword to the book, Mr. Pratt obliquely references the separation, and intentionally butchers the spelling of “foreword,” as part of a running joke that he doesn’t know what the word means. “When I was asked to write the forward for ‘Unqualified,’ Anna’s memoir, I immediately said yes without even thinking about it,” he writes. “And boy did a lot happen between then and now. So much. Like … soooo much.” Mr. Pratt also makes an extended guest appearance later in the book, in a chapter titled, “She Said, He Said: What It’s Like to Be a Couple in Hollywood,” which consists entirely of dialogue between them. (A publicist for Mr. Pratt said he was unable to comment for this article because “his schedule is completely over committed at this point.”)

Ms. Faris, 40, grew up in Edmonds, Wash., and has been acting since she was 9. She got a degree in English literature from the University of Washington, then moved to Los Angeles. Her first role in a major film was playing Cindy Campbell in “Scary Movie,” a campy horror parody. In the ensuing years, she was often cast as the drunk girl, the ditsy sidekick or the adorable goofball. Eventually, she started producing and landing leading roles in comedies like “The House Bunny” and “What’s Your Number?” Next year, she stars in a remake of the 1987 romantic comedy “Overboard,” which originally featured Goldie Hawn as a self-involved heiress.

In 2015, she started a podcast, “Anna Faris Is Unqualified,” a show that has been described as a mash-up between Marc Maron and Dear Abby. On the show, Ms. Faris and her co-host, Sim Sarna, take calls from listeners and dole out relationship advice, often with celebrity guests weighing in (T.J. Miller, Lisa Kudrow, Aubrey Plaza and Chelsea Handler have all made appearances). The podcast gave her the idea for the book.

In the last chapter of “Unqualified,” Ms. Faris noted that she started seeing a therapist while writing the book, and that she has grown skeptical of the idea of “closure” following a breakup.

“I just wanted to make sure that anyone who was actually willing to read the book felt like I wasn’t glorifying my life at all. I am clearly a flawed person,” she said in the interview. “This is terrifying,” she added — that word again — “that I’m writing about stuff that makes me feel incredibly vulnerable.”",Is Anna Faris Unqualified?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/books/anna-faris-book-chris-pratt.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

A month ago, Mr. Rajoy promised that Catalonia would never hold an illegal referendum on independence, while Mr. Puigdemont told Catalan voters that they would.
After the referendum, Mr. Puigdemont and Mr. Rajoy engaged in a game of chicken, exchanging ultimatums.
Mr. Puigdemont could still forestall the application of Article 155 if he decides to call new elections himself, pre-empting Mr. Rajoy.
“But the worse way would have been if Mr. Rajoy had now tried to act very minimally and then still have failed.”","“You need mistakes on both sides to get entangled in such a difficult and undesirable situation,” said Pablo Simón, a politics professor at the Carlos III University in Madrid.

Catalan separatists have been flouting Spain’s Constitution, he argued, but “the central government could have searched for political dialogue and really reached out to the more moderate Catalans.”

“Between fiercely defending the status quo in Spain and claiming the right to self-determination,” Mr. Simón added, “there are a lot of gray areas that have simply been left unexplored.”

Separatism has century-old roots in Catalonia, a region that has its own culture and language. It was one of the factors that plunged Spain into a civil war in the 1930s that was then followed by a lengthy dictatorship under Gen. Francisco Franco.

But after Franco’s death in 1975, Catalonia endorsed Spain’s democratic Constitution. Working hand in hand with politicians in Madrid, conservative politicians in Catalonia acted as a buffer against smaller parties advocating secessionism.

Still, the desire for a distinct identity was not slaked. Catalans tried to finesse greater autonomy for themselves, striking a deal in 2006 that was approved in a Catalan referendum — as well as by both Catalan and Spanish lawmakers — and one that might have forestalled the current crisis over yet more extreme demands.

But Spain’s constitutional court rejected part of that text in 2010 after Mr. Rajoy’s Popular Party had campaigned fiercely against it.

In each and every subsequent round of the conflict, Mr. Rajoy and Mr. Puigdemont have both raised the stakes and boxed themselves into a corner by making irreconcilable pledges.

Bay of Biscay FRANCE CATALONIA Barcelona Madrid PORTUGAL SPAIN Mediterranean Sea Strait of Gibraltar ALGERIA 200 Miles MOROCCO

No small amount of the momentum that thrust the country into crisis was the desire to save face by both men, who were playing to vastly different political constituencies.

Above all, Mr. Rajoy could not afford to appear weak. In his decisions, he was looking beyond Catalonia at the rest of Spain, where a firm stance has allowed him to reclaim a national leadership that was seriously put at risk in 2016, following two inconclusive national elections amid major corruption scandals afflicting his governing Popular Party.

Catalan secessionism also allowed Mr. Rajoy to rope in the main opposition Socialist party into a shared commitment to defend Spanish unity.

Mr. Puigdemont, on the other hand, gained by playing to the home crowd with promises of independence that always amounted to castles in the air, in a European Union committed to defending its member states against any rebellion by one of the Continent’s regions.

This dynamic steadily widened the gap between the two leaders.

A month ago, Mr. Rajoy promised that Catalonia would never hold an illegal referendum on independence, while Mr. Puigdemont told Catalan voters that they would.

On Oct. 1, almost 2.3 million voters defied a Spanish police crackdown to vote overwhelmingly for independence, in a referendum that was held without legal guarantees and was boycotted by most Catalan citizens opposed to secession.

After the referendum, Mr. Puigdemont and Mr. Rajoy engaged in a game of chicken, exchanging ultimatums.

Then on Saturday, Mr. Rajoy set in motion what Ernesto Ekaizer, a Madrid-based journalist, described as “a bulldozer” to quash secessionism.

By invoking Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, Mr. Rajoy now intends to remove Mr. Puigdemont and other separatist leaders from office, and call new elections within six months.

Article 155, a vaguely worded provision in the Constitution that has never before been tested, in effect allows the central government to strip the autonomy of a region that is “seriously prejudicing the general interests of Spain.”

Writing on Sunday in Ara, a Catalan separatist newspaper, Mr. Ekaizer warned that Mr. Rajoy’s intervention could backfire and “won’t do anything more than make the situation more serious.”

Indeed, the path ahead in such a scenario is treacherous. Not least, Catalans have already voted for a regional Parliament where a majority of lawmakers support secession, even without so far winning a majority of the votes in the region. There is not much reason to believe the outcome of a new vote would be different.

Mr. Rajoy and the Spanish courts may be tempted to ban hard-line separatist parties and their politicians. But the impulse may only lead them further down a path that Catalans see as increasingly repressive, as Madrid attempts to get the lawmakers it wants in Catalonia, not the ones it has.

Mr. Rajoy is likely to get approval on Friday for his emergency measures from the Spanish Senate, where his conservative party holds a majority.

Separately, the Catalan Parliament is set to meet this week to review what Mr. Puigdemont described as Mr. Rajoy’s decision to “eliminate our self-government and our democracy.”

While the chasm between both sides is wide, it may not be unbridgeable.

Mr. Puigdemont could still forestall the application of Article 155 if he decides to call new elections himself, pre-empting Mr. Rajoy.

Alternately, he could get his separatist lawmakers to vote for a unilateral declaration of independence, as he recently threatened.

“We’re reaching the end of a poker game in which both players have now shown their trump cards but not actually put them on the table,” said Antón Costas, an economics professor at the University of Barcelona.

“So however bad things look, there is still a final opportunity to have neither a declaration of independence nor Article 155,” he said.

But such an off-route may easily be passed given the speed of Catalonia’s crisis. With each missed opportunity to defuse the dispute, the gulf between the sides only widens.

In 2012, coinciding with the global financial crisis and the meltdown of Spain’s banking sector, grievances over the failure to gain greater autonomy turned instead into Catalan demands for a better fiscal deal for the prosperous region, which Mr. Rajoy rejected.

That rebuff pushed Catalonia’s conservative government to embrace an independence project whose appeal on the street grew. Even after Spain came out of recession in late 2013, the independence movement was in full flow.

In defiance of Spain’s courts and government, Catalonia held a nonbinding independence vote in 2014 that was followed by regional elections in 2015, in which an unwieldy alliance of separatist parties won most seats in the Catalan Parliament, but only 48 percent of the vote.

Since then, Mr. Puigdemont has used Mr. Rajoy’s stonewalling as a reason to pursue his statehood project unilaterally, under self-made Catalan laws, rather than those of Spain.

Mr. Rajoy didn’t negotiate earlier because he probably assumed that “demands for independence were linked to economic problems and would evaporate once the crisis was over,” said Mr. Simón, the politics professor.

Now, Mr. Rajoy is committed to using the “logical tool” of Article 155, even if taking charge of Catalonia is “a high-risk operation, which can provoke disobedience by civil servants and peaceful resistance by citizens,” Mr. Simón added.

Still, Mr. Rajoy has won significant cross-party backing for his strategy in Catalonia, said Luis Garicano, a leading member of the center-right Ciudadanos party that has been a staunch ally of Mr. Rajoy in opposing Catalan secessionism.

“It’s never good news that things should get this far, but what is very, very good news is that there is a lot of unity among the constitutional forces, especially with the Socialists,” Mr. Garicano said.

“We can’t know for sure what comes next,” Mr. Garicano added. “But the worse way would have been if Mr. Rajoy had now tried to act very minimally and then still have failed.”","In Catalonia Crisis, Shared Blame for ‘a Difficult and Undesirable Situation’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/world/europe/catalonia-spain-carles-puigdemont-mariano-rajoy.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“This study is a whole other thing.”An updated version of this article, with more about the national implications of the Washington, D.C., study of police body cameras, can be found here.","After the public uprising in response to the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., advocates and many police officials turned to cameras as a way to reduce violent encounters and build trust. By 2015, 95 percent of large police departments reported they were using body cameras or had committed to doing so in the near future, according to a national survey.

The cameras provide an independent, if sometimes ambiguous, record of police-civilian encounters.

Until now, the most commonly cited study on police body cameras had suggested that cameras did indeed have a calming effect. That experiment took place in 2012 in Rialto, Calif., where officers were randomly assigned cameras based on their shifts. Over a year, shifts that included cameras experienced half as many use-of-force incidents (including the use of a police baton, Taser or gun) as those shifts without cameras. The number of complaints filed by civilians against officers also declined — a stunning 90 percent compared with the previous year.

The Rialto study had a big impact in policing. Axon (formerly known as Taser International) has sold more than 300,000 police cameras worldwide and cites the Rialto study on its website. A federal district judge also cited the study in 2013 when she ordered the New York City Police Department to conduct a yearlong pilot program using body cameras. (Results are due out this spring.)

But the Rialto experiment featured just 54 officers, compared with over 2,000 in Washington. Officers in Washington captured five times as many hours of video. The larger sample size and the long-term way the cameras were assigned added to the reliability of the D.C. results.

“This is the most important empirical study on the impact of police body-worn cameras to date,” said Harlan Yu from Upturn, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit consulting company that studies how technology affects social issues. It was not directly involved in the research. “The results call into question whether police departments should be adopting body-worn cameras, given their high cost.”

The federal government has given police departments more than $40 million to invest in body cameras, and state and local authorities have spent many millions more. The devices vary in price, but the biggest expense is the data-storage cost. In Washington, M.P.D. officers collect about a thousand hours of footage a day. About 40 percent of it is deleted within 90 days, while the rest is to be kept for months, years or decades, depending on the statute of limitations for the charges connected to the footage.

The cameras also have a cost in terms of privacy violations. In a report on the policies governing police body cams in 50 major departments, Upturn and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights found that many cities have weak rules in place. Those rules can allow departments to refuse to share footage with civilians who want to file complaints, for example.

Some companies are exploring ways to integrate facial recognition software into police cameras, a level of surveillance that would disproportionately affect low-income minority communities, where the police tend to spend the most time.

“D.C. has relatively strong body-worn-camera procedures,” Mr. Yu said. “In cities that have weaker policies, it’s certainly possible that the cameras may be doing more harm than good.” Like other advocacy groups, the American Civil Liberties Union has supported body cameras. But the study, says Monica Hopkins-Maxwell at the A.C.L.U. of D.C., “should give us pause.”

For now, Washington officials say they intend to continue using cameras. But they admit to being surprised by the findings.

“I thought it would make a difference on police and civilian behavior — particularly for officers, and this is the exception, who might be more inclined to misbehave,” said the M.P.D. chief, Peter Newsham.

Why didn’t the cameras change behavior? After all, we know that other cameras do change behavior. Public closed-circuit TV cameras seem to lead to a moderate decrease in crime, particularly in parking garages. Traffic cameras significantly decrease speeding and fatal accidents.

Even the suggestion that someone is watching us tends to influence us: In 2011, researchers at Newcastle University in England posted pictures of a pair of male eyes and the caption, “Cycle Thieves: We Are Watching You.” Bike thefts decreased by 62 percent in those locations — and not elsewhere.

One hypothesis is that officers got used to the cameras and became desensitized to them. But the researchers saw no difference in behavior during the initial phase, when the cameras were new. (The researchers also checked the data to make sure officers were turning their cameras on when they were supposed to, and found a very high level of compliance.) Another possibility is that officers without cameras were acting like officers with cameras, simply because they knew other officers had the devices.

An equally plausible explanation has to do with fear: In Washington, police officers are instructed to turn on their cameras whenever they answer a call or encounter the public in a law-enforcement context. The kinds of situations that might lead to civilian complaints or use-of-force incidents are high-stress encounters. When frightened, humans tend to act on automatic fear responses (or, in the case of good police officers in an ideal world, training).

“It’s a lot to ask, psychologically speaking, to not only remember the camera is on but to moderate your behavior,” said Mr. Yokum, the head of the Lab @ DC.

Finally, cameras may have had less impact in Washington, because the police department there has already had to confront excessive-force problems. After a devastating 1998 Washington Post series revealed that the city’s police department had shot and killed more people per resident in the 1990s than any other police force in a large American city, the Department of Justice entered into a memorandum of agreement with D.C. to reform its policing.

“We went through a transformation with regard to use of force when Justice came in here,” Chief Newsham said.

Cities that lack such accountability in their police culture may find cameras more effective, under this theory. (The Rialto Police Department had been reeling from a series of scandals when the Rialto study showed a large impact from cameras.)

Even if cameras do not reduce violent encounters, they can still offer other kinds of benefits: for training, or to hold a rogue officer accountable after the fact.

To Chief Newsham, the cameras’ primary benefit is to improve relations with the community. “The transparency and trust that the community has, knowing your department is recording the interactions, I don’t think you can undervalue that,” he said. So far, it’s hard to say for sure if cameras increase trust, but Chief Newsham said he’d like to find out more through additional studies like this one.

The nine-person research team pre-published its design online, so that there would be less temptation to rejigger the approach after the results were in (an emerging best practice in social science research).

“We like to be very anecdotal in policing — to compare this year to that year,” said M.P.D. Commander Ralph Ennis, who oversaw the rollout of the cameras and worked closely with researchers. “This study is a whole other thing.”

In Australia, though weakened by shopping centers, they never really died.

This is still a place where many Australians can buy a novel, sausages and shampoo in three different shops, each owned by a neighbor with children at the local school.

Big box stores are rare and independent bookstores are strong: Their sales accounted for around 26 percent of Australia’s book business in 2015, according to Nielsen, up from 20 percent in the late 2000s, more than double the share for independents in the United States.

Romantics (and some booksellers) argue that Australians simply favor local offerings. Cynics (and some economists) argue that many Australians are just wealthy and complacent, unfamiliar with more convenient alternatives that they’ll eventually embrace and come to love.

Regardless, this much is clear: Amazon’s arrival is a stress test not just for individual retail categories but also for Australia’s own writing, and way of life.

“Our culture is, and all cultures are, being swamped by outside influences,” Mr. Rubbo said. “We’re fighting to defend our voice.”

What Do You Want and When Do You Want It?

Amazon’s first “fulfillment center” in Australia sits at the intersection of several highways about an hour south of central Melbourne. There are food companies and warehouses for Penguin Random House nearby, and inside, room for millions of products.

Union organizers say they are watching the location closely to ensure that new hires receive Australia’s minimum wage of roughly 18 Australian dollars, around $14.50. But on a recent visit, the warehouse was empty except for a few gray shelves in the middle of a gray floor. The only employees were construction workers clad in neon-green and finishing a bathroom.

What comes next is anyone’s guess. Amazon turned down requests for an interview, and did not respond to emails with specific questions.

The company is known for this sort of thing, preferring buzz to transparency, and here in Australia, that’s led to excitement for many who are hoping for an easier, much broader online shopping experience — along with real estate speculation in the warehouse market, the rollout of a new free delivery service by Australia’s postal service, and what the chief executive at one large retailing conglomerate described as “a healthy sense of paranoia.”

Booksellers know the feeling. Amazon hasn’t explained why it’s taken so long to bring its full retail operation to Australia but Australians have been able to order from Amazon’s American site for years and even with shipping costs, book prices are often equal to or cheaper than what can be found in Sydney or Melbourne.

There are other digital booksellers already in Australia too, including Book Depository, an Amazon subsidiary from Britain, and Booktopia, a start-up that nearly went public last year.

Tony Nash, the chief executive of Booktopia, which according to the company, controls about 4 percent of Australia’s book market, said that Amazon has already made everyone more competitive.

Booktopia, for example, now uses conveyors, automatic packing machines and a staff of 150 people to get books into customers’ hands, in some cases on the same day they’re ordered.

“It’s not about price,” Mr. Nash said. Especially in countries with small widely dispersed populations like Canada and Australia, where 24 million people are spread across a continent the size of the United States, “it’s about the logistics.”

But isolation, as Australians know better than most, can help and hurt.

Sean Guy, a manager at The Bookshop in Darwin, Australia’s northernmost major city, said if he lived in a more isolated community like Alice Springs, in the nation’s interior desert region, “I’d probably find it a lot easier to go online for five minutes than call the local bookshop.”

For most everyone else, he added, bricks-and-books still work.

“You’ll never be able to beat the prices of Amazon, but you can save on time by going into a store,” he said. “And people like supporting local businesses.”

Australians already buy more books per capita than Americans (based on Nielsen sales figures) and spend more hours reading.

Michael Heyward, the publisher at Text, an independent publisher with a mix of new and established Australian writers, including Helen Garner, said that maybe Australia’s built up enough independence to live with Amazon in peace.

“I would like to believe we can have our cake and eat it,” he said in an interview at his office in Melbourne.

But just below his own bookish calm — and the not-so-secret hope that Amazon will help sell more books — there are wider concerns.

“Let’s not outsource our minds to the narcissism of the global algorithm,” warned Anna Funder, the author of “Stasiland” and “All That I Am,” at a booksellers conference last year. And she’s not alone.

“People who work in the book industry are agents of culture rather than just instruments of commerce,” said Tim Winton, the author of Australian classics like “Cloudstreet,” and one of Australia’s best-known writers. “When you take away their role as agents of culture and reduce them to instruments of capitalism, it changes the dynamic.”

In interviews with more than a dozen booksellers, authors, independent publishers and lawyers specializing in copyright, two worst-case scenarios emerged.

One, widely considered the more likely, involves Amazon convincing Australia’s big publishers to provide steep discounts and promises of faster delivery, driving down prices and author royalties for all books, and possibly putting independent booksellers’ orders at the end of the line.

“Amazon controls the negotiating process,” said David Gaunt, the co-owner of Gleebooks in Sydney. “If they choose to sell the new Richard Flanagan book at $9.99,” he added, referring to Australia’s last winner of the Man Booker Prize, who has a new novel out, “we’ll sell none.”

The second nightmare scenario, according to booksellers and authors, is that Amazon will find a way to tilt Australia’s labor, tax and import laws in its favor.

Stock grants for employees could be used to decrease tax liability, as Amazon has done in Europe. What else Amazon might do is a question lawyers and consultants are already gaming out, while lobbying the Australian government, which at this point seems determined to protect its own.

Starting in July, a new digital services tax will be levied on all online purchases of 1,000 Australian dollars, or roughly $780, or less. Netflix, eBay and Amazon will all be affected.

Australian lawmakers have also resisted calls from economists on the government’s own Productivity Commission to eliminate the country’s parallel import restrictions. The rules essentially give Australian publishers a national monopoly over any book they publish. Booksellers are not allowed to import books from another country if the book has been published by an Australian copyright holder within 30 days of overseas release and if the Australian publisher can supply the book within 90 days.

Critics say the rules are protectionist, and a cause of overpriced books.

But these restrictions, copyright lawyers say, should keep Amazon from stocking its warehouses with cheaper books shipped in from abroad. And they are widely seen by authors as the foundation of Australia’s literary culture.

The copyright law that went into effect in May 1969 essentially created a protected market in a country that, until then, had relied almost entirely on Britain for its books.

Now, many authors say, any effort to soften the rules or let Amazon skirt them would weaken local publishers, reduce royalty rates and return Australia to a reliance on outsiders who may not care to publish the array of Australian authors now in circulation.

“What makes me anxious is this sort of return to a centralizing of cultural power,” said Mr. Winton, who has published more than two dozen books for adults and children. For Australia, he said, Amazon may represent a step backward: “It’s a retrograde move.”

Price vs. Personal Interaction

Inside the Readings flagship store on Lygon Street, Australian authors get prominent displays on front tables and on the first shelves people see.

At Riverbend Books in Brisbane, another independent bookseller well known to publishers and authors, roughly 60 percent of the books are written by Australians.

Would Amazon give local authors the same level of promotion? Will it publish and print its own books in Australia or make sellers of used books more dominant? Will it undermine or compete with the community ethos that bookstores like Readings represent?

“We have a lot of questions,” said Mr. Rubbo, 69, a quiet, casual man with intense blue eyes who has expanded Readings to seven locations in and around Melbourne over the past 41 years.

He said that since the arrival of Borders in 2002, Readings and many other bookstores have strengthened their bonds with local authors and readers. Events are now the norm; Readings will do 260 this year alone.

The strongest independent bookstores, while maintaining a 1990s feel at times, complete with racks of music CDs, are also linked up with universities and schools and Australia’s well-known writers festivals in Sydney, Melbourne and elsewhere.

Many customers, while open to buying some items from Amazon, seem pleased with the status quo for books. “I like seeing the physical book itself, and the chance to find things you wouldn’t find otherwise,” said Sonya Theys, 24, who was browsing at Readings one recent evening.

Authors are even more zealous. “If literature is a religion, the bookstore is the church,” said Alec Patric, an award-winning novelist who also happens to work at Readings. “It’s a delicate equilibrium.”

Amazon’s deals with publishers could upset all of that. Mr. Rubbo said he has pressed them to keep the playing field even, to not give Amazon any special treatment with delivery time or price.

Suzy Wilson, the owner of Riverbend, has made the same case to major Australian publishers. She said she was told not to fret. “They were giving me a bit of a pep talk really,” she said.

But as negotiations between Amazon and local publishers continue, the major players are staying silent. Penguin Random House and Hachette turned down requests for comment. Michael Gordon-Smith, the chief executive of the Australian Publishers Association, sent a statement by email: “We welcome any new ways to get books to Australian readers and any new investment in the Australian industry that is consistent with good corporate citizenship and respect for creators’ rights.”

Ms. Wilson and Mr. Rubbo both said that Amazon’s power could bend the will of even the well-intentioned. In their nightmares, they see declining revenues, shuttered stores and silent, dying neighborhoods.

“It’s really crucial that these places survive and thrive,” Ms. Wilson said. “I wish I was more optimistic.”",Australia’s Amazon Book Battle,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/books/australias-amazon-book-battle.html

Q. Why are hearing aids so incredibly costly? Is it patents? A lock on manufacturing? With today’s digital revolution, it would seem that they should be approaching the cost of eyeglasses.

A. Hearing aids remain expensive — $900 to $3,500 or more per ear — but that is likely to be changing soon. The Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017, which became law in August, includes a provision for selling hearing aids over the counter to adults with mild to moderate hearing loss in two to three years. The extra time allows the F.D.A. to establish safety, effectiveness and labeling standards. Under the new law, hearing aids are expected to cost around $300 or less per ear.

Experts don’t know exactly why hearing aids are still so costly, except that companies continue to invest in improvements, and fees usually cover the services of a highly trained audiologist.

Cost reductions can’t come soon enough for those who depend on hearing aids. Barbara Kelley, executive director of the Hearing Loss Association of America, said her office gets a handful of calls every day from people needing help paying for hearing aids. The association refers them to the Department of Veterans Affairs, Medicaid or foundations like the Lions Club, depending on their military status and where they live. “It’s still really tough,” she said. Medicare does not cover the cost of hearing aids, though there’s a bill before Congress that would require such coverage.

“Eighty percent of people who could benefit from a hearing aid don’t get one,” Ms. Kelley said, often because of cost or access to care. “Some of the reason is stigma: They don’t want to be seen as being old.”

Research has clearly shown that hearing problems can have serious health consequences, leading to falls, cognitive problems, depression and social isolation.

The Athletic, he said, promised not to start a Pittsburgh site.
Instead, The Athletic Pittsburgh hired a second writer away from DK Pittsburgh Sports recently.
According to skeptical media executives and investors interviewed for this article, something similar is likely the best-case scenario for The Athletic.","These reporters are skilled experts feeling the strains of a crippled industry, and many are looking for a way out. Mather knows it.

Mather, 37, founded The Athletic with Adam Hansmann, 29. They worked together at Strava, an app and website for weekend warriors and elite competitors that calls itself the social network for athletes.

That experience, along with their frustration at the difficulty of finding high-quality sportswriting that wasn’t bogged down by pop-up ads, informed their big bet. They believe there are hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions, of enthusiastic sports fans willing to pay $60 annually — less with frequently offered discounts — for good reporting and writing, a clean app and no ads.

They have raised almost $8 million in venture capital funding and have recurring subscription revenue, ensuring the site won’t shutter soon. But the question everybody in sports media is asking is what happens in three, five, seven years? Will The Athletic’s business model allow it to survive that long?

Newspapers are a classic example of a bundle. Subscribers might read just one section, but their subscription gets them the entire paper. Mather and Hansmann believe that sports is an undervalued part of that bundle, and that there are tens of thousands of sports fans in each city who don’t care about the other sections, and would rather jettison their subscription and pay for The Athletic instead.

“I think the sports page has carried local papers for a while, and they don’t treat it well,” Mather said.

After waiting nine months to debut their second local site, Toronto, and another five months for their third, Cleveland, the company planned to grow the number of local sites slowly, before tackling national ones. But that timeline was drastically altered after layoffs at ESPN, Sports Illustrated, Yahoo Sports, Fox Sports, Bleacher Report, Vice Sports and Vocativ this spring and summer put dozens of talented, well-connected journalists on the market.

“I’d say it’s probably the largest talent displacement in sports media ever,” Hansmann said.

The Athletic raised $5.6 million in venture capital financing in July to take advantage of the moment, adding to the $2.3 million seed round it raised in January.

“It was really hard to see everything that was happening in terms of the layoffs,” said Deepen Parikh, an executive at Courtside Ventures, one of The Athletic’s largest investors, “and knowing we really, genuinely had an opportunity to capitalize on it and not take it.”

The Athletic did not need to raise any financing, its executives said. Only one of the local sites, Toronto, breaks even — Chicago and the Bay Area and “a few smaller markets” are on track to do so by the end of the year, executives said — but most subscribers pay upfront for an annual subscription, so The Athletic had cash in hand to continue operations.

The company has wasted no time spending the new money. It started sites in Detroit, Philadelphia, the Bay Area and Minnesota, brought on the former Fox Sports writer Stewart Mandel to lead a national college football site and hired the former Sports Illustrated writer Seth Davis to head up another for national college basketball.

Paul Fichtenbaum, a former top Sports Illustrated editor who had been working for The Athletic as a consultant, was hired to oversee the national sites and start a longform vertical, called Ink. “Building a company is exciting,” he said, but the “bigger opportunity to change an industry is really something that we all aspire to.”

Now the plan is to raise even more money soon, and to gain a foothold in every American and Canadian professional sports market within two years. “If there is a hockey, basketball, baseball or football team” in a city, Hansmann said, “that’s the starting point.”

It is that kind of ambition, in an industry that has sustained a decade of retrenchment, that has most of the sports media industry rooting for The Athletic’s success. Every writer knows he or she could be the next victim of a naïve pivot to video.

But Mather and Hansmann have displayed sharp elbows, and not everybody is happy with them. Newspaper sports editors have been left smarting after losing reporters to The Athletic — four writers for The Athletic Bay Area worked at the Bay Area Newspaper Group a few months ago. And then there is Dejan Kovacevic, a longtime Pittsburgh sportswriter who started DK Pittsburgh Sports, a subscription-based local sports site that in some ways is a model for The Athletic, three years ago.

In an email, Kovacevic said Mather and Hansmann approached him to be an adviser but they couldn’t agree on compensation. The Athletic, he said, promised not to start a Pittsburgh site. Instead, The Athletic Pittsburgh hired a second writer away from DK Pittsburgh Sports recently. Kovacevic also said that Mather and Hansmann were unhappy when he sold a copy of his publishing platform to Greg Bedard, who launched a subscription sports site in Boston this summer, because they said it raised their cost of doing business.

Mather said that when The Athletic’s executives spoke with Kovacevic they had no intention of expanding into Pittsburgh in the near term, and that he and Hansmann “only make ‘promises’ to our customers, employees, investors and partners.”

“We are doing great work,” Mather said. “We treat our writers really well, we pay them well, and we are doing amazing journalism. If someone has a problem with that, that’s on them.”

Mather and Hansmann also don’t hew to traditional — they would say antiquated — norms about the separation of business and advertising efforts, and are already cozier with the teams they cover than many outlets. They have an agreement with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, for instance, whereby Argonauts season ticket-holders can receive a trial subscription to The Athletic, paid for by the Argonauts.

Hansmann said The Athletic pulled no punches in its reporting on the Argonauts, while Mather suggested The Athletic could partner with teams on insider video or events in which subscribers go to the stadium early for exclusive access. Fichtenbaum said his understanding was the Argonauts partnership was a one-off.

Similarly, many of The Athletic’s representatives sang the virtues of its digital presentation, which shuns banner ads. But Parikh, the investor, said, “advertising has a very real opportunity down the road with The Athletic,” before adding that it would have to be “customer centric.”

Mather and Hansmann declined to disclose subscription numbers, but they have said Toronto, their most successful local site, has more than 15,000 subscribers. The national sites figure to boost local subscription numbers.

As The Athletic’s costs rise — it will soon need a bigger office, and the company is beginning to hire nonrevenue-generating support staff like accountants and human resources personnel — the company will seemingly need to attract casual sports fans. But Mather and Hansmann are not convinced.

“In a city like Chicago, there are 100,000 die-hard fans,” Mather said. “That is a very lucrative subscription business. There are over 100,000 die-hard fans of Chicago teams outside of Chicago,” he added, and he says they aren’t served well. “Bleacher Report is empty calories. SB Nation is empty calories. The newspapers are doing nothing.”

More journalists and investors will pay attention if The Athletic can get to the point that it can rely only on its own revenue, rather than having to turn to venture capital. Successful online media subscription products usually either cost hundreds or thousands of dollars annually and appeal to information-starved professionals — like The Information and Politico Pro — or have relatively inexpensive subscriptions that support relatively few writers — like DK Pittsburgh Sports and Stratechery.

While The Athletic aspires to be the Spotify or Netflix of sports media, the only media companies that have achieved scale with a relatively low price point (and the help of ads) are the very same newspapers The Athletic is intent on destroying.

Bleacher Report was the big sports media winner of the era when scale and online advertising revenue seemed like the future of media. It was rarely profitable and raised $40 million in venture capital funding before being bought by Turner in 2012 for about $175 million. According to skeptical media executives and investors interviewed for this article, something similar is likely the best-case scenario for The Athletic.

Mather and Hansmann insist that they, and their investors, are in it for the long haul, and that the time is finally right for a subscription media product to go big. “The advertising business model does not align with quality,” Mather said. “It’s hot takes instead of objective analysis, it’s short-term instead of long-term, it’s serving sponsors instead of users, it’s thinking big instead of great.”

“It really comes down to the business model,” he added. “That is our core belief.”",Why The Athletic Wants to Pillage Newspapers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/sports/the-athletic-newspapers.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Eugene Smith Memorial Fund’s 2017 grant in Humanistic Photography for his project on the European migrant and refugee crisis.

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

“Coffee With Polio Experts” will not be picked up by Hulu anytime soon, but there is something compelling in these short videos put out by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

The formula is simple: Doctors who have spent years fighting polio in the world’s most remote regions sit down over coffee with a World Health Organization representative to tell war stories.

The production values are amateurish — cups rattle, the bustle of the coffee shop intrudes. But the tales can be gripping, and they are recalled by soldiers who save lives rather than taking them.

When the eradication drive began in the 1980s, polio paralyzed 1,000 children a day. Now, fewer than 100 a year suffer that fate. But the virus is never quite extinguished. Field commanders explain how the battle must be fought, literally village-to-village and house-to-house.

In the most recent video, Dr. Naveed Sadozai describes pulling off a highway in Afghanistan, hoping to vaccinate sheepherders in a camp. To avoid land mines, he drives only in recent tire tracks; because the herders have huge attack dogs, he cajoles them from inside the car.

To win over a father skeptical of the vaccine, Dr. Sadozai offers to buy a sheep and chooses an emaciated one with a withered leg. When the herder explains why his choice is bad, Dr. Sadozai turns the tables, saying he will let the herder be the sheep expert if he can be the medical expert. He prevails: All the father’s children are vaccinated.

In another video, Christopher Maher describes how the eradication campaign stopped the assassinations of vaccinators by the Pakistani Taliban: staffers recruited additional vaccinators from the same clans as the attackers.

In a third, Dr. Ousmane Diop, a laboratory expert, explains how, as the virus became ever more rare, the campaign shifted from taking stool samples from crippled children to sampling the sewage of entire neighborhoods for signs of the virus.

And while it has nothing to do the eradication campaign, a startling polio-related video can be seen on the website Sweatpants and Coffee: Dergin Tokmak, a child of Turkish immigrants in Germany whose legs were withered by childhood polio, does a leaping, spinning break-dance routine on a pair of bright red crutches.

Daniel Day-Lewis has always been unpredictable, and he may have delivered his biggest surprise yet when he announced in June that he would retire from acting after reteaming with his “There Will Be Blood” director, Paul Thomas Anderson, on one final film, “Phantom Thread.” The trailer for the movie has just been released, and it looks to be a portrait of an artist as intense and focused as the man who plays him.

I have had a decent career and I’ve got a good family here and a lot of friends. So I’m not sitting back sulking. But it would have been nice to see what could have happened.”

Hand is an accomplished coach in the English Premier Ice Hockey League and with the national program, but his most impressive achievements came during an unrivaled 34-season playing career.

Growing up in Edinburgh, Hand headed to the local skating rink when he was 7 for peace and closure after the death of his father from a heart attack. Playing alongside his brothers, he was eventually discovered by a local team, the Murrayfield Racers, with whom he made his professional debut at 14.

By 17, Hand led the British Hockey League with 116 assists in 50 games to go with 99 goals. He surpassed the 100-goal mark in each of the next four seasons.

Those early years were the statistical high point of a pro career spanning more than three decades during which Hand collected 2,992 assists and 4,634 points, both British hockey records. Wayne Gretzky, the player to whom Hand is most frequently compared in Britain, established N.H.L. records considered unmatchable with 1,963 assists and 2,857 points.

“The goalies were bad; that’s what it was,” Hand said modestly when asked about his British hockey exploits.

Whatever the reason for his remarkable point totals, it was enough to gain the attention of the Oilers, who had built one of the great dynasties in league history when they selected Hand with the final pick in the 1986 draft, making him the first British player drafted by an N.H.L. team. By then, Hand had earned a tryout with Calgary, Edmonton’s biggest rival.

“Our league had a deal with Calgary — they would invite the young player of the year in Britain to the camp in Calgary,” Hand said. “It was a token gesture. I don’t think they realized there was a possible opportunity that one of the players could make the team.”

But his rights were officially owned by the Oilers, who had won consecutive Stanley Cups in 1984 and 1985, so Hand reported to Edmonton training camp in 1986. On a club that would win three more Cups in the next four seasons, Hand made an impression despite facing long odds to make the team.

“There was absolutely no question when he came over for that first training camp that he had enough hockey skill,” said Bill Tuele, the Oilers’ former director of public relations. “He had never been pushed to any great limit. He was a neat kid. He was a bit overwhelmed by the whole process. To be thrown into that caldron was almost an impossible task.”

With few roster spots available, Hand was sent to the Victoria Cougars of the Western Hockey League. After collecting 8 points in three games, a homesick Hand returned to Edinburgh to finish the season with the Racers.

He was invited back to Oilers camp the next season and was one of Edmonton’s final cuts. But Hand again decided to head home rather than report to Edmonton’s top developmental team in the American Hockey League.

He would not receive another invitation to an N.H.L. camp, instead flourishing in Britain and becoming the only hockey player to receive the prestigious Member of the British Empire award from Queen Elizabeth II.

His 82 points with the national team made him the country’s career leading scorer. After 14 seasons serving in a dual role as a player and coach with a number of British teams, Hand retired as a player in 2015 at age 47. He served as head coach of the Manchester Phoenix of the English Premier Ice Hockey League until the club ceased operations in January.

Now consisting of 12 teams, the league is entering what local officials believe could be a new golden age for the sport in Britain, with former N.H.L. players joining the league.

“In Tony’s day, he was the best player in the U.K. by far,” said Andy French, the general secretary of Ice Hockey U.K., the national governing body for the sport. “He was better than a lot of the imports. He had a vision that nobody else had. He’s now passing that quality that he had down through to the younger generation of players. I’m hoping that we can produce another Tony Hand.”

For all the success he enjoyed at home, Hand still, three decades later, sometimes thinks about his decision to leave Edmonton.

“It wasn’t like I was unambitious,” he said. “I just didn’t know. I had never been away. Obviously when you’re young you make these decisions, and I had never had a father figure to sort of guide me. I don’t sit and regret it. But did I make the right decision? Probably not.”

Since ending his playing career, Hand has contributed as a scout and coach to the British national team, which in April won the 1B division of the world championships to earn promotion to Division 1A, one level below the top tier.

Hand’s hope is that Britain’s accomplishments in international hockey can help him find the kind of opportunity in the N.H.L. he never quite pursued in an otherwise illustrious hockey career.

“Your social alliances affect how you weight information,” said Dr. Seifert.","Agents with links to the Russian government set up an endless array of fake accounts and websites and purchased a slew of advertisements on Google and Facebook, spreading dubious claims that seemed intended to sow division all along the political spectrum — “a cultural hack,” in the words of one expert.

Yet the psychology behind social media platforms — the dynamics that make them such powerful vectors of misinformation in the first place — is at least as important, experts say, especially for those who think they’re immune to being duped. For all the suspicions about social media companies’ motives and ethics, it is the interaction of the technology with our common, often subconscious psychological biases that makes so many of us vulnerable to misinformation, and this has largely escaped notice.

Skepticism of online “news” serves as a decent filter much of the time, but our innate biases allow it to be bypassed, researchers have found — especially when presented with the right kind of algorithmically selected “meme.”

At a time when political misinformation is in ready supply, and in demand, “Facebook, Google, and Twitter function as a distribution mechanism, a platform for circulating false information and helping find receptive audiences,” said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College (and occasional contributor to The Times’s Upshot column).

For starters, said Colleen Seifert, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, “People have a benevolent view of Facebook, for instance, as a curator, but in fact it does have a motive of its own. What it’s actually doing is keeping your eyes on the site. It’s curating news and information that will keep you watching.”

That kind of curating acts as a fertile host for falsehoods by simultaneously engaging two predigital social-science standbys: the urban myth as “meme,” or viral idea; and individual biases, the automatic, subconscious presumptions that color belief.

The first process is largely data-driven, experts said, and built into social media algorithms. The wide circulation of bizarre, easily debunked rumors — so-called Pizzagate, for example, the canard that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex ring from a Washington-area pizza parlor — is not entirely dependent on partisan fever (though that was its origin).

For one, the common wisdom that these rumors gain circulation because most people conduct their digital lives in echo chambers or “information cocoons” is exaggerated, Dr. Nyhan said.

In a forthcoming paper, Dr. Nyhan and colleagues review the relevant research, including analyses of partisan online news sites and Nielsen data, and find the opposite. Most people are more omnivorous than presumed; they are not confined in warm bubbles containing only agreeable outrage.

But they don’t have to be for fake news to spread fast, research also suggests. Social media algorithms function at one level like evolutionary selection: Most lies and false rumors go nowhere, but the rare ones with appealing urban-myth “mutations” find psychological traction, then go viral.

There is no precise formula for such digital catnip. The point, experts said, is that the very absurdity of the Pizzagate lie could have boosted its early prominence, no matter the politics of those who shared it.

“My experience is that once this stuff gets going, people just pass these stories on without even necessarily stopping to read them,” Mr. McKinney said. “They’re just participating in the conversation without stopping to look hard” at the source.

Digital social networks are “dangerously effective at identifying memes that are well adapted to surviving, and these also tend to be the rumors and conspiracy theories that are hardest to correct,” Dr. Nyhan said.

One reason is the raw pace of digital information sharing, he said: “The networks make information run so fast that it outruns fact-checkers’ ability to check it. Misinformation spreads widely before it can be downgraded in the algorithms.”

The extent to which Facebook and other platforms function as “marketers” of misinformation, similar to the way they market shoes and makeup, is contentious. In 2015, a trio of behavior scientists working at Facebook inflamed the debate in a paper published in the prominent journal Science.

The authors analyzed the news feeds of some 10 million users in the United States who posted their political views, and concluded that “individuals’ choices played a stronger role in limiting exposure” to contrary news and commentary than Facebook’s own algorithmic ranking — which gauges how interesting stories are likely to be to individual users, based on data they have provided.

Outside critics lashed the study as self-serving, while other researchers said the analysis was solid and without apparent bias.

The other dynamic that works in favor of proliferating misinformation is not embedded in the software but in the biological hardware: the cognitive biases of the human brain.

Purely from a psychological point of view, subtle individual biases are at least as important as rankings and choice when it comes to spreading bogus news or Russian hoaxes — like a false report of Muslim men in Michigan collecting welfare for multiple wives.

Merely understanding what a news report or commentary is saying requires a temporary suspension of disbelief. Mentally, the reader must temporarily accept the stated “facts” as possibly true. A cognitive connection is made automatically: Clinton-sex offender, Trump-Nazi, Muslim men-welfare.

And refuting those false claims requires a person to first mentally articulate them, reinforcing a subconscious connection that lingers far longer than people presume.

Over time, for many people, it is that false initial connection that stays the strongest, not the retractions or corrections: “Was Obama a Muslim? I seem to remember that....”

In a recent analysis of the biases that help spread misinformation, Dr. Seifert and co-authors named this and several other automatic cognitive connections that can buttress false information.

Another is repetition: Merely seeing a news headline multiple times in a news feed makes it seem more credible before it is ever read carefully, even if it’s a fake item being whipped around by friends as a joke.

And, as salespeople have known forever, people tend to value the information and judgments offered by good friends over all other sources. It’s a psychological tendency with significant consequences now that nearly two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news from social media.

“Your social alliances affect how you weight information,” said Dr. Seifert. “We overweight information from people we know.”

The casual, social, wisecracking nature of thumbing through and participating in the digital exchanges allows these biases to operate all but unchecked, Dr. Seifert said.

Stopping to drill down and determine the true source of a foul-smelling story can be tricky, even for the motivated skeptic, and mentally it’s hard work. Ideological leanings and viewing choices are conscious, downstream factors that come into play only after automatic cognitive biases have already had their way, abetted by the algorithms and social nature of digital interactions.

It’s genius” – Mr. Farrell was in Chicago filming “Widows” with Steve McQueen, and before that working on “Roman J. Israel, Esq.,” with Denzel Washington. And before that was “The Beguiled,” with Sofia Coppola, and “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” which was shot last summer in Cincinnati and, of Mr. Farrell’s recent films, has perhaps affected him the most.

Written by Mr. Lanthimos with Efthymis Filippou, the film is far darker than “The Lobster,” and suffused with an increasingly claustrophobic dread. Mr. Farrell adopted a monotone for the part similar to that of his “Lobster” role, but the characters’ similarity ends there.

David, his “Lobster” character, was doughy, inward, guileless and desperately lonely, all of which felt especially poignant coming from a live wire like Mr. Farrell, who said he felt great liberation in being so contained. “There was no attempt and no desire, as written, to be in any way cool, any way interesting, any way suave,” he said. But Steven, the heart surgeon he played in “Killing,” is cunning and arrogant, and by the end of the production, Mr. Farrell said, he felt very depressed.

He was drawn to the part by the same tug that drew him to “The Lobster,” finding brilliance in the twisted worlds Mr. Lanthimos creates. And in Mr. Farrell, Mr. Lanthimos said he found a true creative partner.

“It’s a gift to have that kind of relationship, it’s easier to go further and explore other things,” Mr. Lanthimos said. “This was a challenge, something more different and complex and dark, and I knew he had the understanding and tone.”

For all his work on big films, Mr. Farrell has long preferred smaller films anyway and the specific stories they can tell. When Martin McDonagh approached him to play a hit man for “In Bruges,” basically throwing him a lifeline, he almost turned down the part. He’d been in a string of bad movies and was still feeling the lingering burn of his Alexander the Great movie. (Among the sharper barbs: “He seems like a moody sad sack that I wouldn’t follow to the grocery store much less into battle.”) He worried his name might scare people away.

Mr. McDonagh persuaded him anyway. “The character needed to be lovable and appealing even though he’s done something horrific and unforgivable, and it’s easy to love Colin, and to believe that sense of guilt he showed so well,” Mr. McDonagh wrote by email. “Also, I don’t think he ever really didn’t want to do the part for a second!”

For Mr. Farrell, it was a shaky time. He was scant months out of rehab, having finally caved to his family’s pressures to get straight. Asked what hastened his bottoming out, Mr. Farrell quipped, “Just existing.” But really, he added, it was the intensity of sudden fame, which came fast after Joel Schumacher cast him in “Tigerland” (2000) and then “Phone Booth” (2002).

“Getting all these platitudes and things being said about you, and all these gifts, it wasn’t in my DNA to believe any of this stuff,” he said. “You try and match the hype, but I never believed it.”

Mr. Farrell is from Castleknock, a relatively well-to-do Dublin suburb, and studied at the Gaiety School of Acting in Dublin before landing a role in 1998 on the BBC soap “Ballykissangel.” He took the Irish national commandment of not getting ahead of yourself to Hollywood, “foolishly and understandably,” he now says, equating personal change with betraying his roots.

“I remember making a promise to myself, ‘Don’t change, don’t change, remember where you come from,’” he said, “But change is inevitable. You don’t change, you get sickness, your life will fall apart on the inside.”

His antics filled gossip pages, but he swears many of them were lost to blackouts. I asked about the time he kissed a reporter on camera on the red carpet, and his eyes widened. “Did I? Who? Which one?” he asked. “I swear to God, I lost so much time.” A little while later, a button on my blouse popped, and as I quickly refastened it, he steadfastly held my gaze, and then pointed to his eyes. “I kept right here, the whole time,” he teased. “Back in the day I would’ve leaned in for a kiss, obviously.”

The exchange was light and playful, and the interview took place before The New York Times published its exposé on the producer Harvey Weinstein, whose reported sexual misconduct Mr. Farrell would later denounce as “atrocious.” In our chat, though, Mr. Farrell did address the latitude given to stars.

“The one thing that fame asks you to do, I have learned, is to police yourself,” he said. “You get away with murder, you get away with mistreating people, you won’t be called out on things you really should be called out with, you really do.”

He was glad that those days were behind him, he said, not least because sobriety has made him a much better dad. His first son, James Padraig, was born in 2003 (James’s mother is the model Kim Bordenave), and initially Mr. Farrell figured he’d be his son’s friend. “’Cause that’s what a 6-month-old grub needs,” he cracked, “a 27-year-old drunk, high friend.” He had his second son, Henry, with his former girlfriend the actress Alicja Bachleda-Curus. Mr. Farrell shares custody of his sons, and says he can’t think of a decision he has made in the last dozen or so years without thinking about how it would impact them.

Now his life centers on the boys, his home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, yoga (“I said I love it, I didn’t say I’m doing it”), and saunas (“very purifying”).

“He was a wild guy, and now I think he’s channeled all of that into his family, and his work,” said the director Dan Gilroy, who said he cast Mr. Farrell in “Roman Israel” in part because he knew he could hold his own with Denzel Washington.

Mr. Farrell said he planned to take a long break, and he was open to what’s next, be it action heroes, even though he loathes guns (“Hate em!”) or, in the vein of Mr. Lanthimos’s films, more unsexy roles, even if he might be somewhat alone in characterizing them that way.

“But I think if you consider the current situation in Afghanistan, and we were talking about this a few minutes ago, and you look a few years in the past to what the circumstances were, Afghanistan has come quite a distance already in terms of creating a much more vibrant population, a much more vibrant government, education system, a larger economy,” he said in a small windowless conference room during a hurried eight-minute news conference. “So there are opportunities to strengthen the foundations of a prosperous Afghanistan society.”

Mr. Tillerson saw none of that hoped-for blooming.

When the huge maw of the C-17 aircraft that he flew into Bagram opened, he was greeted by Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of United States operations in Afghanistan, along with a sizable contingent of soldiers and security guards.

They piled into a motorcade and drove the few minutes to the base’s bunkerlike headquarters, passing hangers constructed by Russia, another of the foreign forces to be humbled in Afghanistan. Huge concrete blast walls lined much of the route. Helicopters patrolled the perimeter, and two security blimps equipped with long-range cameras hovered.

At the headquarters building, a former prison, Mr. Tillerson and General Nicholson met in another windowless room with Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani; its chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah; and its national security adviser, Hanif Atmar, as an armored truck and Humvee guarded outside.

After the men sat down, Mr. Tillerson said: “We had a pretty smooth flight.”

Mr. Ghani replied, “We arranged the weather for you.”

Mr. Tillerson brought with him a six-person press contingent that was taken aside late the night before and sworn to secrecy about the trip until his plane returned to Doha, Qatar, where the trip had originated.

After eight months of internal discussions, President Trump in August announced his policy for Afghanistan, an effort to prevent an obvious loss in the country. Commanders will be allowed to request troops as needed, and the administration emphasized that it would increasingly rely on regional partners like India to improve stability.

Mr. Trump also promised to pressure Pakistan, which United States officials have long accused of playing a double game in Afghanistan — publicly supporting the United States mission here while secretly bankrolling and giving shelter to the Taliban and other insurgent groups.

But the massive air base here demonstrates why the administration cannot get too tough with Pakistan, since nearly all of the supplies for this fortress city are transported by air or land through Pakistani territory. Soldiers can order supplies and gifts from Amazon, which delivers daily to the base.

Mr. Tillerson will visit Islamabad on Tuesday for his first talks with Pakistani leaders since he delivered a speech last week in which he called for improved ties with India, Pakistan’s rival. In the speech, Pakistan got only a brief, none-too-complimentary mention.

On Monday, Mr. Tillerson said that the United States was increasingly concerned about the stability of Pakistan, which has a large nuclear arsenal.

“Pakistan needs to, I think, take a cleareyed view of the situation that they’re confronted with in terms of the number of terrorist organizations that find safe haven inside of Pakistan,” he said.

Mr. Tillerson said the United States would remain in Afghanistan until peace was restored. Or perhaps until things get much worse.

“The president has made it clear that we’re here to stay until we can secure a process of reconciliation and peace,” he said. “It’s not an unlimited commitment.

The historical parallels to F.D.R. and 1938, while inexact, are intriguing. Like Mr. Trump, Roosevelt was piqued by opposition from members of his own party and set out to replace them with more ideologically aligned candidates who would support his agenda — in his case, liberals who would take out Southern conservatives. But voters resented the intervention and repudiated him by re-electing nearly all of his Democratic rivals.

“His attempt to purge the party of conservative Democrats proved to be a serious mistake,” said Robert Dallek, whose biography “Franklin D. Roosevelt: A Political Life” will be published next month. “He lost every primary contest except one, and 60 percent of the country disapproved of his purge.”

Although born out of frustration, Roosevelt’s purge was part of a desire to force a party realignment. In those days, both parties had liberals and conservatives. Roosevelt in effect was trying to make the Democrats the more uniformly liberal party while leaving the Republicans as the conservative party. He would fail, but in decades to come, that realignment would eventually occur on its own.

“His goal was two responsible, unified parties to replace, as he said, ‘Tweedledum and Tweedledee’ parties,” said Susan Dunn, a Williams College historian and author of “Roosevelt’s Purge,” the definitive book on the 1938 election. “To me, Trump’s purge is only about vindictiveness. He wants to strike out at and defeat the people who have dared to criticize him.”

Other presidents have been incensed by wayward members of their parties, but few attempted what Roosevelt did and what Mr. Trump is threatening. Karl Rove, deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush, at times grew livid at Republicans who defied the White House. But he said the idea of challenging them in primaries was anathema.

Roosevelt’s experience showed the dangers of isolation in the White House, said Mr. Rove, who has sharply criticized Mr. Bannon’s efforts. “The lesson is it’s better to try to influence by encouragement than by opposition,” he said. “It’s important to keep focused on the main things people want you to keep focused on — what are the big issues of the day? And don’t let your personal pique guide your political actions.” (Mr. Bannon said he would not reply because it would be “punching down.”)

Unlike Mr. Trump, with his historically low poll ratings, Roosevelt was broadly popular at the time. He swept to re-election in 1936 with 61 percent of the vote, winning all but two states in one of the biggest landslides in American history, and his approval ratings remained high. While Mr. Trump’s Republicans can afford to lose only two votes in the Senate, Roosevelt’s Democrats enjoyed large majorities in Congress.

But Roosevelt grew angry at resistance from Democrats to additional domestic programs and repeated Supreme Court rulings overturning parts of the New Deal. The confrontation came to a head when he sought to pack the Supreme Court by adding as many as six more justices to seize control of the bench, an idea that provoked fierce opposition in both parties and ultimately collapsed.

Harry Hopkins, Roosevelt’s confidant, railed against Democrats “who tricked the voters by wearing our insignia only to turn against us as soon as they got in office.” Roosevelt was so angry that his “resentment crystallized into the desire to crush all who conspired against the throne,” said George Creel, a journalist and critic at the time. So Roosevelt put together a team to organize a campaign against the conservative Democrats. The newspapers called it the “elimination committee” and labeled the campaign Roosevelt’s “purge,” a reference to Stalin’s terror in the Soviet Union.

Advisers like Frances Perkins feared it was “reckless” but could not talk him out of it. On June 24, 1938, Roosevelt announced during a fireside chat that he had a responsibility to carry out the 1936 platform and therefore would oppose the election of “outspoken reactionaries” and hypocrites “who say ‘yes’ to a progressive objective, but who also find some reason to oppose any specific proposal designed to gain that objective.”

He took on conservatives like Senators Walter F. George of Georgia, Ellison D. Smith of South Carolina, Millard E. Tydings of Maryland and Guy M. Gillette of Iowa. Mr. Smith, a fierce segregationist known as “Cotton Ed,” despised Roosevelt and referred to the New Deal as the “Jackass Age.” But Mr. Smith and the others won anyway. Roosevelt managed to take out only one rival in the House. Amid the Democratic discord and the aftermath of a recession, Republicans swept to victory in the fall, picking up eight Senate seats and 81 House seats by Ms. Dunn’s count.

“Unfortunately, his hubris overwhelmed his normally impeccable political instincts,” said Paul Sparrow, director of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum. But it had unanticipated benefits. “The good news for history,” he said, “is that this embarrassment taught him an important lesson: Don’t get too far out in front of the American voter, a lesson he applied just two years later as he carefully laid the groundwork for America’s entry into World War II.”

Indeed, Ms. Dunn said some of the same conservative Democrats who survived Roosevelt’s purge ultimately became his strongest allies during the buildup to the war. Mr. Tydings backed Roosevelt’s compulsory universal military service, and Mr. George played a key role in passing the Lend-Lease Act to supply Britain and other countries with military aid.

FRANKENSTEIN

The First Two Hundred Years

By Christopher Frayling

Illustrated. 208 pp. Reel Art Press. $39.95.

It is (still) alive. In the two centuries since Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley wrote “Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus” in 1818, her eight-foot monster has become the ultimate emblem of the uneasy borderline separating what science can do and what it should do. As the scholar Christopher Frayling writes in his new, amply illustrated history of the novel and its enduring fascination, “The real creation myth of modern times…is no longer Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.” In the age of stem cells, genetic engineering, cloning, three-parent babies, and cryogenic attempts at resurrection, the “real creation myth is ‘Frankenstein.’”

The nuances of Shelley’s novel were largely shed in the formation of that myth. Victor Frankenstein, the complex, tortured genius, became a mad scientist; his creature went from a French-speaking, poetry-reading autodidact to a grunting, groaning killer. Through prints, paintings, ephemera and photography, Frayling traces the creature’s visual evolution. In Richard Brinsley Peake’s 1823 play “Presumption, or the Fate of Frankenstein,” the first stage production of the novel, the monster appears as an unwieldy, but not unattractive, muscle-bound giant in a toga. Political cartoonists simplified the monster to caricature perceived social threats (“The Irish Frankenstein” became a popular motif). By the time Boris Karloff appeared onscreen in 1931, the monster had become a heavy-lidded, bolt-necked brute.

The novel’s stormy genesis is almost as famous as the monster’s lightning-charged birth. Frayling fastidiously pieces together the summer of 1816, when three Romantic luminaries and their friends spent a holiday on Lake Geneva. The relentlessly gloomy weather and frequent storms forced the unmarried Mary Godwin, Percy Shelley and Lord Byron to entertain themselves indoors. Gossipy English tourists in the region suspected these radical freethinkers were engaging in every form of bad behavior (one fashionable hotel even furnished a telescope from which guests could spy on the villa). But the reality was more sedate: Lord Byron challenged his friends to write ghost stories, and the rest is literary history. When the 18-year-old Godwin read her effort, she created modern science fiction as a genre.

The chronology of Frayling’s plates jumps around freely, between grindhouse film posters, New Yorker cartoons, postage stamps and the excellent woodcuts Lynd Kendall Ward created for a 1934 edition of the novel. The sheer quantity demonstrates just how thoroughly the creature has saturated contemporary culture. He appears in affectionate parodies (“The Munsters,” “Young Frankenstein”), campy riffs on the genre (“The Rocky Horror Picture Show”), cartoons (“The Simpsons”) and commercial kitsch (plastic toys and vodka ads). It’s a blithe pop jumble, with one jarring exception: Wedged between a poster for a blaxploitation film and an Archie comic is a spread containing a 1935 Vanity Fair cover depicting a Hitler-monster hybrid. Beside it is a photograph of a towering “German worker” statue in a swastika-draped exhibition staged by the Third Reich. The lack of context or commentary for these images is careless.

Unsurprisingly, Frayling devotes many plates to posters and production stills from the first “Frankenstein” feature and its sequels. What is surprising is how many visual cues the filmmakers took from art history. Doctor Frankenstein’s murdered wife lies prone across the nuptial bed just like the woman beset by demons in Henry Fuseli’s 1782 oil painting “The Nightmare.” In one spread, Elsa Lanchester, inhabiting the title role in the 1935 film “The Bride of Frankenstein,” appears in dramatic profile beside the famous ancient Egyptian bust of Nefertiti. According to Frayling, Karloff’s look was directly informed by “Los Chinchillas,” a print from Francisco de Goya’s 1799 series “Los Caprichos,” which unfortunately isn’t pictured.

Some of the book’s most intriguing images appear early on, when Frayling is describing the fierce debates and radical experiments that formed the novel’s scientific context. Galvanism is well represented (one engraving from 1803 shows the Italian scientist Giovanni Aldini electrifying the corpse of a hanged man to animate his limbs), but Frayling omits images illustrating the grisly underbelly of anatomical studies. Shelley wrote her novel at a time when medical schools’ demand for cadavers made body snatching a lucrative business. (Those who could afford to locked their loved ones’ coffins in metal cages.)

Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, I express myself with images.”

Other projects include a series for the NBCUniversal cable network Oxygen that is based on an article about the gruesome death of Jessica Chambers, a teenager who was burned alive in Mississippi, and an adaptation of the online cooking show “Mom vs. Chef” for USA, another NBC cable network.

Mr. Henick grew up in Great Neck, N.Y., and spent his childhood riding forklifts around his father’s floor-covering business at a warehouse in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood that has since been converted into an apartment building. His interest in media and technology began early.

When he was 14, he and his best friend created an MP3 website that drew a cease-and-desist letter from the Recording Industry Association of America because it hosted the “Titanic” soundtrack.

Several years later, Mr. Henick and his friend started one of the first ringtone sites in the United States. They bought the domain name NokiaUSA.net in the hope that Nokia customers would stumble on their site. Nokia was not pleased — it served the teenagers a cease-and-desist letter in the halls of their high school, after which they changed the company’s name to MobileSmarts. The business, Mr. Henick said, made a lot of money, although he wouldn’t specify how much.

“He’s an entrepreneur who knows how to build new things and new companies,” Jonah Peretti, the founder and chief executive of BuzzFeed, said in an interview. “I’m always amazed at the way he’s able to switch between these different models in his head and see the same things through a totally different lens.”

Mr. Henick’s experience as a teenage ringtone magnate gave him the idea to go west for college. “I was sort of already on that trajectory of wanting to head at least somewhere close to Silicon Valley, to figure out what was going on there,” he said.

He enrolled at Stanford, where he wrote for the campus humor magazine and played bass in a band called North of Cuba with his Theta Delta Chi fraternity brothers. After graduating with a degree in science, technology and society, he stayed at Stanford another year, earning a master’s in digital media studies, which he now calls “completely useless.”

“The professor would want to talk to us about LiveJournal and Myspace to a certain extent, and the students in the class would raise their hand and say, ‘Well, what do you think about Facebook?’” Mr. Henick said. “And they didn’t even know about it.”

From there, Mr. Henick studied producing at the University of Southern California’s film school in Los Angeles. During summer break, he attended a talk at the Skirball Cultural Center by the comedy producer Judd Apatow.

“I just went up to him and told him as much of my story as I could,” Mr. Henick said. “We were both from Long Island, both went to U.S.C., and I was looking for a gig.”

Mr. Apatow brought him on as an intern before hiring him as an assistant, so Mr. Henick spent his second year at U.S.C. balancing classes with reading scripts and checking out sets. After graduation, he worked on movies like “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” and “Step Brothers” before going out on his own as a writer, script doctor and start-up consultant.

Along the way, he and Ms. Killoch, who met at U.S.C., started a clothing company. They also got married.

“I clearly get bored very easily, because I do too many things,” Mr. Henick said. “I was literally sitting in my apartment writing movies, doing all right — that’s sort of the dream for some people — and I was like, ‘What else can I be doing?’”

Before Mr. Henick started at BuzzFeed, he was worried that he might end up restless yet again. But so far, he said, “I haven’t been bored once.”

When he joined three years ago, Tasty, the site’s popular food division, did not exist, and the company had yet to secure funding from NBCUniversal, which has since plowed in $400 million.

During Mr. Henick’s tenure, many digital media companies that once raked in millions of investment dollars found themselves struggling. A so-called pivot to video — a term sometimes used to cover layoffs of text-oriented staff members — swept the industry. Increasingly wary of the outsize influence of Facebook and Google — and hoping to siphon away some of the billions of advertising dollars still devoted to television — new media companies rediscovered old media, setting off a race into TV and film.

Cue Mr. Henick.

His mission is to help diversify BuzzFeed’s revenue stream: Executives expect that partnerships with production studios may bring in a third of the company’s revenue in the coming years.

Since it was founded in 2006, BuzzFeed, which is now valued at about $1.7 billion, has anticipated trends in the media business. Its move into the entertainment industry could be viewed as prescient — but the company is also said to be pursuing an initial public offering of stock, and associating itself with a glamorous business may have the side benefit of attracting investors and bolstering valuations.

“I don’t think we do anything specifically for that reason, but it’s always a byproduct,” Mr. Henick said. “If our business is stronger and it’s growing exponentially because we keep finding brand-new businesses to get into, it’s going to allow us to hopefully go public or invest in a lot more stuff elsewhere in the company.”

During a weekly check-in meeting at the old BuzzFeed lot on Sunset Boulevard, Mr. Henick swiveled around on his desk chair, a hand under his chin. He wore jeans, a light blue button-down and retro Air Jordan sneakers. Staff members talked about projects or possible deals with Netflix, MTV and Facebook.

The talk turned to a recent article about the right-wing website Breitbart and one of its former star employees, the rabble-rouser Milo Yiannopoulos. Did anyone see a film opportunity there? Someone suggested the Oscar-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin.

Mr. Henick’s eyes sparkled.

But for Mr. Nikolaou, the project, called “…Balkaniotheque” and sponsored by the Onassis Foundation, became more than a multifaceted look at the region. It has been a search for his very identity.

“I am a Greek,” said Mr. Nikolaou, who calls both Athens and Chalkis home. “And I have multiple identities. I belong in the East, in the West, but I also belong in the Balkans. This was forgotten for Greeks. None define themselves as Balkan. I had to find myself.”

Early on, Mr. Nikolaou said the project felt like psychoanalysis, a dive into his soul and the way he learned how to feel. He became fixated on the notion of a shared, repressed Balkan identity, one that he could unearth and restore to the collective memory.

“I wish to describe the Balkan soul,” he said. “Which seems to be dark and intractable, but it becomes simple, warm and human when it flames up.”

Mr. Nikolaou said he allowed the places to which he journeyed to choose him, not the other way around. In his travels, he’s been to nearly a dozen countries, exploring bustling capital cities as well as Roma ghettos and mountain villages.

“I made more than 20 trips trying not just to take photos, but to feel the Balkan reality,” he said. “To see those deep characteristics of the Balkan people that I believe are common all over the peninsula.”

The Balkan people were very hospitable, Mr. Nikolaou said, though he preferred to stay in the remote, rural areas. “There I met the most important people,” he said. “People totally free from the stress of our civilization. People with pain in their eyes but firstly, with big, big heart.”

He bore witness to funerals, celebrated at weddings and made intimate connections with those who opened their homes and lives to him. That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.

“The Balkans are a place where people look so different, but they are so alike in the way they face life,” he said. “And that must be what will lead us in the future. It may seem utopian, but deep inside me I believe that all people can live without borders. Even in the war-crushed Balkans, we can. It is enough to look at what it is that unites us. And what unites us is more important than what keeps us divided.”

Some blame the industry’s demise on the government’s refusal in 2013 to come to the rescue of the country’s automakers as they were battered by a high Australian dollar, high production costs and a shrinking domestic market.

Union officials estimated about 30,000 people lost their jobs as a result of the recent closures. In the area north of Adelaide, which has at times had South Australia’s highest unemployment rate and where Holden was the largest employer, nearly 1,000 people were left looking for work as a result of the automakers decision to cease production.

Leading politicians expressed dismay at the fate of the domestic auto industry.

“Personally, I feel very sad, as we all do, for the end of an era,” Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said during a radio interview on Friday. He added that the majority of workers in Elizabeth had either found new employment, decided to go back to school or retired.

But union representatives said most of the laid-off workers will never get work in the manufacturing industry again.

The average length of service among those at the plant was about 20 years, according to the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, and the average age of those affected by the closure was about 38.

But John Camillo, the union’s secretary in South Australia, said it was the workers over 50 that were particularly struggling to find new employment.

“It’s difficult out there, especially here in Adelaide,” Mr. Camillo said.

The decision to stop making cars in Australia reflects “the perfect storm of negative influences the car industry faces,” Mr. Turnbull said. He pointed to the continued strength of the Australian dollar, high production costs, and a small domestic market that is both competitive and fragmented.

The small size of the domestic car industry made it almost impossible to compete against foreign automakers.

“It just didn’t reach the scale of operation,” said John W. Freebairn, an economics professor at the University of Melbourne. “You have to compete with the smart U.S. manufacturers, the Japanese, the South Koreans and so on who are producing several hundred thousand units a year. Our guys were nowhere near that.”

But as of last week, it had “one person on board,” said Tischelle George, a senior adviser at the housing authority.

Mr. Stringer wants to expand the N.Y.C.H.A. program and Ms. George said plans are underway to recruit residents from Queensbridge Houses, where about 7,000 people live.

In ZIP codes where one in 10 residents were living in a N.Y.C.H.A. property, the average credit score was less than 630, while the average score in the city was 673, the report said.

But seven years in, such reporting is not being used extensively.

Reporting can feel “onerous” for landlords and property management companies that must set up mechanisms for reporting and must comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a federal law that requires accurate reporting that can be challenged by consumers, said Sarah Chenven, deputy director of Credit Builders Alliance, a nonprofit that helps low- and moderate-income households improve their credit.

Sajata Epps, a textiles and clothing designer who has lived in the same apartment in the Bronx for 17 years, said she plans to enroll in the program because she believes her timely payments could enhance her credit score.

Ms. Epps, 40, did not know her current score but said she was not approved for a line of credit about three years ago despite paying off school loans and the delinquent credit card she had in her 20s. “I’m looking forward to seeing how this reflects on me getting more credit and a line of capital from my business account,” said Ms. Epps, a leader of the Kelly Street Block Association.

Ms. Epps’s landlord, Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association, is on board with Mr. Stringer’s plan.

Advocates have persuaded some landlords by touting benefits, such as an incentive for tenants to pay rent on time.

But that incentive threatens to disenfranchise renters who have long used rent withholding as a way to force landlords to improve poor housing conditions, according to the National Consumer Law Center, a nonprofit that advocates for low-income and disadvantaged consumers.

“There’s definitely pitfalls to it when the landlord-tenant relationship is not good, and in New York City, that’s pretty frequent,” said James B. Fishman, a New York City tenant lawyer.

Mr. Fishman said there are sometimes fees for reporting rent, which would be passed on to the tenant. He also said the city has some special rental situations — for example, older and disabled tenants and tenants who pay reduced rent — that could complicate reporting. “These are things that need to be factored in the calculations,” he said. “It’s unlike anywhere else in the country.”",Comptroller Wants Paying Rent on Time to Count Toward Credit Score,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/nyregion/rent-payments-credit-score-scott-stringer.html

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Today we get to watch a face-off between the good guys and the bad guys, courtesy of David J. Kahn.

Today’s Theme

The GUNFIGHT AT / THE O.K. CORRAL (28D and 62A) took place in October 1881, and was a 30-second shootout between the lawmen of Tombstone, Ariz., and a group of outlaws called the Cowboys (in those days, it was considered an insult to call a law-abiding cattleman a “cowboy”). Mr. Kahn was able to get only one law man (DOC HOLLIDAY) and one bad guy (IKE CLANTON) into his grid for space reasons.

In addition, we have four entries forming a circular “corral” of sorts (31A, 37D, 52A and 35D). All of them are synonyms for the word “O.K.,” but all are clued as something different, neatly hiding the connection to the theme in plain sight. That’s a pretty nice bonus.

Tricky Clues

1A: I had MACAU and MACAW (wrong, Deb! That’s a bird) before MACAO.

49A: Do you get tripped up by clues where the first word is actually a proper name? “Banks of Chicago” sounds as if it refers to places in Chicago where you can keep your money, but we’ve got only a five-letter slot. The constructor and editors have sneakily used the capital-letter-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence rule against you. “Banks” refers to the baseball player ERNIE Banks.

Constructor Notes

I guess I can say with a smile that this is just an O.K. puzzle. This worked only because I was able to find 4 four-letter synonyms for O.K. that could be clued otherwise, which is why “so-so,” at first an obvious synonym, wasn’t included. I also wanted to include a gunfighter on each side. Fun fact: Kirk Douglas, who played Doc Holliday in the 1957 movie, celebrated his centennial last year.

Undoubtedly, the term “fascism” has an effective anti-authoritarian ring to it, so perhaps that is why it is thrown around so much these days. But from what I can tell, much of what students are protesting, both at the University of Oregon and elsewhere, is the expression of viewpoints or ideologies that offend them and make them feel marginalized. They are fed up with what they see as a blanket protection of free speech that, at its extreme, permits the expression of views by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. I am opposed to all these groups stand for, but offensive speech can never be the sole criterion for shutting down a speaker.

The students’ own tactics reveal just how malleable the concept of offensiveness can be. For example, the word “fascism” has deep emotional connotations for me. It’s the reason for great suffering in my family. Two generations ago, members of my extended family were thrown into concentration camps and murdered in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust.

So, when students accuse me of leading an institution that harbors and promotes fascism, it offends me. But does that justify my censoring their speech? Clearly the answer is no.

Without the freedom to express ideas, even those that offend, we cannot challenge the status quo nor move society forward. But student protesters can still change and reform institutions. In 2015, I had been president of the University of Oregon for all of three months when protests erupted around the country over the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. A group called the Black Student Task Force organized a protest right outside my office. I invited the students in for a discussion, and although the matters we discussed, about systemic racism and educational opportunity, were emotionally charged, we established a respectful dialogue. More important, the discussion led to change.

The University of Oregon engaged in a searching and difficult historical examination of racism at the school. We doubled the number of black faculty members, created new programs to enroll more black students, started an African-American lecture series, and raised $1.6 million to build a new black student cultural center. We also invested in symbolic change by removing the name of a former Ku Klux Klan leader from one of our residence halls and replacing it with the name of an illustrious black alumnus.

Educators and students must learn from each other, and nothing is more important to this exchange than free speech. Our future as a university, and more broadly, our future as a nation, depends upon our willingness to hear voices different from our own and engage in meaningful discussion.

We in academia have a lot of big issues to tackle. One such topic — what to do about speech that offends vulnerable populations and how to protect speech and safety at the same time — presents a difficult challenge, but that makes the issue that much more important.

SPECIAL POST — The 12th World Sudoku Championship, which I’ve attended in Bangalore, India, has just ended. It was the largest WSC to date — 206 competitors from 32 countries. Most countries were represented by four-person teams, although individual solvers could take part as well.

The contestants tackled almost 150 tough sudoku and sudoku variations over two days, scoring points for correct solutions. Point values varied according to the difficulty of the puzzles.

When it was over, the top five teams were China, Japan, France, USA and Czech Republic. China and Japan towered over everyone else.

The top individual solvers were Kota Morinishi of Japan (4,890 points) and Tiit Vunk of Estonia (4,887), with only 3 points separating them.

The United States has been at war continuously since the attacks of 9/11 and now has just over 240,000 active-duty and reserve troops in at least 172 countries and territories. While the number of men and women deployed overseas has shrunk considerably over the past 60 years, the military’s reach has not. American forces are actively engaged not only in the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Yemen that have dominated the news, but also in Niger and Somalia, both recently the scene of deadly attacks, as well as Jordan, Thailand and elsewhere.

An additional 37,813 troops serve on presumably secret assignment in places listed simply as “unknown.” The Pentagon provided no further explanation.

There are traditional deployments in Japan (39,980 troops) and South Korea (23,591) to defend against North Korea and China, if needed, along with 36,034 troops in Germany, 8,286 in Britain and 1,364 in Turkey — all NATO allies.

America’s operations in conflict zones like Africa are expanding: 400 American Special Forces personnel in Somalia train local troops fighting the Shabab Islamist group, providing intelligence and sometimes going into battle with them. One member of the Navy SEALs was killed there in a mission in May. On Oct. 14, a massive attack widely attributed to the Shabab on a Mogadishu street killed more than 270 people, which would show the group’s increased reach. About 800 troops are based in Niger, where four Green Berets died on Oct. 4.

Many of these forces are engaged in counterterrorism operations — against the Taliban in Afghanistan, for instance; against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria; against an affiliate of Al Qaeda in Yemen. So far, Americans seem to accept that these missions and the deployments they require will continue indefinitely. Still, it’s a very real question whether, in addition to endorsing these commitments, which have cost trillions of dollars and many lives over 16 years, they will embrace new entanglements of the sort President Trump has seemed to portend with his rash threats and questionable decisions on North Korea and Iran.",America’s Forever Wars,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/opinion/americas-forever-wars.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Miranda: I’m the same way, except my collaborator is Tommy Kail2.

Sondheim: I need the spur. And the spur and the boost comes from somebody else, generally. Rarely, only in the case of “Sweeney”3 did I come across something myself and think, “Oooh.” Oh, no, and “Passion.”4 Those are the two.

Miranda: And “Sweeney” was the one where you were working from the original text and said, “I need a book writer,” right?

Sondheim: Yeah. I’d been working from a little Samuel French-type version.5 I was up to Page 8 in Bond’s script, which is, I guess, the marketplace scene,6 and already it was an hour and a half long. I thought, “This is not going to work because I don’t know how to cut, really.” I mean I do, but I don’t. That’s why I got Hugh Wheeler,7 because he was born in England, he was the son of a bankruptcy judge. So he knew something about class structure. And I’d had a good time with him on “[A Little] Night Music.” Also, he’d been a mystery writer, you know. He was one of the most prolific mystery writers in America. He wrote (and co-wrote) under a pseudonym, Patrick Quentin.

Miranda: My favorite thing is bringing the song into the room to my collaborators. That’s my favorite part of the process. Not the writing of it, not even it being done. It’s the moment when I know my collaborators are going to make it better.

Sondheim: That’s my least favorite part of collaboration. Unless I really like what I’ve written.

Miranda: Oh?

Sondheim: Then I want to share it with a collaborator. But no, I don’t get that excitement that you get out of it, presenting it to collaborators. First of all, I only really do it with a book writer. I don’t with a director. I just don’t want to call in a director till it’s ready to present, and that means me and my collaborator. But you know, Lapine8 was the first one who actually made me give him unfinished songs. I never give unfinished songs.

Sondheim: No, not particularly, but it was valuable to him.

Miranda: Talk a bit about that danger and uncertainty.

Sondheim: Well, because it stimulates you to do things you haven’t done before. The whole thing is if you know where you’re going, you’ve gone, as the poet says. And that’s death. That leads to stultified writing and stultified shows.

Miranda: Since “Hamilton,” I have been pitched every historical era.

Sondheim: Of course! And so that’s the one thing you don’t want to do. After “Gypsy” I got nothing but backstage stories and I said, “The only thing I don’t want to write is anything to do with show business.” That’s the only thing.

SONDHEIM HAS CERTAINLY followed his own advice in this regard: His choice of subject matter over the last half-century of work demolishes any notions of the kinds of stories musical theater can tell. From a violent barber (“Sweeney Todd” with Hugh Wheeler) to ancient Roman farce (1962’s “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,” with librettists Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart) to fractured fairy tales (“Into the Woods” with James Lapine). Within this vast terrain, he and his collaborators have also radically experimented with the musical theater form: See the diptych structure of “Sunday in the Park With George,” also with Lapine, in which each act takes place a century apart, or the unprecedented “Company” (1970), with a book by George Furth, a meditation on commitment and monogamy, which Sondheim describes as a “non-plot” musical.” Here he is, arriving at the form of “Follies,” his legendary 1971 musical with librettist James Goldman about a reunion of retired performers from a 1930s Ziegfeldesque revue: “You start with the subject matter and some content and it takes form. If you’re going to say, ‘O.K., it’s a reunion party,’ well, hello, don’t try to give it a plot. And if you don’t give it a plot, what’s going to hold it together? Uh-oh. That’s what’s dangerous and that’s what’s scary about it.”

We gravitate toward the subject of surprise, both for the audience and for the playwright.

Sondheim: That was a big lesson from Peter Shaffer.9 We went to see a play once about the mad queen of Spain and in the first act there were two rapes, an evisceration, a fire and something horrifying with a child, I don’t remember. And at the end of the first act I said, “This is so much my kind of thing. Why am I bored?” He said, “There’s no surprise.” And I thought, “Put that on your bathroom mirror.” Surprise: if it’s in the lyric, the unexpected word, the unexpected note, the unexpected incident. The unexpected, the unexpected, that’s what theater is about. If you had to patent one thing in the theater, it’s surprise.

Miranda: Can you think of any times you’ve surprised yourself in the writing process?

Sondheim: Oh, come on, as a writer you’re always surprised when you think of the right note or the right word. You think, “Oh, I didn’t know I could — oh, that’s good!” You know, writing’s full of surprises for oneself. It comes with the territory, but this is a different kind of thing. This is surprising the audience —

Sondheim bats the question away. He’s either uninterested in recounting a specific time that he surprised himself while writing, or there have been so many that it’s impossible to pick: It comes with the territory.

Two years ago, I interviewed Sondheim and John Weidman together for a PBS documentary, but my favorite moment from the interview never aired. We were on the subject of “Finishing the Hat” from “Sunday in the Park With George,” one of Sondheim’s most celebrated songs, and maybe the greatest song ever written about the self-induced spell of the creative process.10 In this excerpt from that interview, just as in his work, Sondheim’s collaborator brought out the best in him:

Weidman: Do you remember you called me the night you finished that song?

Sondheim (smiling): Was I excited?

Weidman: You were ... beyond excited. I mean, it’s like you needed to call somebody. I may have been number 17 on the list, but I could hear it in your voice, you said, “I just wrote this song.”

Sondheim: Yeah, I remember, I wanted to tell everybody. [Laughs.] I wanted to tell everybody. I was really pleased.

Miranda: I love the story you told about the making of it in your book, about being inspired by a party game you were creating for Phyllis Newman’s party,11 and realizing you’d spent the entire night in a sort of trance —

Sondheim: I started planning that game at 8 o’clock in the evening, and when I looked up, it was 7 o’clock in the morning. I’m exaggerating, but not by much. Time had disappeared. That’s what happens — you must know that yourself. You must know that the great thing about writing and creating is, time disappears. You are in the moment, and the moment can go for eight hours or for two minutes, or whatever, until the phone rings, or you know, you have to go get something to eat.

PRESENT DAY again — I’m trying to give Sondheim credit for expanding the scope of the American musical, and he is passing on the credit to his mentor Oscar Hammerstein instead.

Miranda: Something that’s so essential about your work is that I think you have expanded the terrain of what musical theater can be. The notion of, “This is a musical, that’s not a musical,” is BS. It’s carried entirely by the passion of the creators.

Sondheim: Yeah, but Oscar invented that with “Oklahoma!” He took a play that was about homosexuality in the West and turned it into a sunny musical. Because he saw something in it that was beyond what Lynn Riggs12 had written, about the opening of territories, the promise of America. He saw that which anybody else reading that play would not have seen.

Miranda: O.K. But it gets back to the notion of, “If I can find myself in the work, others will see themselves.” So it’s about not being afraid of specificity.

Sondheim lights up.

Sondheim: Absolutely! That’s exactly what he taught me, when he criticized my poetic Hammerstein lyrics when I was starting out.13 He said, “That’s not what you feel. Don’t write what I feel. Write what you feel.” Oh! It had never occurred to me to write what I felt. And Oscar was the one who taught everyone to do that.

Write what you feel. Or as George’s muse, Dot, says to him in “Sunday,” “Anything you do,/Let it come from you./Then it will be new.”

And then for a moment you let in the depth and intensity and range of Stephen Sondheim’s feeling for the past half-century. That Tony and Maria of “West Side Story” first fell in love as Sondheim sharpened his Blackwing pencils, finding the words for their doomed romance at age 25. That Mrs. Lovett of “Sweeney Todd” hatched her diabolical plans from this writing couch as Sondheim talked to himself. That within Sondheim, somewhere, is both Georges Seurat and Fosca, Pseudolus and Mama Rose, John Wilkes Booth and Madame Armfeldt, Charley Kringas and Little Red Riding Hood. He has served up vodka stingers for Joanne (“Company”) and chrysanthemum tea for the Shogun (“Pacific Overtures”). Sixty years of iconic theatrical moments, and they exist as a result of the specific way Stephen Sondheim feels. Line by line, note by note, surprise by surprise.

And if you’re Sondheim, there are days like today, when you feel under the weather and the day is full of distractions. But there are also nights when you write “Finishing the Hat,” and you’re so proud of what you’ve made that you have to call a friend and say, “I just wrote this song.”

What’s important is that Sondheim is still here, staring down another deadline. Starting on a hat. Feeling his way toward the moment when time disappears.

Sondheim: You shouldn’t feel safe. You should feel, “I don’t know if I can write this.” That’s what I mean by dangerous, and I think that’s a good thing to do. Sacrifice something safe.

WASHINGTON — President Trump said early on Monday that his proposed tax plan would not prompt any changes to Americans’ tax-deferred retirement plans, pushing back against reports that the Republicans are weighing a proposal that would significantly reduce the income workers can save in these popular programs.

Mr. Trump’s shutdown of the proposal is the first of what many Republicans privately fear could be a presidential pattern that disrupts their efforts to pass a sweeping overhaul of the tax code. In it, Mr. Trump appeared to rule out a politically difficult idea, which, if enacted, would have provided some revenue to help pay for the tax plan.

Republicans’ ability to win passage of a tax package hinges on its ability to survive a complex set of legislative restrictions in the Senate. Republicans are attempting to cut business tax rates deeply, and also to cut individual tax rates, using a legislative route that allows them to bypass a Democratic filibuster and pass a bill with a simple Senate majority. To do that, they will need to make some tough political choices, eliminating some popular tax breaks, or employing some budgetary accounting tricks, in order to offset lost revenues from rate cuts.

Mr. Trump’s tweet concerned one of those accounting maneuvers, which would have allowed Republicans to effectively borrow tax revenues from the future to offset some rate cuts today. Reducing 401(k) contribution limits would force retirement savers to pay more in taxes today, as they sock away money, but less in the future, when they began withdrawing retirement funds tax-free.

The searches came as the companies face a backlash over their efforts to evade rules on diesel emissions.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — People don’t believe me when I tell them that there is always a way into a puzzle, even the late week ones, but it’s true. What seems to happen is that some solvers quickly scan the list of clues on, say, a Friday puzzle,, see nothing that they know on the first pass, and decide that they can’t solve it. Many times, they give up and walk away.

But take a moment to think about this logically: What would be the point of making and editing a puzzle that no one can solve? It would be like building a house with no door or windows.

Lenin bequeathed a fully functioning police state to Joseph Stalin ; thus the experiment, in its fulminant form, lasted from 1917 to 1953, by which time there were many millions of supernumerary deaths (and if Stalin hadn’t died in March of the latter year there would have been a second Jewish Holocaust by Christmastime). The verdict of history has at last been returned. But the jury — i.e., informed opinion in the First World — stayed out until the late 1970s. What took it so long?

Western intellectuals deserve their usual share of the obloquy. As one historian of Russia put it, it is to the intellectuals that we turn for “real prowess of wrong-headedness.” But it wasn’t just the pundits, the writers (H. G. Wells, G. B. Shaw) and the philosophers (J.P. Sartre, A. J. Ayer) who swallowed the Moscow line; so did historians, sociologists, politicians, and even businessmen. To its supporters the allure of the Communist Party was twofold. The secondary appeal was that it gave you the (not quite delusive) impression that you were playing your part in world events; the primary appeal was that the program looked wonderful on paper, and spoke to the optimism and idealism of many of the most generous hearts and minds.

It was vaguely understood that there had been some loss of life: the terror and famine under Lenin, the Civil War, forced collectivization (“Ten millions,” Stalin said to Churchill, holding up both palms, in the Kremlin in 1942), the burgeoning system of state slavery known as the gulag (created under Lenin), the Great Purge of 1937-38.All that could be set aside, for now, because (a) revolutions are always violent, and (b) the ends supposedly justify the means.

As for the first point, the French revolutionary terror lasted from June 1793 to July 1794, and claimed more than 16,000 victims, no more than a busy couple of weeks for the Bolsheviks (and imagine if Robespierre had kept at it until 1830). As for the second point, well, there is a counterproposition: Means shape ends, and tend to poison them. We all know, now, what we think of the Good Intentions Paving Company. Anyway, the means were all the Soviet citizen was ever going to get. Western doublethink and selective blindness on this question is a very rich field; the wisest and most stylish guide to it is “Reflections on a Ravaged Century” (2000), by Robert Conquest, to whom we will necessarily return.

So far as I know, the first writer to see it all with an illusionless eye was that highly privileged observer Vladimir Nabokov (born 1899), whose family fled Russia in 1919. Once established in America, he was befriended by Edmund Wilson, and they engaged in a celebrated correspondence from 1940 to 1971 (published as “Dear Bunny, Dear Volodya”). Not lastingly duped by Stalin, the author of “To the Finland Station” was lastingly duped by Lenin and Trotsky. The Nabokov-Wilson letters are therefore very lively. Nabokov’s definitive rebuke is dated Feb. 23, 1948. It concludes:

“Under the Soviets, from the very start, the only protection a dissenter could hope for was dependent on governmental whims, not laws. No parties except the one in power could exist. Your Alymovs [Sergei Alymov was a showcase hack poet] are specters bobbing in the wake of a foreign tourist. Bureaucracy … took over immediately. Public opinion disintegrated. The intelligentsia ceased to exist. Any changes that took place between November [1917] and now have been changes in the décor which more or less screens an unchanging black abyss of oppression and terror.”

The correspondence ended in 1971, but the friendship died five years earlier. Nabokov could forgive Wilson’s mawkish indulgence of the Bolsheviks — but not his hostile and ignorant review of “Eugene Onegin” (Nabokov’s famously eccentric translation of Pushkin’s epic). Wilson died in 1972, just after his stern revision of “To the Finland Station”: “I have also been charged with having given a much too amiable picture of Lenin. … One can see the point of Lenin’s being short with the temporizing and arguing Russians but one cannot be surprised that he gave offense and did not show himself so benevolent as I perhaps tend to make him.” As for Trotsky (who said, inter alia, “We must rid ourselves once and for all of the Quaker-Papist babble about the sanctity of human life”), “I have not found anything,” Wilson wrote, “which obliges me to make any rectifications.” So this, among much else, went unrectified: “It is as a hero of the faith in Reason that Trotsky must figure for us.”

By 1972 Wilson might have found time to read the three outstanding memoirs of the period: “I Chose Freedom,” by Viktor Kravchenko (1946), “Journey Into the Whirlwind,” by Eugenia Ginzburg (1967), and “Hope Against Hope,” by Nadezhda Mandelstam (1970). Kravchenko was an apparat high-up who defected immediately after the war; Ginzburg was a provincial don and journalist who was found guilty of Trotskyism; and Mandelstam was the wife, and then the widow, of the great poet Osip (1891-1938). Cumulatively, these books persuade you of a disconcerting truth: Compared with Stalin’s Russia, Hitler’s Germany was a terrestrial paradise — except for Communists and Jews (and, later, Gypsies and homosexuals).

Kravchenko, Ginzburg and Mandelstam show us a society from which the concept of trust had been completely excised — a society where the conversational meaning of the question “Do they write?” was “Do they write letters of denunciation to the secret police?” You couldn’t trust your parents; you couldn’t trust your children. In addition, everyone was terrified all the time, right up to and including Stalin, who feared assassination at every waking minute. When he flew to Tehran for the first Big Three summit, his plane was escorted by 27 fighters; when he entrained for Potsdam (the third and final summit), his bodyguards numbered 18,500. By contrast, ordinary Germans knew no panic until 1943, as the reckoning loomed, and as the cities were being bombed nightly, then daily, then daily as well as nightly.

The truth about Russia dawned in cloud and mist. The first consciousness-shifting book was Conquest’s “The Great Terror” (1968). Very soon the samizdat version was circulating in Russia; and freshly enlightened parents would wonder if their growing teenagers were “ready for Conquest” and the attendant shock. Conquest had time to add “The Nation Killers” and “Lenin,” but not long enough to add ”Kolyma: The Arctic Death Camps” (1976) — before the translation of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s “The Gulag Archipelago” was complete in its three volumes (1973-75). This was and is a visionary nonfiction epic written by an artist in the Russian Orthodox, old-regime tradition of Gogol, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy. Hereafter the great argument (like the original Marxist idea) had only a vampiric existence — technically dead, but still animate.

For a while anything that could be mistaken for “Red-baiting,” in the United Kingdom at least, was considered bad form, like kicking a man when he was down. About five years later there was a reaction, then an overreaction, then a judgment. Having gone from wondering whether Stalin was “better” than Churchill and Roosevelt, the commentariat was suddenly asking itself whether Stalin was better than Hitler; half a decade after that, the finding of “equivalence” at last gave way to “broad parity.” Equivalence marks the overreaction. Hitler and Stalin were not equivalent.

One of the few developments in recent years, apart from a further downgrading of Lenin and Trotsky, has been a morally slight but otherwise highly significant upgrading of Stalin. This was the result of two very substantial books by Simon Sebag Montefiore, “Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar” (2003) and “Young Stalin” (2007). Montefiore is innocent of ideology; he is an honest Stakhanovite of the archives, and was genuinely embarrassed and apologetic about “changing the picture,” as his mentor, Conquest, “anti-Sovietchik number one” (according to the Kremlin), was the first to acknowledge.

What Montefiore has done is give flesh to the “Red Tsar.” For decades Trotsky’s jealous dismissal — “the gray blur,” the faceless bureaucrat — was the utterly misleading orthodoxy. Stalin was never a gray blur. Let us for a moment consider the Stalin versus Hitler question simply as a contest between two human beings. Until 1917 Stalin was a czarist dissident, a brawler, a boozer, a singer, a charmer, a womanizer and a brilliant mimic; he was not only a published but an anthologized poet; and he was wholly dedicated to the fight for universal equality and justice. Compare him with Hitler, the dank, sexless, humorless, milk-drinking vegetarian invert, nursing dreams, in his Viennese flophouse, of Judaeocide and world domination. Once established as the autocrat, Hitler went back to reading nothing but trash ethnology and the westerns of Karl May, whereas Stalin went back to reading Dickens, Chekhov, Gogol, Hemingway, Zola, Balzac, Maupassant and Oscar Wilde. Stalin was an Earthling; Hitler climbed up from the infernal regions.

“A map of the world that does not include Utopia,” Wilde said, “is not worth even glancing at.” In fact the opposite is true. Utopia means “not place,” it means “nowhere.” In the 20th century the effort to create the Marxist variant cost close to 100 million lives (a mid-estimate not including warfare). Literary history, here, provides an unignorable hint. Every imagined Utopia, from Plato to the present day, helplessly becomes a Dystopia, almost certainly because the writers just couldn’t resist the urge to make the “place” sound halfway interesting. Otherwise the Perfect Society is perfectly inhuman and perfectly inane. What would you do all day in Utopia?

PhotoIn an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well.","From grizzled cotton farmers to quiet small-town buildings and roadside stands, Walker Evans built his reputation on chronicling America’s out-of-the-way places and people. And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common. Born Walker Evans III, the scion of a prominent family, he grew up in privilege, attending Phillips Academy and then Williams College, dropping out after one year.

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

Photo

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

Roosevelt in effect was trying to make the Democrats the more uniformly liberal party while leaving the Republicans as the conservative party.
Roosevelt’s experience showed the dangers of isolation in the White House, said Mr. Rove, who has sharply criticized Mr. Bannon’s efforts.
While Mr. Trump’s Republicans can afford to lose only two votes in the Senate, Roosevelt’s Democrats enjoyed large majorities in Congress.
The newspapers called it the “elimination committee” and labeled the campaign Roosevelt’s “purge,” a reference to Stalin’s terror in the Soviet Union.","Still, Mr. Bannon showed no signs of backing off, appearing at a fund-raiser the next night for a challenger to Mr. Flake as Breitbart News, the website he runs, featured stories on his efforts to line up donors for other primary challengers. “We’re putting together a grass-roots army,” he said in a speech in California on Friday night.

The historical parallels to F.D.R. and 1938, while inexact, are intriguing. Like Mr. Trump, Roosevelt was piqued by opposition from members of his own party and set out to replace them with more ideologically aligned candidates who would support his agenda — in his case, liberals who would take out Southern conservatives. But voters resented the intervention and repudiated him by re-electing nearly all of his Democratic rivals.

“His attempt to purge the party of conservative Democrats proved to be a serious mistake,” said Robert Dallek, whose biography “Franklin D. Roosevelt: A Political Life” will be published next month. “He lost every primary contest except one, and 60 percent of the country disapproved of his purge.”

Although born out of frustration, Roosevelt’s purge was part of a desire to force a party realignment. In those days, both parties had liberals and conservatives. Roosevelt in effect was trying to make the Democrats the more uniformly liberal party while leaving the Republicans as the conservative party. He would fail, but in decades to come, that realignment would eventually occur on its own.

“His goal was two responsible, unified parties to replace, as he said, ‘Tweedledum and Tweedledee’ parties,” said Susan Dunn, a Williams College historian and author of “Roosevelt’s Purge,” the definitive book on the 1938 election. “To me, Trump’s purge is only about vindictiveness. He wants to strike out at and defeat the people who have dared to criticize him.”

Other presidents have been incensed by wayward members of their parties, but few attempted what Roosevelt did and what Mr. Trump is threatening. Karl Rove, deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush, at times grew livid at Republicans who defied the White House. But he said the idea of challenging them in primaries was anathema.

Roosevelt’s experience showed the dangers of isolation in the White House, said Mr. Rove, who has sharply criticized Mr. Bannon’s efforts. “The lesson is it’s better to try to influence by encouragement than by opposition,” he said. “It’s important to keep focused on the main things people want you to keep focused on — what are the big issues of the day? And don’t let your personal pique guide your political actions.” (Mr. Bannon said he would not reply because it would be “punching down.”)

Unlike Mr. Trump, with his historically low poll ratings, Roosevelt was broadly popular at the time. He swept to re-election in 1936 with 61 percent of the vote, winning all but two states in one of the biggest landslides in American history, and his approval ratings remained high. While Mr. Trump’s Republicans can afford to lose only two votes in the Senate, Roosevelt’s Democrats enjoyed large majorities in Congress.

But Roosevelt grew angry at resistance from Democrats to additional domestic programs and repeated Supreme Court rulings overturning parts of the New Deal. The confrontation came to a head when he sought to pack the Supreme Court by adding as many as six more justices to seize control of the bench, an idea that provoked fierce opposition in both parties and ultimately collapsed.

Harry Hopkins, Roosevelt’s confidant, railed against Democrats “who tricked the voters by wearing our insignia only to turn against us as soon as they got in office.” Roosevelt was so angry that his “resentment crystallized into the desire to crush all who conspired against the throne,” said George Creel, a journalist and critic at the time. So Roosevelt put together a team to organize a campaign against the conservative Democrats. The newspapers called it the “elimination committee” and labeled the campaign Roosevelt’s “purge,” a reference to Stalin’s terror in the Soviet Union.

Advisers like Frances Perkins feared it was “reckless” but could not talk him out of it. On June 24, 1938, Roosevelt announced during a fireside chat that he had a responsibility to carry out the 1936 platform and therefore would oppose the election of “outspoken reactionaries” and hypocrites “who say ‘yes’ to a progressive objective, but who also find some reason to oppose any specific proposal designed to gain that objective.”

He took on conservatives like Senators Walter F. George of Georgia, Ellison D. Smith of South Carolina, Millard E. Tydings of Maryland and Guy M. Gillette of Iowa. Mr. Smith, a fierce segregationist known as “Cotton Ed,” despised Roosevelt and referred to the New Deal as the “Jackass Age.” But Mr. Smith and the others won anyway. Roosevelt managed to take out only one rival in the House. Amid the Democratic discord and the aftermath of a recession, Republicans swept to victory in the fall, picking up eight Senate seats and 81 House seats by Ms. Dunn’s count.

“Unfortunately, his hubris overwhelmed his normally impeccable political instincts,” said Paul Sparrow, director of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum. But it had unanticipated benefits. “The good news for history,” he said, “is that this embarrassment taught him an important lesson: Don’t get too far out in front of the American voter, a lesson he applied just two years later as he carefully laid the groundwork for America’s entry into World War II.”

Indeed, Ms. Dunn said some of the same conservative Democrats who survived Roosevelt’s purge ultimately became his strongest allies during the buildup to the war. Mr. Tydings backed Roosevelt’s compulsory universal military service, and Mr. George played a key role in passing the Lend-Lease Act to supply Britain and other countries with military aid.

Neural networks now help recognize faces in photos posted to Facebook, identify commands spoken into living-room digital assistants like the Amazon Echo and instantly translate foreign languages on Microsoft’s Skype phone service.

Using the same mathematical techniques, researchers are improving self-driving cars and developing hospital services that can identify illness and disease in medical scans, digital assistants that can not only recognize spoken words but understand them, automated stock-trading systems and robots that pick up objects they’ve never seen before.

With so few A.I. specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia. In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.

Uber hired 40 people from Carnegie Mellon’s groundbreaking A.I. program in 2015 to work on its self-driving-car project. Over the last several years, four of the best-known A.I. researchers in academia have left or taken leave from their professorships at Stanford University. At the University of Washington, six of 20 artificial intelligence professors are now on leave or partial leave and working for outside companies.

“There is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry,” said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

Some professors are finding a way to compromise. Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records). Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.

“There are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia,” Mr. Zettlemoyer said. “The salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.”

To bring in new A.I. engineers, companies like Google and Facebook are running classes that aim to teach “deep learning” and related techniques to existing employees. And nonprofits like Fast.ai and companies like Deeplearning.ai, founded by a former Stanford professor who helped create the Google Brain lab, offer online courses.

The basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math. But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call “a dark art.” Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.

In order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places. Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills. Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.

“I can’t compete with Google, and I don’t want to,” said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries. “So I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.”

But the industry’s giants are doing much the same. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have opened A.I. labs in Toronto and Montreal, where much of this research outside the United States is being done. Google also is hiring in China, where Microsoft has long had a strong presence.

Not surprisingly, many think the talent shortage won’t be alleviated for years.

“Of course demand outweighs supply. And things are not getting better any time soon,” Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal and a prominent A.I. researcher, said. “It takes many years to train a Ph.D.”",Tech Giants Are Paying Huge Salaries for Scarce A.I.

I taught my first class at Columbia University’s M.F.A. program this month, and even though I’ve been teaching college writing since 1993, I initially felt a little intimidated by the school’s regal campus. That, and regretful.

I enjoyed going to college at the University of Michigan, an hour from home, but my secret humiliation is: I was the type of mediocre student I now disdain. As a freshman, I cared about my friends, my boyfriend and my poetry. Or, I cared about what my boyfriend thought of my friends, what my friends thought of him, and what they thought of my poetry about him. Here’s what I wish I’d known and done differently:

A’S ARE COOL AND COME WITH PERKS As a student, I saw myself as anti-establishment, and I hated tests; I barely maintained a B average. I thought only nerds spent weekends in the library studying. Recently I learned that my niece Dara, a sophomore at New York University with a 3.7 G.P.A. (and a boyfriend), was offered a week of travel in Buenos Aires as part of her honors seminar. I was retroactively envious to learn that a 3.5 G.P.A. or higher at many schools qualifies you for free trips, scholarships, grants, awards, private parties and top internships. At 20, I was too busy freaking out when said boyfriend disappeared (after sleeping with one of said friends). Students certainly don’t need to strive obsessively for perfection, but I should have prioritized grades, not guys.

SHOW UP AND SPEAK UP If a class was boring or it snowed, I’d skip. My rationale was that nobody in the 300-person lecture hall would notice and I could get notes later. Attendance barely counted. When I went, I’d sit quietly in back. Yet as a teacher, I see that the students who come weekly, sit in front, and ask and answer questions get higher grades and frankly, preferential treatment. After 15 weeks, I barely know the absentees or anyone Snapchatting the term away on their iPhones. It’s not just that these students flush $300 down the toilet every time they miss my class; participating can actually lead to payoffs. I reward those who try harder with recommendations, references, professional contacts and encouragement.

CLASS CONNECTIONS CAN LAUNCH YOUR CAREER As an undergrad, I rarely visited my professors during office hours. I didn’t want to annoy teachers with what I considered triviality. Besides, I thought I knew everything already. In graduate school, on the other hand, I went to the readings of a professor I admired. Eventually, I’d go to his office just to vent. Once, after I complained about a dead-end job, he recommended me for a position at The New Yorker, jump-starting my career.

This is not exactly an avant-garde idea. I learned it from my mom, who learned it from hers, and so on, back until what I would imagine was the dawn of time. This has always been the role of the black mother in the community. We watch the kids. All of them. This is that “village” that we hear so much about but that has somehow been forgotten. All I’ve done is try to revive its spirit.

We were brought to that corner in June 2015 when a mother was murdered while breaking up a fight. That summer there was another murder one block to the east and then another one block to the west. A police siege and an unlawful search of a 94-year-old woman’s home also happened on the block that summer.

The children saw all of this, and unfortunately, those will always be their memories. They’ll never forget the sobbing over an aunt shot on the street, the fear of the police who lined the big boys up and took them to jail. This was what their summers had looked like for so long. As a mom and a human being, I could not go back to my home unbothered. These were my memories now, too. I didn’t want them, and I didn’t want the children to have them. So we made brand-new ones.

After just three summers on the block, violent crime and gun-related incidents in that census tract have declined dramatically. And this has had a ripple effect as far as a mile out. The neighborhood elementary school attended by a majority of our children has also seen improvements in student performance. All of this has happened with no real resources, new jobs or governmental assistance.

The most frequently asked question we get is: How did you do it? It’s simple. We cared. We put on hot-pink T-shirts, got our lawn chairs and a couple of packs of hot dogs, and went to the corner and cooked some dinner. We showed up and established a presence in the neighborhood. We’re also creating small community centers in vacant lots around the city, where kids can play, study and get a hot meal.

We also listened to the people there. They told us how to stop gun violence in their neighborhood and pretty much all the other ones just like it. They told us they needed resources, jobs and skills training. They told us they needed schools that could prepare their children to compete in a world that will soon be run by computers. They need a share of that $95 million planned for a new police and firefighter training center, because now the community polices itself.

They told us that it was great that their children were learning their rights in school but that they wanted more qualified teachers who could teach them to read and write. And with a chunk of that $95 million, we could afford it. Sure, we still have gang violence. The cure for that is bringing jobs and resources to impoverished neighborhoods. We know that.

MONDAY PUZZLE — The crossword editor Will Shortz has called this period of time the “golden age of puzzles,” which makes it especially funny to me that a crossword puzzle then goes ahead and declares six of its own ages. It’s very meta, to use a colloquialism, and a decent start to our solving week.

Today’s Theme

Timothy Polin offers us a theme set of six words that all end in -AGE, and separates the suffix from the base word to make a new AGE, as it were. Mr. Polin manages to pack a lot of theme material comfortably within his grid.

For example, at 39A, the word BONDAGE is split into BOND AGE and clued as “Period known for its 007 movies?” Similarly, at 50A, the word COVERAGE is split into COVER AGE and clued as “Period when tribute bands thrived?” because tribute bands play covers of songs.

I liked this set, although the top entry, 17A’s ANCHORAGE, stood out to me as a place name in a set of nonplace name words. And we have OWIE crossing BOBO, which in itself is not an issue, but they are not great entries. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, I enjoyed seeing the debut of SAFE SPACE and am glad that it was not clued derogatorily.

But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

(Soap carving and pumpkin decoration were among her favorites.)

Photo

That annual tradition has evolved through many twists and turns into “Junk Kaleidoscope,” a phrase that Amy Smith-Stewart, the Aldrich’s curator, likes to think of as “a ruptured view of the world through everyday cultural artifacts,” she said recently while installing the show.

Hung in frames, displayed on shelves, or arranged in domestic-scaled installations, Ms. Mack’s new work quietly exudes the motley variety of a craft show crossed with a fair exhibition hall in its mix of stained glass, gilding, silk flowers, neon lights and lots of denim. There are references to early sideshow banners, commemorative wreaths, needlepoint samplers, teen longing, and American heartthrobs.

“I’m interested in my body of work looking like the things that came out of the fair, not in their craftiness, but in their diversity,” said Ms. Mack, who cites as inspirations Ree Morton (1936-1977), Rosemarie Trockel and Robert Gober, artists known for their idiosyncratic use of various materials.

She returns to the Durham Fair almost every year and took road trips to visit state fairs through the Southeast and the northern Midwest. “Fairs are great sources for images,” she said, while assuring me that she is not obsessed. What she does obsess over, she explained, is “their collections of things, the categorization, their repetitive nature.” Fittingly, a large poster-size list hangs at the entrance to the main gallery at the Aldrich, enumerating 73 categories.

Photo

The evolution of the kind of official list that Ms. Mack would eagerly pore over as a kid, the show at the Aldrich mixes existing competition categories, like “#14 Wood, three-dimensional construction” with more ambiguous entries, like “#38 My heart wants more” and “#55 After the fact.”

Photo

The list is also a link to the exhibition’s pivotal origins, Ms. Mack’s epic project, “The Fair” (staged in 1996 and 2006). Fresh out of the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia, where she earned her M.F.A. in sculpture, Ms. Mack decided to enter all 73 craft categories in the Durham Fair. It was an act of near-manic D.I.Y. industriousness, done in the name of art rather than heartlandish moral rectitude. She taught herself leather tooling, screen-printing and chair caning, and won dozens of ribbons.

“Art gave me this framework to put around the fair, this permission to allow myself to allocate an insane amount of time to making crafts — all summer, every day, two crafts a day, while working a full-time temp job,” she recalled. Real Art Ways, a nonprofit art space in Hartford, showed the items — adorned with their ribbons. The following year, Postmasters Gallery in New York showed the project.

Photo

In 2006, Ms. Mack was at it again, entering all 69 craft categories of the Durham Fair. “That second time it was more about using repetition, remaking, and memorialization to think about how I was processing these familiar images and experiences,” she said. Ten years later, she was planning “Junk Kaleidoscope,” fleshing out her interest in commemoration. “All the work in the show came from either a memory I have or an image I saw, maybe a very specific object I walked by,” she explained. “But they’re not exact reproductions, they’re combinations of a few things.”

Photo

There are several wreath motifs in the show, including “Conn Con,” from 2017, a large ring of straw festooned with ornamental corn. It’s the kind of regional homage that one might find at the fair, but also an allusion to the false impression of household bliss that the mastery of the “domestic arts” might imply. “How you decorate your house, your curb appeal — it was all very important where I grew up,” said Ms. Mack, who now has work in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Seattle Art Museum, among others.

Ms. Smith-Stewart, who came across the artist’s work in a group show at MoMA PS1 in 2002, while working as an assistant curator, said: “Anissa is interested in the storytelling power of objects, and many of the works have a narrative that can be pieced together differently depending on the audience.”

Ms. Mack’s list is a gathering of ideas that have been percolating in her psyche over the years. “#45 Amy, Amy, anyone,” for instance, refers to the artist’s childhood fascination with Amy Carter. “I was so curious about her,” said Ms. Mack, who still has the straight red hair, sprinkling of freckles and gently angular features she shared back then with America’s First Kid. “She was my ageish, but a little older. And she sort of looked like me.”

Photo

Ms. Mack hasn’t tackled the subject of Amy Carter quite yet, but that doesn’t matter. The list, for her, is a live document for future work. It can be a catalyst (or excuse) to make something new, or a way of understanding something she’s already made.

Everything in the show refers to something on the list, she explained, but some might match three, “and some categories, like Americana, might cover everything.” “Everyone’s favorite angel, 2017,” for instance, a pencil sketch of Farrah Fawcett drawn on a canvas that the artist has molded to look like white denim, could be “#20 Best of the best,” “#33 I never thought she’d take his last name,” “ or “#60 Locations, actors, obstacles.”

“Wreath,” from 2017, is a good example of how Ms. Mack might bundle together different impressions into a cohesive work. It revolves around a story she read in the paper last year about a terminally ill 14-year-old British girl whose last wish was to be cryogenically frozen. The artist printed the condensed tale, word by word, on the surface of around 300 resin-cast rings (tiny wreaths, if you will), and then arranged them among dozens of inexpensive vintage rings in a rectangular grid of foam slots, the kind of display she frequently sees at fairs and flea markets.

Photo

The work shows how nuanced Ms. Mack’s state fair resonances can be. “The girl’s story reminded me of the midway,” she said. “It’s this place of incredible hope, where you might win this huge stuffed thing, but you also kind of know you’re going to lose.”

A white neon sign casting cold light in a dark side gallery transports viewers to the midway’s fleeting alley of rickety rides and ringtoss stands. It reads “FACTS FAKES FREAKS.” Ms. Mack didn’t have political intentions when she made the sign last year — the wording came from an old sideshow banner she had seen. But the relevance today doesn’t escape her.

“The emotions generated in the space of the midway are things that really play out in other parts of American culture,” she said. “The pride of winning something for someone else, the showing off, the hucksterism.” It’s all right there.",And the Blue Ribbon Goes to ...

“They are a generation in transition since they are the first to be born here, yet they have not lost their roots,” said Ms. Vincenti, 28. “They are American, but they consider themselves Mexican, too.”

The young people, she said, approach their studies eagerly, unlike those of us who balked at weekly piano lessons as children. Even in their spare time, they kick back and play their instruments just for the fun of it. Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

Mr. Tillerson said the United States would remain in Afghanistan until peace was restored.","Mr. Tillerson’s visit was his first to Afghanistan as secretary of state, and like nearly every other top American official to visit over the previous two decades, he said the country’s predicament was not nearly as dire as his own security precautions suggested.

“But I think if you consider the current situation in Afghanistan, and we were talking about this a few minutes ago, and you look a few years in the past to what the circumstances were, Afghanistan has come quite a distance already in terms of creating a much more vibrant population, a much more vibrant government, education system, a larger economy,” he said in a small windowless conference room during a hurried eight-minute news conference. “So there are opportunities to strengthen the foundations of a prosperous Afghanistan society.”

Mr. Tillerson saw none of that hoped-for blooming.

When the huge maw of the C-17 aircraft that he flew into Bagram opened, he was greeted by Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of United States operations in Afghanistan, along with a sizable contingent of soldiers and security guards.

They piled into a motorcade and drove the few minutes to the base’s bunkerlike headquarters, passing hangers constructed by Russia, another of the foreign forces to be humbled in Afghanistan. Huge concrete blast walls lined much of the route. Helicopters patrolled the perimeter, and two security blimps equipped with long-range cameras hovered.

At the headquarters building, a former prison, Mr. Tillerson and General Nicholson met in another windowless room with Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani; its chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah; and its national security adviser, Hanif Atmar, as an armored truck and Humvee guarded outside.

After the men sat down, Mr. Tillerson said: “We had a pretty smooth flight.”

Mr. Ghani replied, “We arranged the weather for you.”

Mr. Tillerson brought with him a six-person press contingent that was taken aside late the night before and sworn to secrecy about the trip until his plane returned to Doha, Qatar, where the trip had originated.

After eight months of internal discussions, President Trump in August announced his policy for Afghanistan, an effort to prevent an obvious loss in the country. Commanders will be allowed to request troops as needed, and the administration emphasized that it would increasingly rely on regional partners like India to improve stability.

Mr. Trump also promised to pressure Pakistan, which United States officials have long accused of playing a double game in Afghanistan — publicly supporting the United States mission here while secretly bankrolling and giving shelter to the Taliban and other insurgent groups.

But the massive air base here demonstrates why the administration cannot get too tough with Pakistan, since nearly all of the supplies for this fortress city are transported by air or land through Pakistani territory. Soldiers can order supplies and gifts from Amazon, which delivers daily to the base.

Mr. Tillerson will visit Islamabad on Tuesday for his first talks with Pakistani leaders since he delivered a speech last week in which he called for improved ties with India, Pakistan’s rival. In the speech, Pakistan got only a brief, none-too-complimentary mention.

On Monday, Mr. Tillerson said that the United States was increasingly concerned about the stability of Pakistan, which has a large nuclear arsenal.

“Pakistan needs to, I think, take a cleareyed view of the situation that they’re confronted with in terms of the number of terrorist organizations that find safe haven inside of Pakistan,” he said.

Mr. Tillerson said the United States would remain in Afghanistan until peace was restored. Or perhaps until things get much worse.

“The president has made it clear that we’re here to stay until we can secure a process of reconciliation and peace,” he said. “It’s not an unlimited commitment. He’s also made it clear it’s not a blank-check commitment. It’s a conditions-based commitment.”",Rex Tillerson Pays Secret Visit to U.S. Air Base in Afghanistan,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/world/asia/rex-tillerson-afghanistan.html

Ms. Milerova says Mr. Miler handed her full control of all copyright, in writing, while on his deathbed.
Neither Ms. Milerova nor Ms. Fischerova responded to requests for comment, and they have largely stayed out of public view.
“They each have a contract that has different conditions and nobody can say which is the right contract,” Ms. Samkova said.
“This was not what Mr. Miler wanted.”With millions of dollars at stake, it could be years until the issue is unraveled.","Csaba Szalo, a professor of sociology at Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic, said Krtek was “an iconic figure, very recognizable to both kids and adults, and is across the generations very easy to identify with for the emotions he elicits.”

“He is very unique in that he has persevered throughout communist times and after as a kind of persisting cultural figure,” he added.

After the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia in 1989, Krtek (pronounced KURR-teck) was free to travel. The character would spread to China, India and Japan through movies and books, spawning lucrative merchandising contracts. Though Krtek never really made it to the United States, a Krtek toy accompanied the American astronaut Andrew J. Feustel on the space shuttle Endeavour in 2011.

Celebrating Krtek’s cultural impact and marking the 60th anniversary of the character’s first appearance, an exhibition in Prague is currently showing original drawings of the character and portraits of Mr. Miler.

However, with success came problems. Confusion about the terms of the inheritance of Mr. Miler’s work after his death in 2011 prompted a legal battle between relatives vying for control of a business empire worth millions of dollars.

According to the details of the most recent case at a court in Prague, Mr. Miler left a controlling stake to five of his direct relatives. Among them was his granddaughter, Karolina Milerova, who lived with Mr. Miler from the age of 14 after falling out with her mother. Ms. Milerova, now 28, says she maintained a close relationship with Mr. Miler and cooperated on projects involving Krtek.

Ms. Milerova says Mr. Miler handed her full control of all copyright, in writing, while on his deathbed. Soon after, she established a new company with the intention of carrying on her grandfather’s legacy, she told the court.

On Oct. 17, the court rejected her claim, determining that the language in the contract was too vague. The decision jeopardizes several licenses she issued over the past six years allowing the production of new Krtek products.

“My grandfather and I had a very special relationship because we lived together for 10 years. Later, we started to do some projects together related to his artwork,” Ms. Milerova said in an interview, adding that she would take her case to a higher court.

“I am the only person in the world who has this right to the future of the brand,” she said.

Not everybody agrees. While Ms. Milerova says that most of the family has reached a consensus after several years, her mother, Barbora Milerova, and the administrator of Mr. Miler’s inheritance, Milena Fischerova, have moved to block her from expanding Krtek’s commercial presence. Neither Ms. Milerova nor Ms. Fischerova responded to requests for comment, and they have largely stayed out of public view.

Some merchandising vendors who once enjoyed exclusive use of Krtek’s likeness through contracts struck with Mr. Miler have also expressed annoyance because they have been forced to compete with a slew of competitors granted licenses by Karolina Milerova.

Alena Samkova, director of Matejovsky, a Czech manufacturer that produces bedding and linen lines with Krtek’s image, said that the account was once the mainstay of her business. Now, however, the company is losing hundreds of thousands of dollars after the market was flooded with lower-quality replicas, she said.

“They each have a contract that has different conditions and nobody can say which is the right contract,” Ms. Samkova said. “This was not what Mr. Miler wanted.”

With millions of dollars at stake, it could be years until the issue is unraveled. The only thing that seems certain is that fans’ affection for Krtek will survive.

“In the commercial world, it has very clear effects,” said Mr. Szalo, the sociology professor. “But if you look at the audience, and children and those who are nostalgic of their childhood, they probably do not care too much about the copyright issue.”",Communism’s Answer to Mickey Mouse Is Thrust Into a Very Capitalist Dispute,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/arts/krtek-czech-mickey-mouse.html

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

Photo

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.



The photographs will be on view in an exhibit at Morrison Hotel Gallery, New York, from Nov. 9, 2017.

“Delaying a decision on a successor creates another kind of uncertainty about what Mr. Xi will do in the future.
The Times reported last year that Mr. Xi might not put his potential successors into the committee at this party congress.
But Chen Min’er, an official widely seen as a potential heir to Mr. Xi, his boss when they were still both local officials, was not on the list.
There had been talk that Mr. Xi had considered keeping him on despite reaching an age, 69, when he is supposed to retire under current unwritten rules.","If Mr. Xi does not promote one or more possible heirs into the top tier, he will buck unspoken rules that emerged from the 1990s onward, when Deng Xiaoping tried to ensure a trouble-free train of succession, avoiding a repeat of the chaos during and immediately after the rule of the revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.

Since Deng’s death in 1997, two leadership transitions have followed a pattern that, while not friction-free, gave clarity well in advance about who would take over: Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao in 2002, and Mr. Hu to Mr. Xi in 2012. But since Mr. Xi came to power at a party congress that year, he has shown a distaste for following his predecessors in lock step.

Photo

Even if Mr. Xi does not seek to stay in office beyond 10 years, he may decide that anointing an heir too soon could dilute his own power, turning him into a lame duck. Mr. Xi spent his first five-year term cracking down on corruption in the party, a drive that he also used to impose discipline and establish himself as the strongest Chinese leader in decades.

“Establishing a successor early would create uncertainty for Xi about how long his power remains at a peak,” said Wu Qiang, a current affairs analyst who formerly taught political science at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “Delaying a decision on a successor creates another kind of uncertainty about what Mr. Xi will do in the future. I think he’s not going to make a decision yet.”

Some analysts, such as Mr. Wu, believe Mr. Xi may want to stay in power beyond his second term. Under the current succession practices, he must step down as president, China’s head of state, after two terms, but there is no formal limit on his other main leadership post as head of the Communist Party. Mr. Xi could also try to stay on as chairman of the Central Military Commission, another powerful post atop the nation’s armed forces, or in another newly developed position.

Of course, unexpected turns are still possible. The selection of China’s leaders takes place behind closed doors, making it unclear what the outcome will be until the moment the new lineup is announced. While the procedures are tightly controlled, there have been reversals before.

Even the number of members on the Standing Committee is not clear. The committee has typically had seven members, but even that could change.

Mr. Xi has used the party congress to cement his control over China and the party that rules it. Before the unveiling of the new Standing Committee, the approximately 2,300 delegates at the party congress are expected on Tuesday to approve changes to the Communist Party constitution that will add Mr. Xi’s name to the document, enhancing his halo of power.

The delegates will also approve a new Central Committee, whose 200 or so full members meet once or twice a year to discuss and vote on policy. The Central Committee will in turn meet after the end of the congress to vote in a new Politburo, including its Standing Committee.

The Standing Committee, which meets regularly to discuss policies and make decisions, is where real power resides in China.

Mr. Xi all but certain to stay on the committee, as is his No. 2, Premier Li Keqiang.

But three sources citing people close to party leaders have said a proposed lineup that was circulated before the Central Committee voted did not include the names of any likely heirs. Instead, most of the five candidates for membership were old enough that they may serve just one term.

Such one-term members would be politically beholden to Mr. Xi, giving him the choice to keep them or replace them as he sees fit, perhaps even before the next congress. This could give Mr. Xi the flexibility to appoint a successor toward the end of his second term, and put off diluting his power until he is about to step down.

The three people spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the secretive discussions. The Times reported last year that Mr. Xi might not put his potential successors into the committee at this party congress.

“Xi seems to be reshaping the rules of the game,” said Joseph Fewsmith, a Boston University professor who studies Chinese elite politics. “This lineup, if it is correct, seems to confirm this.”

The candidates included Li Zhanshu, a policy adviser closely allied with Mr. Xi; Han Zheng, the party secretary of Shanghai; Wang Yang, a vice premier who has handled trade issues; Wang Huning, an ideological adviser who also worked for two previous leaders; and Zhao Leji, the head of the party’s organization department, which screens officials for promotion and transfers.

But Chen Min’er, an official widely seen as a potential heir to Mr. Xi, his boss when they were still both local officials, was not on the list. Nor was Wang Qishan, the hard-charging head of the party’s anticorruption agency, one of Mr. Xi’s closest allies. There had been talk that Mr. Xi had considered keeping him on despite reaching an age, 69, when he is supposed to retire under current unwritten rules.

The names on the list matched a report in the South China Morning Post, an English-language newspaper in Hong Kong, on Sunday.

They convince themselves that ‘this text is important,’” he said. “It’s something we need to be aware of.”

There is a dearth of data directly linking distracted walking to pedestrian injuries and deaths, but it seems to be a global problem, too. Preliminary studies “give a hint to unsafe behavior,” said Dr. Etienne Krug, director of the Department for Management of Noncommunicable Diseases, Disability, Violence and Injury Prevention at the World Health Organization.

People who text and walk, for example, are nearly four times as likely to engage in at least one dangerous action, like jaywalking or not looking both ways, and take 18 percent more time to cross a street than undistracted pedestrians. Solutions, Dr. Krug said, are “hard to legislate and even harder to enforce.”

A number of other cities have come up with creative ways to help protect so-called cellphone zombies, who talk, text, listen to music, check their email and even snap selfies. Initiatives include low-tech efforts, like edgy signs in Hayward, Calif. (“Heads Up! Cross the Street. Then Update Facebook.”) and no-selfie zones in Mumbai, and innovative traffic lights in Europe and several pieces of legislation proposed in response to Honolulu’s new law.

Last month, the Board of Supervisors in San Mateo County, Calif., unanimously passed a resolution prohibiting pedestrians’ use of cellphones while crossing streets. It’s not enforceable, as state law governs such issues, but David Canepa, who introduced the measure, said it was an important springboard; the resolution is expected to go to the California Legislature for statewide consideration in January.

“There is chaos in the crosswalks,” said Mr. Canepa, who admits to a few close calls with distracted driving and walking himself. “I know it’s an issue. I’ve lived it. My cellphone is my life.”

As children, he said, we are taught to look both ways when crossing a street, but “you can’t look both ways when you’re looking down and texting.”

Critics are concerned about personal freedom and slow to adjust to new ideas, Mr. Canepa said. “But at the end of the day, people understand the value of public safety,” he added. “This legislation is practical and is common sense. It will save lives.”

At least 10 states have debated similar legislation dealing with distracted pedestrians or bicyclists; none of it has passed, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Legislation is pending in two states, the group said, and in September, New York passed a law that directs New York City to study its efforts to educate the public on the dangers of distracted walking.

Municipal laws are not tracked, but Rexburg, Idaho, may have been among the first to adopt a citywide ban, in 2011. The city recorded five pedestrian deaths in a short period in a concentrated area. It was a high toll, given the city’s size: about 35,000 residents.

“It was a shock to our system,” said Stephen Zollinger, Rexburg’s city attorney.

Distracted walking was suspected. Along with other safety measures, Rexburg barred pedestrians from using hand-held devices — except while talking — while crossing public streets, he said, and “we’ve not had a pedestrian fatality since.”

Bodegraven, a small town near Amsterdam, tried a different approach. This year, it embedded LED-illuminated strips in the crosswalk at a busy intersection — right in the line of sight of people staring at their phones. When the traffic lights turn red or green, so do the lights at ground level, alerting pedestrians when it’s safe to cross.

The pilot program aims to anticipate trends, not reverse them, said Dolf Roodenburg, the project leader and a traffic engineer in the Netherlands. If it’s successful, the town hopes to install the lights at more intersections and on bike paths, and offer them to other cities.

In Augsburg, Germany, similar lights were installed last year after a teenager using her smartphone was struck and seriously injured by a tram when she walked onto the tracks.

There are, of course, contrary points of view on the effectiveness of legislating pedestrian behavior.

Janette Sadik-Khan, a former commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation and now transportation principal at Bloomberg Associates, which advises mayors around the world, said laws against texting and walking were not the answer. They have no basis in any research, are poorly conceived and distract from the road design and driver behavior issues that are responsible for most crashes, she said.

“It’s an easy way out. Engineering is a lot more difficult, but a lot more efficient,” Ms. Sadik-Khan said. “Traffic safety is very serious business in government, based in sound analysis.”

She and others recommended focusing on proven strategies like vehicle speed reduction, which is one of the most effective ways to reduce deaths, as survival rates are higher in low-speed collisions.

Vehicle design can also help. “In some countries, cars are designed to be more forgiving to pedestrians,” said Deborah A. P. Hersman, president and chief executive of the National Safety Council. Making bumpers softer and modifying the front ends of vehicles can reduce the severity of a pedestrian impact, but only 44 countries, mostly in Europe, require manufacturers to apply these protections, according to the W.H.O. The United States is not among them.

Rochelle Sobel, founder of the Association for Safe International Road Travel, a nonprofit group, said it was important for Americans traveling abroad to learn the local road culture. In the Dominican Republic, pedestrians do not have the right of way, and in some countries, drivers routinely ignore traffic regulations.

For example, they may fail to stop at intersections or red lights, Ms. Sobel said. In many low- and middle-income countries, where about 90 percent of the world’s road-traffic deaths occur, according to the W.H.O., pedestrians often share poorly maintained roads with animals, carts, cars, buses and trucks. Those roads are already high-risk environments not designed for walking, Ms. Sobel said.

Ms. Hersman, who previously served as chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said concerns about government overreach often lessened with time. Laws requiring seatbelt use or restricting smoking initially met resistance but now are widely accepted.

“It’s important to have an open mind,” she said. “Society can move forward.”

Mather, 37, founded The Athletic with Adam Hansmann, 29. They worked together at Strava, an app and website for weekend warriors and elite competitors that calls itself the social network for athletes.

That experience, along with their frustration at the difficulty of finding high-quality sportswriting that wasn’t bogged down by pop-up ads, informed their big bet. They believe there are hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions, of enthusiastic sports fans willing to pay $60 annually — less with frequently offered discounts — for good reporting and writing, a clean app and no ads.

They have raised almost $8 million in venture capital funding and have recurring subscription revenue, ensuring the site won’t shutter soon. But the question everybody in sports media is asking is what happens in three, five, seven years? Will The Athletic’s business model allow it to survive that long?

Newspapers are a classic example of a bundle. Subscribers might read just one section, but their subscription gets them the entire paper. Mather and Hansmann believe that sports is an undervalued part of that bundle, and that there are tens of thousands of sports fans in each city who don’t care about the other sections, and would rather jettison their subscription and pay for The Athletic instead.

“I think the sports page has carried local papers for a while, and they don’t treat it well,” Mather said.

After waiting nine months to debut their second local site, Toronto, and another five months for their third, Cleveland, the company planned to grow the number of local sites slowly, before tackling national ones. But that timeline was drastically altered after layoffs at ESPN, Sports Illustrated, Yahoo Sports, Fox Sports, Bleacher Report, Vice Sports and Vocativ this spring and summer put dozens of talented, well-connected journalists on the market.

“I’d say it’s probably the largest talent displacement in sports media ever,” Hansmann said.

The Athletic raised $5.6 million in venture capital financing in July to take advantage of the moment, adding to the $2.3 million seed round it raised in January.

“It was really hard to see everything that was happening in terms of the layoffs,” said Deepen Parikh, an executive at Courtside Ventures, one of The Athletic’s largest investors, “and knowing we really, genuinely had an opportunity to capitalize on it and not take it.”

The Athletic did not need to raise any financing, its executives said. Only one of the local sites, Toronto, breaks even — Chicago and the Bay Area and “a few smaller markets” are on track to do so by the end of the year, executives said — but most subscribers pay upfront for an annual subscription, so The Athletic had cash in hand to continue operations.

The company has wasted no time spending the new money. It started sites in Detroit, Philadelphia, the Bay Area and Minnesota, brought on the former Fox Sports writer Stewart Mandel to lead a national college football site and hired the former Sports Illustrated writer Seth Davis to head up another for national college basketball.

Paul Fichtenbaum, a former top Sports Illustrated editor who had been working for The Athletic as a consultant, was hired to oversee the national sites and start a longform vertical, called Ink. “Building a company is exciting,” he said, but the “bigger opportunity to change an industry is really something that we all aspire to.”

Now the plan is to raise even more money soon, and to gain a foothold in every American and Canadian professional sports market within two years. “If there is a hockey, basketball, baseball or football team” in a city, Hansmann said, “that’s the starting point.”

It is that kind of ambition, in an industry that has sustained a decade of retrenchment, that has most of the sports media industry rooting for The Athletic’s success. Every writer knows he or she could be the next victim of a naïve pivot to video.

But Mather and Hansmann have displayed sharp elbows, and not everybody is happy with them. Newspaper sports editors have been left smarting after losing reporters to The Athletic — four writers for The Athletic Bay Area worked at the Bay Area Newspaper Group a few months ago. And then there is Dejan Kovacevic, a longtime Pittsburgh sportswriter who started DK Pittsburgh Sports, a subscription-based local sports site that in some ways is a model for The Athletic, three years ago.

In an email, Kovacevic said Mather and Hansmann approached him to be an adviser but they couldn’t agree on compensation. The Athletic, he said, promised not to start a Pittsburgh site. Instead, The Athletic Pittsburgh hired a second writer away from DK Pittsburgh Sports recently. Kovacevic also said that Mather and Hansmann were unhappy when he sold a copy of his publishing platform to Greg Bedard, who launched a subscription sports site in Boston this summer, because they said it raised their cost of doing business.

Mather said that when The Athletic’s executives spoke with Kovacevic they had no intention of expanding into Pittsburgh in the near term, and that he and Hansmann “only make ‘promises’ to our customers, employees, investors and partners.”

“We are doing great work,” Mather said. “We treat our writers really well, we pay them well, and we are doing amazing journalism. If someone has a problem with that, that’s on them.”

Mather and Hansmann also don’t hew to traditional — they would say antiquated — norms about the separation of business and advertising efforts, and are already cozier with the teams they cover than many outlets. They have an agreement with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, for instance, whereby Argonauts season ticket-holders can receive a trial subscription to The Athletic, paid for by the Argonauts.

Hansmann said The Athletic pulled no punches in its reporting on the Argonauts, while Mather suggested The Athletic could partner with teams on insider video or events in which subscribers go to the stadium early for exclusive access. Fichtenbaum said his understanding was the Argonauts partnership was a one-off.

Similarly, many of The Athletic’s representatives sang the virtues of its digital presentation, which shuns banner ads. But Parikh, the investor, said, “advertising has a very real opportunity down the road with The Athletic,” before adding that it would have to be “customer centric.”

Mather and Hansmann declined to disclose subscription numbers, but they have said Toronto, their most successful local site, has more than 15,000 subscribers. The national sites figure to boost local subscription numbers.

As The Athletic’s costs rise — it will soon need a bigger office, and the company is beginning to hire nonrevenue-generating support staff like accountants and human resources personnel — the company will seemingly need to attract casual sports fans. But Mather and Hansmann are not convinced.

“In a city like Chicago, there are 100,000 die-hard fans,” Mather said. “That is a very lucrative subscription business. There are over 100,000 die-hard fans of Chicago teams outside of Chicago,” he added, and he says they aren’t served well. “Bleacher Report is empty calories. SB Nation is empty calories. The newspapers are doing nothing.”

More journalists and investors will pay attention if The Athletic can get to the point that it can rely only on its own revenue, rather than having to turn to venture capital. Successful online media subscription products usually either cost hundreds or thousands of dollars annually and appeal to information-starved professionals — like The Information and Politico Pro — or have relatively inexpensive subscriptions that support relatively few writers — like DK Pittsburgh Sports and Stratechery.

While The Athletic aspires to be the Spotify or Netflix of sports media, the only media companies that have achieved scale with a relatively low price point (and the help of ads) are the very same newspapers The Athletic is intent on destroying.

Bleacher Report was the big sports media winner of the era when scale and online advertising revenue seemed like the future of media. It was rarely profitable and raised $40 million in venture capital funding before being bought by Turner in 2012 for about $175 million. According to skeptical media executives and investors interviewed for this article, something similar is likely the best-case scenario for The Athletic.

Mather and Hansmann insist that they, and their investors, are in it for the long haul, and that the time is finally right for a subscription media product to go big. “The advertising business model does not align with quality,” Mather said. “It’s hot takes instead of objective analysis, it’s short-term instead of long-term, it’s serving sponsors instead of users, it’s thinking big instead of great.”

“It really comes down to the business model,” he added. “That is our core belief.”",Why The Athletic Wants to Pillage Newspapers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/sports/the-athletic-newspapers.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

Photo

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Jeff Chen is back with a surprisingly straightforward puzzle, which made me wonder if he was secretly taking us for a ride. His puzzles have had some pretty neat gimmicks in them, so when I see a list theme from him, my first thought is that perhaps he is pulling the old bluff on us.

Today’s Theme

It’s actually a list theme, but it’s a tight one. A total of four, two-word phrases each have a synonym for “victim” as their first word, and the CON MEN who target them are hiding away at 43D. For example, at 30A, the answer to “A mere pittance” is CHUMP CHANGE and, at 40A, the answer to the clue “Unexpected hit” is SUCKER PUNCH.

Tricky Clues

21A: A “Person setting the stage?” could be a narrator, but today it’s a ROADIE setting up for a concert.

57A: This puzzle was one of the entries in the Westchester Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and quite a few of the solvers were bamboozled by the spelling of MARK ANTONY with a ‘K.’ Many contestants thought that his name was spelled with a ‘C,’ but it’s not. And you have that easy crossing of PORKY’S to confirm.

23D: My first reaction to IBANKER was “What? No!” but it’s a thing.

37D: UNDEROOS were haute couture when The Boy was a wee one. He preferred the Batman ones.

Constructor Notes

My mother-in-law’s name is Patsy and I’m a big fan of Patsy Cline — “Walkin’ After Midnight” is one of my favorites. Not hard to see where I got the idea for the puzzle. What is hard to see is PATSY CLINE in the grid. She could have gone where PIGEON COOP is, but my mother-in-law in a crossword where PATSY is associated with CHUMP, SUCKER, and MARK ... hmm.

The key to the app’s convenience is also its downside: A person who is a friend of yours on Facebook can add you to a GroupMe chat without your consent.

Last November, news of the “Mud Men” chat spread like wildfire.

Students started noticing the racist chat on the morning of Nov. 11 when freshmen who were targeted posted screenshots of the threats on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, forcing students inside the Penn bubble — and plenty outside of it — to pay attention. Black organizations sent a barrage of emails and texts to their constituencies about the situation and began to plan for an emergency town hall. By the afternoon, the news had been picked up by national civil rights activists, including Shaun King and DeRay Mckesson. The news was trending on Twitter for hours before the school issued an official response.

There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of Penn’s black freshmen and in turn, Penn’s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.

The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on Penn’s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.

That problem is not exclusive to the University of Pennsylvania: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.

Don’t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat’s existence. I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.

Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the Penn administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.

Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.

The racist chat appeared to have been created in Oklahoma, but for the creator to have known so many members of the black freshman class, he or she would have to have been at Penn. So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus. There were multiple individuals who were taunting students on this chat, and all were anonymized by pseudonyms. So the big questions were: How many people were involved? Would they act on their covert threats? How much of the population of the school did they speak for? The chats also included a racial taunt that invoked the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, some chapters of which have been shut down at other campuses for racist behavior. (The Penn S.A.E. chapter immediately denounced the online attacks.)

Working with the F.B.I., the administration was able to identify the creator of the GroupMe chat within a few weeks — a student at the University of Oklahoma who had been accepted to Penn but chose not to attend. The student was suspended, and both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Oklahoma issued condemnations of his actions. Ultimately, the investigation found that no Penn students were involved in the chat. But these kinds of incidents make black and brown students increasingly wary.

GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It’s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.

An anonymous attack on GroupMe doesn’t feel that different from racist propaganda in “real life.” Just a few months ago, someone put up neo-Nazi recruitment fliers around campus. They were promptly removed, but the incident had an important thing in common with the GroupMe disaster: anonymity.

The creator of the GroupMe and the people who hung the fliers hid their names and faces, putting the students they were targeting in the precarious position of questioning who to trust.

Who is to blame for a faceless flier or for anonymous internet trolling? Either incident could be indicative of the racist opinions of one person or of many.

Re “Do We Believe Women? Nation Takes Fresh Look at Sexual Harassment” (Retro Report, Oct. 18):

Your headline asks, “Do We Believe Women?” The answer lately seems to be yes.

Unlike the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas, in which the central question was whether Anita Hill was credible, the response to Harvey Weinstein (and subsequent reports of sexual harassment everywhere from schools to boardrooms to studios to state legislatures) has not centered on questions of whether we should believe women. Indeed, the overwhelming consensus is that of course we should believe them, because their reports are so entirely and obviously believable.

This is not progress. I long for a day when sexual harassment is so rare that we will be surprised by these kinds of allegations, when one woman’s report isn’t instantly met with a chorus of “#MeToo.”

Military generals are a fraternity comprised almost exclusively of white men, according to a government report from 2011. How dare their word be questioned?

But there is no limit to the questioning of women in the Trump universe, no matter how high those women have risen, no matter the merits of their claims, particularly if the women are black or brown or if they have directly challenged Trump.

As Michelle Lyn wrote for Vogue.com last week:

“According to Trump’s sordid he-said-she-said turn of events, however, Wilson isn’t an elected official supporting a constituent and friend, she’s a ‘wacky’ woman. Just like Clinton and San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz were ‘nasty’; Brzezinski had a ‘low IQ’; Megyn Kelly has ‘blood coming out of her wherever”; and Jessica Leeds, who accused Trump of assault, ‘would not be [his] first choice.’”

She continued:

“Women who hold truth to Trump’s power are often met with petty insults and cyberbullying (Paging Melania!) — but most of all, Trump and company brand them liars or assail them as absurd.”

One common thread is to reach beyond attacking these women on the merits of their claims to attacking the way they look. And this isn’t simply constrained to Trump himself; it is apparently in the bloodline. Donald Trump Jr. once referred to Congresswoman Maxine Waters as looking “like a stripper.”

Another strategy of dismissal is to portray these women as mere ideological, party-serving puppets, rather than as fierce advocates with their own opinions and power.

Trump tweeted, for example, that Mayor Cruz was “told by the Democrats that you must be nasty” to him.

None of this is out of step with what his base wants. Trump is advancing an agenda of white male identity politics and for those in his camp and in his corner, this is the dawn of a blissful new day.

Trump isn’t simply doing this on a personal level; he’s also doing it on the broader policy level.

At the same time that he’s pushing massive tax cuts for the top 1 percent, he is also seriously considering welfare reform. You may not fully comprehend the racial dimensions of this, so allow me to elucidate.

According to a Tax Policy Center report issued late last month about the Republican tax plan, in 2018, “Taxpayers in the top one percent (incomes above $730,000), would receive about 50 percent of the total tax benefit,” and by 2027, “about 80 percent of the total benefit would accrue to taxpayers in the top one percent.”

And who exactly are the top 1 percent, demographically? Well, a 2011 analysis by The Grio found that they are 96.2 percent white, and a 2012 study found that about eight in 10 were men.

Contrast that with welfare, where the majority of recipients are women. Although white people are the largest group of recipients of most of the major government assistance programs, many white people, and Republicans in particular, don’t seem to realize this. A YouGov poll taken in January of 2016 found that a plurality of respondents and an even higher percentage of Republicans wrongly believe that black people are welfare’s largest recipients.

Much of the money is directed at white people, but most of the stigma is directed at black and brown people, and Trump is, like a multitude of Republicans before him, exploiting the misperception.

The city’s downtown theater district, another top tourist draw, wasn’t as lucky. Located just blocks from Buffalo Bayou, which rose about 40 feet during the storm, the district suffered widespread flooding. Water filled the basement of Jones Hall, home to the Houston Symphony. One of the recently renovated Alley Theater’s two stages was destroyed, along with all the company’s sets and costumes. At the Wortham Theater Center, which hosts the Houston Grand Opera and the Houston Ballet, the water rose almost to the lip of the main stage, putting the theater out of commission for at least a year.

While the ballet, the symphony and the Alley were able to move this season’s performances to other concert halls around town, the Houston Grand Opera had to get more creative. The managing director, Perryn Leech, decided to build an entirely new venue, dubbed the Resilience Theater, inside the cavernous George R. Brown Convention Center. This presented a long list of challenges, including how to pacify season ticket holders (free Lyft rides to and from shows); where to place the orchestra (behind the stage); and how to finesse the acoustics (a work in progress). The opera opened its season on Friday night with a drastically scaled-down production of “La Traviata.”

“Some of the greatest performances I’ve ever attended or worked on have been at temporary venues,” Mr. Leech said, putting an optimistic spin on the company’s predicament. “You wouldn’t necessarily have chosen this, but it’s an opportunity to take a main-stage opera and put it into a different space. Each performance is going to be an event in itself.”

One of the buzziest recent additions to the Houston arts calendar is the Day for Night multimedia festival. Last year’s event, headlined by Björk and Aphex Twin, drew two-thirds of its audience — about 17,000 people — from outside the city. This year’s installment will be held over a weekend in December, with performances by Thom Yorke and Nine Inch Nails, and a symposium on politics and art featuring Chelsea Manning, Laurie Anderson and Pussy Riot’s Nadya Tolokonnikova.

“We feel like Day for Night is so important because it’s a chance to show how resilient Houston is,” said Omar Afra, the festival co-founder and the publisher of the underground newspaper Free Press Houston. “If Houston was a kid on the street, it would be that knucklehead who you push down but they keep getting back up. You’re just not going to stop us.”

One of the city’s biggest draws remains its innovative restaurant scene, which has been garnering national accolades for years. Three of the past four winners of the James Beard Foundation’s award for Best Chef: Southwest have been Houstonians. One of them, Underbelly’s Mr. Shepherd, suggested a few culinary must-dos: a picnic lunch at Menil Park, beer and tacos on the crowded patio at Eight Row Flint, dinner in the outdoor garden of the intimate Italian restaurant Coltivare.

“You don’t have to come here to help out,” he said. “You can come to enjoy yourself and have fun. It’s a beautiful time of year. The heat is pretty much coming down, and we don’t have hard-core winters. This is actually the best time of year to come to Houston.”",Most Houston Attractions Have Reopened; the Opera Gets Creative,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/travel/houston-attractions-reopen.html

Since 2005, he has done so for 19 writing systems (and he’s currently working to add another eight). With Noor’s help, and some financial support from a research center at the University of California, Berkeley, he drew up the basic set of letters and defined how they combine, what rules govern punctuation and whether spaces exist between words, then submitted a proposal to the Unicode Consortium, the organization that maintains the standards for digital scripts. In 2018, seven years after Pandey’s discovery, what came to be called Hanifi Rohingya will be rolled out in Unicode’s 11th version. The Rohingya will be able to communicate online with one another, using their own alphabet.

As a practical matter, this will not have much impact for the Rohingya who are suffering in Myanmar, many of whom are illiterate and shut off from educational and technological opportunity. “The spread of this new digital system is unlikely to go to scale,” Maung Zarni, a human rights activist who works on Rohingya issues, and Natalie Brinham, a Ph.D. fellow at Queen Mary University of London, told me in an email. They emphasized that the Rohingya do not have the autonomy to organize their own schools. But given the group’s history of oppression, the encoding of their language carries considerable symbolic weight because it legitimizes an oppressed minority and their language. “It becomes a tool of unity to help people come together,” Noor says.

Creating such interconnectedness and expanding the linguistic powers of technology users around the world is the whole point of Unicode. If the work is slow, that’s because standardizing a writing system for computers is a delicate art that relies on both engineering and diplomacy. And the time and attention of the volunteers who maintain the standard are finite. So what happens when a new system of visual communication like emoji emerges and comes under their purview? Things get even slower and the mission more complicated.

Shortly after finishing a linguistics Ph.D. at Berkeley in 1980, Ken Whistler was frustrated by the inability of mainframe computers to print the specialized phonetic symbols that linguists use. I can fix that, he thought, and he then hacked an early personal computer to do so. In 1989, on one of his first days on the job at a software start-up, his boss told him to meet with a Xerox computer scientist, Joe Becker, who had just published a manifesto on multilingual computing. “The people of the world need to be able to communicate and compute in their own native languages,” Becker wrote, “not just in English.”

At the time, computing in the United States relied on encodings like those from the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (usually known as ASCII), which assigned numerical identifiers to letters, numbers, punctuation and behaviors (like “indent”). The capital letter “A,” for instance, had an ASCII code of 065, or 01000001 in the 0s and 1s in the binary code of computers. Each textual character used by a computer needs its own unique sequence, a numerical identifier or “character encoding.” The problem with ASCII was that it had only 256 codes to distribute and far more than 256 characters in the world needing identifiers.

In order to work with more writing systems than ASCII was able to handle, technology companies like Apple, Xerox, IBM, DEC, Hewlett-Packard and even Kodak created their proprietary encodings. None of them worked with the others. To complicate things further, some nations insisted as a matter of national pride on their own standards for text data. “The proliferation of character encodings was chaos,” Whistler says.

Joe Becker gathered like-minded computer scientists to bring order to the chaos, arguing that cooperation was needed among companies. The result was the Unicode Consortium, which was incorporated in 1991. He also maintained that the solution had to be international and helped broker an alliance with the International Organization for Standardization, which maintains more than 20,000 standards related to products and services, from the tensile strength of yarn to the chemical composition of toys. Such standards are meant to ensure, among other things, that things from one country can be used in the industrial processes of another. Standardized shipping containers, for instance, have made international commerce far more efficient. Standards don’t become regulations; they’re conventions, “recipes for reality” in the words of Lawrence Busch, a sociologist emeritus at Michigan State University who studies how standards arise. Unicode unified all the numerical identifiers and made sure they were reliable and up-to-date.

As is the case in other standards organizations, full membership in the nonprofit Unicode Consortium comes with the right to vote on changes to the standard. Membership dues are $18,000 annually; current full members include global tech giants (like Apple, Facebook and Google) and the Sultanate of Oman (which wants to see digital Arabic improved). A second membership tier includes a university, government bodies in Bangladesh and India, a typeface company and an emoji search engine. Over the years, members came and went, depending on their immediate interest in issues of standardization.

Unicode’s idealistic founders intended to bring the personal-computing revolution to everyone on the planet, regardless of language. “The people who really got the bug,” Whistler says, “saw themselves at an inflection point in history and their chance to make a difference.” No fortunes have been made through Unicode, unless you count the platforms (like Twitter) and products (like the iPhone) that adopted the standard.

Unicode’s history is full of attacks by governments, activists and eccentrics. In the early 1990s, the Chinese government objected to the encoding of Tibetan. About five years ago, Hungarian nationalists tried to sabotage the encoding for Old Hungarian because they wanted it to be called “Szekley-Hungarian Rovas” instead. An encoding for an alphabet used to write Nepal Bhasa and Sanskrit was delayed a few years ago by ethnonationalists who mistrusted the proposal because they objected to the author’s surname. Over and over, the Unicode Consortium has protected its standard from such political attacks.

The standard’s effectiveness helped. “If standards work, they’re invisible and can be ignored by the public,” Busch says. Twenty years after its first version, Unicode had become the default text-data standard, adopted by device manufacturers and software companies all over the world. Each version of the standard ushered more users into a seamless digital world of text. “We used to ask ourselves, ‘How many years do you think the consortium will need to be in place before we can publish the last version?’ ” Whistler recalls. The end was finally in sight — at one point the consortium had barely more than 50 writing systems to add.

All that changed in October 2010, when that year’s version of the Unicode standard included its first set of emojis.

On a downtown San Francisco street last November, partygoers were lined up at a Taco Bell truck to get tacos. Inside the nearby co-working space, Covo, was the opening night party of Emojicon, a weekend-long celebration of all things emoji, held just days before the presidential election. Only foods that could be depicted with emojis were being served, while a balloon artist twisted approximations of various emojis.

In the late 1990s, when Japanese phone manufacturers first put emojis on their devices as marketing gimmicks, messaging standards required that emojis be sent as text data — as characters matched to strings of numbers, not as images. But emojis were unreadable on devices that couldn’t translate their numerical identifiers.

When a software engineer named Graham Asher suggested in 2000 that Unicode take responsibility for emojis, the consortium demurred on the grounds that pictures were subjectively interpreted. A few years later, companies like Apple and Microsoft realized that the increasingly popular Japanese emojis would appear as gibberish on their products and pushed the consortium to encode them. By 2009, 974 emojis had been assigned numerical identifiers, which were released the following year.

As the demand for new emojis surged, so, too, did the criticisms. White human figures didn’t reflect the diversity of real skin colors. Many emojis for specific professions (like police officer and construction worker) had only male figures, while icons for foods didn’t represent what people around the world actually ate. Millions of users wanted to communicate using the language of emoji, and as consumers, they expected change to be swift. One thing appeared to be slowing things down: the Unicode Consortium.

At Emojicon, resentment toward Unicode was simmering amid the emoji karaoke, emoji improv and talks on emoji linguistics. “Such a 1980s sci-fi villain name,” one participant grumbled. “Who put them in charge?” A student from Rice University, Mark Bramhill, complained that the requirements for the yoga-pose emoji he had proposed were off-puttingly specific, almost as if they were meant to deter him. A general antiestablishment frustration seemed to be directed at the ruling organization. One speaker, Latoya Peterson, the deputy editor of digital innovation for ESPN’s “The Undefeated,” urged people to submit proposals to Unicode for more diverse emojis. “We are the internet!” she said. “It is us!”

On the first morning of Emojicon, Mark Davis, president of Unicode, explained in a talk that the consortium also maintains the repository for time and date formats, currency and language names and other information that adapts computer functions to where a user is. Even more demanding technically is making sure that characters behave as users want them to. One major achievement has been ironing out how right-to-left alphabets like Arabic are used in the same line of text as left-to-right ones like Latin, which affects billions of users and can take years to adjust. Dealing with emojis, in short, is a small, though increasing, part of the consortium’s responsibilities.

Davis mentioned that once characters become part of the Unicode standard, they’re never removed. This inspired one young designer in the audience to announce that he’d ensure his legacy by proposing emojis until one was accepted. The crowd laughed; Davis smiled coolly, perhaps because Unicode committees have been overwhelmed with some 500 submissions in the last three years.

Not everyone thinks that Unicode should be in the emoji business at all. I met several people at Emojicon promoting apps that treat emojis like pictures, not text, and I heard an idea floated for a separate standards body for emojis run by people with nontechnical backgrounds. “Normal people can have an opinion about why there isn’t a cupcake emoji,” said Jennifer 8. Lee, an entrepreneur and a film producer whose advocacy on behalf of a dumpling emoji inspired her to organize Emojicon. The issue isn’t space — Unicode has about 800,000 unused numerical identifiers — but about whose expertise and worldview shapes the standard and prioritizes its projects.

“Emoji has had a tendency to subtract attention from the other important things the consortium needs to be working on,” Ken Whistler says. He believes that Unicode was right to take responsibility for emoji, because it has the technical expertise to deal with character chaos (and has dealt with it before). But emoji is an unwanted distraction. “We can spend hours arguing for an emoji for chopsticks, and then have nobody in the room pay any attention to details for what’s required for Nepal, which the people in Nepal use to write their language. That’s my main concern: emoji eats the attention span both in the committee and for key people with other responsibilities.”

Emoji has nonetheless provided a boost to Unicode. Companies frequently used to implement partial versions of the standard, but the spread of emoji now forces them to adopt more complete versions of it. As a result, smartphones that can manage emoji will be more likely to have Hanifi Rohingya on them too. The stream of proposals also makes the standard seem alive, attracting new volunteers to Unicode’s mission. It’s not unusual for people who come to the organization through an interest in emoji to end up embracing its priorities. “Working on characters used in a small province of China, even if it’s 20,000 people who are going to use it, that’s a more important use of their time than deliberating over whether the hand of my yoga emoji is in the right position,” Mark Bramhill told me.

Since its creation was announced in 2015, the “Adopt a Character” program, through which individuals and organizations can sponsor any characters, including emojis, has raised more than $200,000. A percentage of the proceeds goes to support the Script Encoding Initiative, a research project based at Berkeley, which is headed by the linguistics researcher Deborah Anderson, who is devoted to making Unicode truly universal. One the consortium recently accepted is called Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong, devised for the Hmong language by a minister in California whose parishioners have been using it for more than 25 years. Still in the proposal stage is Tigalari, once used to write Sanskrit and other Indian languages.

One way to read the story of Unicode in the time of emoji is to see a privileged generation of tech consumers confronting the fact that they can’t communicate in ways they want to on their devices: through emoji. They get involved in standards-making, which yields them some satisfaction but slows down the speed with which millions of others around the world get access to the most basic of online linguistic powers. “There are always winners and losers in standards,” Lawrence Busch says. “You might want to say, ultimately we’d like everyone to win and nobody to lose too much, but we’re stuck with the fact that we have to make decisions, and when we make them, those decisions are going to be less acceptable to some than to others.”",How the Appetite for Emojis Complicates the Effort to Standardize the World’s Alphabets,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/how-the-appetite-for-emojis-complicates-the-effort-to-standardize-the-worlds-alphabets.html

Ms. Morris battled frequent frustration, particularly with the damage to her speech, which included impairment of her language. She remembers failing to identify basic images.

“I would say the wrong word for what was there,” she said. “For instance, say it was a cat, I’d say ‘dog.’ Or if it was a rabbit, I’d say ‘pig.’ But I really thought I’d said the right word. Everything was so mixed up.”

During this time her grandmother offered much support, as her mother lived in Britain, along with Ms. Morris’s two brothers.

It was months before she was able to walk again. To this day, she still has weakness on her right side. Despite the setbacks, Ms. Morris set goals, working — often as a babysitter — by day, and studying at night.

“I was just like a nerd,” she said. “I was in the library all the time.”

Nine years after her stroke, Ms. Morris completed her bachelor’s degree in media studies at Hunter College in 1996; she earned her master’s in English education from City College of New York in 2006. Additionally, Ms. Morris completed coursework to be a certified nursing assistant, and from 2007 to 2009 she worked for the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan. Her entry into the medical field was inspired not by her own medical scare but by that of her closest relative.

“Grandmother wasn’t feeling well,” Ms. Morris recalled. “I thought maybe I could do something to help her. I was just trying to keep up, to see what I could do to help her, help myself, get a job.”

By 2012, her grandmother had grown feebler, and Ms. Morris stepped in as her primary caretaker. She empathized with her grandmother’s frustration at not being able to vocalize her needs, having had a nearly identical experience in the wake of her own medical crisis, and became adept at anticipating them.

The death of her grandmother, in 2014, took a deep emotional toll on Ms. Morris.

The following year, seeking a fresh start, she enrolled in the Grace Institute in Manhattan, which provides job-skills training to low-income women.

Community Service Society, one of the organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, used $233 from the fund to pay for two monthly MetroCards to cover Ms. Morris’s commuting costs to the training center.

In February, Ms. Morris graduated from the institute’s administrative assistant program. She is now looking for a job.

Since 2016, Ms. Morris, who rents a room in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan, has worked part-time as a receptionist and administrative assistant one day a week at a nursing home in Norwalk, Conn. She also receives food stamps and Social Security Disability payments.

In addition to the independence and stability that steady income would provide, Ms. Morris said having a job would be an integral part of achieving normalcy, of feeling that she was truly moving at the same pace as others.

Today’s Theme

We’re taking “Selfies” at each of our vacation stops, with a hilarious editorial acknowledgment of the selfie phenomenon in the circled/shaded squares (they all say “ME.”)

Each of the theme entries is a destination where Ms. Gray takes a selfie and then updates her Facebook status with the photo and a description of where she is. For example, at 16D she waxes (sorry) eloquent about visiting MADAM TUSSAUD’S museum: “Facebook Status: ‘Vegas, baby!

Some areas of the puzzle will be tough if solvers are not familiar with a destination or how it’s described. I had to look up where the 2016 Summer Olympics were to get 23A’s CHRIST THE REDEEMER from the clue “Facebook Status: ‘2016 Summer Olympics and a day trip to one of the new Seven Wonders of the World!’ ” As always, your mileage may vary.

A. City life offers few opportunities to flex your green thumb. A fire escape or a window ledge can make for an alluring solution — who wouldn’t want a little box of nature perched outside the window? But if that pretty flowerpot falls off the ledge onto the street below, it could prove deadly for a passer-by, which may explain why your co-op prohibits placing objects on the ledge. A fire escape, meanwhile, is neither a terrace nor a balcony, but an escape route, as its name aptly suggests.

“No one should be using a fire escape for the storage or placement of any items, including plantings,” said Mark A. Hakim, the director of the cooperative and condominium department at the New York City law firm Chaves & Perlowitz. “It is a matter of health and safety.”

Your neighbors shouldn’t knowingly let water leak into your apartment — it’s rude. Manners aside, they are also violating city and state laws about fire safety that call for keeping means of egress free of obstructions. Keep sounding the alarm — and consider your complaints a public service. Yes, the water could damage your apartment, but a falling object could harm someone, and a blocked fire escape could endanger the lives of your neighbors.

Write another letter to the board and to the managing agent. Demand that the board “take this matter seriously,” Mr. Hakim said. You could also report the blocked fire escape to 311. If an inspector finds a fire hazard, the building would likely be issued a violation. Since you are a shareholder in the corporation, press the board to act before you help inflict fines against your own building.

Unfortunately, nearly all utilities forbid this. In fact, Florida Power and Light lobbied the Legislature hard this year to restrict their customers from access to home-based solar systems when the grid goes down.

We should use this opportunity in Puerto Rico and other places hit hard by recent storms to do two things: Rebuild damaged or destroyed homes and businesses to be as energy efficient as possible, and rebuild the grid so that alternative energy systems like solar and wind, whether on a home or in a microgrid, can operate independently when the larger grid is damaged or shut down. (Microgrids are small networks of electricity users who rely on a local generating source like solar that is usually attached to the larger grid but can operate independently.)

The need for affordable, clean, reliable, resilient power is most acute for the majority of people of Caribbean island nations who pay high prices for electricity generated by burning imported oil and often paid for by imported capital. A nation like the Bahamas can spend a substantial part of its tourist industry’s earnings just to run its electricity system, and other islands are even worse off.

Our organization, the Rocky Mountain Institute, works with the Clinton Foundation, international and regional partners, governments and utilities to help Caribbean island nations switch to modern and regionally abundant solar and wind power. Those efforts were going well before the latest hurricanes. Solar arrays in the Turks and Caicos Islands and on Cooper Island in the British Virgin Islands, among others, survived the hurricanes without damage and were able to provide electricity to nearby communities.

With those storms behind us, we must work to rebuild stronger, fuel-free, stormproof power systems based on decentralized and resilient renewables like solar. We need to use 21st century innovation, not 20th century technology. Importing fossil fuels costs these island nations enormous sums. Yet the sun shines and the wind blows on these islands for free. We’re optimistic we can do this. But we’ll have to resist our own impulses to carry on with business as usual.

We can learn from the experience of another Caribbean nation — Cuba. Most electricity in the country was restored within a week after Irma struck in early September; in Havana, took just three days. More than a decade ago, Cuba modernized its Soviet-era power plants and centralized grid. In 2005 serious blackouts occurred on 224 days. In 2007 the island’s move to decentralized energy cut that to zero. Now, when hurricanes like Irma hit, many parts of Cuba can sustain vital services.

What was Cuba’s resilient formula? First, the efficient use of power, which helped renewables do more at lower cost. Millions of efficient light bulbs, fans, rice cookers, pressure cookers, refrigerators, air-conditioners and pumps were sold nationwide, reducing power usage.

Most important, Cuba added over 1,800 decentralized diesel and fuel-oil-fired electrical plants across the island and upgraded the infrastructure of the grid itself. Cuba lets these local plants or microgrids disconnect from the island’s grid during storms or blackouts and generate their own electricity for local needs. This allows these microgrids to serve their own customers, then reconnect to the larger grid later.

Microgrids are becoming proven and popular around the world from India (where record floods couldn’t stop solar power) to the University of California at San Diego, whose microgrid (powering 92 percent of the campus and saving $8 million a year) reversed flow and sent power back to the utility in less than a half-hour (until wildfires ate a power line).

Some traditional utilities oppose microgrids as a threat to their beleaguered monopoly. But giant electrical equipment firms like Siemens, Schneider and General Electric now offer microgrids, and nearly 2,000 projects were underway worldwide at the end of 2016.

Simple, sensible improvements like these can make our families, communities and nations more secure and durable, while saving money and creating important new value in the electricity, fuel and real-estate industries.

When storms, earthquakes, wildfires or cyberattacks take down our brittle power grid, we should all be able to start rebuilding our homes and lives immediately, with our smartphones and water pumps, filling stations and traffic lights, computers and refrigerators continuously powered by the world’s greatest uninterruptible power supply — the sun.",How to Keep the Lights On After a Hurricane,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/opinion/hurricane-puerto-rico-electricity.html

The winds — known as the Diablo winds in Northern California and Santa Ana winds in the south — are typical of the fall, arriving from the arid expanses of Nevada’s Great Basin.

On the heels of a record hot summer, California’s brush and trees are primed for ignition, said Daniel Swain, a U.C.L.A. climate scientist who also runs the California Weather Blog.

What’s more, he said, “The Santa Ana winds are going to coincide with record heat, which was not the case, for example, up in the Santa Rosa area. There it was just the magnitude of the winds that was really critical.”

The heat on Monday and Tuesday is expected to flirt with temperature records in places across the state.

That includes Dodger Stadium, where the Dodgers are hosting the Houston Astros for Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday. The forecast calls for a high of about 100 degrees.

If it holds up, said John Thorn, a baseball historian, it would be the hottest World Series game on record.

The Dodgers are in the World Series for the first since 1988, but some fans can’t help but feel a little bittersweet.

Vin Scully won’t be calling the games.

The announcer ended his storied career in the Dodgers broadcasting booth last fall after 67 seasons.

Still, that hasn’t stopped some fans from begging for one last encore. At least two online petitions have collected thousands of signatures asking Mr. Scully to return for the series between the Dodgers and Houston Astros, which begins Tuesday.

But don’t get your hopes up.

Mr. Scully, 89, shot down the idea in an email to the Los Angeles Daily News, saying in part, “I honestly don’t feel I belong there.”

Joe Davis, who took over for Mr. Scully, said fans and players would love nothing more than welcome the Hall of Fame broadcaster back.

“And Vin knows the door is wide open,” Mr. Davis said in a text message. “But it sounds like — and understandably so after 67 years put in — he’s perfectly content watching the games like the rest of us.”

“Delaying a decision on a successor creates another kind of uncertainty about what Mr. Xi will do in the future.
The Times reported last year that Mr. Xi might not put his potential successors into the committee at this party congress.
But Chen Min’er, an official widely seen as a potential heir to Mr. Xi, his boss when they were still both local officials, was not on the list.
There had been talk that Mr. Xi had considered keeping him on despite reaching an age, 69, when he is supposed to retire under current unwritten rules.","If Mr. Xi does not promote one or more possible heirs into the top tier, he will buck unspoken rules that emerged from the 1990s onward, when Deng Xiaoping tried to ensure a trouble-free train of succession, avoiding a repeat of the chaos during and immediately after the rule of the revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.

Since Deng’s death in 1997, two leadership transitions have followed a pattern that, while not friction-free, gave clarity well in advance about who would take over: Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao in 2002, and Mr. Hu to Mr. Xi in 2012. But since Mr. Xi came to power at a party congress that year, he has shown a distaste for following his predecessors in lock step.

Photo

Even if Mr. Xi does not seek to stay in office beyond 10 years, he may decide that anointing an heir too soon could dilute his own power, turning him into a lame duck. Mr. Xi spent his first five-year term cracking down on corruption in the party, a drive that he also used to impose discipline and establish himself as the strongest Chinese leader in decades.

“Establishing a successor early would create uncertainty for Xi about how long his power remains at a peak,” said Wu Qiang, a current affairs analyst who formerly taught political science at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “Delaying a decision on a successor creates another kind of uncertainty about what Mr. Xi will do in the future. I think he’s not going to make a decision yet.”

Some analysts, such as Mr. Wu, believe Mr. Xi may want to stay in power beyond his second term. Under the current succession practices, he must step down as president, China’s head of state, after two terms, but there is no formal limit on his other main leadership post as head of the Communist Party. Mr. Xi could also try to stay on as chairman of the Central Military Commission, another powerful post atop the nation’s armed forces, or in another newly developed position.

Of course, unexpected turns are still possible. The selection of China’s leaders takes place behind closed doors, making it unclear what the outcome will be until the moment the new lineup is announced. While the procedures are tightly controlled, there have been reversals before.

Even the number of members on the Standing Committee is not clear. The committee has typically had seven members, but even that could change.

Mr. Xi has used the party congress to cement his control over China and the party that rules it. Before the unveiling of the new Standing Committee, the approximately 2,300 delegates at the party congress are expected on Tuesday to approve changes to the Communist Party constitution that will add Mr. Xi’s name to the document, enhancing his halo of power.

The delegates will also approve a new Central Committee, whose 200 or so full members meet once or twice a year to discuss and vote on policy. The Central Committee will in turn meet after the end of the congress to vote in a new Politburo, including its Standing Committee.

The Standing Committee, which meets regularly to discuss policies and make decisions, is where real power resides in China.

Mr. Xi all but certain to stay on the committee, as is his No. 2, Premier Li Keqiang.

But three sources citing people close to party leaders have said a proposed lineup that was circulated before the Central Committee voted did not include the names of any likely heirs. Instead, most of the five candidates for membership were old enough that they may serve just one term.

Such one-term members would be politically beholden to Mr. Xi, giving him the choice to keep them or replace them as he sees fit, perhaps even before the next congress. This could give Mr. Xi the flexibility to appoint a successor toward the end of his second term, and put off diluting his power until he is about to step down.

The three people spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the secretive discussions. The Times reported last year that Mr. Xi might not put his potential successors into the committee at this party congress.

“Xi seems to be reshaping the rules of the game,” said Joseph Fewsmith, a Boston University professor who studies Chinese elite politics. “This lineup, if it is correct, seems to confirm this.”

The candidates included Li Zhanshu, a policy adviser closely allied with Mr. Xi; Han Zheng, the party secretary of Shanghai; Wang Yang, a vice premier who has handled trade issues; Wang Huning, an ideological adviser who also worked for two previous leaders; and Zhao Leji, the head of the party’s organization department, which screens officials for promotion and transfers.

But Chen Min’er, an official widely seen as a potential heir to Mr. Xi, his boss when they were still both local officials, was not on the list. Nor was Wang Qishan, the hard-charging head of the party’s anticorruption agency, one of Mr. Xi’s closest allies. There had been talk that Mr. Xi had considered keeping him on despite reaching an age, 69, when he is supposed to retire under current unwritten rules.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — The romantic in Ned White emerges today with a 76-word puzzle that plays around with a popular phrase.

Today’s Theme

I managed to solve the revealer, HEAD OVER HEELS, before I figured out the theme, which may or may not have helped me.

The theme itself places phrases used to designate people as the “head” of something (NUMERO UNO at 13A, for example) on top of phrases used to call someone a “heel” (SCOUNDREL at 17A), thus giving us HEAD OVER HEELS. I liked this idea, and Mr. White does it well, except I had trouble locating the central pair because they were staggered at 56A (BIG WHEEL) and 42A (DIRTY RAT).

Tricky Clues

8A: Yes, a five-letter entry for “One of the Obamas” could be either SASHA or MALIA. But check those crossings. They’re not all easy, but perhaps you knew that a SPORE was “One of billions in a puffball” at 8D.

I taught my first class at Columbia University’s M.F.A. program this month, and even though I’ve been teaching college writing since 1993, I initially felt a little intimidated by the school’s regal campus. That, and regretful.

I enjoyed going to college at the University of Michigan, an hour from home, but my secret humiliation is: I was the type of mediocre student I now disdain. As a freshman, I cared about my friends, my boyfriend and my poetry. Or, I cared about what my boyfriend thought of my friends, what my friends thought of him, and what they thought of my poetry about him. Here’s what I wish I’d known and done differently:

A’S ARE COOL AND COME WITH PERKS As a student, I saw myself as anti-establishment, and I hated tests; I barely maintained a B average. I thought only nerds spent weekends in the library studying. Recently I learned that my niece Dara, a sophomore at New York University with a 3.7 G.P.A. (and a boyfriend), was offered a week of travel in Buenos Aires as part of her honors seminar. I was retroactively envious to learn that a 3.5 G.P.A. or higher at many schools qualifies you for free trips, scholarships, grants, awards, private parties and top internships. At 20, I was too busy freaking out when said boyfriend disappeared (after sleeping with one of said friends). Students certainly don’t need to strive obsessively for perfection, but I should have prioritized grades, not guys.

SHOW UP AND SPEAK UP If a class was boring or it snowed, I’d skip. My rationale was that nobody in the 300-person lecture hall would notice and I could get notes later. Attendance barely counted. When I went, I’d sit quietly in back. Yet as a teacher, I see that the students who come weekly, sit in front, and ask and answer questions get higher grades and frankly, preferential treatment. After 15 weeks, I barely know the absentees or anyone Snapchatting the term away on their iPhones. It’s not just that these students flush $300 down the toilet every time they miss my class; participating can actually lead to payoffs. I reward those who try harder with recommendations, references, professional contacts and encouragement.

CLASS CONNECTIONS CAN LAUNCH YOUR CAREER As an undergrad, I rarely visited my professors during office hours. I didn’t want to annoy teachers with what I considered triviality. Besides, I thought I knew everything already. In graduate school, on the other hand, I went to the readings of a professor I admired. Eventually, I’d go to his office just to vent. Once, after I complained about a dead-end job, he recommended me for a position at The New Yorker, jump-starting my career.

The episode involving Mr. Price occurred in 2015 when he was in a car with Isa Dick Hackett, a Hollywood producer. She told investigators for Amazon shortly after the car ride that Mr. Price made unwanted sexual advances toward her.

Mr. Price’s career at Amazon continued until last week, when Ms. Hackett shared the details of the episode publicly for the first time, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. Amazon suspended him the day the article appeared, and he left the company on Tuesday.

Amazon’s recent actions took place in the middle of a firestorm over revelations in The New York Times and The New Yorker about another entertainment industry figure, Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of decades of sexual harassment and abuse. Ms. Hackett, for one, has said she was emboldened to go public with her story by the willingness of Mr. Weinstein’s accusers to speak up.

But there is confusion among some Amazon employees about why Mr. Price did not lose his job in 2015 after the company learned of Ms. Hackett’s accusations. One consequence Mr. Price faced after the episode was being told to be careful how much alcohol he drank at work functions, according to a third employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality policies. The employee was briefed on the decision.

Some of the frustration inside the company has been directed at Jeff Blackburn, the Amazon senior vice president who directly managed Mr. Price. Mr. Blackburn sent the email to Amazon’s film and television employees on Friday, and it was more broadly distributed by other executives to their groups.

In his email, Mr. Blackburn said Amazon was “taking this situation, and the general issue of sexual harassment, very seriously.” He said it was not appropriate to share personnel details publicly, but said that Mr. Price’s departure “followed new information that surfaced last week, as well as other factors.”

His email did not describe the new information. On the same day Mr. Price was suspended, an actress, Rose McGowan, posted a series of messages on Twitter saying she had previously told the head of Amazon Studios, the company’s movie and television group, that Mr. Weinstein had raped her. Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman has said he denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex.

Charles Harder, a lawyer for Mr. Price, did not respond to messages requesting comment.

The pinnacle of Amazon is an elite group known as the S-team, roughly 16 senior executives, fewer than a dozen of whom report directly to Jeff Bezos, the company’s chief executive. Just one member of the S-team is a woman, Beth Galetti, Amazon’s senior vice president for human resources, according to two of the three employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

At Microsoft, in contrast, three of the 15 people who report to the company’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, are women. At Apple, women will represent six of the 18 people who report to Tim Cook, the company’s chief, as of later this month, when the company’s new general counsel starts.

Like other technology companies, Amazon has described improving the diversity of its work force as an important company goal. In a report on company diversity, Amazon says 61 percent of its work force and 75 percent of its managers are men. Those figures, though, include the huge numbers of workers in Amazon’s warehouses, where women are better represented than at other parts of the company.

In August, at a staff meeting for Amazon employees held at a basketball arena, Mr. Bezos was asked about the dearth of diversity — implying gender and race — on his senior leadership team. Amazon employees applauded loudly at the question.

Mr. Bezos replied that diversity was important at Amazon, according to two of the employees who would speak only on the condition of anonymity. But Mr. Bezos said that adding more diversity to the leadership team would happen slowly because of low turnover in its ranks — an answer that left many employees disappointed.

One of the Amazon employees, who recently looked at an organizational chart, said Amazon’s S-team members and the people who report directly to them amount to roughly 90 people, about 75 of whom are men.

Amazon has taken some steps in recent years to make working at the company more appealing to women. Two years ago, it instituted a more generous maternity leave policy, providing birth mothers with up to 20 weeks of paid leave.

But the company’s office culture still has a hard-charging reputation that could make it harder to recruit more women. Textio, a Seattle start-up that uses software to analyze language, has examined public job postings for all the major internet companies. The company found that the language in Amazon’s skewed most sharply to the masculine end of the spectrum, with frequent use of words like “wickedly,” “insane” and “maniacal.”

Kieran Snyder, the co-founder and chief executive of Textio, worked at Amazon for about six months. “I would say Amazon has a reputation in the industry for being a very aggressive culture,” she said.","Inside Amazon, Diversity Concerns Flare Up After Harassment Accusations",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/technology/amazon-sexual-harassment.html

Photo“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said.
“These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty.","Silent clues to a violent past are buried among the scores of mass graves that dot Chungui district in the mountainous Ayacucho region of Peru. There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

Photo

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

Photo

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

We want to be in control, or at least to give control to trained professionals, like doctors. We don’t want computers to be in charge.

Researchers at Penn and the University of Chicago have conducted some clever experiments that capture this phenomenon. They asked participants to complete tasks (like predicting which business-school applicants would go on to successful careers) and compare their performance with a computer algorithm’s. After the computer made a mistake, people were reluctant to use it again. After the people made mistakes, their self-confidence didn’t budge.

They rationalized their own imperfections, while obsessing over the computer’s shortcomings. It didn’t matter that the human beings made more mistakes — a lot more — than the computer.

So it is with driving. Human driving is a public-health scourge. More than 37,000 Americans died in crashes last year, most from human error. In my community, the heartbreaking toll included a mother, father and their teenage son, killed when a speeding car slammed into their car on one of those busy suburban roads. Their teenage daughter survived.

The death count from cars exceeds that from guns. So if you are outraged by guns and want things to change, you should feel the same about car crashes.

Technology creates an opportunity to save lives. Computers don’t get drowsy, drunk or distracted by text messages, and they don’t have blind spots. Just look at commercial airlines: Automation has helped all but eliminate fatal crashes among American air carriers. The last one happened in 2009.

The technology for semi-driverless cars still isn’t good enough or cheap enough. The $50,000 Volvo I was driving — like a Tesla I’ve tried — got confused by unpainted lane lines, for instance, and I had to take over. But the technology is improving rapidly. Within a few years, many cars will have sophisticated crash-avoidance systems.

I expect that we will agonize about using them, out of both legitimate caution and irrational fear. Any driverless crashes will be sensationalized, as has already happened, while we ignore tens of thousands of deaths from human crashes. But I still expect that driving will be revolutionized sooner than many people now understand.

Those researchers at Penn and Chicago also studied the circumstances in which people get comfortable with computer control, and found a theme: When the choice isn’t all or nothing — when people have “even a slight amount” of control — they are more open to automation.

That’s where driving is headed. The shift will be gradual, not sudden, as Google’s chief economist, Hal Varian, told me. Cars will handle many tasks, while a human driver will have override power. The combination won’t be perfect, but it can be much better than the status quo.

My own experience also leads me to think that attitudes may change quickly. One of the more powerful forces in human psychology is known as the familiarity principle. After people have experience with something, they usually feel more positively about it.

I began my short time with the Volvo too nervous to use some features. By the end, I was confident that the car made me safer.

In June 2017, an appeals court ruled against the D.E.A., and the agency released the video.
(The inspectors general report said a D.E.A.
struggled to produce evidence that someone on the passenger boat had been armed.
The inspectors general found that the other two cases were also followed by inaccurate reports from the field.","The controversy over the actions of the agents has had an impact: As the D.E.A. braced for the May release of the inspectors general report on the episode, the agency disbanded the program that had run the interdiction operation, named the Foreign-deployed Advisory Support Teams, or FAST. The FAST program provided military-style training to law enforcement officers in other countries to counter drug traffickers.

The inspectors general report, which found no evidence to support the D.E.A.’s account that its agents were fired upon, has also drawn attention from lawmakers. A bipartisan group of four senators asserted that the D.E.A. and State Department “repeatedly and knowingly misled members of Congress and congressional staff.”

“The D.E.A. convinced themselves of a false version of events due to arrogance, false assumptions, and ignorance,” said Tim Rieser, an aide to Sen. Patrick Leahy and one of the staff members who has spent years delving into the shooting. “They rushed to judgment and then stuck to their story.”

Mary Brandenberger, a D.E.A. spokeswoman, declined to comment on whether the agency still believed that an exchange of gunfire had taken place, because the episode was still under internal review. The agency has never retracted its view that the agents were fired upon and acted in self-defense.

For a crucial piece of evidence that it asserted would exonerate its personnel, the D.E.A. kept the video under tight control. The first time it was shown outside the agency was in May 2012, shortly after the shooting, when it was screened in a secure conference room for a group of congressional staffers.

The D.E.A. and State Department briefers controlled all the information, said Peter Quilter, a former staff member for the House Foreign Affairs Committee who attended some of initial briefings. “It was very difficult to second-guess them.” He added: “They very simply misled the Congress. The video did not back up their story of what happened.”

In at least eight briefings over six months, and in multiple letters in response to senators and representatives, the D.E.A. maintained that the shooting was justified.

In June 2012, United States officials allowed a New York Times reporter to briefly view portions of the video, probably those shown to Congress. The officials pointed to blips in the grainy night-vision video, which they said were indications that the occupants of the passenger boat had fired on the team on the canoe. The Times described these flashes as less clearly visible than the ferocious series of shots from the canoe carrying the agents. The still-secret video was not definitive in supporting the D.E.A.’s version of events, The Times reported, saying that the video “answers some questions while raising new ones” about the operation.

The video was released to the public through the Freedom of Information Act, with the law firm Jenner & Block taking on the case pro bono. A federal judge ordered the release of the video in January 2016, and the agency appealed. In June 2017, an appeals court ruled against the D.E.A., and the agency released the video.

The video opens on the outskirts of Ahuas, around 1 a.m. on May 11, 2012. A propeller plane touches down in a field and rolls to a stop. People gather around it and then carry dozens of blocky parcels to a nearby pickup truck. The parcels turned out to be more than 400 kilos of cocaine.

The cocaine is what brought the D.E.A. to Ahuas, as part of a program called Operation Anvil. The D.E.A. was working alongside the Honduran police and military to intercept drug shipments as they headed north.

In the video, the cocaine-filled pickup truck can be seen driving through the village to a landing on the twisting Patuca River. There the traffickers offload the drugs into a motorized canoe.

Four government helicopters appear and chaos erupts. The traffickers quickly abandon their task. One of them pushes the drug-laden canoe into the middle of the river and flees into the jungle with the others. Three members of the antidrug team — two Honduran police and one D.E.A. agent — ignore the men and pursue the canoe downstream.

The three men manage to climb on board. The D.E.A. agent, sitting in the back, begins to pilot it back toward the landing. But the motor stalls and the canoe starts to drift downstream. The D.E.A. agent can be seen vainly jerking the starter rope to try to restart the engine.

As he does this a second boat appears in the frame. It seems to be maneuvering directly toward the drifting canoe carrying the drugs. This second boat would turn out to be a water taxi, carrying a dozen passengers and cargo upriver to Ahuas.

The passengers and pilot on the civilian boat would later say they were terrified by the helicopters and did not intend to steer toward the canoe containing the law enforcement agents. For their part, the drug agents assumed the second boat was trying to recover the drugs.

It remains unclear why the civilian craft steered directly into the boat with the agents, but the boats collided.

The video clearly shows gunfire from the antidrug agents. As passengers leap into the water, the antidrug team continues to fire at them. An eight-second burst of machine gun fire comes from one of the helicopters. (The inspectors general report said a D.E.A. agent ordered a Honduran door gunner to fire.)

The footage cuts away for a moment, and the edges of the video are blocked by D.E.A. redactions, obscuring the surveillance plane’s altitude and other technical intelligence-gathering data the agency deemed sensitive.

While it is impossible to determine what is happening off camera, or underneath the blurred areas, any gunfire originating from the passenger boat — the evidence at the heart of the case that D.E.A. officials made to Congress — is strikingly difficult to discern.

In the end, four passengers were killed and three were injured.

In the months after the shooting, the D.E.A. struggled to produce evidence that someone on the passenger boat had been armed. No bullets had struck the helicopters, the agents or their canoe.

The Ahuas killings were among three fatal shooting cases that took place during Operation Anvil. The inspectors general found that the other two cases were also followed by inaccurate reports from the field. In one, they concluded, a Honduran police officer planted a gun on the dead body of an unarmed drug trafficker.

Carson Ulrich, who served as deputy for the FAST team missions at the time of the Ahuas shooting, stands by the D.E.A.’s assertions that the passenger boat was searching for the drugs and had fired on the antidrug team.

Mr. Ulrich argued that the now-disbanded FAST program was “desperately” needed to “bring the rule of law to an area governed by the cartels.” The government inspectors general investigators were biased, Mr. Ulrich contended. “They are slandering heroes. I dare anyone to pick up a rifle and do what these American agents did.”

To an extent, my job is to know something about “Star Trek,” but simultaneously make myself forget it.
Some franchise fans have criticized the new series for breaking with the optimistic tone of past series.
The creators of a work like “Star Trek: Discovery” have to keep multiple audiences in mind.","This is great. But it’s not really my gig. As the chief television critic for a general-interest newspaper, as I’ve been for just over two years, my job is to be a grazer, a sampler, a dabbler. I don’t believe that there’s a hierarchy of fandom — that fans who have logged more eyeball-hours supporting a franchise are more authentic than other fans, and thus have greater ownership of the story.

So I write for the center of the “Star Trek” bell curve: the fan who may have seen a lot of the previous programs, or a little, or none at all, but who’s interested in “Discovery.” (This, by the way, is probably fine for the “Trek” superfan, who in today’s vast media cosmos can find plenty of more-targeted reviews from the standpoint of completists.)

Of course, “Star Trek” isn’t just any story. It’s part of our national mythology, a continuing megastory whose characters come to represent our abstract ideals. It would be malpractice for a TV critic not to know anything about “Star Trek.” I’d watched each of the series, more (“Deep Space Nine”) or less (sorry, “Enterprise”).

This kind of question — how much does the source material matter? — comes up more often as pop culture has become dominated by adaptations (“Game of Thrones”), revivals (“The X-Files”), reboots (“Dynasty”), sequels (“Fuller House”), prequels (“Young Sheldon”) and remakes of adaptations (“The Tick”).

It’s as if we were trapped in a time loop reliving the past … not unlike the “Star Trek: The Next Generation” crew in the episode “Cause and Effect.”

My philosophy is that any work needs to stand on its own: If I need to have read the source book to really “get” a TV series, then it’s not a good series. It’s not an iron rule, of course. Good luck understanding “Twin Peaks: The Return” if you didn’t see the original. (Then again, good luck even if you did see the original.)

Likewise, part of what I need to ask about a show like “Discovery” is: If it weren’t associated with this brand, would I want to watch any more of it? To an extent, my job is to know something about “Star Trek,” but simultaneously make myself forget it.

I address some of these meta-questions in my review of “Discovery,” which I wrote after watching six episodes. Some franchise fans have criticized the new series for breaking with the optimistic tone of past series. I don’t have that problem, although I had other issues. Franchises stay vital by remaking themselves for their times, not by pledging allegiance to the past. Just as Batman could be a camp icon in the 1960s and a brooding antihero in the 21st century, so can “Trek” complicate itself for the era of complex TV.

Of course, it’s not just critics who have to think about this. The creators of a work like “Star Trek: Discovery” have to keep multiple audiences in mind. After all, CBS was probably counting on the passionate “Trek” fan base to drive subscriptions to its All Access streaming service.

But a franchise also needs new fans to grow. If you become too beholden to callbacks and timelines, you risk becoming less a storyteller and more of a custodian.

Ms. Soleimani and Mr.","Larger hotel chains, like Marriott or the Four Seasons Resorts, will typically refund any deposits in a disaster, but smaller businesses may not have funds to recoup. “If you book at a smaller hotel or bed-and-breakfast and they’re wiped out, whatever deposit you wired them is going to be very difficult to get back,” Ms. Gregoli said.

Insure Yourself

Weddings today can be as expensive as a car, sometimes even more, so protect your investment. Purchase wedding insurance. It isn’t very expensive, Ms. Gregoli said, but it may protect against any unexpected events. It starts at about $150 for a basic policy, but rates go up based on such things as location, the number of guests and whether the event is inside or outside in a tent. The total cost of the wedding will also affect the rate: A $10,000 even is going to carry a lower premium than one costing $150,000.

Insurance can offer peace of mind. For example, if the space you booked for your wedding is destroyed by a hurricane or fire, a good insurance policy will cover the costs of rescheduling and reimburse you for any lost deposits. (It will even cover things like losing the rings before the wedding or if a bride’s gown is lost in baggage.)

Find Out Who’s in Charge

If there is an extreme event — an act of terrorism, say, something weather-related, or a fire — don’t rely on hotel wedding planners. Often, the general manager will have clearer answers, Ms. Gregoli said.

One month after Hurricane Maria passed over Anguilla, Ms. Gregoli and one of her couples had a conference call with the general manager at a resort on the island. They needed to know specifics about the damage: Is it landscaping and trees that were hardest hit — or is there structural damage? Would the ferry dock be rebuilt in time to accept guests? Lucky for this particular bride and groom, the general manager confirmed all repairs would be finished for their June 2018 nuptials. But another one of Ms. Gregoli’s clients, whose wedding was booked in December at the Ritz Carlton in St. Thomas, in the United States Virgin Islands, wasn’t as fortuitous. That couple had to reschedule for the following year.

Read contracts carefully. In an extreme event, what is the wedding site’s obligation to keep you informed?

Sonia Byck-Barwick of Paradise Ridge Vineyards, which was devastated in the early days of the wildfires in Santa Rosa, Calif., asserted that refunding any and all deposits the winery had collected for upcoming weddings was a top priority. Weddings were a major part of the boutique winery’s business; it had 24 already booked for 2018, plus 8 to 10 in the remainder of 2017 (including one on Oct. 14).

Backup Plan

Have an alternate plan. If you can’t make it to your destination is there somewhere you can marry locally?

Roya Soleimani and Andrew Charles Winner, who live in San Francisco, had planned their wedding for Oct. 15 at Chardonnay Golf Club in Napa County. They hoped to stick to their original plans until the preceding Thursday, when Mr. Winner’s brother, a firefighter in San Rafael, Calif., engaged in fighting the blaze, told them it was time to call it.

“I was researching the best respiratory masks to buy for our guests and vendors,” said Ms. Soleimani, 32, a corporate communications manager at Google.org. “We were starting to realize that the idea of celebrating in Napa, when all of this was going on, just didn’t feel right.” (The couple is quick to point out that their original venue and vendors offered full refunds, nearly across the board.)

Ms. Soleimani and Mr. Winner, 38, a consultant for First Republic Bank and an appraisals specialist, put out the call that they were searching for a new venue for their 230 guests. Soon, they were put in touch with the Julia Morgan Ballroom in San Francisco, and were gratified by the venue’s immediate willingness to help — and at a discount, no less.

“We’re making major cuts to our normal rates,” said Phil Spiegel, the executive vice president of Merchants Exchange Productions, which runs the ballroom. “This is our way of helping.” The ballroom hosted two displaced weddings last weekend and is currently taking inquiries from wine country couples for the weeks and months ahead.",5 Ways to Protect Yourself Against Unexpected Wedding Catastrophe,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/fashion/weddings/5-ways-to-protect-yourself-against-unexpected-wedding-catastrophe.html

But when researchers put an Elmo sticker on the apple, more than a third chose it. That’s a significant result, and from a cheap, easily replicated intervention.

While the intervention seems simple, any study like this is anything but. For many reasons, doing research in nutrition is very, very hard.

First, the researchers have to fund their work, which can take years. Then the work has to be vetted and approved by an Institutional Review Board, which safeguards subjects from potential harm. I.R.B.s are especially vigilant when studies involve children, a vulnerable group. Even if the research is of minimal risk, this process can take months.

Then there’s getting permission from schools to do the work. As you can imagine, many are resistant to allowing research on their premises. Often, protocols and rules require getting permission from parents to allow their children to be part of studies. If parents (understandably) refuse, figuring out how to do the work without involving some children can be tricky.

Finally, many methodological decisions come into play. Let’s imagine that we want to do a simple test of cookies versus apples, plus or minus stickers — as this study did. It’s possible that children eat different things on different days, so we need to make sure that we test them on multiple days of the week. It’s possible that they might change their behavior once, but then go back to their old ways, so we need to test responses over time.

It’s possible that handing out the cookie or apple personally might change behavior more than just leaving the choices out for display. If that’s the case, we need to stay hidden and observe unobtrusively. This matters because in the real world it’s probably not feasible to have someone handing out these foods in schools, and we need the methods to mirror what will most likely happen later. It’s also possible that the choices might differ based on whether children can take both the apple and the cookie (in which case they could get the sticker and the treat) or whether they had to choose one.

I point out all these things to reinforce that this type of research isn’t as simple as many might initially think. Without addressing these questions, and more, the work may be flawed or not easily generalized.

These difficulties are some of the reasons so much research on food and nutrition is done with animals, like mice. We don’t need to worry as much about I.R.B.s or getting a school on board. We don’t have to worry about mice noticing who’s recording data. And we can control what they’re offered to eat, every meal of every day. But the same things that make animal studies so much easier to perform also make them much less meaningful. Human eating and nutrition are typically more complex than anything a mouse would encounter.

Overcoming these problems and proving spectacular results in preteens are some of the reasons this study on cookies and apples, and others like it, are so compelling. The authors have transformed this work into popular appearances, books and publicity for the Food and Brand Lab.

But cracks began to appear in Mr. Wansink’s and the Food and Brand Lab’s work not long ago, when other researchers noted discrepancies in some of his studies. The numbers didn’t add up; odd things appeared in the data, including the study on apples and cookies. The issues were significant enough that JAMA Pediatrics retracted the original article, and the researchers posted a replacement.

The problems didn’t end there. As Stephanie Lee at BuzzFeed recently reported, it appears that the study wasn’t conducted on 8-to-11-year-olds as published. It was done on 3-to-5-year-olds.

Just as mice can’t be easily extrapolated to humans, research done on 3-to-5-year-olds doesn’t necessarily generalize to 8-to-11-year-olds. Putting an Elmo sticker on an apple for a small child might matter, but that doesn’t mean it will for a fifth grader. On Friday, the study was fully retracted.

Making things worse, this may have happened in other publications. Ms. Lee has also reported on a study published in Preventive Medicine in 2012 that claimed that children are more likely to eat vegetables if you give them a “cool” name, like “X-ray Vision Carrots.” That study, too, may be retracted or corrected, along with a host of others.

As a researcher, and one who works with children, I find it hard to understand how you could do a study of 3-to-5-year-olds, analyze the data, write it up and then somehow forget and imagine it happened with 8-to-11-year-olds. The grant application would have required detail on the study subjects, as well as justification for the age ranges. The I.R.B. would require researchers to be specific about the ages of the children studied.

I reached out to the authors of the study to ask how this could have happened, and Mr. Wansink replied: “The explanation for mislabeling of the age groups in the study is both simple and embarrassing. I was not present for the 2008 data collection, and when I later wrote the paper I wrongly inferred that these children must have been the typical age range of elementary students we usually study. Instead, I discovered that while the data was indeed collected in elementary schools, it was actually collected at Head Start day cares that happened to meet in those elementary schools.”

This is a level of disconnect that many scientists would find inconceivable, and I do not mean to suggest that this is the norm for nutrition research. It does, however, illustrate how an inattention to detail can derail what might be promising work. The difficulties of research in this area are already significant. Distrust makes things worse. The social sciences are already suffering from a replication problem; when work that makes a big splash fails to hold up, it hurts science in general.

We want to believe there are easy fixes to the obesity epidemic and nutrition in general. We want to believe there are simple actions we can take, like putting labels on menus, or stickers on food, or jazzing up the names of vegetables. Sadly, all of that may not work, regardless of what advocates say.

Since Deng’s death in 1997, two leadership transitions have followed a pattern that, while not friction-free, gave clarity well in advance about who would take over: Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao in 2002, and Mr. Hu to Mr. Xi in 2012. But since Mr. Xi came to power at a party congress that year, he has shown a distaste for following his predecessors in lock step.

Even if Mr. Xi does not seek to stay in office beyond 10 years, he may decide that anointing an heir too soon could dilute his own power, turning him into a lame duck. Mr. Xi spent his first five-year term cracking down on corruption in the party, a drive that he also used to impose discipline and establish himself as the strongest Chinese leader in decades.

“Establishing a successor early would create uncertainty for Xi about how long his power remains at a peak,” said Wu Qiang, a current affairs analyst who formerly taught political science at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “Delaying a decision on a successor creates another kind of uncertainty about what Mr. Xi will do in the future. I think he’s not going to make a decision yet.”

Some analysts, such as Mr. Wu, believe Mr. Xi may want to stay in power beyond his second term. Under the current succession practices, he must step down as president, China’s head of state, after two terms, but there is no formal limit on his other main leadership post as head of the Communist Party. Mr. Xi could also try to stay on as chairman of the Central Military Commission, another powerful post atop the nation’s armed forces, or in another newly developed position.

Of course, unexpected turns are still possible. The selection of China’s leaders takes place behind closed doors, making it unclear what the outcome will be until the moment the new lineup is announced. While the procedures are tightly controlled, there have been reversals before.

Even the number of members on the Standing Committee is not clear. The committee has typically had seven members, but even that could change.

Mr. Xi has used the party congress to cement his control over China and the party that rules it. Before the unveiling of the new Standing Committee, the approximately 2,300 delegates at the party congress are expected on Tuesday to approve changes to the Communist Party constitution that will add Mr. Xi’s name to the document, enhancing his halo of power.

The delegates will also approve a new Central Committee, whose 200 or so full members meet once or twice a year to discuss and vote on policy. The Central Committee will in turn meet after the end of the congress to vote in a new Politburo, including its Standing Committee.

The Standing Committee, which meets regularly to discuss policies and make decisions, is where real power resides in China.

Mr. Xi all but certain to stay on the committee, as is his No. 2, Premier Li Keqiang.

But three sources citing people close to party leaders have said a proposed lineup that was circulated before the Central Committee voted did not include the names of any likely heirs. Instead, most of the five candidates for membership were old enough that they may serve just one term.

Such one-term members would be politically beholden to Mr. Xi, giving him the choice to keep them or replace them as he sees fit, perhaps even before the next congress. This could give Mr. Xi the flexibility to appoint a successor toward the end of his second term, and put off diluting his power until he is about to step down.

The three people spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the secretive discussions. The Times reported last year that Mr. Xi might not put his potential successors into the committee at this party congress.

“Xi seems to be reshaping the rules of the game,” said Joseph Fewsmith, a Boston University professor who studies Chinese elite politics. “This lineup, if it is correct, seems to confirm this.”

The candidates included Li Zhanshu, a policy adviser closely allied with Mr. Xi; Han Zheng, the party secretary of Shanghai; Wang Yang, a vice premier who has handled trade issues; Wang Huning, an ideological adviser who also worked for two previous leaders; and Zhao Leji, the head of the party’s organization department, which screens officials for promotion and transfers.

But Chen Min’er, an official widely seen as a potential heir to Mr. Xi, his boss when they were still both local officials, was not on the list. Nor was Wang Qishan, the hard-charging head of the party’s anticorruption agency, one of Mr. Xi’s closest allies. There had been talk that Mr. Xi had considered keeping him on despite reaching an age, 69, when he is supposed to retire under current unwritten rules.

A Virus That Lurks in the Eye

Like the patients he is now trying to help, Dr. Crozier was blinded in one eye by uveitis and recovered — but then lost his sight a second time, to a cataract. He had surgery in March.

His eye disease, described on May 7, 2015, in The New England Journal of Medicine, put the world on alert. Nearly two months after he had seemingly recovered from Ebola, and after his blood was free of it, severe uveitis suddenly developed — and Dr. Yeh was stunned to find that the fluid inside Dr. Crozier’s eye was teeming with active virus. At that time, uveitis was also emerging in West Africa.

Even though the virus may still lurk inside the eye in survivors with uveitis, it is not on the surface or in tears, so patients cannot spread Ebola through casual contact. But operating on them might pose a risk to surgeons who open the eye.

Eventually, the immune system seems to eliminate the virus, but no one knows how long that takes. Eighteen months after the virus was first found inside Dr. Crozier’s eye, a repeat test was negative. But when the virus level actually dropped is not known.

“After Ian became ill and had complications, he became a pioneer, a rallying point,” Dr. Oneill said. “Ian’s story was the turning point for survivors.”

Cuomo, who controls the transit agency.","The new system will replace the MetroCard, but MetroCards will not be phased out until 2023 — 30 years after they replaced tokens for subways and buses. Until 2023, passengers can pay their fares the new way or the old way, with a MetroCard. The new system will also process fares for the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North commuter lines.

The most obvious difference will be what passengers do to go through a subway turnstile or board a bus: wave or tap a smartphone or a credit or debit card, instead of swipe a MetroCard.

The system will work through apps like Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay as well as “contactless cards” — credit or debit cards with embedded chips that rely on a wireless technology known as near field communication, or N.F.C.

“The millennial generation, those who are more prone to new technology, will be our greatest users in the early stages,” Mr. Lhota said. He added that card issuers “are going to want to be a part of it” and would add the near-field technology “when they realize that 5.8 to 6 million people in New York City are getting on the subway every day.”

Mr. Lhota said another potential advantage was that fare readers could be installed by the back doors on buses to “allow for all-door boarding.” That would let buses pull away from bus stops sooner than they do now, reducing travel times.

The transit agency is hiring the same company that designed the system in London, which is also the company that developed MetroCards a generation ago. But the new system will let passengers pay as they go, in contrast to the MetroCard system, which requires them to pay in advance, whether they want a single ride or a month’s worth.

The new system will not mean the end of the flat fare that has defined the New York subway system since it opened in 1904. Fares on the London Underground are based on distance, as they are in some other cities that use similar technology, like Washington. But Mr. Lhota said he was not contemplating changing the fare structure for the subways. (The Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North do charge by distance, using zones that usually include several stations.)

Thomas K. Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association, an influential nonprofit group, praised the move to the new system, predicting that ridership would increase once the new fare system was widely available, just as it did after the MetroCard was introduced.

He called the new fare system “a real win-win and an important step for the M.T.A. to be taking.”

The transit agency has been talking for years about replacing the MetroCard, which made its debut when Bill Clinton was president (and the basic fare was $1.25, $1.50 less than it is now and $1.75 less than with a single-ride MetroCard).

The transit agency ran a pilot program for a successor to the MetroCard in 2006. Officials hoped to do away with MetroCards by 2012 and believed that contactless bank cards would be the way to the future. But while such cards were popular in Europe, they did not immediately catch on in this country.

Mr. Lhota said there had been “a firm commitment on high, first from Tom Prendergast” — his predecessor, Thomas F. Prendergast — “and now myself, to get this done.”

“It just takes focus from on high to see it get done,” he said, “and it’s going to get done.”

If the transit authority’s finance committee approves the contract for the new fare system on Monday, the plan will go to the agency’s board for a vote on Wednesday.

The transit authority sought bids for the new system and chose Cubic Transportation Systems, the company behind the MetroCard, from among five proposals.

Cubic signed a licensing deal in 2016 with Transport for London, the transit agency for greater London, that allowed Cubic to take the technology developed for London to other cities.

But calls about New York’s new fare payment system, once it is installed, will be answered nearly 400 miles away, in Buffalo. Cubic plans to open a call center there, putting jobs in an area that is struggling economically but is important politically to state officials like Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the transit agency.",New York to Replace MetroCard With Modern Way to Pay Transit Fares,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/nyregion/metrocard-subway-new-york.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

But when researchers put an Elmo sticker on the apple, more than a third chose it. That’s a significant result, and from a cheap, easily replicated intervention.

While the intervention seems simple, any study like this is anything but. For many reasons, doing research in nutrition is very, very hard.

First, the researchers have to fund their work, which can take years. Then the work has to be vetted and approved by an Institutional Review Board, which safeguards subjects from potential harm. I.R.B.s are especially vigilant when studies involve children, a vulnerable group. Even if the research is of minimal risk, this process can take months.

Then there’s getting permission from schools to do the work. As you can imagine, many are resistant to allowing research on their premises. Often, protocols and rules require getting permission from parents to allow their children to be part of studies. If parents (understandably) refuse, figuring out how to do the work without involving some children can be tricky.

Finally, many methodological decisions come into play. Let’s imagine that we want to do a simple test of cookies versus apples, plus or minus stickers — as this study did. It’s possible that children eat different things on different days, so we need to make sure that we test them on multiple days of the week. It’s possible that they might change their behavior once, but then go back to their old ways, so we need to test responses over time.

It’s possible that handing out the cookie or apple personally might change behavior more than just leaving the choices out for display. If that’s the case, we need to stay hidden and observe unobtrusively. This matters because in the real world it’s probably not feasible to have someone handing out these foods in schools, and we need the methods to mirror what will most likely happen later. It’s also possible that the choices might differ based on whether children can take both the apple and the cookie (in which case they could get the sticker and the treat) or whether they had to choose one.

I point out all these things to reinforce that this type of research isn’t as simple as many might initially think. Without addressing these questions, and more, the work may be flawed or not easily generalized.

These difficulties are some of the reasons so much research on food and nutrition is done with animals, like mice. We don’t need to worry as much about I.R.B.s or getting a school on board. We don’t have to worry about mice noticing who’s recording data. And we can control what they’re offered to eat, every meal of every day. But the same things that make animal studies so much easier to perform also make them much less meaningful. Human eating and nutrition are typically more complex than anything a mouse would encounter.

Overcoming these problems and proving spectacular results in preteens are some of the reasons this study on cookies and apples, and others like it, are so compelling. The authors have transformed this work into popular appearances, books and publicity for the Food and Brand Lab.

But cracks began to appear in Mr. Wansink’s and the Food and Brand Lab’s work not long ago, when other researchers noted discrepancies in some of his studies. The numbers didn’t add up; odd things appeared in the data, including the study on apples and cookies. The issues were significant enough that JAMA Pediatrics retracted the original article, and the researchers posted a replacement.

The problems didn’t end there. As Stephanie Lee at BuzzFeed recently reported, it appears that the study wasn’t conducted on 8-to-11-year-olds as published. It was done on 3-to-5-year-olds.

Just as mice can’t be easily extrapolated to humans, research done on 3-to-5-year-olds doesn’t necessarily generalize to 8-to-11-year-olds. Putting an Elmo sticker on an apple for a small child might matter, but that doesn’t mean it will for a fifth grader. On Friday, the study was fully retracted.

Making things worse, this may have happened in other publications. Ms. Lee has also reported on a study published in Preventive Medicine in 2012 that claimed that children are more likely to eat vegetables if you give them a “cool” name, like “X-ray Vision Carrots.” That study, too, may be retracted or corrected, along with a host of others.

As a researcher, and one who works with children, I find it hard to understand how you could do a study of 3-to-5-year-olds, analyze the data, write it up and then somehow forget and imagine it happened with 8-to-11-year-olds. The grant application would have required detail on the study subjects, as well as justification for the age ranges. The I.R.B. would require researchers to be specific about the ages of the children studied.

I reached out to the authors of the study to ask how this could have happened, and Mr. Wansink replied: “The explanation for mislabeling of the age groups in the study is both simple and embarrassing. I was not present for the 2008 data collection, and when I later wrote the paper I wrongly inferred that these children must have been the typical age range of elementary students we usually study. Instead, I discovered that while the data was indeed collected in elementary schools, it was actually collected at Head Start day cares that happened to meet in those elementary schools.”

This is a level of disconnect that many scientists would find inconceivable, and I do not mean to suggest that this is the norm for nutrition research. It does, however, illustrate how an inattention to detail can derail what might be promising work. The difficulties of research in this area are already significant. Distrust makes things worse. The social sciences are already suffering from a replication problem; when work that makes a big splash fails to hold up, it hurts science in general.

We want to believe there are easy fixes to the obesity epidemic and nutrition in general. We want to believe there are simple actions we can take, like putting labels on menus, or stickers on food, or jazzing up the names of vegetables. Sadly, all of that may not work, regardless of what advocates say.

The Athletic, he said, promised not to start a Pittsburgh site.

According to skeptical media executives and investors interviewed for this article, something similar is likely the best-case scenario for The Athletic.","These reporters are skilled experts feeling the strains of a crippled industry, and many are looking for a way out. Mather knows it.

Mather, 37, founded The Athletic with Adam Hansmann, 29. They worked together at Strava, an app and website for weekend warriors and elite competitors that calls itself the social network for athletes.

That experience, along with their frustration at the difficulty of finding high-quality sportswriting that wasn’t bogged down by pop-up ads, informed their big bet. They believe there are hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions, of enthusiastic sports fans willing to pay $60 annually — less with frequently offered discounts — for good reporting and writing, a clean app and no ads.

They have raised almost $8 million in venture capital funding and have recurring subscription revenue, ensuring the site won’t shutter soon. But the question everybody in sports media is asking is what happens in three, five, seven years? Will The Athletic’s business model allow it to survive that long?

Newspapers are a classic example of a bundle. Subscribers might read just one section, but their subscription gets them the entire paper. Mather and Hansmann believe that sports is an undervalued part of that bundle, and that there are tens of thousands of sports fans in each city who don’t care about the other sections, and would rather jettison their subscription and pay for The Athletic instead.

“I think the sports page has carried local papers for a while, and they don’t treat it well,” Mather said.

After waiting nine months to debut their second local site, Toronto, and another five months for their third, Cleveland, the company planned to grow the number of local sites slowly, before tackling national ones. But that timeline was drastically altered after layoffs at ESPN, Sports Illustrated, Yahoo Sports, Fox Sports, Bleacher Report, Vice Sports and Vocativ this spring and summer put dozens of talented, well-connected journalists on the market.

“I’d say it’s probably the largest talent displacement in sports media ever,” Hansmann said.

The Athletic raised $5.6 million in venture capital financing in July to take advantage of the moment, adding to the $2.3 million seed round it raised in January.

“It was really hard to see everything that was happening in terms of the layoffs,” said Deepen Parikh, an executive at Courtside Ventures, one of The Athletic’s largest investors, “and knowing we really, genuinely had an opportunity to capitalize on it and not take it.”

The Athletic did not need to raise any financing, its executives said. Only one of the local sites, Toronto, breaks even — Chicago and the Bay Area and “a few smaller markets” are on track to do so by the end of the year, executives said — but most subscribers pay upfront for an annual subscription, so The Athletic had cash in hand to continue operations.

The company has wasted no time spending the new money. It started sites in Detroit, Philadelphia, the Bay Area and Minnesota, brought on the former Fox Sports writer Stewart Mandel to lead a national college football site and hired the former Sports Illustrated writer Seth Davis to head up another for national college basketball.

Paul Fichtenbaum, a former top Sports Illustrated editor who had been working for The Athletic as a consultant, was hired to oversee the national sites and start a longform vertical, called Ink. “Building a company is exciting,” he said, but the “bigger opportunity to change an industry is really something that we all aspire to.”

Now the plan is to raise even more money soon, and to gain a foothold in every American and Canadian professional sports market within two years. “If there is a hockey, basketball, baseball or football team” in a city, Hansmann said, “that’s the starting point.”

It is that kind of ambition, in an industry that has sustained a decade of retrenchment, that has most of the sports media industry rooting for The Athletic’s success. Every writer knows he or she could be the next victim of a naïve pivot to video.

But Mather and Hansmann have displayed sharp elbows, and not everybody is happy with them. Newspaper sports editors have been left smarting after losing reporters to The Athletic — four writers for The Athletic Bay Area worked at the Bay Area Newspaper Group a few months ago. And then there is Dejan Kovacevic, a longtime Pittsburgh sportswriter who started DK Pittsburgh Sports, a subscription-based local sports site that in some ways is a model for The Athletic, three years ago.

In an email, Kovacevic said Mather and Hansmann approached him to be an adviser but they couldn’t agree on compensation. The Athletic, he said, promised not to start a Pittsburgh site. Instead, The Athletic Pittsburgh hired a second writer away from DK Pittsburgh Sports recently. Kovacevic also said that Mather and Hansmann were unhappy when he sold a copy of his publishing platform to Greg Bedard, who launched a subscription sports site in Boston this summer, because they said it raised their cost of doing business.

Mather said that when The Athletic’s executives spoke with Kovacevic they had no intention of expanding into Pittsburgh in the near term, and that he and Hansmann “only make ‘promises’ to our customers, employees, investors and partners.”

“We are doing great work,” Mather said. “We treat our writers really well, we pay them well, and we are doing amazing journalism. If someone has a problem with that, that’s on them.”

Mather and Hansmann also don’t hew to traditional — they would say antiquated — norms about the separation of business and advertising efforts, and are already cozier with the teams they cover than many outlets. They have an agreement with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, for instance, whereby Argonauts season ticket-holders can receive a trial subscription to The Athletic, paid for by the Argonauts.

Hansmann said The Athletic pulled no punches in its reporting on the Argonauts, while Mather suggested The Athletic could partner with teams on insider video or events in which subscribers go to the stadium early for exclusive access. Fichtenbaum said his understanding was the Argonauts partnership was a one-off.

Similarly, many of The Athletic’s representatives sang the virtues of its digital presentation, which shuns banner ads. But Parikh, the investor, said, “advertising has a very real opportunity down the road with The Athletic,” before adding that it would have to be “customer centric.”

Mather and Hansmann declined to disclose subscription numbers, but they have said Toronto, their most successful local site, has more than 15,000 subscribers. The national sites figure to boost local subscription numbers.

As The Athletic’s costs rise — it will soon need a bigger office, and the company is beginning to hire nonrevenue-generating support staff like accountants and human resources personnel — the company will seemingly need to attract casual sports fans. But Mather and Hansmann are not convinced.

“In a city like Chicago, there are 100,000 die-hard fans,” Mather said. “That is a very lucrative subscription business. There are over 100,000 die-hard fans of Chicago teams outside of Chicago,” he added, and he says they aren’t served well. “Bleacher Report is empty calories. SB Nation is empty calories. The newspapers are doing nothing.”

More journalists and investors will pay attention if The Athletic can get to the point that it can rely only on its own revenue, rather than having to turn to venture capital. Successful online media subscription products usually either cost hundreds or thousands of dollars annually and appeal to information-starved professionals — like The Information and Politico Pro — or have relatively inexpensive subscriptions that support relatively few writers — like DK Pittsburgh Sports and Stratechery.

While The Athletic aspires to be the Spotify or Netflix of sports media, the only media companies that have achieved scale with a relatively low price point (and the help of ads) are the very same newspapers The Athletic is intent on destroying.

Bleacher Report was the big sports media winner of the era when scale and online advertising revenue seemed like the future of media. It was rarely profitable and raised $40 million in venture capital funding before being bought by Turner in 2012 for about $175 million. According to skeptical media executives and investors interviewed for this article, something similar is likely the best-case scenario for The Athletic.

Mather and Hansmann insist that they, and their investors, are in it for the long haul, and that the time is finally right for a subscription media product to go big. “The advertising business model does not align with quality,” Mather said. “It’s hot takes instead of objective analysis, it’s short-term instead of long-term, it’s serving sponsors instead of users, it’s thinking big instead of great.”

“It really comes down to the business model,” he added. “That is our core belief.”",Why The Athletic Wants to Pillage Newspapers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/sports/the-athletic-newspapers.html

As a result, many of those grapes were potentially susceptible to smoke taint, which can leave wine with an unpleasant, ashy flavor.
Fear of smoke taint can force changes in winemaking protocols.
But with these grapes, Mr. Williams suggested, Frog’s Leap could do fewer pumpovers and press the skins before fermentation is complete.
“We’ll have to make hard decisions if we want to make great wines,” Mr. Williams said.","Still, several days of visits to the worst-hit parts of Napa and Sonoma Counties indicated that despite a communal sense of relief that the worst had been dodged, the fires have created serious concerns for the near future. Potential damage to the grapes, which may take months or years to show itself, could affect the supply and quality of some of this year’s vintage.

Aside from the wine, tourism is what the industry depends on, as do all the peripheral components — restaurants, hotels, spas, tour guides — that exist to offer a glimpse of what the pioneering winemaker Robert Mondavi used to call “the good life.” October and November are peak months for Napa and Sonoma, a time when tourists flock to the region, visiting wineries to taste and, often, to enter into long-term relationships as customers.

Tres Sabores, a small winery tucked into the hills in the Rutherford Bench area of Napa Valley, depends on tours and visitors for its business. It has had more than 250 cancellations through November, a situation repeated throughout the region, said Julie Johnson, the owner. “My team is losing tasting fees, sales, tips, commissions, wages — it’s a lot,” she said. “How can I provide for my team? That’s the thought in my head.”

Jeff Bundschu, whose family has owned Gundlach Bundschu in Sonoma Valley since the mid-19th century, says visitors make up 20 percent of his winery’s business, more if they join the wine club and become regular customers. Yet Mr. Bundschu, who had to persuade his father to leave his house behind the winery before it burned down, says he is more concerned at the moment with the well-being of his 96 employees and the community at large. Like many in the area, he is trying to organize a fund-raiser.

“We have a couple of weeks when the world is interested in us, and then the next disaster will strike and we’ll be on our own,” he said.

A dozen or so winemaking facilities were damaged or destroyed by the fires in Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino Counties, most notably Signorello Estate and White Rock Vineyards in the Stags Leap District of Napa Valley. But structures can be rebuilt in far less time than the years it would take for a newly planted vineyard to become productive.

A less tangible concern is that the roiling smoke that hovered over the region could somehow damage grapes that were not yet harvested.

Initial reports after the fires began suggested that much of the vintage had already been harvested. That was true of the white grapes. But many fine-wine producers in Napa and Sonoma still had red grapes hanging — particularly those for the riper, more voluptuous style that dominate in California, especially in Napa Valley. For many producers, as much as 30 percent of their Bordeaux varieties like cabernet sauvignon, merlot and cabernet franc, and Rhône grapes like grenache, had yet to be harvested.

Many producers had planned to pick these grapes just when the fires arrived, and then were unable to do so. As a result, many of those grapes were potentially susceptible to smoke taint, which can leave wine with an unpleasant, ashy flavor.

One thing is clear: A perception among consumers that the 2017 vintage is tainted would be bad for business, leading some producers to avoid discussing whether they still had grapes on the vines.

“I think more people picked before the fire than say they were at Woodstock,” said John Williams, the proprietor of Frog’s Leap Winery, which grows and makes cabernet sauvignon and other wines in Rutherford. “The most researched term on Google right now is ‘smoke taint.’”

Thirty percent of his estate cabernet grapes were still hanging a few days into the fires. Like many other producers, Frog’s Leap is processing the grapes picked after the fires started separately from those harvested before so that any potential taint will be confined.

The issue is more complicated than smoke residue settling on the skins of grapes. The interaction with smoke can cause chemical compounds to form within the grapes. At first, these compounds may be undetectable by taste or smell. They may become volatile during fermentation, or it may not be until much later, months or years, that they become evident.

Winemakers cannot simply wash the grapes. Instead, they send grapes, juice or wine to laboratories, which test for indications of these compounds.

Fear of smoke taint can force changes in winemaking protocols. Frog’s Leap depends on naturally occurring yeast to ferment its red grapes, Mr. Williams said, but manufactured yeast can be purchased that is said to either mask the smoke taint — if it exists — with fruity flavors or curtail the release of the smoky flavors.

In addition, the grapes can be handled more delicately than usual. Ordinarily, Frog’s Leap would pump the fermenting juice over the grape skins regularly to extract as much color, flavor and texture as possible. The skins remain with the juice until fermentation is complete, and then they are pressed to extract a little bit more. But with these grapes, Mr. Williams suggested, Frog’s Leap could do fewer pumpovers and press the skins before fermentation is complete. This might lead to other issues, like a loss of color and flavor.

Still other decisions loom. Producers may decide to use more heavily charred barrels to age these wines. The char will cause the wine to taste more oaky, but, since oak contains the same active compound found in smoke taint, albeit in a more agreeable form, it might mask any potential flaw.

Ultimately, if a wine proves unsatisfactory, many producers will sell it off, either to be bottled as a proprietary wine for wine clubs or other institutions, or on the bulk-wine market. They will earn something, but not nearly what they would have if they were bottling the wine themselves.

“We’ll have to make hard decisions if we want to make great wines,” Mr. Williams said. “Thirty percent of our cabernet business is a big hit.”

Reminders of the fires are all over the wine country. Wide swatches of umber dirt — fire breaks bulldozed through fields and woods, to cordon the flames off — scar the countryside. The bulldozers have carved up numerous paved mountain roads, their metal tracks leaving ruts that will shake passenger vehicles for some time to come.

Those who lived or worked on the front lines of the fires swap tales of bravery. Sam Coturri, who works with his father, Phil Coturri, a prominent vineyard manager in Sonoma and Napa, and at Sixteen 600, their wine label, spoke of his brother, Max, a local volunteer firefighter who single-handedly saved a house that had caught fire as he was feeding chickens that had been left untended behind the evacuation lines.

Sam Coturri worked to save his parents’ house. With colleagues, he dug a fire break with a backhoe and hosed down the wooden structure. He has hired a crisis counselor to help the 100 vineyard management employees, some of whom lost homes and many of whom are immigrants.

“I’ve always known how much I owe to a largely immigrant work force,” he said. “I learned this week how much of a responsibility I have to them as well.”

As with any agricultural enterprise, the work of making wine must go on regardless of interruptions, even one as profound and traumatic as the fires. “We don’t know the bigger story yet,” Mr. Williams said. “We have to take care of our people, make the best wine we can possibly make and get the vineyards ready for winter.”

In December, Nikki Haley, Trump’s nominee for ambassador to the United Nations, set up a conference call with two senior State Department officials: Kristie Kenney, the State Department counselor, and Patrick Kennedy, the under secretary of state for management.
“The people the Senate would expect to confirm have all been taken off the table.”In the early days of the administration, according to State Department officials, White House officials, especially Bannon, sent over many names for State Department posts.
“They came away with the impression that we’re very ‘patriotic’ and ‘professional,’ ” a senior State Department official says.
According to one senior State Department official, Tillerson originally wanted to cut the staff by 15 percent, until he was told that to do so the State Department would have to fire people.","On the afternoon I saw Tillerson at the State Department, he’d just returned from several hours at the White House. This was hardly unusual. When he’s in Washington, he often spends part of his workday at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in formal and informal meetings with Trump. Tillerson, a former Eagle Scout who years later served as the Boy Scouts of America’s national president, always comes prepared for those encounters, keeping a 2-inch-by-8-inch notecard in the inside pocket of his suit jacket with a handwritten list of matters he wants to discuss with the president. After meeting with Trump, he’ll then add to the list the things Trump wants him to take care of.

Many political eminences, including Tillerson’s hunting buddy, the former Secretary of State James Baker, had advised Tillerson that his relationship with Trump would be the most important factor in determining his success in his new job. And this was an area in which Tillerson, in his previous job as chief executive of Exxon Mobil, had excelled. “I have over my life had to build relationships with heads of state, not just this one, but heads of states all over the world,” he reminded me. At Exxon Mobil, he did business with a rogue’s gallery of world leaders, from Vladimir Putin (who in 2013 awarded Tillerson Russia’s Order of Friendship) to Hugo Chavez (who in 2007 seized Exxon Mobil’s assets, prompting the oil giant to leave Venezuela). I asked Tillerson if Trump had any similarities to the heads of state he dealt with as an oil executive. “Yeah, there are other leaders that share the qualities that he has,” Tillerson replied, before adding, “and I’m not gonna name names, because then you’ll go — everybody will go dissect that.”

But building a good rapport with the head of state of his own country has, so far, proved to be beyond Tillerson’s formidable abilities. According to some people who are close to Trump, his disappointment with Tillerson is as much personal as it is professional. “Trump originally thought he could have a relationship with Tillerson that’s almost social,” says one Trump adviser, “the way his relationships are with Wilbur Ross and Steve Mnuchin.” But unlike Trump’s commerce and Treasury secretaries — plutocrats who, like Trump, are on their third, younger wives — Tillerson, who is 65 and has been married to the same woman for 31 years, has shown little interest in being the president’s running buddy; instead of Saturday-night dinners with Trump at his Washington hotel, Tillerson favors trips home to Texas to see his grandchildren or to Colorado to visit his nonagenarian parents.

(The White House, provided a detailed list of questions relating to Tillerson and his relationship with Trump as described in this article, responded with the following official statement: “The president has assembled the most talented cabinet in history and everyone continues to be dedicated towards advancing the president’s America First agenda. Anything to the contrary is simply false and comes from unnamed sources who are either out of the loop or unwilling to turn the country around.”)

In his office, Tillerson contemplated what has turned out to be his most difficult diplomatic mission. “I’ve had to build a relationship with President Trump because he didn’t know me — I mean he certainly knew of me, just as I knew of him — but to understand how my thought processes work, for me to understand how his work, for me to understand how he makes decisions, because he makes decisions in a very different way than I do,” Tillerson said, spinning his fingers around his head to indicate cognition. “I’m an engineer by training. I’m a very systems, process, methodical decision maker. He’s an entrepreneur. Different mind-set. He makes decisions differently. Doesn’t mean one is better than the other, but I’ve had to learn how he processes information and how I can help him process the information and how I can give him good advice that makes sense to him. So for both of us there’s a communication to be worked out.”

Although the State Department is no longer quite the ivied redoubt it was a half-century ago, when men like George Kennan and Paul Nitze roamed the halls of Foggy Bottom and its global outposts, its employees still tend to be a bit tweedier than your ordinary government bureaucrat. This is especially true of the nearly 14,000 members of the Foreign Service, with their rigorous entrance exam and a strict up-or-out promotions system, not to mention their cosmopolitan ethos and fluency in multiple languages. They consider themselves elite.

This elite might have been more simpatico with President Barack Obama, given his appreciation of diplomacy and soft power, than with Trump, but neither of Obama’s secretaries of state was particularly beloved by the department’s rank and file. There were complaints that Hillary Clinton subordinated the department’s needs to those of her political ambitions, creating a new and unwieldy cadre of special envoys and ambassadors at large that seemed designed to appeal to Democratic constituencies. Clinton’s successor, John Kerry, was viewed by some as an imperious boss who treated the department as a kind of playground, bringing his yellow Labrador retriever to work and letting the dog roam the building’s seventh-floor suite of executive offices known as Mahogany Row.

But after Trump’s election, many State Department officials braced for much worse. Some of the initially rumored potential secretaries — John Bolton, Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani — often seemed more inclined to blow up Foggy Bottom than to run it. When Trump picked Tillerson, the news was greeted not only with relief but even with optimism.

It was true that Tillerson was never going to be a conventional secretary of state, especially not working for Trump. “His idea for the job when he took it was that he and Trump can be negotiators, the best negotiators, for America,” says a Trump adviser. “His idea of foreign policy isn’t one that would make sense to people who read Foreign Policy.” But his combed-back silver hair and Texas-inflected baritone — in which a Foggy Bottom commonplace like “partner” becomes a mellifluous “pardner” — radiated the kind of authority admired by Trump, who asked Tillerson to be his secretary of state during their first meeting at Trump Tower in December. “He’s much more than a business executive,” Trump told Fox News shortly before announcing Tillerson’s nomination. “He’s a world-class player.” Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House adviser who attended that first Trump-Tillerson meeting, says: “The president puts a ton of weight on first impressions. As soon as Rex walked in the room, I knew the job was his.”

To external appearances, the work Tillerson did at Exxon Mobil seemed to reflect the zero-sum negotiator’s view of foreign policy that Trump has espoused ever since “The Art of the Deal.” “He’s led this charmed life,” Trump said of Tillerson at a black-tie dinner in January. “He goes into a country, takes the oil, goes into another country.” Tillerson’s future employees took a different comfort in Tillerson’s résumé. As chief executive of Exxon Mobil, where he worked for 41 years, Tillerson led a nearly 75,000-person corporate behemoth with a global footprint that rivaled that of the United States itself, requiring it to have, in effect, its own foreign policy. In fact, Exxon Mobil operated its own sort of mini-State Department, a division called the International Government Relations Group, staffed with foreign-policy experts, including a number who previously served in high-ranking positions in Foggy Bottom. As Tillerson traveled the world cutting deals for Exxon Mobil in Russia and Africa and the Middle East, he relied on the I.G.R.G. for expertise and advice much the same way secretaries of state typically rely on the Foreign Service.

Tillerson was originally recommended to the Trump team by the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, both mandarins of the Republican foreign-policy establishment who had consulted for Exxon Mobil, on the grounds that his vast knowledge of foreign governments and their leaders made him a perfect fit for the job. “The expectation was that Tillerson would be a grown-up and provide ballast,” says a 30-year veteran of the Foreign Service, “that he was someone who believed in America being the glue that created global stability and would be interested in upholding the world order as we have it.”

Before their Senate confirmations, secretary-of-state nominees are customarily provided a suite of offices on the first floor of the State Department’s eight-story, limestone-and-steel headquarters. There, just off the international-flag-draped lobby on C Street, they prepare for their new job, receiving briefings from and meeting with some of the people they will soon be leading.

Trump transition officials had sent a small beachhead team, led by Charles Glazer, a former Wall Street executive and Republican donor who served as President George W. Bush’s ambassador to El Salvador, to use the office. Few saw Tillerson set foot in it. A space that could accommodate 50 people wound up being filled by not even a dozen. What’s more, some State Department officials were told by the Trump transition team that they were not to contact Tillerson at all. “The attitude was that anyone who worked with Obama must be suspect,” one Trump transition official says.

In December, Nikki Haley, Trump’s nominee for ambassador to the United Nations, set up a conference call with two senior State Department officials: Kristie Kenney, the State Department counselor, and Patrick Kennedy, the under secretary of state for management. Haley wanted to ask them questions about the logistics of her new job: basic matters like what her salary and benefits would be and where her family would live in New York City. Kenney and Kennedy told her about the federal employee health insurance plan and offered to send her floor plans of the U.N. ambassador’s apartment. When word of the call got back to Trump’s transition team, the two department officials were reprimanded by Glazer and told never to speak with Haley again.

Kenney and Kennedy were among the small cohort of foreign-policy professionals who held the Foreign Service’s equivalent of a three- or four-star general rank in the military. These senior diplomats were responsible for handling America’s most vexing global challenges, everything from Russia’s annexation of Crimea to North Korea’s pursuit of weapons of mass destruction to the Iran nuclear deal. Members of this elite group, who served under Democratic and Republican presidents alike, had submitted their pro forma letters of resignation upon the end of the Obama administration, as was the custom during presidential transitions. The letters typically occasion a conversation with the incoming secretary and his or her team about whether these diplomats should remain in their current jobs or, if not, what other senior positions inside the department they might be moved to. In a worst-case situation, they would usually be rotated into a sleepy ambassadorship.

But this time around, every letter was greeted with silence. Not only did the officials not know how Tillerson intended to use them; they didn’t know if, come the Monday after Trump’s Friday inauguration, they would even have jobs. As one of them later recalled, “Every conversation would end with, ‘Have you heard anything from Tillerson?’ ”

Finally, with only a few days until the inauguration and still no word from Tillerson, one of the senior officials, Victoria Nuland — who once was Hillary Clinton’s State Department spokeswoman but had also been a foreign-policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney and was at the time the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs — opted to retire. The others chose to make a go of it. On the Monday after the inauguration, they showed up for work, as usual, at Foggy Bottom.

Two days later, Kennedy was told to retire and given three days to clean out his office. Kennedy had spent 44 years in the Foreign Service and was not particularly political, focusing instead on management and operations; he’d been appointed to his under-secretary position by President George W. Bush. But he had become a central figure in conservative conspiracy theories about Benghazi and Clinton’s private email server. Tillerson aides later joked that Kennedy’s defenestration was like something out of the Soviet Union, dragging a political foe out into the street and shooting him in the head so as to send a message to others.

A few weeks later, Kenney, who as counselor was the State Department’s No. 5 policy official, was told that her services were no longer needed, and she retired. And in the weeks after that, half a dozen other top diplomats were shown the door — fired, forced into retirement or warehoused at a university fellowship. “If you took the entire three-star and four-star corps of the military and said, ‘Leave!’ Congress would go crazy,” one of the recently departed said.

In a few short months, Tillerson had rid the State Department of much of its last several decades of diplomatic experience, though it was not really clear to what end. The new secretary of state, it soon became evident, had an easier time firing people than hiring them — a consequence of the election that delivered him to Foggy Bottom.

During the campaign, the “Never Trump” movement gathered many of its most devoted adherents from Republican foreign-policy circles, with scores of G.O.P. national-security professionals signing open letters declaring their opposition to the eventual Republican nominee. Although internecine foreign-policy squabbles were hardly unusual, they typically ended when the primaries did, with the losers rallying around the victor. But in 2016, representatives of all the various factions of the Republican foreign-policy world — realists and neoconservatives, hawks and isolationists — were united in their opposition to Trump, not only on ideological grounds but because they viewed him as personally unfit for office. And, given the personal nature of the criticism, Trump and those around him didn’t forgive it.

Tillerson’s early choice for deputy secretary of state was Elliott Abrams, a longtime Republican foreign-policy hand who served as George W. Bush’s deputy national-security adviser. At Tillerson’s instigation, Trump met with Abrams in early February and came away favorably disposed to his nomination, according to White House officials. But after the meeting, Trump apparently saw Rand Paul on Fox News disparage Abrams as a Never Trumper. (During the campaign Abrams wrote an article for The Weekly Standard titled “When You Can’t Stand Your Candidate.”) Trump told Tillerson that Abrams could not work for him after all.

According to a senior administration official, other potential hires were knocked out of consideration for sins as minor as retweeting some of Marco Rubio’s “little hands” jokes about Trump. “The hiring pool is very different from your normal hiring pool,” the official says. “The people the Senate would expect to confirm have all been taken off the table.”

In the early days of the administration, according to State Department officials, White House officials, especially Bannon, sent over many names for State Department posts. But Tillerson, after looking at their résumés and in some cases conducting interviews, felt he had no choice but to reject them. “They didn’t meet the qualifications for the actual jobs,” another senior administration official says.

Amid this impasse, power in the State Department has accrued to the relative handful of figures who have actually been hired, like Tillerson’s chief of staff, Margaret Peterlin. Peterlin served in the early 2000s as a national-security aide to Dennis Hastert, who was then speaker of the House, but she had been out of international-affairs work for more than a decade, first as a Commerce Department official, then as an executive for the Mars candy company before she left to raise her children. Peterlin was tapped by a Trump transition official, a fellow former Hastert staff member, to shepherd the secretary-of-state nominee through his confirmation process. Tillerson subsequently asked her to become his chief of staff.

By the spring, however, Peterlin had become a particular source of irritation to White House officials, some of whom told me they believed that she was dragging her feet on nominations in order to preserve her newfound power. In April, according to multiple sources, Reince Priebus, who was then chief of staff at the White House, went so far as to set up a weekly meeting among himself, Peterlin and the White House personnel director, Johnny DeStefano, to review applicants in the hope of moving things along.

In the past few months, the pace of nominations for the State Department has picked up. But even so, few of the nominees have qualifications that match those of their predecessors. For instance, Tillerson’s nominee for under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs — a post that was held by the former White House senior adviser Karen Hughes during George W. Bush’s administration and the former Time editor Richard Stengel during Obama’s — is a New York City marketing executive named Irwin Steven Goldstein who once worked at the same company as Peterlin’s husband.

The person on whose shoulders the fallout from the staffing shortage rests most heavily is Brian Hook, the head of the department’s office of policy planning. A former adviser to Mitt Romney, Hook was a founder of the John Hay Initiative, a hawkish foreign-policy think tank whose other two founders, Eliot A. Cohen and Eric Edelman, were (and still are) among Trump’s most vociferous critics. Cohen and Edelman put their names on anti-Trump letters during the 2016 election; Hook didn’t.

With so many crucial assistant-secretary positions — including some responsible for Asia, the Middle East, and South America — still either vacant or filled with acting officials, Hook has had to pick up the slack. “He’s trying to do the job of 30 people,” a 25-year veteran Foreign Service officer says. “He’s just knee-walking.” Worse, the office of policy planning, which has traditionally functioned as the secretary of state’s in-house think tank, is now tasked with handling day-to-day operations at the expense of formulating long-term strategy. “The problem is there’s no conceptual motor at all,” says Cohen, a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies who served as counselor of the department under Rice. “It’s the random thoughts of Donald J. Trump and a very weak State Department and a secretary of state who hasn’t thought deeply about these things.”

When I recently met with Hook in his seventh-floor office at the State Department, he seemed wary of any implication that, in light of his establishment pedigree and association with Cohen and Edelman, he wasn’t sufficiently pro-Trump. I noted that on his conference table he had a book by Daniel W. Drezner, an international-politics professor at Tufts University who writes regularly for The Washington Post website and is a frequent critic of Trump and of Tillerson. In fact, just that morning, Drezner had published a column calling on Tillerson to resign. I jokingly told Hook that he might want to hide the book. Instead, R.C. Hammond, Tillerson’s communications director, who was sitting in on the interview, immediately seized it.

“This is the guy who has the thing at The Post?” Hammond asked Hook. “Where’s your trash can?” He made as if he was going to throw the book across Hook’s office. Hook raised his hand to block Hammond.

“No!” Hook said. “It’s a book on policy planning! This was written before Rex Tillerson was even considered.”

“Trash can,” Hammond reiterated. Hook kept his hand up. The fifth of Bombay gin and the liter bottle of tonic water on his desk suddenly made more sense.

On June 5, Tillerson was in Sydney, Australia, with the defense secretary, James Mattis, when he learned that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt were all severing relations with the tiny Persian Gulf nation Qatar and imposing an air, sea and land blockade. The countries took these actions, they contended, because of Qatar’s support for Islamist groups, like the Muslim Brotherhood, and its warm relations with Iran, with which it shares the world’s largest gas field. But it was most likely not a coincidence that the move came on the heels of Trump’s goofy and garish visit to Saudi Arabia, during which he was photographed laying hands on what appeared to be a mysterious glowing orb, announced a $110 billion arms deal and called for a Sunni alliance to combat terrorism and Iran.

Tillerson had participated in the festivities, joining Trump and their Saudi hosts in a ceremonial sword dance — “not my first sword dance,” he later told reporters. But Qatar is also a country Tillerson knows well. At Exxon Mobil, he worked closely with its emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, who was then Qatar’s interior minister, to help develop the world largest liquefied-natural-gas complex in Ras Laffan Industrial City. He happened to be in Doha, on Exxon Mobil business, the night Trump was elected. According to Hammond, when Tillerson returned to the country for the first time as secretary of state, in July, he tapped Hammond on the shoulder as his airplane was making its approach and pointed down to Ras Laffan. “Do you want to see what $250 billion looks like?” Tillerson asked.

Tillerson feared the crisis could destabilize the region. Mattis, meanwhile, was concerned about the United States air base in Qatar that hosts the largest concentration of American military members in the Middle East. Together, the two cabinet secretaries began working to get Trump to try to broker a resolution.

But other members of the Trump administration argued against such a move, especially Jared Kushner. Ever since Trump’s election, Kushner had been the focus of an intense courtship by Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, and Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi; and the two men quickly formed a close friendship with the president’s son-in-law. So close, in fact, that the crown princes convinced Kushner not just of Qatar’s perfidy but of the opportunity the blockade provided to further tilt American foreign policy toward the Saudis and away from Iran, according to the Trump adviser. “Rex saw it as a crisis to solve,” the adviser says. “Jared saw it as an opportunity to seize.”

Back in Washington, Tillerson suggested summoning the parties to Camp David. When that idea gained no traction, Tillerson proposed an American-sponsored meeting in Kuwait, to no avail. While Tillerson publicly called on the Saudis to end their blockade, Trump pronounced the action against Qatar “hard but necessary.” The “special relationship of prince to prince,” as the senior administration official describes the Kushner-Mohammed bin Salman alliance, seemed to be carrying the day.

Finally, in mid-July, Trump acquiesced to Tillerson’s request to be allowed to go to the region himself to conduct a round of shuttle diplomacy. In Doha, over a dinner of goat and baby camel, Tillerson negotiated with Qatar’s emir. In Jidda, he cajoled the Saudis and their allies to end their blockade. Nothing seemed to work, especially because each side was receiving the opposite message from other officials in Washington. On his flight back to the United States, Tillerson vented some of his frustrations. “It is a lot different than being C.E.O. of Exxon because I was the ultimate decision maker,” he told two reporters on board. The federal government, by contrast, is “not a highly disciplined organization, decision making is fragmented and sometimes people don’t want to take decisions.”

But Tillerson continued to quietly work the issue, concentrating as much on the head of state at home as on the heads of state in the gulf. When the quartet excluded Qatar from a military exercise in which it had traditionally taken part, he made a note of it on his list of things to talk to Trump about and brought it up to him at the White House. When Mohammed bin Salman welcomed a rogue member of Qatar’s Al-Thani royal family to Mina, lending credence to Tillerson’s suspicion that the Saudis hoped to use the crisis to engineer a regime change in Doha, Tillerson alerted Trump.

After several months, Tillerson finally won Trump over to his view. In early September, Trump told the Saudis and the Qataris that it was time to end the dispute. After Trump brokered a call between the emir of Qatar and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, the two sides immediately began fighting again, and the crisis remains unresolved, but at least it was a start.

When I spoke to Tillerson about what caused the initial split in the administration on Qatar, he said that it boiled down to experience. “I think I started from a different place perhaps because I’ve known all the leaders involved for a long time, and I’ve seen these kinds of issues emerge in the region over the 20-plus years I’ve been dealing with the region,” he said. “So this was not new for me, and so I guess my reaction to it was perhaps immediately measured because I’ve seen it before. To those who have not seen it before” — and here Tillerson didn’t bother to name names, but it seemed he was talking about Kushner — “there are a lot of concerns expressed about Qatar that are legitimate concerns. The U.S. government has had some of these concerns, and we’re addressing them now through the engagement with Qatar and the memorandum of understanding we put in place when I was over there, and it’s going very well. We have issues with the other countries as well, and so I think the way we reacted was just based upon, in my case, that past experience versus those who perhaps had not seen this before.”

It was amid the Qatar episode that, in July, Tillerson and Mattis convened a special meeting with Trump to give the president a tutorial on, as The Associated Press later described it, “American Power 101.” Sitting in a windowless meeting room at the Pentagon known as the Tank, Tillerson and Mattis reportedly used charts and maps to explain to Trump why the United States needed to have so many diplomatic, military and intelligence assets deployed around the world. In at least one respect, their message had its intended effect: A month later, Trump would reverse his promise to withdraw from Afghanistan and announce that he was sending more troops there.

But when the meeting broke up, that development was hardly assured; and it was after spending 90 minutes tutoring Trump — including, according to NBC, about why the tenfold increase in nuclear weapons Trump desired would be a bad idea — that Tillerson reportedly called the president a “moron.” It may well be the harshest criticism Tillerson has directed at his boss, but it’s far from the only one. According to a former administration official, in private conversations with aides and friends, Tillerson refers to Trump, in his Texas deadpan, as the dealmaker in chief. And in meetings with Trump, according to people who have attended them, he increasingly rolls his eyes at the president’s remarks. If Trump disagrees with Tillerson, the official said, his secretary of state will say, “It’s your deal.”

The friction hasn’t been confined to foreign policy. In July, Tillerson was reportedly outraged by Trump’s politically charged speech at the Boy Scout Jamboree in West Virginia, where, a few days earlier, Tillerson himself was honored for his service to the organization. In August, after Trump’s response to a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville — in which he said there were “very fine people” on “both sides” of the violent clashes there — Tillerson was asked on Fox News about whether the “president’s values” reflected America’s values. “The president speaks for himself,” Tillerson replied.

The souring of Tillerson’s relationship with Trump has left him not just without the support of the most crucial ally, his boss, but also without the support of any real allies at all. “The conundrum for Rex,” says a Trump-administration official sympathetic to Tillerson’s plight, “is that he’s on this island.”

During his first eight months in Washington, Tillerson spent so much time focusing his energies on Trump that he neglected other crucial constituencies. Bob Corker, the Republican senator from Tennessee who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has praised Tillerson — along with Mattis and the White House Chief of Staff John Kelly — for helping to “separate our country from chaos”; but Tillerson has few other allies on Capitol Hill, and now that Corker’s own relationship with Trump is on the rocks, it’s unclear how much his support of Tillerson will mean. Nor has Tillerson developed any new, close ties with foreign leaders, and many of the ones he had from his days at Exxon are now complicated by the realities of his current job.

His interactions with the press, meanwhile, have been grudging at best. Previous secretaries of state traveled the globe on a Boeing 757 that could accommodate as many as a dozen members of the State Department press corps; Tillerson has usually opted to fly on a smaller 737, with very limited room for reporters, and has studiously avoided the media in Washington. He has been sparing with his major policy speeches. “I speak when I have something I think’s important to say,” Tillerson told me. “I don’t need a lot of time talking to. ...” He nodded curtly in my direction.

And then, of course, there’s Tillerson’s relationship — or lack thereof — with the State Department itself. For a secretary of state, speaking to the public, either in speeches or through regular interactions with the press, is a vital way of speaking to the department’s employees, especially when the secretary is planning to upend their lives, as Tillerson currently is. Not long after he was sworn in last February, Tillerson announced that he would be undertaking a grand “redesign” of the department. He hired a small consulting firm, Insigniam, that did work for him at Exxon Mobil to conduct a “listening tour” of State Department rank and file through an online questionnaire and about 300 personal interviews.

Many State Department employees found that Insigniam’s questions, both online and in person, betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of what they did. “They came away with the impression that we’re very ‘patriotic’ and ‘professional,’ ” a senior State Department official says. “You don’t need a [expletive] survey to know that. It’s completely demeaning.”

At the same time Tillerson was getting ready to carry out his redesign, he was also trying to accommodate the Trump administration’s demand to drastically slash the State Department’s budget, ultimately acquiescing to a 30 percent cut. Tillerson insists that one has nothing to do with the other. “The budget and what we’re doing organizationally have no relationship whatsoever,” he told me. But others inside and outside the State Department see them as inextricably linked. “It’d be like Exxon Mobil starting with a budget number and then deciding if it was going to produce oil or gas,” a former senior State Department official says.

Although Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have already declared Trump’s State Department cuts a nonstarter — and, in September, passed an appropriations bill that funded the department for the next three months at about last year’s level — Tillerson still intends to slash the department’s staff by 8 percent, or roughly 2,000 people. According to one senior State Department official, Tillerson originally wanted to cut the staff by 15 percent, until he was told that to do so the State Department would have to fire people. (The 8 percent reduction will be accomplished through attrition and some buyouts.)

“I have just the utmost respect for the Foreign Service officer corps here, and they’re vital,” Tillerson told me. “They’re vital and critical to the country’s ability to carry out its foreign policies.” As for the perception by many inside and outside Foggy Bottom that he wants to gut the Foreign Service, he said he doesn’t quite know how to respond. “I’m mystified by it,” he said. “I’m perplexed by it.”

But even the cuts he has planned, some State Department veterans fear, will cripple the department for years to come, especially as the lower and midlevel ranks of the department are reduced. “You can’t have captains if you don’t have lieutenants,” a senior State Department official says. “You can’t have majors if you don’t have captains.”

In nearly 300 embassies, missions and consulates around the world where State Department officials work to promote and defend America’s interests, diplomats complain about not just a dearth of resources but also a lack of guidance. “I’d request instructions on action items, saying I need a decision, and I’d hear absolutely nothing,” a recently returned ambassador said. Meanwhile, foreign leaders are increasingly emboldened in their attempts to drive a wedge between America’s diplomatic corps and the president. Earlier this year, according to Foreign Policy, Trump pushed out the United States ambassador to Jordan at the request of the country’s king. And this month, Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has cultivated a close relationship with Trump, declared the American ambassador to his country persona non grata after a visa dispute. “We do not see him as the representative of the United States in Turkey,” Erdogan said.

A result, according to the nearly two dozen current and former State Department officials with whom I spoke, is that the department’s morale has never been lower. For that, almost all of them blame Tillerson. “When we’re put up for confirmation and swearing in, we thank the president and the secretary of state for having confidence in us, but I’m not sure I can honestly say that anymore,” the 25-year veteran of the Foreign Service confessed. “It’s not even about the president for me. It’s that I am deeply, deeply anguished about the secretary of state, and I have never felt like that.”

After Tillerson’s punishing turn in the media glare in recent weeks, the assumption among many that I spoke to in Foggy Bottom (outside Tillerson’s closest advisers) was that his departure was now a question of when, not if. Some believed that the only holdup was that Trump had not yet decided on Tillerson’s replacement, with Haley and the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, being the most frequently mentioned candidates. Others speculated that Tillerson had asked to delay his exit until he’d been in his position for a year, in order to avoid a huge capital-gains tax hit on the stocks he had to divest from in order to take the job.

The “moron” remark had actually elevated Tillerson in the estimation of some in Foggy Bottom — “I feel like it’s curiously redemptive,” the 25-year veteran Foreign Service officer told me — but even these people conceded that they believed he could no longer do his job effectively. “This just isn’t sustainable,” a senior State Department official said. “You can’t have a secretary of state going around the world who’s not seen as representing the president’s foreign policy.”

But even if Tillerson leaves, the fear among many in the State Department is that the hangover from his tenure will be long-lasting. The Foreign Service officer recalls a recent meeting of acting assistant secretaries, where the most pressing matters discussed were the backlog of Freedom of Information Act requests and the number of typographical errors in memos to the secretary’s office. “The world is going to hell in a handbasket,” the Foreign Service officer fumed, “and the greatest minds in our diplomatic service are talking about FOIA requests and [expletive] typos.”

All of which can lead to some dark thoughts. More than one State Department official told me that they believed all of this wasn’t a case of simple mismanagement but of something more sinister. “I’ve lived in a lot of countries where conspiracy theories abound because people feel like they lack self-determination,” Nancy McEldowney, a 30-year career Foreign Service officer who retired in June, says. “And a great many people inside State are now hypothesizing about what the goal of all this is. Why are they firing people and shrinking the department down? It can’t simply be a budget-cutting exercise. If it were purely for reform, they would have done it differently.”

Whatever his intentions, Tillerson’s true legacy may well be to have transformed a venerable American institution into the caricature of its most fevered, irrational critics.

MONDAY PUZZLES — If you make odd connections between things as I do, the crossword might bring out different things for you. Jennifer Nutt, who wrote today’s lovely Monday crossword, probably did not have this in mind when she created it, but her puzzle brought this up for me, so I’m going to tell you a story.

The first time I visited Cape Town, I took the ferry to Robben Island to see the prison — now a museum — where former South African president Nelson Mandela and many others who resisted the National Party during the apartheid era were held. It’s the kind of thing that is expected of first-time visitors (“Oh, you must go!”) and I’m a student of history, so I climbed aboard the boat and off I went.

Cape Town is a very windy city because of its location between the mountains and the sea, and on that day, the wind was working against the ferry as it made its way across the water. With no warning, a pod of humpback whales appeared in the water at the front of the boat, and skimmed over the water toward the island, almost as if to lead us in. When we slowed down, they would loop back and continue to guide us. It was a very touching sight, almost as if they were saying, “Follow us. There are secrets to be told here.” Once we were close to the shore, they dispersed and made their way back out to sea.

The tour, which is more a heartbreaking example of man’s inhumanity to man than a tourist trap curiosity, lasted about an hour and included talks by both former prisoners and the Afrikaaner guards who had held them captive. They had returned to educate mostly foreign visitors about a relatively recent period in history (1948 — 1994) where a nationalist government had succeeded in discriminating despicably against black Africans and criminalizing interaction between the races. There were also a surprising number of white South Africans in our group.

“Are you here with people from outside the country?” I asked one Capetonian.

“No, for myself,” he said.",Swimming Away from the Wind,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/15/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2017-10-16.html

A pie made with a dozen Granny Smith apples may be inedible, but a pie made with four Granny Smith apples may be irresistible.
Cider syrup, apple cider and apple juice are perfectly fine nonalcoholic alternatives.","Many home bakers assume that when it comes to pie crust, thinner is better. “People are worried that they’re doing it wrong,” said Kate McDermott, a professional “pie coach” who holds frequent workshops. “So they keep rolling, and rolling, and rolling, until the crust is much thinner than it needs to be.”

Many modern recipes call for a crust that is an eighth-inch thick. But Ms. McDermott rolls out her crusts to at least a quarter-inch, a more traditional proportion.

Double-crust pies were invented many centuries ago to serve as durable cases for valuable ingredients like meat, sugar, spices and citrus peel (and occasionally live birds, frogs and humans). “It was the original Tupperware,” said Ms. McDermott, author of “Art of the Pie.”

Those crusts were not necessarily meant to be eaten. To this day, a good pie must have a stable marriage of filling and crust.

To achieve this, a fully baked, not-soggy crust is essential. A sturdy crust (like the one on a baguette) can often be chewy and tough. The genius of the traditional method for making pie crust — with large, flat flakes of flour and butter — is that, once baked, it is both strong and tender.

A thick crust demands a heavy, heat-conducting dish. Thin metal does not provide the even, steady heat that’s needed to cook this crust through. Thick glass is fine if you want to check the color of the crust, but heavy ceramics (like stoneware, earthenware and porcelain) are actually better at browning, according to Ms. McDermott. Her trick of baking the pie on a preheated baking sheet (to ensure that heat reaches the crust quickly) means that there’s no reason to doubt that the bottom crust is cooked when the other signs of doneness (bubbling filling, brown top crust) are there.

However, you do not need a pie pan to bake a pie, especially a deep-dish pie. The sloped sides of a traditional pie dish are there to make it easier to slice and serve, but they are certainly not necessary. Any baking dish of any shape can be used, as long as it is at least two inches deep and holds 2½ to 3 quarts. Use your most-loved casserole or cast-iron skillet. Your favorite dish may not have a rim, but you don’t need one — this pie’s crust is thick enough to make its own.

And which apples? A pie made with a dozen Granny Smith apples may be inedible, but a pie made with four Granny Smith apples may be irresistible. Generally, a mix of tart and sweet apples gives the best odds of a great filling. Though some claim that ancient breeds like sweet Bramleys and tart Pippins make the best pies, many of the newer apples on the market — Honeycrisps and Pink Ladys, Ginger Golds and Cameos — offer a good balance of sweet and tart.

These new apples also hold their shape in baking, because snacking apples are bred to be firm and “explosively crunchy,” according to Rowan Jacobsen, author of “Apples of Uncommon Character.”

“Crispness has become super-valued,” he said.

An interplay of sweet and sour flavors, plus firm and soft textures, is the goal. “You need the mortar and you need the bricks,” Mr. Jacobsen said of a good filling. If using crunchy apples, toss in a McIntosh, Idared or Cortland. Those apples will break down during baking and bind the filling. (A spoonful of applesauce will do the same thing.)

And when it comes to maximizing apple flavor, Ms. McDermott takes no chances, boosting it at every opportunity. Instead of lemon juice, commonly added to balance the sweetness of added sugar, she uses unfiltered apple cider vinegar; she also deploys a shot of apple liqueur, schnapps or brandy, like French Calvados. Cider syrup, apple cider and apple juice are perfectly fine nonalcoholic alternatives.

“Pie is very forgiving,” she said. “It is happy as long as it is made.”

The inspectors general found that the other two cases were also followed by inaccurate reports from the field.","The controversy over the actions of the agents has had an impact: As the D.E.A. braced for the May release of the inspectors general report on the episode, the agency disbanded the program that had run the interdiction operation, named the Foreign-deployed Advisory Support Teams, or FAST. The FAST program provided military-style training to law enforcement officers in other countries to counter drug traffickers.

The inspectors general report, which found no evidence to support the D.E.A.’s account that its agents were fired upon, has also drawn attention from lawmakers. A bipartisan group of four senators asserted that the D.E.A. and State Department “repeatedly and knowingly misled members of Congress and congressional staff.”

“The D.E.A. convinced themselves of a false version of events due to arrogance, false assumptions, and ignorance,” said Tim Rieser, an aide to Sen. Patrick Leahy and one of the staff members who has spent years delving into the shooting. “They rushed to judgment and then stuck to their story.”

Mary Brandenberger, a D.E.A. spokeswoman, declined to comment on whether the agency still believed that an exchange of gunfire had taken place, because the episode was still under internal review. The agency has never retracted its view that the agents were fired upon and acted in self-defense.

For a crucial piece of evidence that it asserted would exonerate its personnel, the D.E.A. kept the video under tight control. The first time it was shown outside the agency was in May 2012, shortly after the shooting, when it was screened in a secure conference room for a group of congressional staffers.

The D.E.A. and State Department briefers controlled all the information, said Peter Quilter, a former staff member for the House Foreign Affairs Committee who attended some of initial briefings. “It was very difficult to second-guess them.” He added: “They very simply misled the Congress. The video did not back up their story of what happened.”

In at least eight briefings over six months, and in multiple letters in response to senators and representatives, the D.E.A. maintained that the shooting was justified.

In June 2012, United States officials allowed a New York Times reporter to briefly view portions of the video, probably those shown to Congress. The officials pointed to blips in the grainy night-vision video, which they said were indications that the occupants of the passenger boat had fired on the team on the canoe. The Times described these flashes as less clearly visible than the ferocious series of shots from the canoe carrying the agents. The still-secret video was not definitive in supporting the D.E.A.’s version of events, The Times reported, saying that the video “answers some questions while raising new ones” about the operation.

The video was released to the public through the Freedom of Information Act, with the law firm Jenner & Block taking on the case pro bono. A federal judge ordered the release of the video in January 2016, and the agency appealed. In June 2017, an appeals court ruled against the D.E.A., and the agency released the video.

The video opens on the outskirts of Ahuas, around 1 a.m. on May 11, 2012. A propeller plane touches down in a field and rolls to a stop. People gather around it and then carry dozens of blocky parcels to a nearby pickup truck. The parcels turned out to be more than 400 kilos of cocaine.

The cocaine is what brought the D.E.A. to Ahuas, as part of a program called Operation Anvil. The D.E.A. was working alongside the Honduran police and military to intercept drug shipments as they headed north.

In the video, the cocaine-filled pickup truck can be seen driving through the village to a landing on the twisting Patuca River. There the traffickers offload the drugs into a motorized canoe.

Four government helicopters appear and chaos erupts. The traffickers quickly abandon their task. One of them pushes the drug-laden canoe into the middle of the river and flees into the jungle with the others. Three members of the antidrug team — two Honduran police and one D.E.A. agent — ignore the men and pursue the canoe downstream.

The three men manage to climb on board. The D.E.A. agent, sitting in the back, begins to pilot it back toward the landing. But the motor stalls and the canoe starts to drift downstream. The D.E.A. agent can be seen vainly jerking the starter rope to try to restart the engine.

As he does this a second boat appears in the frame. It seems to be maneuvering directly toward the drifting canoe carrying the drugs. This second boat would turn out to be a water taxi, carrying a dozen passengers and cargo upriver to Ahuas.

The passengers and pilot on the civilian boat would later say they were terrified by the helicopters and did not intend to steer toward the canoe containing the law enforcement agents. For their part, the drug agents assumed the second boat was trying to recover the drugs.

It remains unclear why the civilian craft steered directly into the boat with the agents, but the boats collided.

The video clearly shows gunfire from the antidrug agents. As passengers leap into the water, the antidrug team continues to fire at them. An eight-second burst of machine gun fire comes from one of the helicopters. (The inspectors general report said a D.E.A. agent ordered a Honduran door gunner to fire.)

The footage cuts away for a moment, and the edges of the video are blocked by D.E.A. redactions, obscuring the surveillance plane’s altitude and other technical intelligence-gathering data the agency deemed sensitive.

While it is impossible to determine what is happening off camera, or underneath the blurred areas, any gunfire originating from the passenger boat — the evidence at the heart of the case that D.E.A. officials made to Congress — is strikingly difficult to discern.

In the end, four passengers were killed and three were injured.

In the months after the shooting, the D.E.A. struggled to produce evidence that someone on the passenger boat had been armed. No bullets had struck the helicopters, the agents or their canoe.

The Ahuas killings were among three fatal shooting cases that took place during Operation Anvil. The inspectors general found that the other two cases were also followed by inaccurate reports from the field. In one, they concluded, a Honduran police officer planted a gun on the dead body of an unarmed drug trafficker.

Carson Ulrich, who served as deputy for the FAST team missions at the time of the Ahuas shooting, stands by the D.E.A.’s assertions that the passenger boat was searching for the drugs and had fired on the antidrug team.

Mr. Ulrich argued that the now-disbanded FAST program was “desperately” needed to “bring the rule of law to an area governed by the cartels.” The government inspectors general investigators were biased, Mr. Ulrich contended. “They are slandering heroes. I dare anyone to pick up a rifle and do what these American agents did.”

When reached by phone, Hilda Lezama, who operated the passenger boat with her husband, said that she still suffered from “extreme pain” from bullet wounds in both of her legs, and is no longer able to work. “I can’t afford to support my daughters,” she said. “We still don’t know why this happened.”",D.E.A.

Ms. Baker is determined to at least consider some distant possibility of hope.","While Ms. Baker’s songs are exquisitely somber, the singer was cheerful and voluble across a cafe table. “It feels like the frayed wire of my brain is trying to pursue five different topics at once,” she said. “It’s probably because I had three cups of coffee this morning.”

We met at Cafe Coco, a 24-hour place a few steps away from a long-running Nashville club, the Exit/In. With no makeup, wearing a gray T-shirt and black pants short enough to reveal a tattoo — “Out into the ether” — above one ankle, Ms. Baker could have been an undergraduate between classes. A laminated pass hung from her belt for concerts organized by Smith7, a Memphis label that also puts on drug- and alcohol-free shows for teenagers. It signed the post-punk band that Ms. Baker formed when she was 14, initially named the Star Killers and currently Forrister.

Coffee and chewing gum are the only habits Ms. Baker allows herself after a stretch of addictive behavior with cigarettes, alcohol and drugs in her teens — experiences that figure in the songs on both of her albums. For the interview, she ordered her fourth coffee of the day: organic, iced, with almond milk.

When Ms. Baker initially released the songs from “Sprained Ankle” online in 2014, she was a student at Middle Tennessee State University, writing music she only expected a few friends to hear. The recordings, made in three days, were stark solo tracks with a handful of overdubs; they often used only a few picked guitar notes tolling behind her voice, as she sang troubled, at times suicidal thoughts. But the independent label 6131 discovered the songs, signed her and issued the album, in mastered form, in October 2015. By the end of the year, Ms. Baker had reached listeners nationwide. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times chose “Sprained Ankle” as one of the best albums of 2015.

“Sprained Ankle,” was a measured cry in the wilderness, a distillation of solitary despair. Just two years later, “Turn Out the Lights” is the work of a songwriter who has resonated with an international audience and who is moving beyond the apocalyptic self-absorption of adolescence. It’s the rare second album that, despite new self-consciousness, stretches beyond an unspoiled debut to reach for even bigger things, with all its passion intact.

“Once we finished recording it, in January, there was a lot of anxiety for me,” Ms. Baker said. “Is it too similar? Is it too different? How can you be afraid of both of those things at the same time?” She laughed. “But I somehow was.”

Her newer songs continue to practice what Ms. Baker calls “radical vulnerability.” But where “Sprained Ankle” was entirely focused on the singer’s inner turmoil, “Turn Out the Lights” has a wider perspective. Ms. Baker is determined to at least consider some distant possibility of hope. “I know that it’s not gonna turn out all right/but I have to believe that it is,” she sings in “Appointments.” And through much of the album, her lyrics recognize other characters enough to engage them in arguments and pleas: “You’re everything I want and I’m all you dread,” Ms. Baker sings in “Sour Breath.”

“To realize that you’re not the most important thing, that you’re not even close to the most important thing, is really comforting,” Ms. Baker said. Touring constantly with the songs from “Sprained Ankle” made her analyze them anew. “I thought not only, ‘Do I want to keep writing songs like this?’, but ‘Do I want to keep living my life primarily concerned with my hurt and attached to it?.’ A lot of people that I know, I think we’re attached to the safety of our hurt. And it’s dangerous and vulnerable to hope because there’s the risk that we’ll get disappointed.”

The album also has an expanded musical palette, enriched but not cluttered. Ms. Baker produced it herself at Ardent Studios, a Memphis institution, in six 12-hour days: time enough to weave in more of her own piano, guitar, organ and voice. Half of the songs also have atmospheric string parts from Camille Faulkner, who will be touring with Ms. Baker in the United States.

On Friday, Ms. Baker marks the release of “Turn Out the Lights” with a concert at Town Hall, the elegant 1,500-seat theater in midtown Manhattan. It’s orders of magnitude larger than her New York City debut in August 2015 for “about 20 people” at the now-defunct Cake Shop. “Fun fact,” she offered. “I usually don’t know the capacities of the venues, because I’ve asked not to know, because it freaks me out. Sometimes I hear how many people are going to be at a show and I think, ‘Oh my gosh, I can’t play to that many people!’ But it gets easier every time.”",Julien Baker Bravely Confronts Her Traumas and Fears,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/arts/music/julien-baker-turn-out-the-lights.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

In Australia, the government is vexed by what it sees as Beijing’s interference in domestic politics. In Europe, politicians are raising an alarm over heavy-handed trade tactics aimed at acquiring foreign technology. In Southeast Asia and Africa, there are complaints about a new era of Chinese colonialism.

China’s ties with two regional heavyweights — Japan and India — remain strained, and Mr. Xi faces an unusually precarious situation on the Korean Peninsula, with both the North and the South defying him, one building a nuclear arsenal and the other deploying American missile defenses.

Still, in a marathon opening speech last week, Mr. Xi showed no sign of retreat and hinted at even bigger spending to vault China to world greatness: more for the military to make it a first-class fighting outfit with global reach, and more for his overseas infrastructure program, the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, which he sees as a way to win friends around the world.

Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China’s economic reforms that started in the late 1970s, set a policy of keeping a low profile in international affairs and biding time. But more than his predecessors, Mr. Xi is abandoning that approach — and encountering pushback.

In Germany, a sharp increase in Chinese investment has prompted complaints that China is closing its markets even as it goes on a buying spree abroad, especially of valuable technology companies. Policy makers are considering options for retaliating.

There are also concerns that China is trying to divide the European Union by cultivating poorer countries like Hungary and Greece and using them to block policies supported by richer countries that hurt Beijing.

Rising powers always face resistance. But in China’s case, that pushback comes not just from the West but also from neighbors who remember the tributary system of its imperial past — or are wary of its Communist political system despite its embrace of capitalism decades ago.

Mr. Xi has made inroads in Southeast Asia, gaining influence in Myanmar, Malaysia and Thailand. But improving ties with Myanmar’s civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, have been offset by the deep popular mistrust of China in that country.

In Malaysia, Beijing’s investments in infrastructure have been met with accusations that the nation is selling off its sovereignty. And in Thailand, a rail project important to a new trade route from southern China has been delayed by haggling over costs.

In Vietnam, China’s efforts to take advantage of Mr. Trump’s neglect have fallen short, said Prof. Alexander L. Vuving of the Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu. “Xi’s pressure in the midst of a weakening U.S. commitment has forced some concessions but it has also deepened Hanoi’s mistrust of Beijing,” Professor Vuving said.

Even in the Philippines, where the strongman president Rodrigo Duterte has cozied up to Beijing and distanced himself from the United States, Mr. Xi has not enjoyed a complete victory. American drones and spy planes have been more decisive in Mr. Duterte’s battle against Islamic militants than the rifles donated by China.

“The quantities of arms sent are not significant compared to the amount needed by the armed forces and the police,” said Roilo Golez, a former congressman. “Five thousand rifles are very minimal and token.”

Mr. Xi has sometimes succeeded in positioning China as a responsible power by stepping up when Washington has stepped back — speaking up for globalization at Davos, or in favor of the Paris climate change accord.

“People are paying far more attention to China’s influence operations than I have seen before,” said Dan Blumenthal, director of Asian studies at the American Enterprise Institute.

But Beijing has also struggled to sway global opinion without resorting to heavy-handed methods or threats that can be counterproductive.

In Australia, which China has sought to use as a kind of pilot zone to test methods that could be adopted in the United States and Europe, Mr. Xi has already encountered a backlash.

China has encouraged Chinese businessmen to give to political campaigns, recruited Chinese students to press its policies in classrooms and mobilized local Chinese-language news media.

In a thinly disguised warning this month, Australia’s intelligence chief, Duncan Lewis, described such activities as “a threat to our sovereignty, the integrity of our national institutions and the exercise of our citizens’ rights.”

Analysts say Australia has been a tempting target because China is its biggest trading partner, and it is home to large populations of Chinese immigrants and students, who provide critical financial support to its universities.

But the government is now considering new limits on campaign contributions, restrictions on foreign investments and tougher counterintelligence laws. Australia is also seeking to strengthen security ties with India and Japan.

“The Chinese party-state has overplayed its hand in trying to influence Australia’s choices,” said Rory Medcalf, head of the national security college at the Australian National University.

Concern about political interference by China is also growing in New Zealand, where a Chinese official recently advised Chinese-language journalists to coordinate coverage with China’s official press.

“I never imagined the level of instruction was that direct,” said Anne-Marie Brady, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, who recently published a research paper on Beijing’s efforts in New Zealand.

Vicki Eastus, a puzzle solver in Brooklyn, put it this way: “The more hectic life is, the more calming I find filling in those little boxes.”

Search the internet for research on the impact of puzzle-solving on the brain, and you’ll find plenty of studies. But the results are mixed, and it’s not clear whether puzzle solving has any purely physiological benefits.

The psychological benefits, though, are not in question.

“When you do a puzzle, the mind becomes completely absorbed in the task at hand,” said Joanne Cohen-Katz, a psychologist in Allentown, Pa. “There is total focus on what is happening in the moment, which is the definition of mindfulness. And we know that mindfulness results in all sorts of positive changes in the brain.”

For one, solving a crossword can be a path to serenity in a world of uncertainty.

“I don’t think I have to sell you on the increased demand for this type of pastime in an increasingly worried world,” wrote Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times, in a memo to Lester Markel, the Sunday editor, after the Pearl Harbor attack. “You can’t think of your troubles while solving a crossword.”

In recent interviews, New York Times crossword enthusiasts shared their emotional connections to the pastime and described the value they find in the exercise.

Harry Hassell, of Jackson Heights, Queens, remembered his mother working on crosswords. “Amid the chaos of the household, it allowed her a personal pleasure and a routine all her own,” he said. “It also allowed me to see her not just as a car-pooling, tennis-playing mother, but also as a clever, intelligent, word-loving woman.”

Such intergenerational connections, forged over black-and-white grids, can have long-term implications.

“I first started doing crosswords as a child while visiting my Grandma Pat,” said Neil Padrick Wilson, a claims analyst in Tacoma, Wash. “She would sit at the big dining room table, dipping toast in her coffee. I would dip toast in my hot chocolate and we would work through a puzzle together. It got me to think, it got me to learn and it got me to know her better.”

Puzzles became so important to Mr. Wilson that he began to create them, and a crossword he made recently ran in The Times.

While not all enthusiasts go on to construct puzzles, it’s not uncommon for an early habit to persist.

“Rituals are often key in bonding with others, particularly family rituals,” said Ray Bepko, a clinical psychologist in Clinton, N.Y. “Pastimes and hobbies are very much a part of this and impact our adult relationships.”

That seems to be at least one reason people continue or develop a solving habit in adulthood, Dr. Bepko said. “Accessing this deep emotional connection is a source of comfort and reassurance anytime, particularly in difficult moments.”

Of course, puzzles are games, and they’re meant to be fun — especially in the addictive “aha!” moments that many solvers describe.

This mathematical idea dates back to the 1950s, but it remained on the fringes of academia and industry until about five years ago.

Neural networks now help recognize faces in photos posted to Facebook, identify commands spoken into living-room digital assistants like the Amazon Echo and instantly translate foreign languages on Microsoft’s Skype phone service.

Using the same mathematical techniques, researchers are improving self-driving cars and developing hospital services that can identify illness and disease in medical scans, digital assistants that can not only recognize spoken words but understand them, automated stock-trading systems and robots that pick up objects they’ve never seen before.

With so few A.I. specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia. In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.

Uber hired 40 people from Carnegie Mellon’s groundbreaking A.I. program in 2015 to work on its self-driving-car project. Over the last several years, four of the best-known A.I. researchers in academia have left or taken leave from their professorships at Stanford University. At the University of Washington, six of 20 artificial intelligence professors are now on leave or partial leave and working for outside companies.

“There is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry,” said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

Some professors are finding a way to compromise. Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records). Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.

“There are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia,” Mr. Zettlemoyer said. “The salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.”

To bring in new A.I. engineers, companies like Google and Facebook are running classes that aim to teach “deep learning” and related techniques to existing employees. And nonprofits like Fast.ai and companies like Deeplearning.ai, founded by a former Stanford professor who helped create the Google Brain lab, offer online courses.

The basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math. But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call “a dark art.” Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.

In order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places. Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills. Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.

“I can’t compete with Google, and I don’t want to,” said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries. “So I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.”

But the industry’s giants are doing much the same. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have opened A.I. labs in Toronto and Montreal, where much of this research outside the United States is being done. Google also is hiring in China, where Microsoft has long had a strong presence.

Not surprisingly, many think the talent shortage won’t be alleviated for years.

“Of course demand outweighs supply.

Miranda: How do you clear your desk and write the next thing?

Sondheim: Well, I collaborate with people. My spark often comes from collaborators. You know, I go to John Weidman1 and say, “Let’s write something else, you got any ideas?” Whatever it is. I mean, I’m a collaborative animal.

Miranda: I’m the same way, except my collaborator is Tommy Kail2.

Sondheim: I need the spur. And the spur and the boost comes from somebody else, generally. Rarely, only in the case of “Sweeney”3 did I come across something myself and think, “Oooh.” Oh, no, and “Passion.”4 Those are the two.

Miranda: And “Sweeney” was the one where you were working from the original text and said, “I need a book writer,” right?

Sondheim: Yeah. I’d been working from a little Samuel French-type version.5 I was up to Page 8 in Bond’s script, which is, I guess, the marketplace scene,6 and already it was an hour and a half long. I thought, “This is not going to work because I don’t know how to cut, really.” I mean I do, but I don’t. That’s why I got Hugh Wheeler,7 because he was born in England, he was the son of a bankruptcy judge. So he knew something about class structure. And I’d had a good time with him on “[A Little] Night Music.” Also, he’d been a mystery writer, you know. He was one of the most prolific mystery writers in America. He wrote (and co-wrote) under a pseudonym, Patrick Quentin.

Miranda: My favorite thing is bringing the song into the room to my collaborators. That’s my favorite part of the process. Not the writing of it, not even it being done. It’s the moment when I know my collaborators are going to make it better.

Sondheim: That’s my least favorite part of collaboration. Unless I really like what I’ve written.

Miranda: Oh?

Sondheim: Then I want to share it with a collaborator. But no, I don’t get that excitement that you get out of it, presenting it to collaborators. First of all, I only really do it with a book writer. I don’t with a director. I just don’t want to call in a director till it’s ready to present, and that means me and my collaborator. But you know, Lapine8 was the first one who actually made me give him unfinished songs. I never give unfinished songs.

Miranda: Did you find that valuable?

Sondheim: No, not particularly, but it was valuable to him.

Miranda: Well, it’s like being naked.

Sondheim: Exactly, and I don’t really mind that as long as I wash myself.

Miranda: You’re gonna show up naked sometimes.

Sondheim: You’ve got to have somebody who’ll surprise you and, you know, it’s the old lesson, you’ve got to work on something dangerous. You have to work on something that makes you uncertain. Something that makes you doubt yourself.

Miranda: Talk a bit about that danger and uncertainty.

Sondheim: Well, because it stimulates you to do things you haven’t done before. The whole thing is if you know where you’re going, you’ve gone, as the poet says. And that’s death. That leads to stultified writing and stultified shows.

Miranda: Since “Hamilton,” I have been pitched every historical era.

Sondheim: Of course! And so that’s the one thing you don’t want to do. After “Gypsy” I got nothing but backstage stories and I said, “The only thing I don’t want to write is anything to do with show business.” That’s the only thing.

SONDHEIM HAS CERTAINLY followed his own advice in this regard: His choice of subject matter over the last half-century of work demolishes any notions of the kinds of stories musical theater can tell. From a violent barber (“Sweeney Todd” with Hugh Wheeler) to ancient Roman farce (1962’s “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,” with librettists Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart) to fractured fairy tales (“Into the Woods” with James Lapine). Within this vast terrain, he and his collaborators have also radically experimented with the musical theater form: See the diptych structure of “Sunday in the Park With George,” also with Lapine, in which each act takes place a century apart, or the unprecedented “Company” (1970), with a book by George Furth, a meditation on commitment and monogamy, which Sondheim describes as a “non-plot” musical.” Here he is, arriving at the form of “Follies,” his legendary 1971 musical with librettist James Goldman about a reunion of retired performers from a 1930s Ziegfeldesque revue: “You start with the subject matter and some content and it takes form. If you’re going to say, ‘O.K., it’s a reunion party,’ well, hello, don’t try to give it a plot. And if you don’t give it a plot, what’s going to hold it together? Uh-oh. That’s what’s dangerous and that’s what’s scary about it.”

We gravitate toward the subject of surprise, both for the audience and for the playwright.

Sondheim: That was a big lesson from Peter Shaffer.9 We went to see a play once about the mad queen of Spain and in the first act there were two rapes, an evisceration, a fire and something horrifying with a child, I don’t remember. And at the end of the first act I said, “This is so much my kind of thing. Why am I bored?” He said, “There’s no surprise.” And I thought, “Put that on your bathroom mirror.” Surprise: if it’s in the lyric, the unexpected word, the unexpected note, the unexpected incident. The unexpected, the unexpected, that’s what theater is about. If you had to patent one thing in the theater, it’s surprise.

Miranda: Can you think of any times you’ve surprised yourself in the writing process?

Sondheim: Oh, come on, as a writer you’re always surprised when you think of the right note or the right word. You think, “Oh, I didn’t know I could — oh, that’s good!” You know, writing’s full of surprises for oneself. It comes with the territory, but this is a different kind of thing. This is surprising the audience —

Sondheim bats the question away. He’s either uninterested in recounting a specific time that he surprised himself while writing, or there have been so many that it’s impossible to pick: It comes with the territory.

Video

Two years ago, I interviewed Sondheim and John Weidman together for a PBS documentary, but my favorite moment from the interview never aired. We were on the subject of “Finishing the Hat” from “Sunday in the Park With George,” one of Sondheim’s most celebrated songs, and maybe the greatest song ever written about the self-induced spell of the creative process.10 In this excerpt from that interview, just as in his work, Sondheim’s collaborator brought out the best in him:

Weidman: Do you remember you called me the night you finished that song?

Sondheim (smiling): Was I excited?

Weidman: You were ... beyond excited. I mean, it’s like you needed to call somebody. I may have been number 17 on the list, but I could hear it in your voice, you said, “I just wrote this song.”

Sondheim: Yeah, I remember, I wanted to tell everybody. [Laughs.] I wanted to tell everybody. I was really pleased.

Miranda: I love the story you told about the making of it in your book, about being inspired by a party game you were creating for Phyllis Newman’s party,11 and realizing you’d spent the entire night in a sort of trance —

Sondheim: I started planning that game at 8 o’clock in the evening, and when I looked up, it was 7 o’clock in the morning. I’m exaggerating, but not by much. Time had disappeared. That’s what happens — you must know that yourself. You must know that the great thing about writing and creating is, time disappears. You are in the moment, and the moment can go for eight hours or for two minutes, or whatever, until the phone rings, or you know, you have to go get something to eat.

PRESENT DAY again — I’m trying to give Sondheim credit for expanding the scope of the American musical, and he is passing on the credit to his mentor Oscar Hammerstein instead.

Miranda: Something that’s so essential about your work is that I think you have expanded the terrain of what musical theater can be. The notion of, “This is a musical, that’s not a musical,” is BS. It’s carried entirely by the passion of the creators.

Sondheim: Yeah, but Oscar invented that with “Oklahoma!” He took a play that was about homosexuality in the West and turned it into a sunny musical. Because he saw something in it that was beyond what Lynn Riggs12 had written, about the opening of territories, the promise of America. He saw that which anybody else reading that play would not have seen.

Miranda: O.K. But it gets back to the notion of, “If I can find myself in the work, others will see themselves.” So it’s about not being afraid of specificity.

Sondheim lights up.

Photo

Sondheim: Absolutely! That’s exactly what he taught me, when he criticized my poetic Hammerstein lyrics when I was starting out.13 He said, “That’s not what you feel. Don’t write what I feel. Write what you feel.” Oh! It had never occurred to me to write what I felt. And Oscar was the one who taught everyone to do that.

Write what you feel. Or as George’s muse, Dot, says to him in “Sunday,” “Anything you do,/Let it come from you./Then it will be new.”

And then for a moment you let in the depth and intensity and range of Stephen Sondheim’s feeling for the past half-century. That Tony and Maria of “West Side Story” first fell in love as Sondheim sharpened his Blackwing pencils, finding the words for their doomed romance at age 25. That Mrs. Lovett of “Sweeney Todd” hatched her diabolical plans from this writing couch as Sondheim talked to himself. That within Sondheim, somewhere, is both Georges Seurat and Fosca, Pseudolus and Mama Rose, John Wilkes Booth and Madame Armfeldt, Charley Kringas and Little Red Riding Hood. He has served up vodka stingers for Joanne (“Company”) and chrysanthemum tea for the Shogun (“Pacific Overtures”). Sixty years of iconic theatrical moments, and they exist as a result of the specific way Stephen Sondheim feels. Line by line, note by note, surprise by surprise.

And if you’re Sondheim, there are days like today, when you feel under the weather and the day is full of distractions. But there are also nights when you write “Finishing the Hat,” and you’re so proud of what you’ve made that you have to call a friend and say, “I just wrote this song.”

What’s important is that Sondheim is still here, staring down another deadline. Starting on a hat. Feeling his way toward the moment when time disappears.

Sondheim: You shouldn’t feel safe. You should feel, “I don’t know if I can write this.” That’s what I mean by dangerous, and I think that’s a good thing to do. Sacrifice something safe.

Spit-grilled chicken (pollo a la brasa) is popular all over Latin America. But it’s the Peruvian version that’s best known here in the United States, buoyed by the many restaurants that serve the bird in all its burnished, garlic-scented, drippings-slicked glory. Usually, they serve a spicy, creamy cilantro sauce alongside that is the perfect complement — and delicious in its own right.

Peruvian chicken is worth learning to make at home because few things beat the crackling skin of a home-roasted chicken, especially when it’s been marinated in garlic, chiles and plenty of spices.

To mimic the juiciness and char of a grill, in this version the chicken is split down the middle before roasting at high heat. You can ask your butcher to do this or go at it yourself with a pair of sturdy kitchen shears; it’s not at all hard. Or substitute a cut-up bird, removing the breasts from the oven a few minutes before the legs and thighs so the white meat doesn’t dry out.

Photo

Before roasting, you’ll need to marinate the chicken.

Even in Peru, the precise ingredients of the marinade are flexible, varying from region to region, cook to cook. In the mountainous parts of the country, pollo a la brasa is often a highly spiced bird imbued with garlic, chiles, cumin, paprika and either dark beer or soy sauce (an ingredient adopted from the country’s large Asian-Peruvian population). In Lima, you might see chickens seasoned more simply, with just a sprinkling of salt, to round out the smokiness of the grill.

Peruvian-style chickens in the United States tend to follow the more assertively flavored route. In this recipe, a full six cloves of garlic ensure its pungent dominance, while chile pastes from both aji amarillo and aji panca chiles lend plenty of complex heat. If you can’t find the Peruvian chile pastes (which are available at Latin American groceries and online), don’t fret. As long as you add some kind of chile paste or sauce for heat and brightness, this dish will maintain its vibrant balance. Even sriracha or sambal will work in a pinch.

Photo

While the chicken roasts, whip up the spicy cilantro sauce to serve alongside. Like the marinade, there are dozens of versions of this creamy, rich mix. Some recipes call for peanuts to give the sauce body and heft, others rely on mayo. This one uses feta cheese for a salty bite. Then slather it liberally over the bird, because the combination of spiced, crispy chicken skin and the creamy herb sauce is magical — particularly when it’s been made by you.

The middens around Damariscotta are the largest examples north of South Carolina, said Arthur Spiess, senior archaeologist with the Maine Historic Preservation Commission.

From about 2,200 to 800 years ago, Native Americans visited this site in late winter and spring. The inhabitants discarded the shells in heaps that grew year after year, century after century.

“They were eating oysters like crazy and catching alewives,” Dr. Spiess said, referring to a type of herring.

Photo

In later centuries, European settlers viewed the middens as a resource. One company burned the oyster shells for lime; another smashed them for chicken feed.

As the shells were unearthed, however, archaeologists found ceramics, bones and stone tools, and the remains of animals on which the tribes feasted. (Many of the artifacts went to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University.)

This and other middens have revealed much of what is known about Native Americans in Maine over the past 4,000 years. The best-studied site, Turner Farm, on North Haven Island in Penobscot Bay, has yielded artifacts more than 5,000 years old.

The inhabitants ate shellfish, of course, mostly soft-shell clams. But they also had a taste for deer, bear, moose, porpoise and seal; cod, sturgeon and swordfish; and even extinct species like sea mink and the flightless great auk.

Donald Soctomah, the historic preservation officer for the two Passamaquoddy tribes in eastern Maine, said middens tell important stories.

“To the Passamaquoddy, the shell middens are a link to the past, and give us an idea of how life was at a certain time and what people consumed,” Dr. Soctomah said in a phone interview. “To us, any information about our past is very important, because we didn’t have a written record.”

In an effort to more rapidly assess middens, Dr. Kelley has developed protocols to survey them using ground-penetrating radar. She thinks of the surveys as a sort of triage, a way of determining which sites are at greatest risk of erosion and which are best to study. With funding from Maine Sea Grant, she has surveyed six middens so far.

“If you want to know what was in the western Gulf of Maine 3,000 years ago, this is how you’re going to figure that out,” Dr. Kelley said.

To survey a site, Dr. Kelley and graduate student Jacque Miller pushed a wheeled radar unit about the size of a jogging stroller across the area, and followed a grid pattern at a walking pace. This allowed them to map a midden without excavating in just two or three days (longer for forested or brushy sites).

The radar not only shows the extent and thickness of the middens, but also reveals the detailed layering, including what may have been floors in historic settlements.

Ms. Miller said in addition to the cultural information buried in the middens, the shells are also a record of ancient climate. Researchers can analyze them to determine historic water temperatures and salinity in the Gulf of Maine.

Still, she said, the middens do not get much attention. “A lot of people just don’t know these things exist,” said Ms. Miller. “It’s just not a focus.”

During the radar surveys, Dr. Kelley’s team had some unpleasant surprises. In one case, they arranged permission to survey a southern Maine midden that had been recorded 49 years ago. When the crew arrived with their equipment, they found it had vanished into the sea.

At the conference, Tom Dawson and Joanna Hambly of the University of St. Andrews described the Shorewatch program, which enlists citizens to monitor archaeological sites in Scotland that are threatened by coastal erosion.

Florida has developed a similar network, called Heritage Monitoring Scouts. Dr. Kelley hopes to develop such a program in Maine.

Dr. Soctomah said he keeps an eye on middens in eastern Maine. “We try to do a walk-by after a bad storm, when you are going to see a site getting more damage,” he said.

“It’s bad because they are disappearing so fast, and the knowledge that is within those middens will be washed out to sea.”",Native American Secrets Lie Buried in Huge Shell Mounds,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/science/native-americans-shell-middens-maine.html

Mr. Lorenzana’s announcement came 154 days after militants led by Isnilon Hapilon, whose Abu Sayyaf group is affiliated with the Islamic State, sacked the southern city of 200,000, burning homes, killing Christians and prompting most residents to flee.

The fighting was set off on May 23, when the Philippine military moved to arrest Mr. Hapilon and was surprised by a huge rebel force that had stockpiled large numbers of weapons.

Since then, much of the city has been devastated as the military, with intelligence support from the United States and Australia, fought to reclaim it. At least 1,000 people have been killed, most of them militants.

President Rodrigo Duterte said last week that Marawi had been “liberated,” though officials later clarified that there were still fighters in the city. Mr. Hapilon was killed last week, as were the last of the Maute brothers, who led a militant group allied with Mr. Hapilon’s, and Mahmud Ahmad, a Malaysian who the authorities described as a key financier for the militants and a link to the Islamic State in Syria.

Mr. Lorenzana said the military had crushed the “most serious attempt to export violent extremism and radicalism” to the southern Philippines.

“While we submit that these tactical and strategic gains will not annihilate the ideology completely, we declare that this achievement is a clear manifestation of how our regional cooperation can lead to a decisive advance against the proliferation of terrorism in this part of the world,” he said.","As Mattis Arrives in Philippines, Mop-Up in Marawi Is Declared Over",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/world/asia/philippines-mattis-marawi-isis.html

The model Cameron Russell solicited and began posting anonymous stories from fellow models of their own experiences on her Instagram account, along with the hashtag #MyJobShouldNotIncludeAbuse. Her account is now filled with wrenching stories from both women and men in the industry.

Trish Goff, a former top model, discussing her experiences with Mr. Weinstein, told The New York Times, “The horrible thing is, as a model, it wasn’t that unusual to be in a weird situation where a photographer or someone feels they have a right to your body.”

The issue was first brought to Ms. Rozic’s attention a few months ago by Sara Ziff, a former model and the founder of the Model Alliance, a research and policy organization established in 2012. Ms. Ziff had been doing a project with the legal clinic at Fordham Law School on the working conditions of models, and, said Elizabeth B. Cooper, an associate professor there, when it came to sexual harassment, “we were all mortified by what we found, and surprised by the limited scope of the current law.”

“I’ve experienced sexual harassment in the workplace; we all know someone who has experienced sexual harassment in the workplace,” said Ms. Rozic, who, when she was elected in 2012, was the youngest woman in the state legislature.

Ms. Ziff, who began modeling when she was 14, remembered “being made to sit on the lap of my booker, who was a man; being sent to castings and told to go into a room alone with a photographer who then asked me to take off all my clothes; going to shoots and being routinely asked to go topless with no warning — all this behavior that in any other industry would be recognized as inappropriate, but in fashion is treated as no big deal.”

Karen Elson, a top model and singer who is on the advisory board of the Model Alliance, said the biggest threat for her was when she was a teenager working in cities like Milan and Paris. “I was repeatedly followed, sexually harassed and intimidated,” she said. “A model scout who worked at my old agency in Paris tried to coerce me into having sex with him and his friend at a nightclub in Paris when I was barely 16. I sensed the danger and ran out. Then, the next day, I told my agent and the scout threatened to have me kicked out of Paris.”

On one of Ms. Elson’s shoots, for a “major U.S. retailer,” she said the photographer was standing over her and “got out his penis and asked if ‘I wanted it.’” She then told her agent. “I know he complained to the client, but nothing happened,” she said. “I turned 18 and became successful and I was lucky to have great agents who were very protective of me, but that’s not always the case for a lot of models.”

Now, when she is on a job, “I insist that the set be cleared and at least one woman stays on set,” Ms. Elson said. “I can demand this because I have respect in the industry, but it should be the norm.”

Though Ms. Cooper did acknowledge that under the current law it was possible for a model to go to the police or district attorney with an abuse complaint, she said in practice that making a complaint was unlikely given the characteristics of many models, which can include their very young age, a lack of language fluency, or lack of support system.

Fashion has grappled with this issue before, most recently in 2014, when the photographer Terry Richardson was accused of sexual harassment by a number of models — though his behavior had been public knowledge since 2009. That year, a documentary directed by Ms. Ziff and Ole Schell, “Picture Me,” contained an allegation from a model named Sena Cech, who said on camera that Mr. Richardson and his assistant had asked her during a casting call to strip, “do something a little sexy,” and then touch his penis.

Though some prominent magazines such as Vogue pledged not to use him after women began to describe their experiences working with him, by 2015 he was again shooting covers, for Harper’s Bazaar and Rolling Stone.

“There has been a sense that simply speaking out is enough,” Ms. Ziff said. “It’s an important first step, but it does not solve the problem. If there aren’t basic legal protections in place, than real change does not occur.”

The bill would amend the current law to explicitly include models, explicitly forbid sexual advances and commentary or other forms of discrimination linked to their employment, and would require clients to provide models upon booking with a contact and avenue for filing any complaints. It would attempt, in effect, to create a human resources department in an industry that has had none.

“For me, personally, it would have held a lot more people accountable for their actions sooner,” said Ms. Elson.

Ms. Rozic is hopeful that a groundswell of public support will ensure that both legislature houses pass the bill by June, so it can be signed into law by the end of 2018.

Ms. Mayfield said the den leader’s response might have been fueled by her decision to post the videos of the senator’s interaction with the scouts online, where they were picked up by the local news media.

She also said she was told the den leader had been upset by other references in Ames’s long question, such as pointing out that the senator was a Republican and that gun ownership was considered a right while health care was seen as a privilege.

On Friday, in response to questions about why Ames was removed from the den, the Boy Scouts of America said only that Ames was now in another unit.

“The Boy Scouts of America and the Denver Area Council are pleased that the family will continue their participation in Scouting,” the statement said.

“We are committed to working with families to find local units that best fit their needs,” it said.

But the meeting and its backlash sent ripples through the organization and the community. The local Boy Scouts group in Broomfield distanced itself in a short statement at the top of its website.

“Our Troop was NOT involved in the Mayfield incident,” it said. “As part of the Boy Scouts of America and the World Scouting Organization, we are an inclusive group regardless of politics, religion, gender and race.”

The incident was also covered extensively by news outlets in Colorado, partly because, in addition to gun control, Ames had asked Ms. Marble about remarks she made in 2013 about the causes of health issues among black people.

“I was astonished that you blamed black people for poor health and poverty because of all the chicken and barbecue they eat,” Ames said.

“I didn’t,” Ms. Marble responded. “That was made up by the media. So, you want to believe it? You believe it. But that’s not how it went down. I didn’t do that. That was false. Get both sides of the story.”

Ms. Marble then offered context for the remarks, which were made at a poverty-reduction meeting with other legislators in 2013. She also told Ames she had a multicultural family, of which she was “proud.”

After the Cub Scout event, local news outlets reported on the gun question but also resurfaced Ms. Marble’s remarks from 2013 and the controversy they posed at the time. Among the objections were those of an African-American state legislator, Representative Rhonda Fields.

“When you look at life expectancy, there are problems in the black race,” Ms. Marble said in 2013. “Sickle-cell anemia is something that comes up. Diabetes is something that’s prevalent in the genetic makeup, and you just can’t help it.

“Although I’ve got to say, I’ve never had better barbecue and better chicken and ate better in my life than when you go down South and you, I mean, I love it,” she said.

“I will not tolerate that,” Ms. Fields, a Democrat, said in response in 2013, according to The Denver Post. “This is not what this committee is all about.” She added, “What we are trying to do is come up with meaningful solutions. This is not about eating chicken.”

Last week The Post published separate editorials about Ms. Marble’s comments and Ames’s dismissal. In one, it said Ms. Marble should have seen the event and Ames’s questions as an educational opportunity. “We’re sad to see her trying to lie them away now,” it said.

Ms. Mayfield said she had chosen a new pack for Ames, who is set to become a Boy Scout in February. She said Ames had felt let down by the den leader’s decision because he thought they shared a close relationship.

He described plants that would make more flowers, stems and seeds when their main stems were cut off or eaten.

At the time, being eaten was believed to be bad for plants — always. It took a decade’s worth of seeing the contrary for other biologists to believe it.

Dr. Paige started looking for a molecular mechanism behind overcompensation in some versions of Arabidopsis. As he damaged their main stems, he started seeing indications that not only did they get bushier and produce more seeds, but they also ramped up their chemical defenses.

At one point in time, theory pitted regrowth, also known as tolerance, against defense: with limited energy, a plant had to pick one or the other.

But in the past decade, more researchers can’t find a trade-off, said Anurag Agrawal, an ecologist at Cornell University who studies plant-herbivore interactions and was not involved in the study.

Most plants respond to damage with a process called endoreduplication, in which a cell can copy its DNA over and over without splitting into two cells. This gives the plant bigger cells with multiple energy factories to accomplish a variety of tasks. Many damaged plants only show minimal levels of endoreduplication. But the overcompensators go into overdrive with the process.

In the case of the study’s mustard plants, they were able to grow bigger and also produce glucosinolate, the sulfurish, bitter chemical compound in mustard, kale, cabbage and horseradish.

And the new research finds that when it comes to building up tolerance or defenses, for at least some plants, you can’t have one without the other.

“What this paper shows is that, in practice, defense and regrowth actually go hand-in-hand because the genetics of defense and regrowth are similar,” Josh Banta a biologist at The University of Texas at Tyler, who was not involved in the study. “Like it or not, theory be darned.”

But even the baddest cowboys are not immortal, the researchers found. If they cut the main stem and 75 percent of its leaves, even overcompensators can’t rebound.

This tough guy tactic may be a special case, said Dr. Agrawal, but Mr. Mesa and Dr. Paige think it could be generalized to many other plants. Depending on much that turns out to be true, future research could one day help farmers grow super crops that made more food without having to use as many pesticides. But as the story often goes for basic genetic research on crops, results that could be applied are a ways off.","Meet the Overcompensators, Plants That Get Tougher and Meaner When Attacked",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/science/plants-defenses-overcompensators.html

“It is impossible that such efforts will not have any impact on enterprises,” Mr. Li said. “But in the long run, and from the macro perspective, the impact will be minimal.”

Pollution figures strongly into the broader debate over the cost of growth in China. Chinese officials are under pressure to keep the economy revving to provide good jobs for its young people and for rural residents moving into cities, among others. But stimulating growth has compounded China’s debt problems, added to its pollution woes and created other complications that Beijing must address.

If successful, the antipollution campaign could produce bluer skies and cleaner water across China, with potential health benefits for the country’s 1.3 billion people.

“For those areas that have suffered ecological damage, their leaders and cadres will be held responsible for life,” said Yang Weimin, the deputy director of the Communist Party’s Office of the Central Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs. “Our people will be able to see stars at night and hear birds chirp.”

But the effort could have a cost as well. Economists at Société Générale, a French bank, predicted in a recent research note that environmental restrictions could shave two-tenths of a percent off economic growth.

“Modestly slower growth will be a necessary sacrifice for maintaining social stability over the medium term,” it said.

Global prices for iron ore, a crucial material for making steel, have slumped in part on expectations that many Chinese steel mills will have to close temporarily this winter.

China is so important to the global economy that a campaign against pollution here could affect economies around the world, particularly iron ore exporters. Economists in Australia are already starting to become concerned.

Australia “is absolutely dependent on China — that’s true of iron ore prices, but it’s also true of Australia’s national income,” said Chris Richardson, the chief Australia economist for Deloitte, the global accounting firm.

Although China now leads the world in its installations of solar and wind power, it still relies on coal to generate three-quarters of its electricity. Electricity use by households is rising as more Chinese consumers buy air-conditioners and adopt the trappings of middle-class life.

Turning off electricity to residential customers to reduce pollution is politically unrealistic. That means steeper cuts may be necessary for industrial users.

Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the government-affiliated China Passenger Car Association, said in a telephone interview that the government had been inexorably tightening pollution standards. The country’s top priority has been shifting away from maximizing economic output and toward environmental protection, and companies must adapt, he said.

“Auto companies have adequate profits,” he said. “They can withstand it, but their production schedules may be affected.”

The pollution effort’s impact on global markets is uncertain, and on Monday Chinese officials said they may be overreacting.

Li Xinchuang, the deputy chairman of the government-affiliated China Steel Association, said Chinese production could continue undiminished if the industry simply closed excess, outdated steel foundries that pollute more.

Christine Loh, who was undersecretary for the environment for Hong Kong until last summer and worked closely with mainland officials, said that China had considerable potential for environmental cleanup without harming the economy.

“The new economy continues to thrive, while the old economy cleans up,” she wrote in an email. “So, the overall picture should not be seen too negatively.”

China’s track record on nationally mandated campaigns has been mixed. Told to maximize economic output, local officials have sometimes faked statistics, most recently in a few economically depressed areas of northeastern China.

President Xi Jinping endorsed the environmental effort in his work report last Wednesday at the start of the party congress. “Clear waters and lush mountains are as valuable as gold and silver,” he said.

Beyond maximizing economic output, Mr. Xi said that his country needed to address a new dilemma, and one that implies greater attention to environmental protection, “between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people’s ever-growing needs for a better life.”",China’s New Antipollution Push Could Cool Its Growth Engine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/business/china-pollution-economy.html

In a phone interview on Sunday, Ms. Kamin said that telling her story in a public forum made her feel strong and vulnerable at the same time. “It’s really amazing to be part of this community,” she said of the dozens of women who had shared similar stories. “I couldn’t be more happy that this is the outcome — that other women would also feel empowered.”

Mr. Toback did not respond to an email seeking comment. But he told The Los Angeles Times that he had not met any of the accusers, or that if he did, it “was for five minutes and have no recollection.”

The accusations against Mr. Besh and other employees at the Besh Restaurant Group paint a picture of a work environment in which women repeatedly dealt with unwanted physical contact, comments and come-ons. The Times-Picayune reported that 25 current and former employees said they had experienced sexual harassment from managers or co-workers, and two filed complaints with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

The Times-Picayune reported that one complaint, filed by a female employee who was not identified, said Mr. Besh tried to force her to “submit to his sexual overtures.”

Mr. Besh said in a statement that he had had a “consensual relationship with one member of my team.”

He added: “I alone am entirely responsible for my moral failings. This is not the way the head of a company like ours should have acted, let alone a husband and father. But it should not taint our incredible team of more than 1,000 employees, nor undermine our unyielding commitment to treating everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of gender, race, age and sexual preference.”

In a phone interview on Sunday, Madie Robison, who said she experienced harassment during her two years working for the restaurant group, said there was no human resources department during her time there. “I think a lot of this could have been avoided if we had a trusted person to talk to,” she said.

Raymond Landry, Besh Restaurant Group’s general counsel, said in an earlier statement that “while we’ve had a complaint procedure in place that complies with all existing laws, we now recognize that, as a practical matter, we needed to do more than what the law requires and we have revamped our training, education and procedures accordingly.”

On Sunday night, Harrah’s New Orleans casino released a statement saying it had ended its relationship with Besh Restaurant Group and would rename its Besh Steak restaurant.

Ms. Robison said she had been struck by how the allegations against Besh Restaurant Group employees mirrored similar stories of intimidation and harassment across a range of industries, from news media to technology to fashion. “You think you’re alone,” she said. “And you’re not.”",James Toback and John Besh Face Sexual Misconduct Allegations,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/us/james-toback-john-besh.html

The model Cameron Russell solicited and began posting anonymous stories from fellow models of their own experiences on her Instagram account, along with the hashtag #MyJobShouldNotIncludeAbuse. Her account is now filled with wrenching stories from both women and men in the industry.

Trish Goff, a former top model, discussing her experiences with Mr. Weinstein, told The New York Times, “The horrible thing is, as a model, it wasn’t that unusual to be in a weird situation where a photographer or someone feels they have a right to your body.”

The issue was first brought to Ms. Rozic’s attention a few months ago by Sara Ziff, a former model and the founder of the Model Alliance, a research and policy organization established in 2012. Ms. Ziff had been doing a project with the legal clinic at Fordham Law School on the working conditions of models, and, said Elizabeth B. Cooper, an associate professor there, when it came to sexual harassment, “we were all mortified by what we found, and surprised by the limited scope of the current law.”

“I’ve experienced sexual harassment in the workplace; we all know someone who has experienced sexual harassment in the workplace,” said Ms. Rozic, who, when she was elected in 2012, was the youngest woman in the state legislature.

Ms. Ziff, who began modeling when she was 14, remembered “being made to sit on the lap of my booker, who was a man; being sent to castings and told to go into a room alone with a photographer who then asked me to take off all my clothes; going to shoots and being routinely asked to go topless with no warning — all this behavior that in any other industry would be recognized as inappropriate, but in fashion is treated as no big deal.”

Karen Elson, a top model and singer who is on the advisory board of the Model Alliance, said the biggest threat for her was when she was a teenager working in cities like Milan and Paris. “I was repeatedly followed, sexually harassed and intimidated,” she said. “A model scout who worked at my old agency in Paris tried to coerce me into having sex with him and his friend at a nightclub in Paris when I was barely 16. I sensed the danger and ran out. Then, the next day, I told my agent and the scout threatened to have me kicked out of Paris.”

On one of Ms. Elson’s shoots, for a “major U.S. retailer,” she said the photographer was standing over her and “got out his penis and asked if ‘I wanted it.’” She then told her agent. “I know he complained to the client, but nothing happened,” she said. “I turned 18 and became successful and I was lucky to have great agents who were very protective of me, but that’s not always the case for a lot of models.”

Now, when she is on a job, “I insist that the set be cleared and at least one woman stays on set,” Ms. Elson said. “I can demand this because I have respect in the industry, but it should be the norm.”

Though Ms. Cooper did acknowledge that under the current law it was possible for a model to go to the police or district attorney with an abuse complaint, she said in practice that making a complaint was unlikely given the characteristics of many models, which can include their very young age, a lack of language fluency, or lack of support system.

Fashion has grappled with this issue before, most recently in 2014, when the photographer Terry Richardson was accused of sexual harassment by a number of models — though his behavior had been public knowledge since 2009. That year, a documentary directed by Ms. Ziff and Ole Schell, “Picture Me,” contained an allegation from a model named Sena Cech, who said on camera that Mr. Richardson and his assistant had asked her during a casting call to strip, “do something a little sexy,” and then touch his penis.

Though some prominent magazines such as Vogue pledged not to use him after women began to describe their experiences working with him, by 2015 he was again shooting covers, for Harper’s Bazaar and Rolling Stone.

“There has been a sense that simply speaking out is enough,” Ms. Ziff said. “It’s an important first step, but it does not solve the problem. If there aren’t basic legal protections in place, than real change does not occur.”

The bill would amend the current law to explicitly include models, explicitly forbid sexual advances and commentary or other forms of discrimination linked to their employment, and would require clients to provide models upon booking with a contact and avenue for filing any complaints. It would attempt, in effect, to create a human resources department in an industry that has had none.

“For me, personally, it would have held a lot more people accountable for their actions sooner,” said Ms. Elson.

Ms. Rozic is hopeful that a groundswell of public support will ensure that both legislature houses pass the bill by June, so it can be signed into law by the end of 2018.

I have had a decent career and I’ve got a good family here and a lot of friends. So I’m not sitting back sulking. But it would have been nice to see what could have happened.”

Hand is an accomplished coach in the English Premier Ice Hockey League and with the national program, but his most impressive achievements came during an unrivaled 34-season playing career.

Growing up in Edinburgh, Hand headed to the local skating rink when he was 7 for peace and closure after the death of his father from a heart attack. Playing alongside his brothers, he was eventually discovered by a local team, the Murrayfield Racers, with whom he made his professional debut at 14.

By 17, Hand led the British Hockey League with 116 assists in 50 games to go with 99 goals. He surpassed the 100-goal mark in each of the next four seasons.

Those early years were the statistical high point of a pro career spanning more than three decades during which Hand collected 2,992 assists and 4,634 points, both British hockey records. Wayne Gretzky, the player to whom Hand is most frequently compared in Britain, established N.H.L. records considered unmatchable with 1,963 assists and 2,857 points.

“The goalies were bad; that’s what it was,” Hand said modestly when asked about his British hockey exploits.

Whatever the reason for his remarkable point totals, it was enough to gain the attention of the Oilers, who had built one of the great dynasties in league history when they selected Hand with the final pick in the 1986 draft, making him the first British player drafted by an N.H.L. team. By then, Hand had earned a tryout with Calgary, Edmonton’s biggest rival.

“Our league had a deal with Calgary — they would invite the young player of the year in Britain to the camp in Calgary,” Hand said. “It was a token gesture. I don’t think they realized there was a possible opportunity that one of the players could make the team.”

But his rights were officially owned by the Oilers, who had won consecutive Stanley Cups in 1984 and 1985, so Hand reported to Edmonton training camp in 1986. On a club that would win three more Cups in the next four seasons, Hand made an impression despite facing long odds to make the team.

“There was absolutely no question when he came over for that first training camp that he had enough hockey skill,” said Bill Tuele, the Oilers’ former director of public relations. “He had never been pushed to any great limit. He was a neat kid. He was a bit overwhelmed by the whole process. To be thrown into that caldron was almost an impossible task.”

With few roster spots available, Hand was sent to the Victoria Cougars of the Western Hockey League. After collecting 8 points in three games, a homesick Hand returned to Edinburgh to finish the season with the Racers.

He was invited back to Oilers camp the next season and was one of Edmonton’s final cuts. But Hand again decided to head home rather than report to Edmonton’s top developmental team in the American Hockey League.

He would not receive another invitation to an N.H.L. camp, instead flourishing in Britain and becoming the only hockey player to receive the prestigious Member of the British Empire award from Queen Elizabeth II.

His 82 points with the national team made him the country’s career leading scorer. After 14 seasons serving in a dual role as a player and coach with a number of British teams, Hand retired as a player in 2015 at age 47. He served as head coach of the Manchester Phoenix of the English Premier Ice Hockey League until the club ceased operations in January.

Now consisting of 12 teams, the league is entering what local officials believe could be a new golden age for the sport in Britain, with former N.H.L. players joining the league.

“In Tony’s day, he was the best player in the U.K. by far,” said Andy French, the general secretary of Ice Hockey U.K., the national governing body for the sport. “He was better than a lot of the imports. He had a vision that nobody else had. He’s now passing that quality that he had down through to the younger generation of players. I’m hoping that we can produce another Tony Hand.”

For all the success he enjoyed at home, Hand still, three decades later, sometimes thinks about his decision to leave Edmonton.

“It wasn’t like I was unambitious,” he said. “I just didn’t know. I had never been away. Obviously when you’re young you make these decisions, and I had never had a father figure to sort of guide me. I don’t sit and regret it. But did I make the right decision? Probably not.”

Since ending his playing career, Hand has contributed as a scout and coach to the British national team, which in April won the 1B division of the world championships to earn promotion to Division 1A, one level below the top tier.

Hand’s hope is that Britain’s accomplishments in international hockey can help him find the kind of opportunity in the N.H.L. he never quite pursued in an otherwise illustrious hockey career.

“I think I’ve got a lot to offer teams,” Hand said. “I’ve got a lot of experience. I’ve got a lot of knowledge. I haven’t really put my name out anywhere.

By looking for patterns in millions of dog photos, for example, a neural network can learn to recognize a dog. This mathematical idea dates back to the 1950s, but it remained on the fringes of academia and industry until about five years ago.

Neural networks now help recognize faces in photos posted to Facebook, identify commands spoken into living-room digital assistants like the Amazon Echo and instantly translate foreign languages on Microsoft’s Skype phone service.

Using the same mathematical techniques, researchers are improving self-driving cars and developing hospital services that can identify illness and disease in medical scans, digital assistants that can not only recognize spoken words but understand them, automated stock-trading systems and robots that pick up objects they’ve never seen before.

With so few A.I. specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia. In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.

Uber hired 40 people from Carnegie Mellon’s groundbreaking A.I. program in 2015 to work on its self-driving-car project. Over the last several years, four of the best-known A.I. researchers in academia have left or taken leave from their professorships at Stanford University. At the University of Washington, six of 20 artificial intelligence professors are now on leave or partial leave and working for outside companies.

“There is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry,” said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

Some professors are finding a way to compromise. Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records). Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.

“There are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia,” Mr. Zettlemoyer said. “The salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.”

To bring in new A.I. engineers, companies like Google and Facebook are running classes that aim to teach “deep learning” and related techniques to existing employees. And nonprofits like Fast.ai and companies like Deeplearning.ai, founded by a former Stanford professor who helped create the Google Brain lab, offer online courses.

The basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math. But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call “a dark art.” Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.

In order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places. Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills. Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.

“I can’t compete with Google, and I don’t want to,” said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries. “So I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.”

But the industry’s giants are doing much the same. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have opened A.I. labs in Toronto and Montreal, where much of this research outside the United States is being done. Google also is hiring in China, where Microsoft has long had a strong presence.

Not surprisingly, many think the talent shortage won’t be alleviated for years.

“Of course demand outweighs supply. And things are not getting better any time soon,” Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal and a prominent A.I. researcher, said. “It takes many years to train a Ph.D.”",Tech Giants Are Paying Huge Salaries for Scarce A.I.

Yet it was a role that Ms. Fowler had been preparing for her whole life. The Peter Pan libertines met their match in a sweet Stoic.

She had what she calls an “unconventional upbringing,” the second child of seven in a small town in rural Arizona called Yarnell. Her father was an evangelical Assemblies of God preacher who sold pay phones on weekdays and, with his wife, home-schooled Susan and her siblings. She ended up never going to high school.

“So I was kind of on my own,” she says. “I tried to read the classics, would go to the library a lot, tried to teach myself things. But didn’t really have any direction. I really had this dream that someday I could be educated.”

She read Plutarch’s “Lives.” “The Stoics were really what changed me,” she says. “Because their whole thing was about, ‘You don’t have control over a lot of the things that determine your life, so all you can do is focus on becoming the best person that you can be.’ And that really spoke to me because I did feel, especially during my teenage years, that my life was really out of my control. I really wished that I could just learn and do all the fun things and cool extracurriculars that I thought everybody else my age was doing.”

Ms. Fowler worked as a stable hand and a nanny to help support her family. “And I would tell myself, in the times when I would be really, really sad, ‘Once I get out of here, I’m going to do something great.’ And I would just pray at night, like, ‘God, please just let me get out, give me opportunities to get out. I promise I’ll do good with it.’”

At 16, she began “freaking out” about her future. “I had this really intense resolve. I would call universities and community colleges and say, ‘I really want to go to college? How do I get to college. What do I do?’ And they would say, ‘You have to get an application. You have to get letters of recommendation.’ It was terrifying. I had no idea what I was doing.”

She figured out how to take the SAT and ACT. She made a list of all the books she had read and at the top wrote, “Susan Fowler’s Home School” and sent it off to Arizona State University.

“And they actually gave me a full scholarship,” she says, the wonder still in her voice.

The college balked at letting her take math and physics to study astronomy, given her lack of high-school prerequisites. “And I was like, ‘No! I didn’t come this far, now that I’ve found something I really loved, to have my dream smashed,’” Ms. Fowler says.

She applied to the top 10 colleges as a transfer student and was accepted at the University of Pennsylvania, where she was told she could study physics and given help with the steep tuition.

After a rough first semester, advisers tried to steer her away from physics. So she walked into the office of Penn’s president, Amy Gutmann, and left a message with her assistant: In a commencement speech, Ms. Gutmann had said that the school would help students fulfill their dreams.

“I heard back directly from the president herself, and she was like, ‘You are right. This is a place for people to fulfill their dreams.’” She told Ms. Fowler she could get back to her whiteboards, and after that, it was “fantastic.”

The Memo That Roared

The essay that shook Silicon Valley was called “Reflecting on One Very, Very Strange Year at Uber,” and Ms. Fowler began by noting that it was “a strange, fascinating, and slightly horrifying story.” Published on Feb. 19, it rocked the world’s most valuable start-up, challenging the mantra that great disrupters are above the law. The blog post was notable for its dispassionate tone, as the young engineer who had left the company after a year walked the reader through everything that had gone very, very wrong in the brozilla culture of kegs, sexual coarseness and snaky competition.

Ms. Fowler was on her first day with her new engineering team when her manager sent her a string of messages over the company chat system.

“He’s telling me that he’s in an open relationship and that his girlfriend is getting laid all the time, but he just can’t because he’s at work all the time,” she says, reprising her blog post with me. “And he’s trying really hard not to get in trouble at work, but he’s really looking for a woman to have sex with. And I was like, ‘What the hell? This can’t be real. How stupid does he have to be?’ But it turned out he’d been getting away with this for so long, he didn’t care anymore. And I feel like so many of these men, they believe that the only reason women get into these jobs is to get a guy.”

Ms. Fowler took screen shots and reported the manager to human resources, thinking, “They’ll do the right thing.” But they didn’t, explaining that the manager was “a high performer” and it was his first offense, something Ms. Fowler later discovered to be untrue.

“Somehow I’m supposed to be like, ‘Oh, he’s a high performer? Never mind. How dare I?’” she says, laughing.

She wrote that H.R. told her she could either find another team to work on or stay on that man’s team and expect a poor performance review. Another manager told her that if she reported stuff to H.R., he could fire her. Amid the manic, sexist behavior, the number of female engineers in the division Ms. Fowler was part of dwindled to less than 6 percent — too few, the company said, to merit ordering them the same black leather jackets they were ordering for the men.

When Ms. Fowler earned some money from “Production-Ready Microservices,” a book on engineering she wrote, she went out to Madewell and bought herself a black leather jacket.

“I didn’t really care if they branded me a troublemaker,” she says, “because I hadn’t gotten that far in my life and overcome all these things to get treated inappropriately. I wasn’t going to take it. I’d worked so hard. I deserved so much better. And I was, like, ‘No. That’s not O.K. You don’t get to do that.’”

In her memo, she says, “I knew I had to be super-careful about how I said it if I wanted anybody to take it seriously. A lot of women have been whistle-blowers in the past, and a lot of them have just gotten torn down and treated terribly. One of the things that kept popping up was this idea that if you do whistle-blow about sexual harassment, then that is what will define the rest of your life. And I kind of struggled with this. But then, to me, I realized, you know what? No. Stepping back, just being in my little Stoicism Susan bubble, if what people know you for is bringing light to an issue about bad behavior, about bad stuff going on and laws not being followed and people being treated inappropriately, why wouldn’t I want that? That’s a badge of honor.

“And I wasn’t just standing up for myself. I felt like I was standing up for everyone else that I was seeing at Uber who was mistreated. It was an extremely demoralizing environment. I would see people who would get harassed or made fun of or bullied and they would go report it, and they would just get ground down by upper management and H.R. And so I felt like, if I can take this on despite the consequences, then I should do it.”

Like women in Hollywood I talked to after the Weinstein collapse, Ms. Fowler thought the new outspokenness in Silicon Valley on sexual harassment may have been spurred by the election of President Trump.

“The second Trump won, I felt super-powerless and I thought, ‘Oh my God, no one’s looking out for us,’” she says. “They have the House, they have the Senate, they have the White House. And so we have to take it back ourselves. We have to be the ones doing the work.”

The only woman on the board then, Arianna Huffington, who had vowed that the culture of “brilliant jerks” must end, had been trying to help Mr. Kalanick by advising him to sleep more and meditate. But he caused another kerfuffle when he chose to meditate in the lactation room.

When Ms. Fowler’s memo exploded, Ms. Huffington oversaw the investigation by Eric Holder, reached out and talked to employees, and said she wanted to “hold the leadership team’s feet to the fire.” Uber later fired 20 people, including senior executives.

“So I was disappointed in her because I expected her to be an advocate,” Ms. Fowler says, noting that Ms. Huffington appeared on TV after the blog post to insist that there’s no “systemic problem” at Uber.

“I had two friends who went to her and Liane Hornsey, who’s the head of H.R., and reported various harassment discrimination,” Ms. Fowler says. “And then I was told that many other women were doing the same thing. And then Arianna went on TV that same week and said, there’s no ‘systemic problem.’ Which I was like, ‘No, a whole bunch of people just went to you this week.’” Ms. Fowler adds that the company’s C.T.O., Thuan Pham, who knew about her complaints, is still in the same job.

Ms. Huffington told me that she agreed that the problem was “systemic sexism,” but that she did not believe there was “systemic sexual harassment.” But, she added, “there should be zero tolerance for even one case of sexual harassment.”

“I was totally supportive of having a full investigation of her claims,” Ms. Huffington says. “That’s why we brought in a former attorney general to investigate. I don’t think you can do a lot more than that.”

Ms. Fowler is not so sure. “The one interaction we had was right after I published the blog, when I started getting calls from friends and family and even acquaintances I hadn’t talked to in years and years who were getting calls about private investigators asking about it,” she says “And I was pretty sure that this was coming from Uber or someone close to Uber. So I sent an email to some of the members of the Uber board because I was like, ‘Look, I don’t know if you’re responsible for this, but hey, if you’re doing this, please stop.’

“And Arianna responded and she was like, ‘Travis has assured me that he did not do this.’ And I replied, asking her, ‘O.K., well, then, could you please go and say publicly, “Whoever’s doing this, stop,” if somebody is?’”

Ms. Huffington told me that “the board had a complete assurance from management that nothing was done like that or would be.”

Speaking to The Wall Street Journal earlier this month, Ms. Hornsey, who joined Uber a month after Ms. Fowler left and a month before the famous blog post, was asked if she had ever reached out to Ms. Fowler.

“I have said, very publicly, ‘Thank you’ to her because she raised some stuff that did lead to change,” she said. “I don’t know whether there would be any benefit in meeting her. I’m seriously working for my employees today; she’s an ex-employee.”

Ms. Fowler tweeted a screen shot of that part of the interview, saying: “Oooh burn” and “She really, really doesn’t like me.”

On the advice of a friend, Ms. Fowler got private security for the first few weeks after she published her incendiary essay.

She thinks Silicon Valley needs to get rid of forced arbitration. “When you join these companies, they make you sign away your constitutional right to sue,” she says.

Ms. Fowler has taken that to the Supreme Court, and as is her wont, is studying the syllabuses of Columbia Law School so she can learn more about her rights.

She now has a job at Stripe as the editor of its tech publication. And she’s working with Verve, a Hollywood talent agency, developing a movie based on her experiences, described by the agency to me as “Erin Brockovich” meets “The Social Network.”

Meanwhile, Ms. Fowler is still reading the Stoics (while Mr. Kalanick is still wrestling with the board about who should control the company he started). “I think, right now especially, with Trump in the White House, who knows what’s going on with North Korea? Then we have natural disasters happening. It just feels like you’re being tossed around on the ocean and there’s nothing. What I keep going back to and what keeps me going, is trying to do good in whatever little spot of the world we can influence, no matter how small.”

As we leave, I ask Ms. Fowler if she knows the baby’s sex.

“A girl,” she says, smiling radiantly. “I’m so excited. Now I’m just like, ‘Got to make this world better so she doesn’t have to deal with these things.’”

The director isn’t as well known for his jokes, but I think he should be. One of his personal favorites is from “Lady Vengeance”: A group of parents gather, each having lost their child to the same murderer. The Lady Vengeance of the title has captured him and tied him up in the other room so they can enact their revenge. Dressed in rain gear in anticipation of the horrific bloodletting to come, each of them holds his or her own weapons. One man, though, seems to be holding just a small stick. But then he begins assembling a massive ax from materials hidden beneath his clothes — making the biggest weapon of them all.

PARK IS an autodidact, a self-taught auteur. This wasn’t just by choice; the 1980s Korea in which he came of age had only a few film schools, and no serious cinematic culture for him to either engage with or ignore. He had only the American Forces Korea Network, a television channel famous for airing foreign movies, often without subtitles. (If there were subtitles, they were in English, not in Korean.) Park remembers watching these on his family’s black-and-white television. Later, he had his university’s cinema club, which showed bootleg VHS tapes of foreign films. “When you say you go to a film school in America or France, you would probably go to a lecture where they teach you about German Expressionism and show you what these German Expressionist films are,” he says. “But in Korea there was no systematic education I could be exposed to. It was sporadic, haphazard. And maybe that’s why my films have ended up in this strange form, where it feels like it’s a mishmash of everything.”

He recalls a James Bond film he saw in the theater as a boy — he doesn’t remember which one, but it excited him so much, he began imagining his own Bond films. But not just the stories: He saw them in his head, shot for shot, thinking of how lighting, angles and editing told stories, and he began formulating his own. When I asked him if he felt anything was lost in translation, he shook his head. “I still understood them,” he said. “When I finally watched some of them again, with subtitles, I knew I had understood the faces, the things they did.” He credits this kind of watching — only being able to grasp expressions and actions, not language — for developing his sense of visual storytelling. There is a well-known anecdote of how Park was inspired to become a film director after seeing Hitchcock’s “Vertigo” in college, and this is true, but he was already thinking like a director long before that, thinking of how to tell stories on film — image by image, face by face, not outside of language, but with more than language.

But being a film director was not a viable career for a Korean at this time. When Park proposed to his wife in the late ’80s, he lied to his future mother-in-law and told her he was going to be a professor, like his architect father. He then set out to make his first film, which was so unsuccessful that Park himself was its only reviewer. He did so in disguise — a film critic friend allowed him to publish a review in his name after first saying he couldn’t review it because they were friends. (“Maybe he had nothing good to say,” Park says.) He wrote film reviews and criticism to earn money until he made his second film — and after that film also failed, he struggled along again. “This is an exaggeration,” Park says, “but I came to think, ‘Is the whole industry in cahoots to really ridicule me? Is everyone conspiring to ridicule me until I collapse from exhaustion?’ ” In 1999, he was given a chance to make a short film, “Judgement,” inspired by the collapse of a shopping center in Seoul, and this time, he engaged the help of a troupe of stage actors, and held his first script reading where he listened to the actors instead of just telling them his thoughts. “I realized actors are not puppets,” he says. “Let’s say in the screenplay, there’s one line of dialogue, and I couldn’t come up with a better one. As a director you can talk to the actor honestly, and say, I couldn’t come up with anything better. Can you think of something to say? This is a kind of luxury a novelist cannot enjoy.”

Park expanded on this approach as he made his third feature film, “Joint Security Area,” the story of four soldiers who guard the border of North and South Korea, two on each side, and the forbidden friendship they strike up, and the tragic result. He and the actors not only shared notes, but also became friends. “We were all young back then,” he says. “We would shoot until nighttime and then afterward, spend all night drinking, sleep only two or three hours, come back to work the next day.” The film’s success — it became Korea’s highest-grossing film after it opened — confirmed the value of collaboration for Park, and so he has worked this way ever since, with some refinements — more sleep, less drinking. His films are built out of conversations with his core crew that begin well before he begins on a script. As soon as he begins drafting he also begins working out music ideas with his composer, who has collaborated with him since “Joint Security Area.” He never has to go very far for these talks: The composer is his next-door neighbor.

WITH “THE HANDMAIDEN,” Park uses sex with the same deliberate force as he once used violence. He was initially drawn to the intense eroticism of “Fingersmith,” about a lesbian con artist in Victorian England, as well as to the English countryside setting, but for his adaptation, he instead set the story in 1930s Japanese-occupied Korea. Park was interested in the way Japanese sympathizers believed Japan would rule forever, and hoped to erase their Korean identities. The result is a lavish stereoscopic historical fiction about the difference between obsession and love, even as it is also subtly a story about what it means to be Korean, when the world, and even your own self, is trying to take that from you. Sookee is the daughter of a famous thief, determined to make a score that will let her leave Korea and travel the world. She has been hired by a young grifter, Count Fujiwara, to help him seduce the Lady Hideko, a young Japanese noblewoman raised in almost complete seclusion by her Uncle Kouzouki, who intends to marry her when she’s of age and take possession of her considerable fortune. Sookee will be Hideko’s new maid, and is to fulfill her duty from within the intimate realm of her new mistress’s confidences. But when Sookee first meets Hideko, running to her side after she screams in the night for help, she is immediately drawn to her, and soon falls in love with her. The film proceeds from there in a series of stunning reversals, as the central characters transform themselves again and again.

Hideko is, unknown to Sookee, not the doomed innocent heiress Sookee imagines her to be, but the star of her uncle’s rarefied erotic cabaret, appearing in readings of erotica staged for his Japanese and Japanese sympathizer friends, who sit dressed in white tie in his elegant library, in lustful awe of Hideko as she performs. Her uncle is so enamored of Japanese culture he has become a naturalized Japanese citizen. In the film, Japanese is spoken to assert cultural power or privilege; Korean is spoken as an assertion of intimacy and camaraderie. One of Park’s favorite scenes in the film is when Hideko climbs a cherry tree to hang herself. She lets herself drop, ready to die, but falls only a little: As the camera pans down, you see Sookee, defiant, holding her feet, crying out from love for her. As Hideko and Sookee confess their true feelings to each other, and the lovers escape, they begin speaking Korean in private, eventually forgoing Japanese almost entirely.

“The Handmaiden” was such a phenomenon that Yongsan CGV, a massive multiplex at one of Seoul’s most popular malls, has dedicated one of its theaters in Park’s honor. The theater is kept to the director’s specifications, with a plaque on the outside in his likeness, and a gallery where he can display his photos and props from his films, including one of Lady Hideko’s suitcases, looking almost as if she forgot it there. Located near one of the main American army bases in South Korea, it is a fitting tribute to Park’s childhood spent watching movies on the American Forces Korea Network: a personal monument, but also a celebration of the Korean cinematic culture that he once longed for, now growing up with and around him.

THE DAY AFTER WE first meet, Park leads me around his home in Heyri, an artists’ community in Paju. Every house here has a distinctive contemporary look, but Park’s, designed by one of Korea’s most renowned architects, Kim Young-joon, stands out. It reimagines the traditional Korean home as two main structures, side by side, joined by a series of walkways. One side is for Park and his wife and daughter, the other for his parents (who have since moved out). The space is both cozy and homey even as it seems to be entirely made of sightlines. In several places, you can see from one side of the house all the way through to the other. Along with his composer, his neighbors include the Seoul Action School for stuntmen. He has to push a stunt motorcycle out of the way as he takes me through his garden.

The room where Park writes his screenplays is very small, almost a long closet, with a window looking out onto the street, furnished with just a desk, a chair and no ornaments except for a 1970s Dieter Rams clock that only ticks when it is wound up. It is a serene place, though its close confines are faintly reminiscent of one of Park’s signature scenes, from “Oldboy,” in which the imprisoned man at the heart of the film fights his way, guard by guard, through a claustrophobic hallway, armed only with a hammer.

He takes me to the other side of the house. The downstairs is mostly empty except for a humidifier. Upstairs, he has made what feels like a kid’s clubhouse. A bottle of Scotch sits on the bookshelf. His graphic novels, genre novels and children’s picture books are here, and I look for things I recognize. I notice a book titled “The Leopard,” though the name of the author is in Korean. I ask him if this is the same book by the Italian author Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa.

“No,” he says. “That’s another Leopard.” He laughs. As an afterthought, he adds, “Visconti’s ‘The Leopard’ is my favorite film.”

Photo

The 1963 adaptation of Lampedusa’s 1958 novel tells the story of a Sicilian nobleman in the 1860s whose class status and entire way of being is threatened by civil war. Park both is and isn’t the prince Burt Lancaster plays in that film, watching as Claudia Cardinale and Alain Delon enact the aristocracy’s forced embrace of the rising middle class. On the one hand, he’s too down-to-earth for that. On the other, Korea has changed more in Park’s lifetime than it has in all of its previous history, and in much the same way Italy did in the 19th century. When I ask him why it’s his favorite film, he says, “Getting old, getting behind in the fast changing times — it’s the most elegant observation about these things.” He doesn’t seem like someone languishing behind the times, but as we continue talking, he strikes me as the calm center of his own work, a fulcrum between tradition and experimentation, intense violence and sexuality, and high romance.

But the greatest sense I have of him comes at the end of our day. We walk to a nearby cafe to finish our conversation. The proprietress shows us into a closed dining room for privacy and leaves us with iced coffees. As I set up my recorder, Park stands at the back of the dining room, gazing out the window with such fondness and focus that I want to know what he’s looking at. Nine cats are arranged on the deck, including a mother cat and her nursing kittens.

There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

Photo

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

Regulators are looking into whether Germany’s three major vehicle manufacturers — BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen — worked together to fix the prices of various vehicle equipment, including design aspects that help control emissions. The searches came as the companies face a backlash over their efforts to evade rules on diesel emissions.

The European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, said in a brief statement that the “inspections” were aimed at enforcing rules that “prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices.” The commission did not name the companies involved, but Daimler and Volkswagen said their offices had been searched.

The New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, has opened an inquiry into the Weinstein Company examining whether allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment against its co-founder Harvey Weinstein reflect broad gender discrimination and other civil rights violations.

“No New Yorker should be forced to walk into a workplace ruled by sexual intimidation, harassment or fear,” Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement on Monday. “If sexual harassment or discrimination is pervasive at a company, we want to know.”

On Monday, the attorney general’s Civil Rights Bureau sent a subpoena to the company seeking a long list of documents, including personnel files; criteria for hiring, promoting and firing; formal and informal complaints of sexual harassment or other discrimination based on gender or age; and records showing how such complaints were handled, according to a person who has seen the confidential subpoena and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The office is also seeking any documents and communications related to private out-of-court settlements struck with accusers, the person said.

The civil investigation places heightened scrutiny on an already reeling entertainment company. The inquiry will also examine whether the company itself bears financial responsibility for any misconduct.

PhotoIn 2006, Ms. Mack was at it again, entering all 69 craft categories of the Durham Fair.
“#45 Amy, Amy, anyone,” for instance, refers to the artist’s childhood fascination with Amy Carter.
“I was so curious about her,” said Ms. Mack, who still has the straight red hair, sprinkling of freckles and gently angular features she shared back then with America’s First Kid.
It reads “FACTS FAKES FREAKS.” Ms. Mack didn’t have political intentions when she made the sign last year — the wording came from an old sideshow banner she had seen.","“I know every artist says this, but I was always making stuff as a kid,” she said. “Plus, you could win a few bucks of prize money and you’d get into the fair for free.” The ritual would begin each August with daily trips to the mailbox to check for the Durham Fair’s entry booklet, which contained the long list of craft categories that would guide Ms. Mack’s plan of attack. (Soap carving and pumpkin decoration were among her favorites.)

Photo

That annual tradition has evolved through many twists and turns into “Junk Kaleidoscope,” a phrase that Amy Smith-Stewart, the Aldrich’s curator, likes to think of as “a ruptured view of the world through everyday cultural artifacts,” she said recently while installing the show.

Photo

Hung in frames, displayed on shelves, or arranged in domestic-scaled installations, Ms. Mack’s new work quietly exudes the motley variety of a craft show crossed with a fair exhibition hall in its mix of stained glass, gilding, silk flowers, neon lights and lots of denim. There are references to early sideshow banners, commemorative wreaths, needlepoint samplers, teen longing, and American heartthrobs.

“I’m interested in my body of work looking like the things that came out of the fair, not in their craftiness, but in their diversity,” said Ms. Mack, who cites as inspirations Ree Morton (1936-1977), Rosemarie Trockel and Robert Gober, artists known for their idiosyncratic use of various materials.

She returns to the Durham Fair almost every year and took road trips to visit state fairs through the Southeast and the northern Midwest. “Fairs are great sources for images,” she said, while assuring me that she is not obsessed. What she does obsess over, she explained, is “their collections of things, the categorization, their repetitive nature.” Fittingly, a large poster-size list hangs at the entrance to the main gallery at the Aldrich, enumerating 73 categories.

Photo

The evolution of the kind of official list that Ms. Mack would eagerly pore over as a kid, the show at the Aldrich mixes existing competition categories, like “#14 Wood, three-dimensional construction” with more ambiguous entries, like “#38 My heart wants more” and “#55 After the fact.”

Photo

The list is also a link to the exhibition’s pivotal origins, Ms. Mack’s epic project, “The Fair” (staged in 1996 and 2006). Fresh out of the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia, where she earned her M.F.A. in sculpture, Ms. Mack decided to enter all 73 craft categories in the Durham Fair. It was an act of near-manic D.I.Y. industriousness, done in the name of art rather than heartlandish moral rectitude. She taught herself leather tooling, screen-printing and chair caning, and won dozens of ribbons.

“Art gave me this framework to put around the fair, this permission to allow myself to allocate an insane amount of time to making crafts — all summer, every day, two crafts a day, while working a full-time temp job,” she recalled. Real Art Ways, a nonprofit art space in Hartford, showed the items — adorned with their ribbons. The following year, Postmasters Gallery in New York showed the project.

Photo

In 2006, Ms. Mack was at it again, entering all 69 craft categories of the Durham Fair. “That second time it was more about using repetition, remaking, and memorialization to think about how I was processing these familiar images and experiences,” she said. Ten years later, she was planning “Junk Kaleidoscope,” fleshing out her interest in commemoration. “All the work in the show came from either a memory I have or an image I saw, maybe a very specific object I walked by,” she explained. “But they’re not exact reproductions, they’re combinations of a few things.”

Photo

There are several wreath motifs in the show, including “Conn Con,” from 2017, a large ring of straw festooned with ornamental corn. It’s the kind of regional homage that one might find at the fair, but also an allusion to the false impression of household bliss that the mastery of the “domestic arts” might imply. “How you decorate your house, your curb appeal — it was all very important where I grew up,” said Ms. Mack, who now has work in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Seattle Art Museum, among others.

Ms. Smith-Stewart, who came across the artist’s work in a group show at MoMA PS1 in 2002, while working as an assistant curator, said: “Anissa is interested in the storytelling power of objects, and many of the works have a narrative that can be pieced together differently depending on the audience.”

Ms. Mack’s list is a gathering of ideas that have been percolating in her psyche over the years. “#45 Amy, Amy, anyone,” for instance, refers to the artist’s childhood fascination with Amy Carter. “I was so curious about her,” said Ms. Mack, who still has the straight red hair, sprinkling of freckles and gently angular features she shared back then with America’s First Kid. “She was my ageish, but a little older. And she sort of looked like me.”

Photo

Ms. Mack hasn’t tackled the subject of Amy Carter quite yet, but that doesn’t matter. The list, for her, is a live document for future work. It can be a catalyst (or excuse) to make something new, or a way of understanding something she’s already made.

Everything in the show refers to something on the list, she explained, but some might match three, “and some categories, like Americana, might cover everything.” “Everyone’s favorite angel, 2017,” for instance, a pencil sketch of Farrah Fawcett drawn on a canvas that the artist has molded to look like white denim, could be “#20 Best of the best,” “#33 I never thought she’d take his last name,” “ or “#60 Locations, actors, obstacles.”

“Wreath,” from 2017, is a good example of how Ms. Mack might bundle together different impressions into a cohesive work. It revolves around a story she read in the paper last year about a terminally ill 14-year-old British girl whose last wish was to be cryogenically frozen. The artist printed the condensed tale, word by word, on the surface of around 300 resin-cast rings (tiny wreaths, if you will), and then arranged them among dozens of inexpensive vintage rings in a rectangular grid of foam slots, the kind of display she frequently sees at fairs and flea markets.

Photo

The work shows how nuanced Ms. Mack’s state fair resonances can be. “The girl’s story reminded me of the midway,” she said. “It’s this place of incredible hope, where you might win this huge stuffed thing, but you also kind of know you’re going to lose.”

A white neon sign casting cold light in a dark side gallery transports viewers to the midway’s fleeting alley of rickety rides and ringtoss stands. It reads “FACTS FAKES FREAKS.” Ms. Mack didn’t have political intentions when she made the sign last year — the wording came from an old sideshow banner she had seen. But the relevance today doesn’t escape her.

“The emotions generated in the space of the midway are things that really play out in other parts of American culture,” she said. “The pride of winning something for someone else, the showing off, the hucksterism.” It’s all right there.",And the Blue Ribbon Goes to ...

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said.
Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls.
“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said.
“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said.","Having spent 15 years photographing child marriages around the world, Stephanie Sinclair is uniquely positioned to understand its lasting impact on communities and, especially, on the girls who were forced to wed against their will. “You can’t expect individuals who have been through significant abuse to just act normal as soon as they get out of that situation,” she said. “They need to be nurtured, to be given the time and the tools to heal.”

With this in mind, Ms. Sinclair last year started the Tehani Photo Workshop — named after an 8-year-old Yemeni bride — in partnership with the Samburu Girls Foundation. The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said. Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls. “The independence that comes with a such a career, the knowledge you acquire through meeting other people, and the freedom the camera gives you to express yourself can’t be underplayed,” she said. “Instinctively, I knew that a photo workshop could nurture the girls in a unique way.”

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

Photo

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

The president’s response seemed certain to keep alive the extraordinary squabble, which erupted a week ago when Mr. Trump was asked about the deadly ambush in Niger and asserted wrongly that previous presidents had not called the families of American troops killed in action. He then proceeded to call relatives of the soldiers killed in Niger, only to have Representative Frederica S. Wilson, a Florida Democrat who listened to Mr. Trump’s conversation with Ms. Johnson, criticize the president publicly for his words.

On Monday, Ms. Johnson supported Ms. Wilson, who has been feuding with both Mr. Trump and Mr. Kelly over the call.

“Whatever Ms. Wilson said was not fabricated,” Ms. Johnson said. “What she said was 100 percent correct.”

Ms. Johnson said that on the call, she let Mr. Trump do most of the talking as her anger grew. When asked if she wanted to say anything to Mr. Trump, the young widow decided against delivering a message.

She did, however, say that she was desperate to know more details about the disappearance and death of her husband, and described him as “caring” and a “great soldier.” The couple had known each other since she was 6 years old.

“I want to know why it took them 48 hours to find my husband,” Ms. Johnson said.

She also shared a deep concern over not being allowed to view her husband’s remains.

“They won’t show me a finger, a hand,” she said. “I know my husband’s body from head to toe and they won’t let me see anything,” she said. “I need to see my husband.”

After a service member is killed on the battlefield, the military’s mortuary affairs personnel often do everything they can to prepare the deceased for a potential viewing. In some cases, however, if the wounds are too grievous or the body is extremely disfigured, the military might suggest that the coffin remain sealed.

Tech. Sgt. Holly Roberts-Davis, who is in charge of public affairs at Dover Air Force Base’s mortuary affairs division, said that families were not allowed to see the remains of their loved ones until after the body is inspected and cleared by the division’s medical examiner. Once that is complete, the family is free to open the coffin.

The back and forth began after Sergeant Johnson and three Americans were killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger. The president called Ms. Johnson and said that her husband “knew what he signed up for,” and referred to the soldier as “your guy.” Ms. Wilson, a longtime family friend who accompanied Ms. Johnson and heard the call, recounted what the president said to several reporters and lamented that the president had offended the young widow, who was upset that the president did not seem to know Sergeant Johnson’s name.

Mr. Trump angrily disputed that account, saying that he “had a very nice conversation with the woman, with the wife, who sounded like a lovely woman.”

Last week, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that Ms. Wilson’s account was “totally fabricated,” although the woman who raised Sergeant Johnson said it was accurate. And Mr. Trump has continued to target the congresswoman, calling her “wacky.”

In a White House briefing, Mr. Kelly harshly criticized Ms. Wilson, who had known Sergeant Johnson’s family since he was in elementary school, for listening to the call. Mr. Kelly called the lawmaker an “empty barrel” and also misrepresented her remarks when he accused her of bragging about securing $20 million for an F.B.I. building in South Florida and twisting President Barack Obama’s arm.

Video of Ms. Wilson’s speech, released by The Sun Sentinel, a newspaper in South Florida, showed that during her nine-minute speech, Ms. Wilson never took credit for getting the money for the building, only for helping pass legislation to name the building after two fallen federal agents. She also never mentioned pleading with Mr. Obama, and she acknowledged the help of several Republicans, including John A. Boehner, then the House speaker; Representatives Mario Diaz-Balart and Carlos Curbelo; and Senator Marco Rubio.

On Monday, Ms. Johnson also pushed back against Mr. Kelly’s criticism of Ms. Wilson for hearing the call. The widow said she had asked the military official accompanying her family to put the call from President Trump on speakerphone so others could also hear his words.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Kelly “absolutely” stands by his Thursday remarks.

“General Kelly said he was ‘stunned’ that Representative Wilson made comments at a building dedication honoring slain F.B.I. agents about her own actions in Congress, including lobbying former President Obama on legislation,” Ms. Sanders said in a statement. “As General Kelly pointed out, if you’re able to make a sacred act like honoring American heroes about yourself, you’re an empty barrel.”

Over the weekend, the dispute continued with Mr. Trump posting Sunday on Twitter, “Wacky Congresswoman Wilson is the gift that keeps on giving for the Republican Party, a disaster for Dems. You watch her in action & vote R!”

Several women from the Congressional Black Caucus also wrote a letter demanding an apology from Mr. Kelly.

“We were appalled by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly’s statements where he called Congresswoman Wilson an ‘empty barrel’ and accused her of taking credit for securing funding for a new F.B.I. Building,” the lawmakers said.

“General Kelly’s comments are reprehensible,” the letter stated. “Congresswoman Wilson’s integrity and credibility should not be challenged or undermined by such blatant lies.

It is a tall order in New Jersey, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 800,000. For Republicans to win a statewide campaign, they usually need to win over many unaffiliated voters whose views tend not to skew to far to the left or the right.

But, if nothing else, the ad did get Ms. Guadagno noticed in an election that has gotten little attention. The ad captured headlines across the country and it was shown on newscasts even before the Guadagno campaign had spent money to show it on television.

The ad has appeared almost exclusively on cable channels, according to Advertising Analytics, a company that tracks advertising. Ads on most cable channels are often less expensive and reach a smaller, more targeted audience.

After her ad was unveiled by her campaign, Ms. Guadagno was a guest on “Fox and Friends,” the conservative morning talk show that is watched by President Trump. On the show, she continued to discuss crimes committed by undocumented immigrants.

When asked for comment about the decision to target immigration, a spokesperson for Ms. Guadagno instead focused on Mr. Murphy.

“It’s Phil Murphy who is out of the mainstream by running on a platform to raise taxes and make New Jersey a sanctuary state,” said Ricky Diaz, the communication director for the Guadagno campaign.

For most of her campaign, Ms. Guadagno has been focused on the state’s property taxes, which are the highest in the country. During her victory speech on the night of the Republican primary in June, Ms. Guadagno made a bold pledge not to run for re-election if she failed to lower property taxes during her first term. She pinned her promise to the top of her Twitter page for months.

But during her interview on Fox, Ms. Guadagno never even mentioned the word tax. Instead, she focused on immigration, and her immigration ad is pinned to the top of her Twitter feed.

While her tough stance on undocumented immigrants may be a move designed to reach conservative Republican voters, it could also be risky.

“It may not even be the card to play with the base,” said Ashley Koning, the director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers. Ms. Koning cited a poll taken in 2015 during the presidential primary showing that 51 percent of Republicans in New Jersey supported a pathway to citizenship, and only 28 percent said undocumented immigrants should be forced to leave the country.

A focus on immigration and Mr. Murphy’s recent comment about New Jersey becoming a sanctuary state “may temporarily sway some voters, especially this late in the game with only a couple of weeks to go,” Ms. Koning said, but “it may not be the driving force that Guadagno hopes to push people to the polls.”

Ms. Guadagno has not always sought out the party’s conservative wing.

She denounced President Trump last year after tapes were released in which Mr. Trump, then a candidate, bragged about forcing himself on women. Ms. Guadagno said “no apology’’ could excuse his comments.

In August, she offered a curt response when asked if there was a chance she would visit the president when he was on vacation in New Jersey.

“None,” she told reporters at the time.

And she holds positions that members of the more conservative wing of the Republican Party would find anathema. From climate change (she supports renewable energy investment) to abortion (she has been a supporter of abortion rights her entire career), Ms. Guadagno has not shown a rigid adherence to the party’s platform or conservative ethos.

She has referred to her plan to cap property taxes — by limiting school property taxes at 5 percent of a family’s annual income with the state making up the difference — as taking a page “out of the Democratic playbook.”

Now, any language that makes a positive reference to Democrats has vanished, which is not surprising at the end of her campaign. But what is notable is how Ms. Guadagno is giving top billing to immigration after spending so much time on a bread-and-butter issue like property taxes.

Mr. Murphy said he has been taken aback by the ad and Ms. Guadagno’s shift toward immigration.

“Yes it did surprise me, it 100 percent surprised me,” he said in a brief interview on Thursday before his rally with Mr. Obama. “Because I didn’t think she would do that, to be honest with you.”",Guadagno Takes Right Turn on Immigration in Waning Days of Campaign,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/nyregion/kim-guadagno-new-jersey-immigration.html

The winds — known as the Diablo winds in Northern California and Santa Ana winds in the south — are typical of the fall, arriving from the arid expanses of Nevada’s Great Basin.

On the heels of a record hot summer, California’s brush and trees are primed for ignition, said Daniel Swain, a U.C.L.A. climate scientist who also runs the California Weather Blog.

What’s more, he said, “The Santa Ana winds are going to coincide with record heat, which was not the case, for example, up in the Santa Rosa area. There it was just the magnitude of the winds that was really critical.”

The heat on Monday and Tuesday is expected to flirt with temperature records in places across the state.

That includes Dodger Stadium, where the Dodgers are hosting the Houston Astros for Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday. The forecast calls for a high of about 100 degrees.

If it holds up, said John Thorn, a baseball historian, it would be the hottest World Series game on record.

The Dodgers are in the World Series for the first since 1988, but some fans can’t help but feel a little bittersweet.

Vin Scully won’t be calling the games.

The announcer ended his storied career in the Dodgers broadcasting booth last fall after 67 seasons.

Still, that hasn’t stopped some fans from begging for one last encore. At least two online petitions have collected thousands of signatures asking Mr. Scully to return for the series between the Dodgers and Houston Astros, which begins Tuesday.

But don’t get your hopes up.

Mr. Scully, 89, shot down the idea in an email to the Los Angeles Daily News, saying in part, “I honestly don’t feel I belong there.”

Joe Davis, who took over for Mr. Scully, said fans and players would love nothing more than welcome the Hall of Fame broadcaster back.

“And Vin knows the door is wide open,” Mr. Davis said in a text message. “But it sounds like — and understandably so after 67 years put in — he’s perfectly content watching the games like the rest of us.”

A major incident is defined as a problem that causes the delay of more than 50 trains. At the height of the crisis, there were more than 80 major incidents on average a month.

Persuading Tesla to build cars in Shanghai while still paying tariffs on them would be a coup for the Chinese government.
China already has the world’s largest market for electric cars.
Tesla said in June that it was negotiating to produce cars in Shanghai.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Tesla had a deal to produce cars in Shanghai.","The preliminary deal still offers Tesla control over its trade secrets and may give the company leverage to negotiate better terms with the Chinese government in the future. Tesla hopes to complete the deal by the end of the year, the two people said.

Any comprehensive arrangement would still require the approval of the central government in Beijing. The Beijing authorities have sometimes used their power to delay deals or demand further concessions from foreign investors.

Persuading Tesla to build cars in Shanghai while still paying tariffs on them would be a coup for the Chinese government. If Tesla were making cars in the Shanghai area, it would have a powerful incentive to buy many, if not most, of the parts in China, strengthening China’s base of suppliers for the fast-growing electric car industry.

China already has the world’s largest market for electric cars. Their dominance is a byproduct of the government’s extensive subsidies, part of a broader plan to shift the country away from gasoline-powered cars. The shift would not only curb pollution but also reduce the country’s dependence on imported oil. LMC Automotive, a global consulting firm, estimates that 295,000 battery-electric cars will be sold this year in China, compared with 287,000 in the rest of the world combined.

The gap may widen. LMC predicts that China’s total will nearly triple in the next two years, while the rest of the world’s will merely double. That is because, in part, Chinese government regulations will require automakers starting in 2019 to sell ever-increasing numbers of electric cars and plug-in hybrids if they want to keep selling gasoline cars. China has also begun research on imposing a rule to ban the sale of internal combustion cars someday.

“China is and will be the largest consumer and producer of electric vehicles in the world,” said Bill Russo, the founder and chief executive of Automobility, a Shanghai consulting firm. “If Tesla hopes to compete as a global electric vehicle maker, it must tap the manufacturing and supply footprint of China in order to compete globally.”

China has the steepest barriers to automotive trade of any large market in the world, making it difficult to compete in the Chinese market without producing in the country. Beijing has been able to retain steep tariffs and other obstacles to imports because it insisted that it was a developing country when it entered the World Trade Organization in 2001.

The W.T.O. has allowed developing countries to retain much higher trade barriers than industrialized countries, on the theory that they have infant industries that may not have grown big enough to withstand global competition. Today, however, China has the world’s largest auto industry.

China charges a tariff of 25 percent on imported cars, compared with 2.5 percent in the United States and 9.8 percent in the European Union. China also has a 17 percent value-added tax — a kind of sales tax — that is charged not only on the price of the car but also on the tariff, so that the taxes are effectively compounded.

Unlike these taxes, the costs of shipping a car across the Pacific are tiny. They can be as little as 1 percent of the cost of a high-priced model like Tesla’s offerings. “Shipping costs are usually not a big deal — it is the 25 percent tariff” that keeps out imports, said Yale Zhang, the managing director of Automotive Foresight, a Shanghai consulting firm.

Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, has expressed concern about China’s trade practices. President Trump is set to visit Beijing from Nov. 8 to 10, but China has shown little sign of willingness to negotiate on sectors that it regards as strategic imperatives, and electric cars are one such industry.

If the deal does come to pass, Tesla would have achieved a breakthrough of sorts in being preliminarily allowed to have a wholly owned operation in a foreign trade zone. Honda also received permission to set up a majority owned operation in a foreign trade zone more than a decade ago, but unlike Tesla, it has been forced to export the output from that factory, mainly to Europe.

Tesla said in June that it was negotiating to produce cars in Shanghai. But the company has been struggling to decide whether to produce inside or outside a free-trade zone in Shanghai and on what terms.

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Photo

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.
He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly.
He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.
“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

Photo

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

“It is impossible that such efforts will not have any impact on enterprises,” Mr. Li said. “But in the long run, and from the macro perspective, the impact will be minimal.”

Pollution figures strongly into the broader debate over the cost of growth in China. Chinese officials are under pressure to keep the economy revving to provide good jobs for its young people and for rural residents moving into cities, among others. But stimulating growth has compounded China’s debt problems, added to its pollution woes and created other complications that Beijing must address.

If successful, the antipollution campaign could produce bluer skies and cleaner water across China, with potential health benefits for the country’s 1.3 billion people.

“For those areas that have suffered ecological damage, their leaders and cadres will be held responsible for life,” said Yang Weimin, the deputy director of the Communist Party’s Office of the Central Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs. “Our people will be able to see stars at night and hear birds chirp.”

But the effort could have a cost as well. Economists at Société Générale, a French bank, predicted in a recent research note that environmental restrictions could shave two-tenths of a percent off economic growth.

“Modestly slower growth will be a necessary sacrifice for maintaining social stability over the medium term,” it said.

Global prices for iron ore, a crucial material for making steel, have slumped in part on expectations that many Chinese steel mills will have to close temporarily this winter.

China is so important to the global economy that a campaign against pollution here could affect economies around the world, particularly iron ore exporters. Economists in Australia are already starting to become concerned.

Australia “is absolutely dependent on China — that’s true of iron ore prices, but it’s also true of Australia’s national income,” said Chris Richardson, the chief Australia economist for Deloitte, the global accounting firm.

Although China now leads the world in its installations of solar and wind power, it still relies on coal to generate three-quarters of its electricity. Electricity use by households is rising as more Chinese consumers buy air-conditioners and adopt the trappings of middle-class life.

Turning off electricity to residential customers to reduce pollution is politically unrealistic. That means steeper cuts may be necessary for industrial users.

Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the government-affiliated China Passenger Car Association, said in a telephone interview that the government had been inexorably tightening pollution standards. The country’s top priority has been shifting away from maximizing economic output and toward environmental protection, and companies must adapt, he said.

“Auto companies have adequate profits,” he said. “They can withstand it, but their production schedules may be affected.”

The pollution effort’s impact on global markets is uncertain, and on Monday Chinese officials said they may be overreacting.

Li Xinchuang, the deputy chairman of the government-affiliated China Steel Association, said Chinese production could continue undiminished if the industry simply closed excess, outdated steel foundries that pollute more.

Christine Loh, who was undersecretary for the environment for Hong Kong until last summer and worked closely with mainland officials, said that China had considerable potential for environmental cleanup without harming the economy.

“The new economy continues to thrive, while the old economy cleans up,” she wrote in an email. “So, the overall picture should not be seen too negatively.”

China’s track record on nationally mandated campaigns has been mixed. Told to maximize economic output, local officials have sometimes faked statistics, most recently in a few economically depressed areas of northeastern China.

President Xi Jinping endorsed the environmental effort in his work report last Wednesday at the start of the party congress. “Clear waters and lush mountains are as valuable as gold and silver,” he said.

Beyond maximizing economic output, Mr. Xi said that his country needed to address a new dilemma, and one that implies greater attention to environmental protection, “between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people’s ever-growing needs for a better life.”",China’s New Antipollution Push Could Cool Its Growth Engine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/business/china-pollution-economy.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“Congressional investigations unfortunately are usually overtly political investigations, where it is to one side’s advantage to drag things out,” said Mr. Gowdy, who made his name in Congress as a fearsome investigator of Democrats. He added, “The notion that one side is playing the part of defense attorney and that the other side is just these white hat defenders of the truth is laughable.”

Instead, he said, he is looking to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, to conduct an apolitical investigation.

None of the challenges have thus far stopped the committees. And given the closed-door nature of their work, prominent new avenues of inquiry could always emerge, such as Russia’s use of social media to sow chaos and discord, capable of influencing the public discourse.

But all three are up against a ticking clock, with Republicans in both chambers eager to wrap up the investigations before too long.

Particularly in the House, partisan fighting is likely to undermine whatever conclusions the committee reaches. One lawmaker said the committee would probably produce two reports. The first, written by Republicans, is expected to forcefully say there is no proof that anyone around Mr. Trump worked with Russia to tip the election. A Democratic report will probably raise unanswered questions and say that the committee was never fully committed to answering them.

The panel has been on rocky ground for months, with much of the controversy surrounding the committee’s chairman, Representative Devin Nunes of California. Mr. Nunes was forced to step aside from leading the investigation in April after it was disclosed that he had received classified information from the White House that showed that Mr. Trump and his associates were incidentally swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies.

Mr. Nunes handed control to three of the committee’s Republicans, Representatives K. Michael Conaway of Texas, Tom Rooney of Florida and Mr. Gowdy. Mr. Conaway, a well-liked accountant, helped put the investigation back on track and has maintained a productive relationship with Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the panel’s top Democrat.

But Democrats say Mr. Nunes, whose signature is required to issue subpoenas, has continued to meddle around the edges of the investigation, driving Republican inquiries into who financed a dossier of unsubstantiated information on purported links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr. Nunes, they say, is also participating in an investigation into the revealing of Trump associates caught up in American surveillance by Obama administration officials.

“Frankly, I have been doing everything I can to try to get us to do a credible investigation and to reach a common conclusion,” Mr. Schiff said. “I view these things as obstacles that are in the way to overcome, and I am doing my best to overcome them almost daily.”

A spokesman for Mr. Nunes did not reply to a request for comment.

Democrats were also incensed by Mr. Gowdy’s remarks to Mr. Kushner in July, which they said were representative of efforts by some Republicans to cut the investigation short. Shortly after the meeting, Mr. Schiff publicly accused Mr. Gowdy of playing defense attorney for the administration.

Republicans have returned the biting words, sharply criticizing Mr. Schiff, whose frequent television appearances irk them. Mr. Rooney used a vulgarity when he called Mr. Schiff’s comments about the Kushner interview nonsense. And Mr. Gowdy said on Friday that he had been compelled to weigh in by the Democrats’ repetitive and meandering questions — and that a transcript would show his own questions to have been appropriately aggressive.

The Republican said it had become clear where the committee was headed.

“Will our private conclusions be the same? Yes,” Mr. Gowdy said. “Will our public pronouncements be the same? No, of course not.”

“This is politics,” he added.

Across Capitol Hill, the tone has been different. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and its top Democrat, Mark Warner of Virginia, have worked to project a collaborative rapport that committee members insist is real.

At a rare news conference this month, the two senators said they had already expended significant resources verifying the conclusions of America’s spy agencies about Russia’s efforts to meddle in the election and were now taking steps to better understand its use of social media campaigns and to investigate the collusion question.

“At the end of the day, what we owe the American people is the truth,” Mr. Warner said in an interview on Thursday. “And if there’s something there, then they should know that. And if there’s not something there, I’ll be the first to acknowledge that.”

But other committee members have sought to contain expectations. At the news conference, Mr. Burr said investigators had “hit a wall” in their work on the dossier, which holds some of the most salacious allegations of collusion, because its author, Christopher Steele, would not meet with the committee. Mr. Burr also said he did not have a mandate to look for criminal activity.

“The special counsel is focused on criminal acts; we’re not focused on criminal acts,” he said. “If we find one, then they’re the first phone call we make.”

Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and a former chairwoman of the committee, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” this month that Mr. Mueller stood a much better chance of reaching a definitive conclusion about collusion than the committees did.

“There’s no proof yet that it’s happened, and I think that proof will likely come with Mr. Mueller’s investigation,” Ms. Feinstein said. “He’s got the ability to use a grand jury. He’s got the ability to use the power of subpoena without question. And he’s got the ability to do a criminal investigation.”

Both intelligence committees will also face questions about how much of what they find can be declassified and shared with the public. Mr. Burr said on Wednesday that his goal was to have the “meat of our business” done by late spring, in time for state governments to make changes to their voting systems before next year’s midterm elections. He said he would push to declassify the findings as much as possible.

The Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, has struggled to get a fledgling investigation off the ground. Ms. Feinstein, the committee’s top Democrat, and its chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, agreed this summer to begin investigating a cluster of topics related to the firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, including Mr. Comey’s handling of the Clinton email case and the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia.

Given its jurisdiction over the Justice Department, the panel is the best positioned on Capitol Hill to unravel the Comey saga, including possible obstruction of justice. But after a brief flurry of activity earlier this fall — including a closed-door interview with the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. — investigators reached an impasse in recent weeks, as Democrats and Republicans haggled over the next witnesses to call and documents to request.

Mr. Grassley has spent weeks negotiating with the Justice Department on the committee’s behalf to try to gain access to two key F.B.I. officials who worked closely with Mr. Comey, Carl Ghattas and James Rybicki. Hopes of interviewing Paul J. Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, collapsed over the summer after prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller warned Mr. Manafort that they planned to seek criminal charges against him.

On Wednesday, Mr. Grassley unilaterally sent a flurry of letters requesting interviews with and information from current and former Justice Department officials, as well as Mr. Kushner and others involved in a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer said to be offering incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton.

Senators said they were still hopeful that the committee would break through the logjam, but a deal had not been reached as of Friday.

A mutual friend of Cuddy and Simmons’s from graduate school, Kenworthey Bilz, a professor of law at the University of Illinois, tried to reassure Cuddy.
On Sept. 26, 2016, Amy Cuddy woke up and checked her phone to find a chilling text from a friend.
It’s not good.”If Amy Cuddy is a victim, she may not seem an obvious one: She has real power, a best-selling book, a thriving speaking career.
“Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself.","The video is now TED’s second-most popular, having been seen, to date, by some 43 million viewers. In the years after the talk, Cuddy became a sought-after speaker, a quasi celebrity and, eventually, the author of a best-selling book, “Presence,” in 2015. The power pose became the sun salutation for the professional woman on the cusp of leaning in. Countless hopefuls, male and female, locked themselves in bathroom stalls before job interviews to make victory V’s with their arms; media trainers had their speakers dutifully practice the pose before approaching the stage. Cuddy has gone on to give talks on power and the body (including power posing) and stereotyping to women’s groups in Australia, at youth homeless shelters, to skin-care workers by the thousands, to employees at Target and agents at State Farm Insurance. Cuddy’s fans approach her in airports, on ski slopes in Telluride, in long lines after her talks, to hug or to thank her, filled with their own power-posing stories — sharing how bold body language helped them get their jobs or win some match or confront a bully at work.

But since 2015, even as she continued to stride onstage and tell the audiences to face down their fears, Cuddy has been fighting her own anxieties, as fellow academics have subjected her research to exceptionally high levels of public scrutiny. She is far from alone in facing challenges to her work: Since 2011, a methodological reform movement has been rattling the field, raising the possibility that vast amounts of research, even entire subfields, might be unreliable. Up-and-coming social psychologists, armed with new statistical sophistication, picked up the cause of replications, openly questioning the work their colleagues conducted under a now-outdated set of assumptions. The culture in the field, once cordial and collaborative, became openly combative, as scientists adjusted to new norms of public critique while still struggling to adjust to new standards of evidence.

Cuddy, in particular, has emerged from this upheaval as a unique object of social psychology’s new, enthusiastic spirit of self-flagellation — as if only in punishing one of its most public stars could it fully break from its past. At conferences, in classrooms and on social media, fellow academics (or commenters on their sites) have savaged not just Cuddy’s work but also her career, her income, her ambition, even her intelligence, sometimes with evident malice. Last spring, she quietly left her tenure-track job at Harvard.

Some say that she has gained fame with an excess of confidence in fragile results, that she prized her platform over scientific certainty. But many of her colleagues, and even some who are critical of her choices, believe that the attacks on her have been excessive and overly personal. What seems undeniable is that the rancor of the critiques reflects the emotional toll among scientists forced to confront the fear that what they were doing all those years may not have been entirely scientific.

One of the seminal social-psychology studies, at the turn of the 20th century, asked a question that at the time was a novel one: How does the presence of other people change an individual’s behavior? Norman Triplett, a psychologist at Indiana University, found that when he asked children to execute a simple task (winding line on a fishing rod), they performed better in the company of other children than they did when alone in a room. Over the following decades, a new discipline grew up within psychology to further interrogate group dynamics: how social groups react in certain circumstances, how the many can affect the one.

The questions grew even more profound, using experiments to tease out universal susceptibilities, raising the possibility that behavior was more easily swayed by outside forces than personality researchers previously believed. The field reached a moment of unusual visibility in the mid-20th century, as practitioners, many of them Jewish refugees or first-generation immigrants from Europe, explored, post-World War II, the way group pressures or authority figures could influence human behavior. In one simple study on conformity in 1951, the social psychologist Solomon Asch found that people would agree that one drawn line matched the length of another — even if it clearly did not — if others around them all agreed that it did. In subsequent years, researchers like Stanley Milgram (who tested how people weighed their consciences against the demands of authority) and Philip Zimbardo (who observed the effect of power on students assigned as either prison guards or prisoners) rejected the traditional confines of the lab for more theatrical displays of human nature. “They felt the urgency of history,” says Rebecca Lemov, a professor of the history of science at Harvard. “They really wanted to make people look.”

Since the late 1960s, the field’s psychologists have tried to elevate the scientific rigor of their work, introducing controls and carefully designed experiments like the ones found in medicine. Increasingly complex ideas about the workings of the unconscious yielded research with the charm of mesmerists’ shows, revealing unlikely forces that seem to guide our behavior: that simply having people wash their hands could change their sense of culpability; that people’s evaluations of risk could easily be rendered irrational; that once people have made a decision, they curiously give more weight to information in its favor. Humans, the research often suggested, were reliably mercurial, highly suggestible, profoundly irrational, tricksters better at fooling ourselves than anyone else.

Already relatively accessible to the public, the field became even more influential with the rise of behavioral economics in the 1980s and 1990s, as visionaries like Richard Thaler, (who won the Nobel Prize in economics this month) found applications for counterintuitive social-psychology insights that could be used to guide policy. In 2000, Malcolm Gladwell, the author of the best-selling “Tipping Point,” applied irresistible storytelling to the science, sending countless journalists to investigate similar terrain and inspiring social psychologists to write books of their own. In 2006, Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard, published the best seller “Stumbling on Happiness” — a book that tried to explain why we plan so poorly for our own future. That same year, TED started airing its first videos, offering a new stage for social psychologists with compelling findings, ideally surprising ones. The field was experiencing a visibility unknown since the midcentury; business schools, eager for social psychologists’ insights into leadership and decision-making, started pursuing social psychologists, with better pay and more funding than psychology graduate schools could offer.

This moment of fizziness for the discipline was already underway when Cuddy arrived at Princeton’s graduate program in 2000, transferring there to follow her adviser, Susan Fiske, with whom she first worked at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She moved to Princeton with her husband at the time — they later divorced — and in her second year there, she had a child. Her academic work continued to thrive as she collaborated with Fiske on research on stereotyping, which found that groups of people (for example of a particular ethnicity) who were judged as nice were assumed to be less competent and vice versa. (“Just Because I’m Nice Don’t Assume I’m Dumb,” was the headline of a Harvard Business Review article by Cuddy.) Fiske and Cuddy’s resulting papers are still heavily cited, formulating a framework for stereotyping that proved hugely influential on the field.

And yet, especially early on at Princeton, Cuddy felt uncertain of her place there. She feared that her brain simply could not function at a high-enough level to power her through the program. Cuddy suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident the summer after her sophomore year in college, when a friend of hers fell asleep at the wheel while Cuddy was asleep in the back seat. In the months after the accident, Cuddy was told she should not expect to finish college; her fog was so deep that she remembers being retaught how to shop for groceries. Even after Cuddy recovered, her friends told her that she had changed, that she was not the same person — but she could not remember who she had been before. It took her four years and multiple false starts before she could return to college. Even after she was accepted to graduate school at University of Massachusetts, she confessed to Fiske that she feared she would not be able to keep up with the work.

Cuddy was trained as a ballet dancer — in between her stints at college, she danced as an apprentice with the Colorado Ballet — but her interest in studying the body and its relationship to power did not begin until 2009, her first year as a teacher at Harvard Business School. At the invitation of her department chair, she joined a small circle of academics meeting with Joe Navarro, a former F.B.I. agent who had written a book about body language. The invited parties, which included Dana Carney, a professor at Columbia University who studied body language and power, all spoke briefly about their work. In the conversation that followed, Navarro pointed out that Cuddy’s own body language, during her presentation, signaled insecurity: She was fiddling with her necklace, wrapping her arms around her torso.

Carney and Cuddy had been noticing the same kinds of body language in their female students, who performed well on written materials but lost points, compared with their male counterparts, on class participation. Their body language was constricted; they raised their hands with their elbows cradled in their other hands; they made themselves physically small; they spoke less often.

The two researchers wondered whether people whose physical cues looked like their female students’ — self-protective, insecure — would feel more powerful or even change their behavior if they simply adopted more expansive body positions.

Carney and Cuddy brainstormed a research project to test this question. At Columbia, Carney recruited students, telling them that they were part of a study intended to measure the effects of placing an electrocardiograph’s electrodes either above or below the heart. In the study of 42 subjects that they eventually published, experimenters arranged half the students into positions associated with high power (leaning back in a chair with feet crossed on a desk, for example) and half the students into positions associated with low power (like crossing arms in front of the body). Before and after the poses, experimenters took saliva swabs from the students to measure how the positions affected cortisol and testosterone levels. They also asked the students to report (before and after the poses) how in charge and powerful they felt on a scale of one to four (a measurement known as “self-reported feelings of power”). And they measured whether that feeling had what researchers call a “downstream effect” — a resulting behavior. People who feel power, the literature suggests, are more likely to engage in a range of certain behaviors, including risk-taking; so the experiment also measured the subjects’ willingness to bet on a roll of the dice.

“I remember how happy we were when Dana called me with the results,” Cuddy says. “Everything went in the direction it was supposed to.” The abstract that they eventually wrote — that their editors approved — reflects the incautious enthusiasm that characterized the era: “That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful, has real-world, actionable implications.”

In 2014, on a podcast called “Story Collider,” Cuddy connects the study that made her so famous with the accident that subtly shifted her identity. After the crash, she recalled, she felt as if she were merely passing for herself, an inauthentic version of who she used to be. It made sense, then, that she ended up “studying how people can become their aspirational selves,” she said. “How can you become a self that you are not now?”

The year that Amy Cuddy published her power-posing paper, Joseph Simmons, who attended graduate school at Princeton with Cuddy, was starting to think about his own seminal paper, one that would, unknown to either of them, have as much influence on her life as it would on his own; it would, in fact, change not just their lives but the field as they knew it, with wildly differing consequences for each of them.

Cuddy and Simmons, each of whom came from working-class backgrounds, had been fond of each other at Princeton, even if they did not socialize often: Cuddy was a new mother, and Simmons was five years younger and heavily committed to his softball team. Simmons considered Cuddy a friend, someone he was always happy to see at a party, despite their obvious differences: Cuddy, who used to follow the Grateful Dead, would have been the one dancing at the party, while Simmons would have been the one laughing with his close friend, a fellow graduate student named Leif Nelson, about the latest buzzy journal article that seemed, to them, ridiculous.

Having arrived at Princeton wide-eyed, straight from Mount St. Mary’s College in Maryland, Simmons, within a few years, appeared to some of his classmates to have lost some of his idealism about academia; maybe he exhibited his idealism about science in a way that could be mistaken for cynicism. Simmons had an unusual interest in statistics, the way its airtight logic could neatly prove, or disprove, the worth of an extravagant idea. He and Nelson were endlessly critical of other studies’ findings, an intellectual exercise they enjoyed and considered essential. The two of them, Nelson says, were “into thinking about subtleties in data collection and analysis.”

After finishing a postdoctoral program at Princeton, Simmons lost touch with Cuddy, who was by then teaching at Northwestern. He remained close to Nelson, who had befriended a behavioral scientist, also a skeptic, Uri Simonsohn. Nelson and Simonsohn kept up an email correspondence for years. They, along with Simmons, took particular umbrage when a prestigious journal accepted a paper from an emeritus professor of psychology at Cornell, Daryl Bem, who claimed that he had strong evidence for the existence of extrasensory perception. The paper struck them as the ultimate in bad-faith science. “How can something not be possible to cause something else?” Nelson says. “Oh, you reverse time, then it can’t.” And yet the methodology was supposedly sound. After years of debating among themselves, the three of them resolved to figure out how so many researchers were coming up with such unlikely results.

Over the course of several months of conference calls and computer simulations, the three researchers eventually determined that the enemy of science — subjectivity — had burrowed its way into the field’s methodology more deeply than had been recognized. Typically, when researchers analyzed data, they were free to make various decisions, based on their judgment, about what data to maintain: whether it was wise, for example, to include experimental subjects whose results were really unusual or whether to exclude them; to add subjects to the sample or exclude additional subjects because of some experimental glitch. More often than not, those decisions — always seemingly justified as a way of eliminating noise — conveniently strengthened the findings’ results. The field (hardly unique in this regard) had approved those kinds of tinkering for years, underappreciating just how powerfully they skewed the results in favor of false positives, particularly if two or three analyses were underway at the same time. The three eventually wrote about this phenomenon in a paper called “False-Positive Psychology,” published in 2011. “Everyone knew it was wrong, but they thought it was wrong the way it’s wrong to jaywalk,” Simmons recently wrote in a paper taking stock of the field. “We decided to write ‘False-Positive Psychology’ when simulations revealed it was wrong the way it’s wrong to rob a bank.”

Simmons called those questionable research practices P-hacking, because researchers used them to lower a crucial measure of statistical significance known as the P-value. The P stands for probable, as in: How probable is it that researchers would happen to get the results they achieved — or even more extreme ones — if there were no phenomena, in truth, to observe? (And no systematic error.) For decades, the standard of so-called statistical significance — also the hurdle to considering a study publishable — has been a P-value of less than 5 percent.

To examine how easily the science could be manipulated, Simmons and Simonsohn ran a study in which they asked 20 participants their ages (and their fathers’ birthdays). Half the group listened to the Beatles song “When I’m Sixty-Four”; the other listened to a control (the instrumental music “Kalimba”). Using totally standard methodology common to the field, they were able to prove that the participants who listened to the Beatles song were magically a year and a half younger than they were before they had heard the music. The subject heading of the explanation: “How Bad Can It Be? A Demonstration of Chronological Rejuvenation.” It was witty, it was relatable — everyone understood that it was a critique of the fundamental soundness of the field.

“We realized entire literatures could be false positives,” Simmons says. They had collaborated with enough other researchers to recognize that the practice was widespread and counted themselves among the guilty. “I P-hacked like crazy all through my time at Princeton, and I still couldn’t get interesting results,” Simmons says.

The paper generated its fair share of attention, but it was not until January 2012, at a tense conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology in San Diego, that social psychologists began to glimpse the iceberg looming ahead — the sliding furniture, the recriminations, the crises of conscience and finger-pointing and side-taking that would follow. At the conference, several hundred academics crowded into the room to hear Simmons and his colleagues challenge the methodology of their field. First, Leslie John, then a graduate student, now an associate professor at the Harvard School of Business, presented a survey of 2,000 social psychologists that suggested that P-hacking, as well as other questionable research practices, was common. In his presentation, Simonsohn introduced a new concept, a graph that could be used to evaluate bodies of research, using the P-values of those studies (the lower the overall P-values, the better). He called it a P-curve and suggested that it could be used, for example, to evaluate the research that a prospective job candidate submitted. To some, the implication of the combined presentations seemed clear: The field was rotten with the practice, and egregious P-hackers should not get away with it.

Journal-paper presentations on statistics are usually unremarkable affairs, but this one precipitated a sequence of exchanges so public that the field had to take notice. The first took place during that event, with Norbert Schwarz, an eminent social psychologist, in the audience. Schwarz, as he listened, grew furious: He believed that the methodology of the survey was flawed, and he indignantly objected to the idea of the P-curve as a kind of litmus test aimed at individuals. He would not let these ideas go uncontested; he interrupted loudly from the front row, violating standard academic etiquette. “The whole room was like, ‘Oh, my God, what just happened?’ ” recalls Brian Nosek, a social psychologist who now runs the Center for Open Science, intended to encourage and normalize replications. Others quietly thanked Schwarz for bravely speaking up.

Not content to stop there, Schwarz followed up four days later with an open letter to 5,000 members of the society’s listserv, explaining in further detail, and with some condescension, his reservations. Although Simonsohn was angry, he still hoped to cool down the conversation. He emailed Schwarz asking if they could talk, so that they could come to a sort of understanding, in the name of science, and release a joint statement. Schwarz agreed but told Simonsohn, over the course of several email exchanges, that he needed more time. Simonsohn lost patience after three weeks: He posted large parts of the email exchange on his personal website, then posted a blistering attack on Schwarz on the society’s listserv, filled with bold caps and underlines, in which he said, among other things, that he knew firsthand that Schwarz had engaged in P-hacking.

“I regret it,” Simonsohn says now about posting the emails. Since then, Simmons, Simonsohn and Nelson say they have given a lot of thought to codes of conduct for communicating responsibly when conveying concerns about a scientist’s work. But the academic blowup between Simonsohn, then a relative unknown in social psychology, and Schwarz, the standard-bearer, signaled from the beginning that leaders on each side would ignore the norms of scientific discourse in an effort to discredit the other. One imminent shift in methods would bring another shift — one of tone — that would affect the field almost as drastically.

After 2012, questions of methodology started dominating every social-psychology conference, as did the topic of replications. Across disciplines, a basic scientific principle is that multiple teams should independently verify a result before it is accepted as true. But for the majority of social-psychology results, even the most influential ones, this hadn’t happened. Brian Nosek, who started the Reproducibility Project (now called the Center for Open Science), an effort to test 100 important social-psychology papers, said that recognition of potential flawed methodology only fueled interest in his project. “The paper shone a light on how easily things could go wrong,” Nosek says. “Knowing that possibility in concept made the Reproducibility Project a test case in some people’s mind of ‘Does it?’ ”

For years, researchers treated journal articles, and their authors, with a genteel respect; even in the rare cases where a new study explicitly contradicted an old one, the community assumed that a lab error must account for the discrepancy. There was no incentive to replicate, in any case: Journals were largely not interested in studies that had already been done, and failed replications made people (maybe even your adviser) uncomfortable.

But in the years after that Society of Personality and Social Psychology conference, a sense of urgency propelled a generation of researchers, most of them under 40, to re-examine the work of other, more established researchers. And politeness was no longer a priority. “All of a sudden you have people emailing other people, asking for their data and then writing blog posts accusing them of shoddy practices,” says Eli Finkel, a social psychologist at Northwestern. “That was unheard-of. Now it was happening all the time.” Some blog posts took on the impact of journal articles, as interested parties weighed in with an impromptu peer review. In 2014, Psychological Science started giving electronic badges, an extra seal of approval, to studies that made their data and methodologies publicly available and preregistered their design and analysis ahead of time, so that researchers could not fish around for a new hypothesis if they turned up some unexpected findings.

Not surprisingly, replicators sometimes encountered the kind of outraged resistance that Simmons and Simonsohn initially did. The same month that Simmons and Simonsohn gave their talk, Stéphane Doyen, a social psychologist in Belgium, published a paper challenging a classic study in the field of priming, which holds that small cues, like exposure to certain words, can subconsciously trigger behaviors. The original study found that research subjects walked more slowly after being exposed to words associated with old age; the replicators found no such effect and titled their journal article “Behavioral Priming: It’s All in the Mind; but Whose Mind?” John Bargh, a professor at Yale, a luminary who published the original study, responded with a combative post on Psychology Today’s blog, claiming that discrepancies in the experiment design accounted for the difference and calling the researchers “incompetent or ill informed.” When other priming studies failed to replicate later that year, the Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, who discussed priming in his book “Thinking Fast and Slow,” wrote a letter to social psychologists who studied the effect, urging them to turn their attitude around. “To deal effectively with the doubts, you should acknowledge their existence and confront them straight on,” he wrote.

The intention of replicators was now unassailably noble — who could argue with better science? — but there was also, for the first time, status to be found in topplings, as journals started publishing more replications, many of which received lavish press attention. It was also inevitable that those being challenged would read envy into their attackers’ motivations. (In a tweet, Gilbert described those he deemed the worst offenders as “shameless little bullies.”)

Jay Van Bavel, a social psychologist at New York University, has tweeted openly about a published nonreplication of one of his studies and believes, as any scientist would, that replications are an essential part of the process; nonetheless, he found the experience of being replicated painful. “It is terrifying, even if it’s fair and within normal scientific bounds,” he says. “Because of social media and how it travels — you get pile-ons when the critique comes out, and 50 people share it in the view of thousands. That’s horrifying for anyone who’s critiqued, even if it’s legitimate.”

The field, clearly, was not moving forward as one. “In the beginning, I thought it was all ridiculous,” says Finkel, who told me it took him a few years before he appreciated the importance of what became known as the replication movement. “It was like we had been having a big party — what big, new, fun, cool stuff can we discover? And we forgot to double-check ourselves. And then the reformers were annoyed, because they felt like they had to come in after the fact and clean up after us. And it was true.”

In August 2014, the day before her second marriage, Amy Cuddy learned that a replication of her 2010 study led by a 34-year-old economist at the University of Zurich named Eva Ranehill had failed to yield the same results. “I remember thinking, Oh, bummer,” Cuddy says. But she was not distraught; often there was some perfectly good reason for a discrepancy in two studies of the same concept.

There were several key differences — Ranehill’s sample size, at 200, was much bigger, and she had designed a double-blind setup. Ranehill had her subjects hold two poses for three minutes each. She did not find an increase in either risk-taking behavior or the expected hormone changes.

Cuddy thought it was likely that the difference in time — six minutes of standing versus two — was a crucial one and probably accounted for the disparity in the results. “It’s not a crazy thing to test,” Cuddy says. “I guess under the theory that more is better? But it could go the other way — three minutes is a really, really long time to be holding a pose like that. It seems likely to me that it would be really uncomfortable, but sure, study it, and let’s see.”

She was relieved to see that the “feelings of power” finding had replicated. But Ranehill used language in her write-up that played down that finding’s importance. Although in one study of her own, Cuddy also played down the finding, she has otherwise consistently, in interviews, been enthusiastic about the idea that a body posture could change someone’s feelings. “We’re psychologists,” she says. “We try to change how people feel.” She also, at the time of the Ranehill replication, still anticipated that other research would probably show downstream effects — more risk taking, or more competitiveness, or better performance in job interviews.

By the time Cuddy got word of Ranehill’s replication, she had given her TED talk, developed a significant speaking career and was writing a book. Simmons had received tenure at Wharton and was writing, with Simonsohn, a blog called Data Colada, in which they sometimes tried to replicate other people’s work. By 2014, there was near-unanimous agreement the Data Colada team had profoundly changed the field’s research techniques for the better. But for the average researcher, an email from someone at Data Colada signaled unpleasantness ahead. “It’s like the police knocking on your door in the middle of the night,” one psychologist said.

In the wake of Ranehill’s failed replication, Cuddy and Carney set to work on a response. Carney, who is now a tenured associate professor of management at the University of California, Berkeley, tried to chart a P-curve of all 33 studies they were mentioning in their paper (which was already under review). Carney sent the paper and the P-curve to Nelson for some feedback, but he sent it on to Simmons and Simonsohn, as they were the experts.

The letter Simmons wrote back to Carney was polite, but he argued that her P-curve had not been executed correctly. He and Simonsohn had each executed P-curves of the 33 studies, and each found that it was flat, suggesting that the body of literature it reflected did not count as strong evidence. He did write that “conceptual points raised before that section are useful and contribute to the debate” but that they should take the P-curve out. “Everybody wins in that case.” According to Cuddy, she and Carney thought the P-curve science was not as settled as Simmons believed it to be. But afraid of public recrimination, they did exactly as he said — they took out the P-curve.

A few weeks after the paper was published, Cuddy learned from Simmons and Simonsohn that they were writing a blog post on the paper. A mutual friend of Cuddy and Simmons’s from graduate school, Kenworthey Bilz, a professor of law at the University of Illinois, tried to reassure Cuddy. “He’ll say his piece, and you’ll say yours, and that will be the end of it,” Bilz told Cuddy. “It’s not like you’re going to become the poster girl for this kind of thing.”

Cuddy was at her home office in Boston when she received an email from Simmons and Simonsohn. They showed her a draft of the post they planned to put online criticizing the paper; they invited feedback on anything the authors felt was incorrect or unfair. “We embrace trying to be as civil as possible but understanding that at some point you are going to say, ‘You were wrong,’ ” Simonsohn said. “People won’t like that, no matter how you much you dress it up. It’s not something people want to hear.”

The post criticized the new paper, as well as the 2010 study. It showed Simmons and Simonsohn’s own unfavorable P-curve and essentially argued that the original published findings on hormones and risk-taking were probably a result of chance. They did not include a feelings-of-power measure in the P-curve they showed. But the blog post did mention in its last footnote that there was a significant effect of power posing on “self-reported power,” although the language made it clear that it didn’t count for much: Simmons believes that self-reports of power generally reflect what is called a demand effect — a result that occurs when subjects intuit the point of the study. Cuddy believes that studies can be constructed to minimize that risk and that demand effects are often nuanced.

Cuddy responded to Simonsohn with a few points that they incorporated into the post but said she preferred to write a longer response in a context in which she felt more comfortable.

Cuddy felt ill when Simmons and Simonsohn published the post with the headline: “Reassessing the Evidence Behind the Most Popular TED Talk.” As illustration, they used a picture of Wonder Woman. Cuddy felt as if Simmons had set them up; that they included her TED talk in the headline made it feel personal, as if they were going after her rather than the work.

The post, which Simonsohn distributed to his email list of hundreds, quickly made the rounds. “People were sending me emails like I was dying of cancer,” Cuddy says. “It was like, ‘We send our condolences,’ ‘Holy crap, this is terrible’ and ‘God bless you; we wish we could do something, but obviously we can’t.’ ” She also knew what was coming, a series of events that did, in fact, transpire over time: subsequent scrutiny of other studies she had published, insulting commentary about her work on the field’s Facebook groups, disdainful headlines about the flimsiness of her research. She paced around, distraught, afraid to look at her email, afraid not to. She had just put together a tenure package and worried that the dust-up would be a continuing distraction.

Cuddy did not like seeing her work criticized in a non-peer-reviewed format, but she wrote a bland statement saying, essentially, that she disagreed with their findings and looked forward to “more progress on this important topic.” Carney reassured Cuddy in the months after the Data Colada post that their paper would eventually be vindicated — of course the effects were real; someone would prove it eventually.

Eventually, the Data Colada post caught the eye of another influential blogger, Andrew Gelman, a professor of statistics and political science at Columbia University, whose interest in Cuddy’s work would prove durable, exacting and possibly career-changing for Cuddy. Gelman wields his sizable influence on the field from afar, on his popular blog andrewgelman.com, where he posts his thoughts on best statistical practices in the sciences, with a frequent emphasis on what he sees as the absurd and unscientific. Gelman, who studied math and physics at M.I.T. before turning to statistics, does not believe that social psychology is any more guilty of P-hacking than, say, biology or economics. But he has devoted extensive attention to the field, especially in more recent years, in part because of the way the media has glorified social-psychology research. He is respected enough that his posts are well read; he is cutting enough that many of his critiques are enjoyed with a strong sense of schadenfreude.

Four months after the Data Colada post, Gelman, with a co-author, published an article in Slate about Carney and Cuddy’s 2010 study, calling it “tabloid fodder.” Eventually, Cuddy’s name began appearing regularly in the blog, both in his posts and in comments. Gelman’s writing on Cuddy’s study was coolly dismissive; it bothered him that Cuddy remained fairly silent on the replication and the Data Colada post. For all he knew, Cuddy was still selling the hormone effect in her speaking gigs and in her best-selling book, “Presence,” which he had not read. Had he looked, he would have been annoyed to see that Cuddy did not include a mention of the Ranehill replication. But he might have been surprised to see how little of the book focused on power posing (just a few pages).

On his site, Cuddy’s name, far from the only one he repeatedly invoked, became a go-to synecdoche for faulty science writ large. When he saw that Cuddy had been invited to speak at a conference, he wondered why the organizers had not invited a bunch of other famous figures he clearly considered bad for science, including Diederik Stapel, who had been accused of outright fraud.

His site became a home for frequently hostile comments from his followers. “She has no serious conception of ‘science,’ ” one posted. Another compared Cuddy to Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos chief executive under investigation for misleading investors. Though Gelman did encourage his readers to stick to the science, he rarely reined anyone in. In one exchange in July 2016, a commenter wrote, “I’ve wondered whether some of Amy Cuddy’s mistakes are due to the fact that she suffered severe head trauma as the result of a car accident some years ago.” Gelman replied, “A head injury hardly seems necessary to explain these mistakes,” pointing out that her adviser, Fiske, whom he has also criticized, had no such injury but made similar errors.

Gelman, whom I met in his office in late June, is not scathing in person; he is rather mild, soft-spoken even. Gelman was vague when asked if he felt there was anything unusual about the frequency of his comments on Cuddy (“People send me things, and I respond,” he said). He said it was Cuddy who was unrelenting. He later emailed me to make sure I was aware that she attacked him and Simmons and Simonsohn on a private Facebook page, without backing up her accusations with evidence; he was still waiting for a clear renunciation of the original 2010 paper on the hormonal effects of power posing. “I would like her to say: ‘Jeez, I didn’t know any better. I was doing what they told me to do. I don’t think I’m a bad person, and it didn’t get replicated’ — rather than salvaging as much as she can.”

Gelman considers himself someone who is doing others the favor of pointing out their errors, a service for which he would be grateful, he says. Cuddy considers him a bully, someone who does not believe that she is entitled to her own interpretation of the research that is her field of expertise.

Cuddy has asked herself what motivates Gelman. “Why not help social psychologists instead of attacking them on your blog?” she wondered aloud to me. “Why not come to a conference or hold a seminar?” When I asked Gelman if he would ever consider meeting with Cuddy to hash out their differences, he seemed put off by the idea of trying to persuade her, in person, that there were flaws in her work.

“I don’t like interpersonal conflict,” he said.

On Sept. 26, 2016, Amy Cuddy woke up and checked her phone to find a chilling text from a friend. “I’m so sorry,” it said. “Are you O.K.?” She felt a familiar dread, something closer to panic. For the past year, she had mostly stopped going to social-psychology conferences, feeling a chill from her community. Another social psychologist had told her that a graduate student asked if she really was friends with Cuddy. When she responded, “Yes,” the young woman asked, “Why?”

It was the kind of information Cuddy wished she did not have; her closest friends were told to stop passing on or commenting about that kind of thing, but acquaintances still did it. She felt adrift in her field. She worried about asking peers to collaborate, suspecting that they would not want to set themselves up for intense scrutiny. And she felt betrayed, not just by those who cut her down on social media, in blog posts, even in reviews (one reviewer called her “a profiteer,” not hiding his contempt), but also by some of those who did not publicly defend her. She was not wrong to think that at least in some cases, it was fear, rather than lack of support for her, that kept people from speaking up. Two tenured psychology professors at Ivy League universities acknowledged to me that they would have publicly defended some of Cuddy’s positions were they not worried about making themselves targets on Data Colada and elsewhere.

Two days before Cuddy received that text from a friend, Gelman once again posted about the power-posing research, but this time he issued a challenge to Dana Carney. “When people screw up or cheat in their research, what do their collaborators say?” he wondered in the post. For Carney, he wrote, “it was not too late.” Unknown to Cuddy and Gelman, Carney had already linked, in her C.V., to Simmon and Simonsohn’s critique of that first, influential 2010 study, but she hadn’t made the kind of statement or gesture that Gelman expected from Cuddy.

That morning of the troubling text, Cuddy logged onto her computer and discovered that Carney had posted on her website a document (then quickly published on New York magazine’s site) that seemed intended to distance its author forever, in every way, from power posing. “I do not believe that ‘power pose’ effects are real,” she said. Not only had she stopped studying power poses, “I discourage others from studying power poses.”

She listed a number of methodological concerns she had, in retrospect, about the 2010 paper, most of which, Cuddy says, Carney had never raised with her. In an email a few months earlier, Carney had clearly told Cuddy that she thought the study’s data was flimsy, the sample was tiny, the effects were barely there. But Cuddy said she had never received notice that this kind of renunciation was coming. Carney declined to comment for this article, but Nelson, who is in her department, said she was clearly in a tough position, saddled with all the negatives of the work — the hit to her reputation — with none of the upside: the speaking fees and the positive feedback from teary fans who no doubt fuel Cuddy’s conviction in the research.

For much of the scientific world, Carney’s statement was an act of integrity and bravery. “Whoa! This is how to do it!” tweeted Michael Inzlicht, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Toronto who had eloquently written about his own crisis of confidence about his field of research, ego depletion.

To Cuddy, Carney’s post seemed so sweeping as to be vague, self-abnegating. Even Simonsohn, who made clear his support for Carney’s decision, thought the letter had a strangely unscientific vehemence to it. “If I do a bad job proving there’s a ninth planet, I probably shouldn’t say there’s a ninth planet,” he says. “But I shouldn’t say there is no ninth planet, either. You should just ignore the bad study and go back to base line.”

Cuddy wrote a lengthy response to Carney that New York magazine published. (New York, Slate and The Atlantic have closely reported on the replication movement.) Then she stopped taking phone calls and went almost completely offline. She found that she couldn’t eat; at 5-foot-5, Cuddy went down to 100 pounds.

Less than two weeks after Carney’s disavowal, Cuddy got on a plane so she could meet her commitment to speak to a crowd of 10,000 in Las Vegas. As frail as she had been since her accident, she headed to an arena in Las Vegas and roused the crowd, a tiny woman on a giant stage, taking up space, making herself big, feeling the relief of feeling powerful.

When I emailed Joe Simmons in July and asked to meet with him, he readily agreed but warned me that he does not check his email often. “I had to take email off my phone,” he explained when we met at a coffee shop across the river from Wharton. A lot of his work these days was stressful — sometimes the emailer was angry, sometimes he was — so if he looked at his phone before bed, “that was it — I wouldn’t sleep all night.”

When Simmons and I met, I asked him why he eventually wrote such a damning blog post, when his initial correspondence with Carney did not seem particularly discouraging. He and Simonsohn, he told me, had clearly explained to Cuddy and Carney that the supporting studies they cited were problematic as a body of work — and yet all the researchers did was drop the visual graph, as if deliberately sidestepping the issue. They left in the body of literature that Simmons and Simonsohn’s P-curve discredited. That apparent disregard for contrary evidence was, Simmons said, partly what prompted them to publish the harsh blog post in the first place.

But the email that Simmons and Simonsohn had sent was, in fact, ambiguous: They had explicitly told her to drop the P-curve and yet left the impression that the paper was otherwise sound. At my request, Simmons looked back at his original email. I watched as he read it over. “Oh, yeah,” he said quietly. He had a pained look on his face. “We did say to drop the graph, didn’t we?” He read it over again, then sat back. “I didn’t remember that. This may be a big misunderstanding about — that email is too polite.”

Cuddy and Carney had taken their advice literally. Simmons stood by his analysis but recognized that there was confusion at play in how they interpreted the events that transpired. Simmons says he harbored no ill will toward Cuddy before criticizing her paper; if anything, he remembered her warmly. “She was great,” he said, smiling at the memory. “We published the blog post despite my history with Amy. Because I realized that once we pulled the trigger on this. … ” He did not finish the sentence. Cuddy had, in fact, become the poster girl for this kind of work, which even he thought was not fair. “The original study wasn’t particularly egregious,” he said. “It was published in 2010 before anyone was thinking about this.”

For a moment, the scientist allowed the human element to factor into how he felt about his email response to that paper. “I wish,” he said, “I’d had the presence of mind to pick up the phone and call Amy.”

The public nature of the attacks against Cuddy have reverberated among social psychologists, raising questions about the effects of harsh discourse on the field and particularly on women. Earlier this year at the conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology, there was a presentation of a 2016 survey of 700 social psychologists, assessing their perceptions of the influence of social media on their careers. The subsequent conversation on popular Facebook groups was so combative that Alison Ledgerwood, a social psychologist at the University of California, Davis, felt the need to respond in a blog post. In it, she argued that if scientists keep having hostile conversations on social media, women are more likely to be driven away from the field. (Women in the profession, the survey presented at the conference reported, participated less than their male colleagues in social-media discussions.)

Even people who believe that the methodological reforms are essential say its costs to science are real. “It’s become like politics — we’ve created two camps of people who shouldn’t be in two camps in the first place,” says Jay Van Bavel, the social psychologist at N.Y.U. “It’s perceived slights and defensiveness, and everybody has some history or grievance — and it will never end because there is that history of perceived grievances, of one of your colleagues who has been put through it, or criticized your friend in a public forum. It’s terrible for science. It’s not good.”

If Amy Cuddy is a victim, she may not seem an obvious one: She has real power, a best-selling book, a thriving speaking career. She did not own up fully to problems in her research or try to replicate her own study. (She says there were real hurdles to doing so, not least of which was finding a collaborator to take that on.) But many of her peers told me that she did not deserve the level of widespread and sometimes vicious criticism she has endured. “Amy has been the target of mockery and meanness on Facebook, on Twitter, in blog posts — I feel like, Wow, I have never seen that in science,” Van Bavel says. “I’ve only been in it for 15 years, but I’ve never seen public humiliation like that.”

As a result, the breadth of the accusations — how diffuse they are — could easily be mistaken for the depth of her scientific missteps, which at the outset were no different from those of so many of her peers. “We were all being trained to simplify, to get our message out there — there were conferences and panels on how to do it,” says Richard Petty, a social psychologist at Ohio State. “One of the ironies is that Amy just did it more successfully.”

I was surprised to find that some of the leaders in the replication movement were not Cuddy’s harshest critics but spoke of her right to defend her work in more measured tones. “Why does everyone care so much about what Amy says?” Brian Nosek says. “Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself. Leif Nelson, one of the three pioneers of the movement, says Cuddy is no different from most other scientists in her loyalty to her data. “Authors love their findings,” he says. “And you can defend almost anything — that’s the norm of science, not just in psychology.” He still considers Cuddy a “very serious psychologist”; he also believes the 2010 paper “is a bunch of nonsense.” But he says, “It does not strike me as at all notable that Amy would defend her work. Most people do.”

Every researcher has a threshold at which he or she is convinced of the evidence; in social psychology, especially, there is no such thing as absolute proof, only measures of probability. In recent months, Cuddy reached the threshold needed to alter her thinking on the effect of hormones. She mentioned, at a psychology conference where she was presenting her work, that a study had recently been conducted on power posing. “They found no hormonal effects,” she said before taking a breath. “That study is done very well, and I trust those results.” Although 11 new papers have recently been published that do not show the downstream effects of power posing on behaviors, Cuddy is still fighting for power posing. The research, she says, still shows its effect on feelings of power: At the conference, she presented a comprehensive meta-analysis, a version of which, she says, she will soon publish, with a strong P-curve supporting that, and she also presented a P-curve suggesting that power posing had a robust effect on self-evaluations, emotions and moods.

Cuddy now seems ready to move on to a new phase. We met near her home in Newton, Mass., in August. Cuddy, smiling, fresh from physical therapy for a torn ACL, was in a tennis skirt, looking young and more lighthearted than I had ever seen her. She had abandoned the dream of tenure. She was planning a new project, a new book, she told me. It was coming together in her mind: “Bullies, Bystanders and Bravehearts.” It would be personal; there would be research; she would write, and she would talk, and she would interview people who had suffered fates worse than her own and bounced back. She would tell their stories and hers, and because she is a good talker, people would listen.",When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Ms. Soleimani and Mr.","Larger hotel chains, like Marriott or the Four Seasons Resorts, will typically refund any deposits in a disaster, but smaller businesses may not have funds to recoup. “If you book at a smaller hotel or bed-and-breakfast and they’re wiped out, whatever deposit you wired them is going to be very difficult to get back,” Ms. Gregoli said.

Insure Yourself

Weddings today can be as expensive as a car, sometimes even more, so protect your investment. Purchase wedding insurance. It isn’t very expensive, Ms. Gregoli said, but it may protect against any unexpected events. It starts at about $150 for a basic policy, but rates go up based on such things as location, the number of guests and whether the event is inside or outside in a tent. The total cost of the wedding will also affect the rate: A $10,000 even is going to carry a lower premium than one costing $150,000.

Insurance can offer peace of mind. For example, if the space you booked for your wedding is destroyed by a hurricane or fire, a good insurance policy will cover the costs of rescheduling and reimburse you for any lost deposits. (It will even cover things like losing the rings before the wedding or if a bride’s gown is lost in baggage.)

Find Out Who’s in Charge

If there is an extreme event — an act of terrorism, say, something weather-related, or a fire — don’t rely on hotel wedding planners. Often, the general manager will have clearer answers, Ms. Gregoli said.

One month after Hurricane Maria passed over Anguilla, Ms. Gregoli and one of her couples had a conference call with the general manager at a resort on the island. They needed to know specifics about the damage: Is it landscaping and trees that were hardest hit — or is there structural damage? Would the ferry dock be rebuilt in time to accept guests? Lucky for this particular bride and groom, the general manager confirmed all repairs would be finished for their June 2018 nuptials. But another one of Ms. Gregoli’s clients, whose wedding was booked in December at the Ritz Carlton in St. Thomas, in the United States Virgin Islands, wasn’t as fortuitous. That couple had to reschedule for the following year.

The Fine Print

Read contracts carefully. In an extreme event, what is the wedding site’s obligation to keep you informed?

Sonia Byck-Barwick of Paradise Ridge Vineyards, which was devastated in the early days of the wildfires in Santa Rosa, Calif., asserted that refunding any and all deposits the winery had collected for upcoming weddings was a top priority. Weddings were a major part of the boutique winery’s business; it had 24 already booked for 2018, plus 8 to 10 in the remainder of 2017 (including one on Oct. 14).

“It’s a big revenue hit, that’s undeniable,” Ms. Byck-Barwick said. “But we’ll be back up and running. I feel so much more pain for everyone who lost their homes.”

Backup Plan

Have an alternate plan. If you can’t make it to your destination is there somewhere you can marry locally?

Roya Soleimani and Andrew Charles Winner, who live in San Francisco, had planned their wedding for Oct. 15 at Chardonnay Golf Club in Napa County. They hoped to stick to their original plans until the preceding Thursday, when Mr. Winner’s brother, a firefighter in San Rafael, Calif., engaged in fighting the blaze, told them it was time to call it.

“I was researching the best respiratory masks to buy for our guests and vendors,” said Ms. Soleimani, 32, a corporate communications manager at Google.org. “We were starting to realize that the idea of celebrating in Napa, when all of this was going on, just didn’t feel right.” (The couple is quick to point out that their original venue and vendors offered full refunds, nearly across the board.)

Ms. Soleimani and Mr. Winner, 38, a consultant for First Republic Bank and an appraisals specialist, put out the call that they were searching for a new venue for their 230 guests. Soon, they were put in touch with the Julia Morgan Ballroom in San Francisco, and were gratified by the venue’s immediate willingness to help — and at a discount, no less.

“We’re making major cuts to our normal rates,” said Phil Spiegel, the executive vice president of Merchants Exchange Productions, which runs the ballroom. “This is our way of helping.” The ballroom hosted two displaced weddings last weekend and is currently taking inquiries from wine country couples for the weeks and months ahead.",5 Ways to Protect Yourself Against Unexpected Wedding Catastrophe,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/fashion/weddings/5-ways-to-protect-yourself-against-unexpected-wedding-catastrophe.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Q. Why are hearing aids so incredibly costly? Is it patents? A lock on manufacturing? With today’s digital revolution, it would seem that they should be approaching the cost of eyeglasses.

A. Hearing aids remain expensive — $900 to $3,500 or more per ear — but that is likely to be changing soon. The Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017, which became law in August, includes a provision for selling hearing aids over the counter to adults with mild to moderate hearing loss in two to three years. The extra time allows the F.D.A. to establish safety, effectiveness and labeling standards. Under the new law, hearing aids are expected to cost around $300 or less per ear.

Experts don’t know exactly why hearing aids are still so costly, except that companies continue to invest in improvements, and fees usually cover the services of a highly trained audiologist.

Cost reductions can’t come soon enough for those who depend on hearing aids. Barbara Kelley, executive director of the Hearing Loss Association of America, said her office gets a handful of calls every day from people needing help paying for hearing aids. The association refers them to the Department of Veterans Affairs, Medicaid or foundations like the Lions Club, depending on their military status and where they live. “It’s still really tough,” she said. Medicare does not cover the cost of hearing aids, though there’s a bill before Congress that would require such coverage.

“Eighty percent of people who could benefit from a hearing aid don’t get one,” Ms. Kelley said, often because of cost or access to care. “Some of the reason is stigma: They don’t want to be seen as being old.”

Research has clearly shown that hearing problems can have serious health consequences, leading to falls, cognitive problems, depression and social isolation. There are other risks too, noted Elizabeth Levine-Davis, a clinical audiologist and coordinator of the Hearing Aid Dispensary at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai: “You can’t hear the car coming down the block, your home smoke alarm, the doorbell, things like that.”",Why Are Hearing Aids So Expensive?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/well/live/why-are-hearing-aids-so-expensive.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

In data to be released this week, the transportation authority said it would show that it is working toward meeting year-end goals regarding inspections and repairs at key points in the vast system.

The first thing that needs to be done is to stabilize the patient, he said, and stop the bleeding. But officials said the bigger aim by early next year was to return service to the pre-crisis level, which would require reducing the number of major incidents by 40 percent. A major incident is defined as a problem that causes the delay of more than 50 trains. At the height of the crisis, there were more than 80 major incidents on average a month.

And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common.
He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.
Photo“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular?
PhotoIn an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well.","From grizzled cotton farmers to quiet small-town buildings and roadside stands, Walker Evans built his reputation on chronicling America’s out-of-the-way places and people. And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common. Born Walker Evans III, the scion of a prominent family, he grew up in privilege, attending Phillips Academy and then Williams College, dropping out after one year.

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

Photo

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

We ate our last meal there before heading out of the city toward the vast tea estates and spice gardens that lace the Cardamom Hills of Kerala.

To get there, we spent nearly five hours in a van grinding our way up the steep hills of the Western Ghats, stopping only for plates of vegetable curry and glasses of fresh pineapple juice. The road narrowed as we worked our way past wildlife sanctuaries and forests of sandalwood. The oppressive mugginess of the city had lifted, giving way to weather cool enough that I considered digging out the one light sweater I brought. Tea estates cascaded down the steep valleys, their tight, trimmed shrubs looking as manicured as a formal English garden.

Manoj Vasudevan, a photographer who teaches tourism in Kerala and who has been exploring the mountains here for decades, was our guide. That included explaining the finer points of mountain driving in India, which required faith, acceptance and a good horn.

The strips of pavement hugging the mountainside were often only wide enough to hold one vehicle, but sometimes three would try to navigate a stretch at once. Horns were essential to blast our gentle warnings on blind curves. Inevitable traffic knots that brought traffic to a stop were solved when a driver or a passenger would hop out and calmly direct cars and buses to back up or edge around each other. Everyone would then head on without a harsh word or even a friendly wave.

“We practice a kind of practical politeness,” he explained.

Many of the sprawling tea estates we passed are owned by Tata Global Beverages, which maintains 51 estates in India and Sri Lanka. We stopped for lunch at the Briar Tea Bungalow, a rambling, low-slung Colonial-style building northwest of Munnar that the British built on a mountain top surrounded by 2,500 acres of tea plants.

Soon, we were back on the road headed for the heart of spice country. Small spice gardens started to pop up the way “u-pick” apple orchards do in upstate New York. Some offer tours for a couple of hundred rupees, about $3. Others declare themselves to be organic, and have small shops where packets of vibrant ground turmeric, nutmeg and green cardamom pods can be had for prices that would make a cook used to prices at an American grocery store fall to her knees.

Touring spice gardens is a fairly new pursuit here, driven by an increasing appreciation of agriculture and cooking among tourists.

“Twenty years ago when I traveled this way there was not even a single place,” Mr. Vasudevan said. “Ten years ago there were maybe a few places. Now, they’re all over. Somebody started it then everyone started copying it because they saw that people were becoming curious to see how spices grow.”

Photo

And then there’s black pepper. From the time of the Roman Empire, people have been coming to Kerala for black pepper. Wars have been fought over it. The plants that produce the fruit are everywhere. Their thin green vines wrap around jackfruit, mango and coconut trees that grow with such abandon they don’t seem to need a bit of human effort to thrive.

Cardomom is a big money maker here, but black pepper remains the coin of the realm. Even though Indian pepper growers are fighting off cheaper production in countries like Vietnam, there are still plenty of wealthy owners who oversee vast plots of pepper plants. But in every village and small town, you can find someone who grows a little pepper and sells a few kilos when a bill comes due or there’s a wedding to fund. About 30 percent of the people who live here are involved in the spice trade, Mr. Vasudevan estimated.

Ms. Gomez and I found our way to a small, organic spice garden in Thekkady where Thomas Puttampurakkal, a retired Kerala police officer in his 80s, tends to pepper vines that twist around jackfruit and nutmeg trees growing in what seems to be an agricultural system with no real pattern or structure.

He uses only elephant dung for fertilizer. Pepper, he explained, is all about terroir. The best grows naturally here in the high elevations, the green berries protected by the shade until they ripen.

The green pepper berries become black pepper after they spend four or five days in the sun. Those same green berries can also produce white pepper, whose pungency is softened by a long soak in water before they are dried and their husks removed.

Photo

Ms. Gomez and I wandered through Mr. Puttampurakkal’s spice garden like kids in a toy store. We rubbed curry leaves between our fingers and dug up turmeric roots. We searched around the bottom of willowy cardamom stalks 12 feet tall, looking for green buds. We sucked the custardy pulp off the seeds inside cacao pods, smelled clove buds and peeled a bit of bark from a cinnamon tree.

We found a nutmeg tree and pulled down a round piece of fruit the size of my palm. Someone had a knife, so we sliced it open to reveal a glossy dark gem covered in a lacy red coat. The seed is nutmeg, the red covering mace.

In the little shop Mr. Puttampurakkal runs, I bought bags of the small, local black Malabar peppercorns locals call tribal pepper and another of the fat, fragrant peppercorns called Tellicherry, named after the famed growing region in Northern Kerala.

I bit into one. It tasted like citrus and flowers. In a split-second, heat overtook the flavor, like hot perfume in my mouth.

Ms. Gomez wandered in, her hands filled with nutmeg. “You have no idea how excited I am,” she said.

Photo

Mr. Puttampurakkal was laughing, probably at us. It was hard to tell. It didn’t matter.

I had made it to the Cardamom hills. Ms. Gomez was right. It was God’s own country. Or, at least, a cook’s.

If You Go

Kerala is always warm, but can get downright hot and muggy from March to May. December through February is reliably dry and cooler, and also more crowded. The monsoon season comes in May and can last until November. The mountains with their spice gardens and teas estates are always cooler than the coast. It’s relatively easy to rent a car or van with a driver, or take a small tour bus to the spice and tea regions. Car rentals are available, too.

Tea fans can visit the Briar Tea Bungalows (V-363, Kannan Devan Hills Village, Talliar post, Idukki; teabungalows.com/talayar-valley-bungalow-munnar/) in the Talayar Valley in Munnar, where you can pick your own tea onthe 2,500-acre estate.

This is not exactly an avant-garde idea. I learned it from my mom, who learned it from hers, and so on, back until what I would imagine was the dawn of time. This has always been the role of the black mother in the community. We watch the kids. All of them. This is that “village” that we hear so much about but that has somehow been forgotten. All I’ve done is try to revive its spirit.

We were brought to that corner in June 2015 when a mother was murdered while breaking up a fight. That summer there was another murder one block to the east and then another one block to the west. A police siege and an unlawful search of a 94-year-old woman’s home also happened on the block that summer.

The children saw all of this, and unfortunately, those will always be their memories. They’ll never forget the sobbing over an aunt shot on the street, the fear of the police who lined the big boys up and took them to jail. This was what their summers had looked like for so long. As a mom and a human being, I could not go back to my home unbothered. These were my memories now, too. I didn’t want them, and I didn’t want the children to have them. So we made brand-new ones.

After just three summers on the block, violent crime and gun-related incidents in that census tract have declined dramatically. And this has had a ripple effect as far as a mile out. The neighborhood elementary school attended by a majority of our children has also seen improvements in student performance. All of this has happened with no real resources, new jobs or governmental assistance.

The most frequently asked question we get is: How did you do it? It’s simple. We cared. We put on hot-pink T-shirts, got our lawn chairs and a couple of packs of hot dogs, and went to the corner and cooked some dinner. We showed up and established a presence in the neighborhood. We’re also creating small community centers in vacant lots around the city, where kids can play, study and get a hot meal.

We also listened to the people there. They told us how to stop gun violence in their neighborhood and pretty much all the other ones just like it. They told us they needed resources, jobs and skills training. They told us they needed schools that could prepare their children to compete in a world that will soon be run by computers. They need a share of that $95 million planned for a new police and firefighter training center, because now the community polices itself.

They told us that it was great that their children were learning their rights in school but that they wanted more qualified teachers who could teach them to read and write. And with a chunk of that $95 million, we could afford it. Sure, we still have gang violence. The cure for that is bringing jobs and resources to impoverished neighborhoods. We know that.

At the elite, church-affiliated private schools I attended, boys were intolerantly expected to imitate macho men. I felt acutely anxious because I couldn’t do that. I’d hide in my bedroom, consumed by guilt and shame; dropping down on my knees, I’d ask God to forgive the “sins” of my life. How I wished that others knew me as the girl I felt myself to be!

What I really needed was informed medical intervention and compassionate emotional support. Today, I have these blessings. I am known and appreciated for myself, and my adult friendships are deeply satisfying and rewarding. I take estrogen and antidepressants, and enjoy feminine voice lessons and good books. I increasingly see myself as a good person — one worthy of love and success, despite my imperfections. Morgan, Madison, Wis.

As a low-income student at an Ivy League school, I was struck by how crippling my anxiety was for the first few months. I rarely left my room, afraid that if I didn’t stay in studying I would fail all of my exams and never go to medical school. In lecture, I was ashamed of feeling like I was the only one who didn’t understand what was going on. When I failed my first science exam, all my fears were confirmed. I was constantly reminded of how lucky I was to attend an Ivy League institution, but I always secretly believed that I didn’t belong and that I had made a mistake in attending. Going home only reminded me that I had to succeed to escape my family’s financial circumstances and that I was responsible for doing well to alleviate some pressure on my family.

It was only when I voiced my emotions to my adviser that I began to feel less alone. I still feel the anxiety creeping in before exams, when the familiar suffocating feeling returns, and I have to remind myself that my entire future is not dependent on one exam. Sarah, Providence, R.I.

A Pervasive Stigma

Readers also shared their battles with damaging cultural associations with mental illness, as well as society’s tendency to not take their symptoms seriously.

I was also a straight-A, highly involved student who developed anxiety. Initially, my teachers, with whom I was very close, weren’t aware of the problem, because my anxious behaviors only resulted in good grades and clean whiteboards. But eventually the dam broke. My grades plummeted, and I began nursing suicidal thoughts. I finally went to my general physician and was told it was an effect of anxiety, so I went to a neurologist to get a second opinion and was told the same thing. I refused to accept the diagnosis at first — I remember saying to a friend that I wish the doctor had told me I had a brain tumor instead. Neurosurgery was a more appealing prospect to me than therapy and medication.

Despite these obstacles, I still feel hopeful for the future. I am currently living at home and taking a break from school. If I had known more about the illness years ago, I might have asked for help sooner. Nancy, New York

When I was a junior in high school, some mornings my parents would find me sitting on my bedroom floor, wrapped in a towel and out of the shower, staring blankly at a wall. Sometimes I would have the strength to cry, other times I could barely peel myself off the floor. My younger sister saw all of this, and I’m equal parts ashamed and jealous: ashamed that I couldn’t be the older sister she wanted or needed, and jealous that she didn’t deal with anxiety as I did.

I refused medication for years, thinking that the stigma would follow me just as much as my anxiety did. I wish I could have accepted the help sooner, because it drove me to the point of wanting to harm myself — and I did, once. With enough talk therapy and the right medication, I have been able to quell the massive anxiety attacks that I experienced all too frequently in high school. Having anxiety doesn’t define me, nor should it define anyone else. Alex, Washington

‘I Would Give My Life for Her to Be Happy Again.’

Parents of anxious teenagers shared stressful experiences of watching their children suffer from a condition that, at times, made them feel just as helpless.

Our beautiful daughter has struggled with severe depression and anxiety for the past 4 years. We live in a good neighborhood and are comfortable financially. We do not have any big stressors that many families face. Five years ago she had friends and did well in school. She had a good start to high school. Then things fell apart, and no one seems able to help.

She can barely function, and we cannot reason with her, because her anxiety rules every thought she has and every word she hears. We worry about how she will survive after we are gone. We are afraid to leave her alone. Our days are filled with worry, despair and some hope that maybe she will get better — somehow. We try to help, and she shuts down. We are exhausted and want this to end. I would give my life for her to be happy again. R., Ann Arbor, Mich.

My daughter crashed during her fall semester of junior year in college. The ensuing two years have been a roller coaster of medications and therapy. When she felt better she stopped both, and the crashes would happen again. We received teary phone calls, resulting in what we’ve termed the “$700 swoop-in”: round-trip emergency flights, hotel and meals. As our child has aged, she has become more self-aware, and after a month home for another “reboot” (the longest one yet), she’s back in the city trying to make a go of it again. She managed to graduate from college in 2016. I have been in therapy recently as well, in order to help manage the stress of handling my daughter. This is not something I saw myself enduring as a middle-aged mother, but the journey has been necessary and revealing for our family. Kath, Waltham, Mass.

Finding Freedom in Their Paths

But some readers also shared moments of peace in the midst of their struggles. While their symptoms didn’t disappear entirely, they eventually found unexpected meaning in their mental-health journeys that encouraged them to keep going.

One of the most important things I discovered when I was sick was opera. I attended a performance happenstance in the thick of my anxiety, and it was one of the only places where I could sit in a large, crowded room and not be afraid of vomiting. I know it sounds dramatic, but it was my rudder, and it saved me. It became my goal to work in opera, and it’s what I clung to every time I wanted to quit school or never leave the house. I was able to connect with these characters on stage, whose experiences of darkness and pain were somehow told through the most exquisite music. It taught me to find the beauty in the hardship I had been experiencing, and to smile at fear. I often feel able to grin and laugh when I face my anxiety now, which is perhaps the most valuable thing I’ll ever learn. I also work for an opera company full time. Kelsey, St. Louis

I remember the first time I had a breakthrough with my anxiety. A friend and I were at an amusement park, and there was this ride called the Ripcord. On it, you are held up by a wire and lifted very high into the air, and then you free-fall down. I had to pull the handle that would drop us, and for some reason I wasn’t afraid. When I pulled it and we fell, it felt very freeing, as if I were flying. I felt that I had overcome a huge hurdle and that I was ready to face anything. Even though I have still had anxiety since then, it taught me that I was in control of it.

When North Korea reneged on its promise to forgo nuclear weapons in the early 1990s, President Bill Clinton’s administration put together the “Agreed Framework” that paved Pyongyang’s path to nuclearization. When North Korea’s leader at the time, Kim Jong-il, withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 2003, confirming that he intended to build a nuclear weapon, President George W. Bush pushed for the China-led six-party talks with North Korea. When the country tested its second nuclear weapon in 2009, President Barack Obama opted for “strategic patience.” Three subsequent tests showed just how misguided this was.

It is time to acknowledge that North Korea may never be interested in negotiating away its nuclear deterrent. Of course we should continue to leave the door open for serious discussions if the situation changes, but the United States government does our citizens — and the world — a disservice if it continually discounts the centrality of nuclear weapons to the Kim regime.

They are not a mere insurance policy for survival. They are a means to a more sweeping end: reunification of the Korean Peninsula on Pyongyang’s terms. We must seriously consider the possibility that the North’s current leader, Kim Jong-un, is preparing to use nuclear weapons to drive American forces out of South Korea and coerce Seoul — even at the risk of fighting a limited nuclear war.

Given this, the United States must approach North Korea with sobriety and urgency. The Trump administration has the opportunity to join both houses of Congress in acknowledging the truth about North Korea and using it to open new opportunities to maximize pressure.

Among North Korea’s many significant forms of illicit financing are foreign slave labor and money laundering. From Africa to Europe, North Korean diplomats exploit their consular posts to launder money at the expense of international comity. If North Korea is relisted, these nations would face a significant decision: Is continuing diplomatic and economic relations with a state that uses diplomacy and finance to export and foment terrorism in their interest?

It would pose an even deeper question to the United States: Will we continue our diplomatic overtures to the Kim regime on the flawed assumption that it is interested in a future without nuclear weapons? It is because of America’s bipartisan belief in North Korea’s potential amenity in a political settlement, captured in the 2008 delisting, that North Korea can now marry a miniaturized warhead to an intercontinental ballistic missile. Relisting Pyongyang is the first step toward a strategic vision based on facts rather than aspirations.

We must tell the truth about the dangerous ambitions of North Korea and once again list it as a state sponsor of terrorism, a move that only strengthens our hand and weakens that of Kim Jong-un.

Researchers have even found occurrences among sign language users. (Those, they call tip-of-the-finger states.)

We’re more likely to draw blanks on words we use less frequently — like abacus or palindrome — but there are also categories of words that lead to tip-of-the-tongue states more often.

Proper names are one of those categories. There’s no definitive theory, but one reason might be that proper names are arbitrary links to the people they represent, so people with the same name don’t possess the same semantic information the way that common nouns do, Abrams said.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Once again, we have a lesson in paying attention and reading clues or any notes associated with the puzzle carefully. There’s got to be a reason the Across clues are so ... terse.

You did see the note, right? It says “The one-word Across clues all have an unusual relationship with their answers.” No kidding. That unusual relationship is for you to deduce, and when you do, prepare for a fun “Aha!” moment.

Today’s puzzle isn’t all that difficult once you get the hang of the theme, and the crossings are relatively gentle. If you’ve been looking forward to training your brain to think of alternate meanings in clues, this one by Alex Eaton-Salners might be just the Thursday puzzle for you.

Today’s Theme

It took me a while to get the hang of this one, but once I did, the rest of the puzzle fell quickly.

The Across clues in Mr. Eaton-Salners’s puzzle are all homophones, one of two or more words pronounced alike but different in meaning or derivation or spelling. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out which homophone of the Across clue (if there is more than one) is really the clue to be solved, and then you solve it.

Nor would Mrs. Obama comment.

Kim Sajet, the Portrait Gallery’s director, would only divulge that Mrs. Obama and Ms. Sherald have already met about the portrait, that the paintings typically involve multiple sittings and that this year’s subjects chose the artists from about 20 portfolios submitted by the curators. The first lady has to personally approve the finished work, as does the Portrait Gallery’s advisory board.

The Smithsonian plans to pay for both works with $500,000 in private donations of which $300,000 has been raised so far. This amount covers everything including each artist’s fees, which Ms. Sajet would not specify. Ms. Sherald’s paintings typically sell for $15,000 to $25,000.

Photo

There is no prescribed format for an official portrait, Ms. Sajet said, except that it be a painting — not a work on paper — and that the artists “be respectful of both the person and the position they hold.”

Official portraits have ranged from “highly formal to much more relaxed,” Ms. Sajet added, citing as examples Ron Sherr’s 1994 portrait of George H. W. Bush standing in a suit and tie at the White House and Robert Anderson’s 2008 likeness of George W. Bush in an open-collared shirt, relaxed on a couch at Camp David.

The selection of Ms. Sherald, who typically depicts African-Americans doing everyday things — two women in bathing suits, a man holding a child — has historical significance. “It’s as if she’s saying, ‘Let’s be clear: the President and I are African Americans and proudly so,” Mr. Staiti said, “and these portraits are going to have an African-American vibe — they’re going to break out of that rather staid tradition. I think it’s important and I think it’s political,” he added, referring to Mrs. Obama’s choice.

While Ms. Sherald could not discuss her interactions with Mrs. Obama, the way she generally works offers clear insights into her likely process with the former first lady. She invites her subjects to her studio here, where she photographs them in an outfit she has selected for them. Or, she said, she may go to their homes to “shop from their closets” and photograph them there.

Photo

Ms. Sherald always shoots her subjects outdoors with natural light. “I like the way it highlights the textures of the skin,” she said.

The commission represents something of a departure for Ms. Sherald; she usually chooses subjects who arrest her attention on the street, in an airport. She literally approaches strangers.

“I would wonder how she’d feel about this leading to commissions of other prominent people,” Mr. Staiti said. “She’s interested in the exact opposite; she’s interested in ordinariness.”

Ms. Sherald said how much the selection means to her, how Mrs. Obama loomed large in her life, though they had not previously met. “We’ve been on a first-name basis for eight years,” she said jokingly. “Seeing her made my world better.”

Photo

“She’s an archetype that a lot of women can relate to — no matter shape, size, race or color,” Ms. Sherald added. “We see our best selves in her.”

Ms. Sherald has yet to start the Obama portrait, though it is due to be finished by year’s end. “I’m not going home for the holidays,” she said with a laugh.

Yet sitting among her paint tubes — their colors smeared on paper plates — with three canvases-in-progress leaning against the walls, Ms. Sherald seemed remarkably calm in the face of such a daunting deadline, perhaps because she has confronted far tougher challenges.

Ms. Sherald is a survivor of congestive heart failure, diagnosed at age 30 just as she was earning her master’s degree at the Maryland Institute College of Art and was training for a triathlon. She received a transplant at 39.

She interrupted her career again, taking a four-year break to care for two ailing relatives back in her hometown Columbus, Ga. She lost her father, a dentist, to Parkinson’s in 2000; her brother to lung cancer in 2012.

But she does not think of herself as unlucky. In fact, she said she is keenly aware of those less fortunate around her — like children in her own community who are aging out of foster care. (One block from her studio, she said she “can see 10 addicts at any given time.”) Ms. Sherald, who has taught art in the Baltimore City Detention Center, hopes to give back financially as soon as she pays off her school loans and can more easily afford her extensive medication: 13 different pills a day.

“When I look at those people,” she said, “I see myself.”

Ms. Sherald isn’t very far from the days when she waited tables and worked in a studio without heat or air-conditioning.

Her parents wanted her to go to medical school, but Ms. Sherald knew that she was an artist. “I don’t feel like I chose to do it,” she said. “I don’t know what else I’m good at.”

Photo

She began with bald self-portraits — she shaved her own head for a time — and then moved into more fantastical work that explored the idea of circus, and fantasy.

Ms. Sherald’s cultural influences range from the science fiction writer Octavia Butler to the Surrealist painter Salvador Dalí and Tim Burton’s quirky movie, “Big Fish.” Names that come up in conversation include the poet David Whyte, the public radio host Krista Tippett — and Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Over the years, Ms. Sherald’s figurative painting has evolved into a stylized realism — a gray skin palette punctuated by colorful pieces of clothing on a flat plane. She makes only about 13 paintings a year. “It’s hard for me to find people to paint,” she said. “There has got to be something about them that only I can see.”

“They exist in a place of the past, the present and the future,” she added. “It’s like something I sense with my spirit more than my mind.”

Ms. Sherald only paints African-Americans. Having studied European art history, she is keenly aware of the scarcity of black faces. “There’s not enough images of us,” she said.

Last year she had her first solo show at Monique Meloche’s Chicago gallery and became the first woman to win the Portrait Gallery’s Outwin Boochever competition. Now there are waiting lists for her work.

“Everybody responds to her paintings,” Ms. Meloche said. “There is something that’s so alive in these characters; they’re very calm — but they’re still very confrontational.”","After a Late Start, an Artist’s Big Break: Michelle Obama’s Official Portrait",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/arts/design/amy-sherald-michelle-obama-official-portrait.html

Two months later, Fox News and its parent, 21st Century Fox, forced Mr. O’Reilly out.

What changed? The allegations against Mr. O’Reilly, once conveniently swept aside, had suddenly become a problem. They had become a problem because they had become public (through the same Times reporters who first wrote about the $32 million payout, Emily Steel and Michael S. Schmidt).

In a similar turn of events, earlier this month, Mr. Weinstein did not last a week at his company after The Times and then The New Yorker detailed sexual harassment and abuse claims against him going back decades.

Now, a national reckoning is underway. Allegations of harassment and abuse have prompted action at Amazon Studios, where a female producer’s accusation forced the resignation of its chief, Roy Price; at the APA talent agency, where allegations from at least three men against the agent Tyler Grasham led to his firing; at Vox Media, which dismissed its editorial director, Lockhart Steele, after a woman accused him of misconduct on Medium without naming him; and at Nickelodeon, which severed ties with “The Loud House” creator Chris Savino after several women leveled accusations.

But it is a reckoning long delayed. And a big reason for the delay has to do with the out-of-court settlements and the nondisclosure agreements that go with them.

It was a nondisclosure agreement that turned off the spigot of accusations against the comedian and actor Bill Cosby, who was forced to grapple with women’s complaints when a former Temple University athletic department employee, Andrea Constand, accused him of drugging and sexually assaulting her in 2005. After some dozen others made similar charges in support of her case, Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand reached a confidential settlement.

And it was a nondisclosure agreement that brought to a close the flurry of media attention that followed the lawsuit filed against Mr. O’Reilly by the former Fox News producer Andrea Mackris in 2004. Her silence — along with agreeing to the public statement that there had been “no wrongdoing whatsoever” — went for about $9 million.

Those are only the best known examples. The entertainment news and gossip archives are filled with reports of celebrity sexual harassment cases written in disappearing ink.

Take the summer of 2010. Two women filed lawsuits accusing the actor Casey Affleck of harassment during the filming of “I’m Still Here.” Around the same time, the actress Kristina Hagan charged that the television star David Boreanaz had harassed her when she was an extra on his Fox show “Bones.” Her high-profile lawyer, Gloria Allred, went before a cluster of cameras to declare that Ms. Hagan was “looking forward to her day in court.”

But all three women struck confidential agreements resolving their cases against the men, who denied the claims against them. Mr. Affleck went on to win an Oscar, and Mr. Boreanaz is a star of the new CBS drama “SEAL Team.”

I reached out to Ms. Allred on Friday to discuss what many people were coming to view as the systemic silencing of women — a stratagem that, yes, compensates the accusers, but also enriches the lawyers who arrange the deals and, arguably, leaves other women vulnerable. Wasn’t that system, I asked, stifling a broader discussion?

“My duty as an attorney is to my client and to assist her and protect her and support her in what she thinks is best for her life,” Ms. Allred told me. “I don’t think any woman should be sacrificed for the ‘cause.’”

For a number of women, she said, a confidential settlement is the right outcome. “Some clients want to protect their privacy — they don’t want anybody to know,” she said.

In most cases, Ms. Allred said, if there is no confidentiality agreement, there is no shot at a settlement. And she disputed the notion that out-of-court settlements somehow let the alleged harassers off scot-free.

”If the accused sexual harasser is paying my client $500,000, or $1 million or $2 million, that’s not nuisance value,” she said. “That’s an admission that the accused feels that he has risk and that he has done something that he should not have done.”

Still, Mr. O’Reilly has lately asserted that he struck the deals only to “protect my family.” Over the weekend, he used his website to call the latest Times report a “smear piece.”

In return for the $32 million he was said to have paid Ms. Wiehl, Mr. O’Reilly bought more than her silence. As part of the deal, the Times reported, all text messages and other communications between them were destroyed, and he got an affidavit, signed by Ms. Wiehl, in which she attested that she had “no claims” regarding the allegations in her initial complaint.

Because of such agreements, it required months and months of reporting on the part of those who nailed down the stories on Mr. O’Reilly and Mr. Weinstein — just as they stymied so many earlier efforts by others.

Lessin, the editor in chief of the tech news website The Information, said that the use of nondisclosure agreements slowed its investigation into sexual harassment allegations in Silicon Valley — specifically, against Justin Caldbeck of Binary Capital. (He resigned from Binary and apologized, saying it was wrong to “leverage a position of power in exchange for sexual gain.”)

“The freedom to tell your story shouldn’t be easily signed away,” Ms. Lessin told me. “It doesn’t mean there aren’t cases where it’s reasonable to use them, but they appear so frequently that it is a sign that women are being forced to sign away their rights to free speech.”

Binary, by the way, was protected by another form of legal silencing — nondisparagement clauses attached to employment contracts, which, as The Times reported in July, the company sought to use to keep complaints from going public. The Weinstein Company had a similar provision.

The New York State Legislature is considering legislation that would void contract provisions that keep employees from bringing harassment and discrimination claims.

The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”",A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/your-money/paying-for-college/payback-college-loans.html

We met at Cafe Coco, a 24-hour place a few steps away from a long-running Nashville club, the Exit/In. With no makeup, wearing a gray T-shirt and black pants short enough to reveal a tattoo — “Out into the ether” — above one ankle, Ms. Baker could have been an undergraduate between classes. A laminated pass hung from her belt for concerts organized by Smith7, a Memphis label that also puts on drug- and alcohol-free shows for teenagers. It signed the post-punk band that Ms. Baker formed when she was 14, initially named the Star Killers and currently Forrister.

Coffee and chewing gum are the only habits Ms. Baker allows herself after a stretch of addictive behavior with cigarettes, alcohol and drugs in her teens — experiences that figure in the songs on both of her albums. For the interview, she ordered her fourth coffee of the day: organic, iced, with almond milk.

When Ms. Baker initially released the songs from “Sprained Ankle” online in 2014, she was a student at Middle Tennessee State University, writing music she only expected a few friends to hear. The recordings, made in three days, were stark solo tracks with a handful of overdubs; they often used only a few picked guitar notes tolling behind her voice, as she sang troubled, at times suicidal thoughts. But the independent label 6131 discovered the songs, signed her and issued the album, in mastered form, in October 2015. By the end of the year, Ms. Baker had reached listeners nationwide. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times chose “Sprained Ankle” as one of the best albums of 2015.

“Sprained Ankle,” was a measured cry in the wilderness, a distillation of solitary despair. Just two years later, “Turn Out the Lights” is the work of a songwriter who has resonated with an international audience and who is moving beyond the apocalyptic self-absorption of adolescence. It’s the rare second album that, despite new self-consciousness, stretches beyond an unspoiled debut to reach for even bigger things, with all its passion intact.

“Once we finished recording it, in January, there was a lot of anxiety for me,” Ms. Baker said. “Is it too similar? Is it too different? How can you be afraid of both of those things at the same time?” She laughed. “But I somehow was.”

Her newer songs continue to practice what Ms. Baker calls “radical vulnerability.” But where “Sprained Ankle” was entirely focused on the singer’s inner turmoil, “Turn Out the Lights” has a wider perspective. Ms. Baker is determined to at least consider some distant possibility of hope. “I know that it’s not gonna turn out all right/but I have to believe that it is,” she sings in “Appointments.” And through much of the album, her lyrics recognize other characters enough to engage them in arguments and pleas: “You’re everything I want and I’m all you dread,” Ms. Baker sings in “Sour Breath.”

“To realize that you’re not the most important thing, that you’re not even close to the most important thing, is really comforting,” Ms. Baker said. Touring constantly with the songs from “Sprained Ankle” made her analyze them anew. “I thought not only, ‘Do I want to keep writing songs like this?’, but ‘Do I want to keep living my life primarily concerned with my hurt and attached to it?.’ A lot of people that I know, I think we’re attached to the safety of our hurt. And it’s dangerous and vulnerable to hope because there’s the risk that we’ll get disappointed.”

The album also has an expanded musical palette, enriched but not cluttered. Ms. Baker produced it herself at Ardent Studios, a Memphis institution, in six 12-hour days: time enough to weave in more of her own piano, guitar, organ and voice. Half of the songs also have atmospheric string parts from Camille Faulkner, who will be touring with Ms. Baker in the United States.

On Friday, Ms. Baker marks the release of “Turn Out the Lights” with a concert at Town Hall, the elegant 1,500-seat theater in midtown Manhattan. It’s orders of magnitude larger than her New York City debut in August 2015 for “about 20 people” at the now-defunct Cake Shop. “Fun fact,” she offered. “I usually don’t know the capacities of the venues, because I’ve asked not to know, because it freaks me out. Sometimes I hear how many people are going to be at a show and I think, ‘Oh my gosh, I can’t play to that many people!’ But it gets easier every time.”",Julien Baker Bravely Confronts Her Traumas and Fears,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/arts/music/julien-baker-turn-out-the-lights.html

中国女性史诗小说《喜福会》的作者谭恩美(Amy Tan)在近期出版的回忆录中提到了她的祖母，一位死于可能是故意吸食鸦片过量的“concubine”。这个词通常被翻译为“妾”。在韦氏词典里，它的含义是：

A woman with whom a man cohabits without being married: such as

a：one having a recognized social status in a household below that of a wife

b：a mistress

一个与一名男性同居，但非对方妻子的女人：比如

a：一个家庭里社会地位被认为低于妻子的女人。

b：一个情妇

妾是一个男人的性伴侣，被期望为他生儿育女，却得不到妻子一般的地位认可和继承权。

中国的历史里有许多著名的妾室，比如清朝晚期的慈禧，她是咸丰皇帝的妃子，在作家张戎的笔下，她是一位开启了现代中国的“concubine”。另一位被赋予这个名称的女人是汉末的虞姬。陈凯歌导演的电影《霸王别姬》的英文译名为“Farewell, My Concubine”, 正是这部电影将这个过时的英文词语介绍给了许多观众，一些人也把这个形象与一个落后的中国联系了起来。

Some shows are just too odd to be appreciated in their time. That’s a good chunk of the case the loving documentary “Too Funny to Fail,” about the 1996 sketch series “The Dana Carvey Show,” lays out, through interviews and impressively amassed archival footage. For a show in which a faux Bill Clinton nurses puppies and kittens from a gruesome teat-covered prosthetic, the question is not, how did it get canceled? It’s, how did it ever made it to ABC in the first place?

The answer is through high hopes and occasional mistakes in judgment, the same things that ushered the show,, like other brilliant but doomed projects, into an early grave. The cast and writers speak about the experience with a befuddled reverence, and the youthful determination captured in the old clips radiates so powerfully it almost sends us all back to our didn’t-know-better-yet selves of 20 years ago.

Best known for staging lyrical but earnest topical dramas (“The Laramie Project,” “Gross Indecency,” “Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo”), Mr. Kaufman turns out to be just the man for eliciting the sting within the soap bubbles of “Torch Song.”

Even more important, without overdoing the tremolo, Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Urie make sure we see the vital links between camp comic postures and the genuine fear and pain that lie beneath. Defiantly quipping bravado is a suit of armor for Arnold Beckoff, the show’s leading man (and occasional lady).

That carapace has served him well. But sometimes it pinches. And as Arnold, Mr. Urie, who has become one of our most inspired physical comedians, digs deeper here to let us feel exactly where it hurts.

When we meet Ms. Ruehl as his mother (call her Ma) in the play’s second act, we experience the shock of recognition that occurs when longtime friends introduce us to their parents. “Oh,” we think, “so that’s where it comes from.” Embodied with carefully harnessed restraint by Ms. Ruehl, whose expert comic timing matches Mr. Urie’s, Ma loves her Arnold as only a mother can.

Photo

That’s especially true for a mother who sees her own image in her grown child as clearly as this one does. Which makes the differences between them — in this case, the little matter of Arnold’s being gay — take on the openhanded smack of betrayal.

The hour or so of entertainment that precedes this encounter is perfectly pleasant. It features one of the funniest simulated sex scenes ever (performed solo by Mr. Urie), not to mention some peerless aperçus. “A drag queen’s like an oil painting,” Arnold tells the audience. “You gotta stand back from it to get the full effect.”

Of course, what Mr. Urie does is let us see the brush strokes that went into this frame-worthy creation. And he shows Arnold’s ambivalence about letting others perceive the genuine fragility that he caricatures. This two-sided self-exposure is especially evident in his relationship with Ed (Ward Horton), a self-defined heterosexual with a taste for dalliance in the back rooms of gay bars.

It is at just such an establishment, the International Stud (a real place, and notorious in the pre-AIDS era), that Arnold meets Ed in 1974. Their passionate physical affair ends (sort of) when Ed announces he’s going to marry a woman, Laurel (Roxanna Hope Radja). Arnold, in turn, takes up with Alan (Michael Rosen), a streetwise young model and former hustler.

The erotic and psychological crosscurrents among this foursome occupy the play’s second part, which is its most contrived and least convincing. It’s in the extended third section that “Torch Song” reveals the tougher mettle of which it is made.

We are now in 1980. Arnold and Ed have been (platonically) reunited. And there’s a new guy in the picture: David (Jack DiFalco), a smart-mouthed gay teenager to whom Arnold has become a foster parent. Soon enough, Ma, fresh from Miami, arrives to assess this awkward ménage. And while Ma is as bright a joke maker as her son, there’s no question that it will end in tears.

Featuring astute, period-specific sets (by David Zinn) and costumes (by Clint Ramos) that summon the 1970s without winking nostalgia, this “Torch Song” has been impeccably assembled, with acting to match throughout. Mr. Horton, who wears Ed’s conflicts with a forthright air of denial, is the dream straight man (so to speak) to Mr. Urie’s flamboyant Arnold.

Mr. DiFalco adroitly avoids the perils of wise-child sassiness and brings a surprising and necessary flash of pain to the recollection of a gay hate crime. And Ms. Radja and Mr. Rosen make the most of what are ultimately throwaway parts.

But Mr. Urie and Ms. Ruehl take the show to a level of emotional truthfulness that makes objections to ungainly construction feel beside the point. Ma’s refusal to acknowledge the fact of Arnold’s homosexuality is given full validity in Ms. Ruehl’s uncompromising performance as a woman who avoids the truth by making a joke of it.

You know exactly where she’s coming from. And it’s that embracing spirit of understanding, grounded in a bedrock of family feeling, that comes to the surface so startlingly and movingly in this “Torch Song.”

Like the 2011 Broadway revival of Larry Kramer’s “The Normal Heart,” a later play about gay men that once seemed stuck in the past, Mr. Kaufman’s stirring production propels an ostensible period piece into a vibrant present.

One common thread is to reach beyond attacking these women on the merits of their claims to attacking the way they look. And this isn’t simply constrained to Trump himself; it is apparently in the bloodline. Donald Trump Jr. once referred to Congresswoman Maxine Waters as looking “like a stripper.”

Another strategy of dismissal is to portray these women as mere ideological, party-serving puppets, rather than as fierce advocates with their own opinions and power.

Trump tweeted, for example, that Mayor Cruz was “told by the Democrats that you must be nasty” to him.

None of this is out of step with what his base wants. Trump is advancing an agenda of white male identity politics and for those in his camp and in his corner, this is the dawn of a blissful new day.

Trump isn’t simply doing this on a personal level; he’s also doing it on the broader policy level.

At the same time that he’s pushing massive tax cuts for the top 1 percent, he is also seriously considering welfare reform. You may not fully comprehend the racial dimensions of this, so allow me to elucidate.

According to a Tax Policy Center report issued late last month about the Republican tax plan, in 2018, “Taxpayers in the top one percent (incomes above $730,000), would receive about 50 percent of the total tax benefit,” and by 2027, “about 80 percent of the total benefit would accrue to taxpayers in the top one percent.”

And who exactly are the top 1 percent, demographically? Well, a 2011 analysis by The Grio found that they are 96.2 percent white, and a 2012 study found that about eight in 10 were men.

Contrast that with welfare, where the majority of recipients are women. Although white people are the largest group of recipients of most of the major government assistance programs, many white people, and Republicans in particular, don’t seem to realize this. A YouGov poll taken in January of 2016 found that a plurality of respondents and an even higher percentage of Republicans wrongly believe that black people are welfare’s largest recipients.

Much of the money is directed at white people, but most of the stigma is directed at black and brown people, and Trump is, like a multitude of Republicans before him, exploiting the misperception.

The historical parallels to F.D.R. and 1938, while inexact, are intriguing. Like Mr. Trump, Roosevelt was piqued by opposition from members of his own party and set out to replace them with more ideologically aligned candidates who would support his agenda — in his case, liberals who would take out Southern conservatives. But voters resented the intervention and repudiated him by re-electing nearly all of his Democratic rivals.

“His attempt to purge the party of conservative Democrats proved to be a serious mistake,” said Robert Dallek, whose biography “Franklin D. Roosevelt: A Political Life” will be published next month. “He lost every primary contest except one, and 60 percent of the country disapproved of his purge.”

Although born out of frustration, Roosevelt’s purge was part of a desire to force a party realignment. In those days, both parties had liberals and conservatives. Roosevelt in effect was trying to make the Democrats the more uniformly liberal party while leaving the Republicans as the conservative party. He would fail, but in decades to come, that realignment would eventually occur on its own.

“His goal was two responsible, unified parties to replace, as he said, ‘Tweedledum and Tweedledee’ parties,” said Susan Dunn, a Williams College historian and author of “Roosevelt’s Purge,” the definitive book on the 1938 election. “To me, Trump’s purge is only about vindictiveness. He wants to strike out at and defeat the people who have dared to criticize him.”

Other presidents have been incensed by wayward members of their parties, but few attempted what Roosevelt did and what Mr. Trump is threatening. Karl Rove, deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush, at times grew livid at Republicans who defied the White House. But he said the idea of challenging them in primaries was anathema.

Roosevelt’s experience showed the dangers of isolation in the White House, said Mr. Rove, who has sharply criticized Mr. Bannon’s efforts. “The lesson is it’s better to try to influence by encouragement than by opposition,” he said. “It’s important to keep focused on the main things people want you to keep focused on — what are the big issues of the day? And don’t let your personal pique guide your political actions.” (Mr. Bannon said he would not reply because it would be “punching down.”)

Unlike Mr. Trump, with his historically low poll ratings, Roosevelt was broadly popular at the time. He swept to re-election in 1936 with 61 percent of the vote, winning all but two states in one of the biggest landslides in American history, and his approval ratings remained high. While Mr. Trump’s Republicans can afford to lose only two votes in the Senate, Roosevelt’s Democrats enjoyed large majorities in Congress.

But Roosevelt grew angry at resistance from Democrats to additional domestic programs and repeated Supreme Court rulings overturning parts of the New Deal. The confrontation came to a head when he sought to pack the Supreme Court by adding as many as six more justices to seize control of the bench, an idea that provoked fierce opposition in both parties and ultimately collapsed.

Harry Hopkins, Roosevelt’s confidant, railed against Democrats “who tricked the voters by wearing our insignia only to turn against us as soon as they got in office.” Roosevelt was so angry that his “resentment crystallized into the desire to crush all who conspired against the throne,” said George Creel, a journalist and critic at the time. So Roosevelt put together a team to organize a campaign against the conservative Democrats. The newspapers called it the “elimination committee” and labeled the campaign Roosevelt’s “purge,” a reference to Stalin’s terror in the Soviet Union.

Advisers like Frances Perkins feared it was “reckless” but could not talk him out of it. On June 24, 1938, Roosevelt announced during a fireside chat that he had a responsibility to carry out the 1936 platform and therefore would oppose the election of “outspoken reactionaries” and hypocrites “who say ‘yes’ to a progressive objective, but who also find some reason to oppose any specific proposal designed to gain that objective.”

He took on conservatives like Senators Walter F. George of Georgia, Ellison D. Smith of South Carolina, Millard E. Tydings of Maryland and Guy M. Gillette of Iowa. Mr. Smith, a fierce segregationist known as “Cotton Ed,” despised Roosevelt and referred to the New Deal as the “Jackass Age.” But Mr. Smith and the others won anyway. Roosevelt managed to take out only one rival in the House. Amid the Democratic discord and the aftermath of a recession, Republicans swept to victory in the fall, picking up eight Senate seats and 81 House seats by Ms. Dunn’s count.

“Unfortunately, his hubris overwhelmed his normally impeccable political instincts,” said Paul Sparrow, director of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum. But it had unanticipated benefits. “The good news for history,” he said, “is that this embarrassment taught him an important lesson: Don’t get too far out in front of the American voter, a lesson he applied just two years later as he carefully laid the groundwork for America’s entry into World War II.”

Indeed, Ms. Dunn said some of the same conservative Democrats who survived Roosevelt’s purge ultimately became his strongest allies during the buildup to the war. Mr. Tydings backed Roosevelt’s compulsory universal military service, and Mr. George played a key role in passing the Lend-Lease Act to supply Britain and other countries with military aid.

You once had a cupcake and cheese ball business.

I was making cupcakes, and then they became really popular. But I always wanted to sell them for a dollar, and everyone else was charging $3 or $4. Then butter went up, and then I got a cockroach problem. So I moved on to cheese balls. And then I got a huge mouse problem, and I was like, “I’m done with making food inside my apartment.”

The cupcakes are gone?

I’ll do it for a special request. Like if there’s a school charity, I’ll say: “You get two dozen cupcakes, but my rules are only vanilla, I’ll leave it with my doorman, you pick it up, you don’t call me, maybe I’ll put pokes on it, maybe not, maybe jimmies on it, maybe not.” And they’re like, “Lady, we don’t even want your stupid cupcakes.” I’m so awful — because I do it because I want to do it, not because I have to do it. When I have to do it, I don’t want to play anymore.

And the cheese balls? They’re such a rarity in New York.

That’s why I brought them back! I mean, it’s a ball of cheese that you can use over a period of four or five days. You just have to reshape it and roll it in more nuts, and nobody will ever know.

You’re a rabbit lover.

I’m on my third rabbit. I’ve had her for three years, and her name’s Tina, and she’s got a deformed paw. She’s seven pounds and the bossiest one I’ve ever had. She’ll stop me in a hallway where I can’t get past her, or, if I’m sitting down, she’ll get behind me and nibble on my back. She’s just in my face a lot.

So you’re a real homebody?

I’m not a shut-in, but I do work a lot on my home, and I’m surrounded by everything that I love. And I think about people who have lost their places with the flooding and fires, and I look around my apartment and think, “God, I would hate to lose that taxidermied chipmunk or cluster of wax flowers.” I’m always amazed by people who don’t do anything to their house. They’re renting their apartment, so they don’t want to paint or put holes in the wall so they’ll get their deposit back.

Ask anyone here about canine excrement and the conversation moves quickly to concepts of citizenship, nationhood, belonging, Lebanon’s sectarian political system and ultimately the civil war that reshaped the country from 1975 to 1990.

Civic activists say those years of sectarian violence and lawlessness, and the ensuing mistrust, destroyed Lebanon’s sense of shared public space, whether physical or political.

During the civil war, “people were afraid of the streets and the sidewalks,” said Jad Chaaban, a university professor who is a member of Beirut Madinati — Arabic for “Beirut, My City” — a group that made a stir last year by taking the radical step of running in municipal elections on a platform of improving public services.

After the war, reconstruction was carried out with “almost total disregard” for public streetscapes, he said.

“People don’t feel that they own anything,” he said. “They don’t own the street. They don’t belong. The sidewalk is a very nice metaphor for the Lebanese situation.”

In spite of that, or because of it, a loose-knit coalition — an underdog movement, dare we say — has sprung up to battle the problem of soiled streets. It includes just a few people: Ms. Badikian and other neighborhood boosters, animal rights activists, a veterinarian and the politician son of an assassinated warlord.

What they shared, at first, was a tenuous hope that dog droppings — unlike, say, government corruption or the war in neighboring Syria — might be a problem small enough to solve. What they found instead was that it contained nearly every classic Lebanese problem.

Lebanon’s weak government has failed to deliver public goods that it should be able to afford, like sewage treatment, clean water, consistent law enforcement or reliable electricity. Clean sidewalks are not even on the agenda.

So about two years ago, Ms. Badikian and several other advocates, all of whom had gotten used to feces-free streets while living abroad, took matters into their own hands. Parallel efforts began in the largely Christian east side of Beirut and the largely Muslim west, a divide that itself is a legacy of the war.

On both sides, they hit fierce resistance.

Ms. Badikian said officials told her neighborhood group, Achrafieh 2020, which pushes for pedestrian-friendly streets in east Beirut, that working with it might anger people in the west. That exasperated the activists, who wondered, why not work with both?

A brief collaboration with trash collectors died during a contract imbroglio that left mountains of garbage nationwide in 2015.

And advocates struggled to enlist foreign domestic workers, often underpaid and overworked, who do much of the dog walking in a city where pets are largely a luxury.

“It was a total fiasco,” said Dr. Maher Yehyia, 42, a veterinarian who had started his own campaign in western Beirut. I had found his number on a box on a lamppost. It was supposed to contain free plastic gloves for dog walkers, but it was empty.

When Dr. Yehyia returned in 2006 from Canada, where he had moved as a child during the war, he set about picking up after his Chihuahua.

“People thought I was crazy,” he said.

He did not proselytize much at first. Fouled streets were a bigger issue in the Christian east, since most traditional Muslims do not keep dogs in their homes. Veterinary patients on the west side are 80 percent cats, he said, while in the east they are 80 percent dogs.

But with growing secularism and returning expatriates, the number of dogs in his practice tripled, a trend he saw reflected underfoot.

So Dr. Yehyia started to clear the “land mines” outside his clinic. Then he hung 300 glove dispensers around town. Fellow vets started calling — not to join him, but to accuse him of self-promotion for printing his clinic’s name and number on the boxes.

A city official arranged a meeting, then canceled. The gloves vanished; Dr. Yehyia saw vendors on the seafront using them to hand out roasted corn.

For the veterinarian, the whole episode was a reminder of why there is no law requiring cleaning up after dogs in the first place: the lax enforcement and rampant use of bribes and connections that doomed other recent public-minded laws, like those requiring seatbelt use and banning smoking in restaurants.

“The war made it so no one respects the laws,” he said. “If you stop at the red light, they will shout at you and say, ‘Do you think you are in Europe?’ ”

He did find sympathy in one quarter: Ms. Badikian’s group. They had added poop to their agenda as they held street fairs promoting walking and biking.

Her group has more political connections, and a bit more traction. It was founded by a member of Parliament, Nadim Gemayel, the son of the assassinated militia leader.

The neighborhood group released ads on social media showing a bearded hipster, first cursing, “I stepped in it,” then holding his head high on a cleaner street.

Lately, Beirut’s city government has posted some signs urging people to scoop the poop. But Ms. Badikian has pushed in vain for “a real campaign” — sustained, high-profile, on television.

The most obvious solution — a fine, like the one that transformed New York City’s sidewalks in 1978 — would be pointless here. Those for smoking and traffic violations are routinely ignored.

Another problem, said Gaby Ferneine, a city council member, is that Beirut has no real city police, only a tiny municipal guards force.

But there was a glimmer of hope in Sioufi, the district where Mr. Nawfal walked his German shepherd. The next pair to pass were Josine Pacaro, 46, and Bruno, a miniature Doberman. Ms. Pacaro, a house worker from the Philippines, wore a pink uniform and plastic gloves.

Asked if she scooped, she said: “Yes, of course. We are the ones to step in it!”

She became a convert after a single misstep “on the kaka.”

“Enough,” she said. “I pick it up.”

She gazed down a line of dog deposits, of various vintages, leading to one of the city’s few public parks. Flies hovered, gleaming in the sunset.

Not much is known about the people who built the edifices, but they are thought to have constructed them at least 2,000 years ago and maybe as far back as 9,000 years ago, according to Dr. Kennedy. They are believed to be the ancestors of the modern-day Bedouin people in the region.

The most well-known of the basalt boulder structures are the “kites,” which were first identified by air pilots in the 1920s. Each looks like a child’s kite, complete with strings and long fluttering tails that are two-dimensionally flattened into the ground.

Archaeologists think ancient nomadic tribes used the kites, which can be more than a mile long, for hunting. The structure’s two long converging walls would funnel stampedes of gazelles into the body of the kite, where they would be slaughtered.

But the lava fields extend beyond Jordan’s borders into countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia. So do their mysteries. Saudi Arabia in particular offers a wealth of harrats that are just out of Dr. Kennedy’s reach.

“We would have loved to fly across into Saudi Arabia to take images. But you never get the permission,” he said. “And then along comes Google Earth.”

In 2004, Dr. Abdullah Al-Saeed, a neurologist and founder of the Desert Team, a group of amateur archaeologists in Saudi Arabia, explored the bleak lava field known as Harrat Khaybar. He saw walls of stones stacked about three feet high, but said that he did not appreciate their unique design at that time.

Then in 2008 he returned to the same spot from his desktop computer.

“When I saw the updated images of Harrat Khaybar from Google Earth, I was literally stunned and could not sleep that night,” Dr. Al-Saeed said in an email. “Flying like a bird all over the Harrat from one enigmatic structure to another! How come we passed by these structures without appreciating their design?”

He spoke to his colleagues, and they set out to investigate the most striking structure they saw in person. The Harrat Khaybar was more than 550 miles from Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. So they took a plane to a nearby city, rented a car and set out for the volcanic domes. In order to navigate the rocky terrain, they had to do much of their exploration on foot through the lava field.

“The question we always discuss while investigating them is, why here? Why in this stony, frightful, rugged land?” he said. He snapped several photos and sent them along with the Google images to archaeologists like Dr. Kennedy for feedback.

“Absolute bafflement.” That’s what Dr. Kennedy said he felt when he first saw the satellite images. Suddenly, he was confronted with structures quite different from anything he had ever seen before. He called them gates because when looked at horizontally, they resemble a simple fence with two thick upright posts on the sides connected by one or more long bars.

“They don’t look like funerary, for disposing of dead bodies. They don’t look like structures where people lived, and they don’t look like animal traps,” he said. “I don’t know what they are.”

More Reporting on Archaeology

For nearly a decade, he has painstakingly cataloged nearly 400 gates. In 2011, his work was featured by Google in a video (for which he was paid). The longest gate he had identified was more than 1,600 feet long, though most were between 160 and 500 feet long. Sometimes the posts were as thick as 30 feet. One gate is intertwined with a kite.

Next he hopes to get accurate dating of the gates, which he suspects may in some cases be older than the kites, and perhaps the oldest man-made structures in the landscape. He invites armchair archaeologists to search the harrats online and share any finds with him.

“More will be found as more people get involved in scouring the landscape from satellite imagery,” he said.

Stephan Kempe, a retired professor of physical geology at Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany, who was not involved in the paper, called the gate structures interesting and said that the new study was one of a series of papers describing previously unnoticed structures in the Saudi Arabian lava fields.

“There are many other features that have only recently been understood as forming classes of prehistoric ‘geoglyphs’ that were widespread in an area thought to be very barren and devoid of human impact,” he said in an email.

He added that he would have liked to have seen some suggestions from Dr. Kennedy as to what the gates may have been used for, if only to dissuade people from speculating as to extraterrestrial origins, as they have regarding the Sphinx and the Nazca Lines in Peru.

“Where I’d go was the Field Museum and look at things rather than looking at art.","Yet when compared to the ice-cold irony of Warhol’s silkscreens or the colorful exuberance of paintings by James Rosenquist, Tom Wesselmann or Rosalyn Drexler, Oldenburg’s work, especially his enduring innovation — rendering sculpture literally soft, through re-creations of everyday things (ice cream cones, typewriters, toilets) that sag from the wall or bag on the floor — looked, and still look, like marvelous reprobates. In the Pop room of any museum gallery, they smirk and slouch and revel in playing at art, seeming to be both the comedians and the clinical depressives.

The latter half of his career, after he grew restless with the art world and moved into cartoonish public sculpture, collaborating with his second wife, the art historian Coosje van Bruggen (who died in 2009), has somewhat obscured his outré spirit — in part because many of the outdoor works, funny and toylike, have become so civically beloved. “Spoonbridge and Cherry,” a red cherry balanced on an enormous spoon, made in steel and aluminum and installed in 1988 in the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden, is among the most photographed artworks in America, the backdrop for untold thousands of silly selfies. Its fans would likely blanch to learn that among Oldenburg’s early public-art proposals was an idea even creepier than the hole: speakers that would have broadcast a piercing nightly scream through the streets of Manhattan at 2 a.m. As he wrote in one of the lesser-quoted passages from his most famous piece of writing, 1961’s half-satirical manifesto “I Am For …”: “I am for the art that comes up in fogs from sewer holes in winter. I am for the art that splits when you step on a frozen puddle. I am for the worm’s art inside the apple.”

THESE WORDS in mind, you don’t fully expect what greets you when you walk into the studio and home Oldenburg has kept on the still-gritty far west side of SoHo since 1971, a five-story warehouse where naval propellers were once manufactured. Inside, it’s as immaculate and organized as a museum. Surfaces gleam and light falls beautifully on the maquettes for public sculpture that line the walls. Slim in khakis and tennis shoes, Oldenburg was sitting in one of the large office spaces with an assistant and wasn’t able to get up to greet me. A fall last year broke his hip, forcing him to get around with a cane or by propelling himself across the floors on rolling office chairs. His daughter, Maartje Oldenburg, who spent most of her childhood in this rambling building and is now an expert on his career, had arrived just as I did, and we convened at a big table her father had piled with boxes of files, like a lawyer preparing for a deposition.

“I guess I was always an archivist,” he said, smiling, surveying the spread, his glasses and ponderous forehead giving him an owllike bearing.

Unlike some overexamined artists of his generation, Oldenburg enjoys interviews, and he had been through this routine dozens of times before. But today he seemed to be in the mood for some serious retrospection: The first drawings he pulled from a folder were ones he made in middle school and high school in Chicago, where his father, Gosta, a Swedish diplomat, had moved the family in 1936 from Oslo upon being posted to the United States as a consul.

His daughter looked over the profusion of drawings protected by plastic sleeves and said: “I always think I’ve seen everything that’s here. But I’ve never seen these before.”

Growing up in wartime Chicago gave Oldenburg, a bookish child of Europe, a firm purchase on America’s brashness, inseparable from its boorishness and brutality. That sense informed the ragtag, anxious nature of his early pieces, work that seems to gain political relevance with each passing year. His childhood drawings — schematics of war planes, storyboard cartoons, caricatures of classmates — aren’t anything special. But they immediately reveal three things: He was a preternaturally talented draftsman from the start; he was always wickedly funny; and he has always had an engineer’s passion for the built world. It’s no accident that many of his best drawings over the years have taken the form of grandly elaborate blueprints and architectural renderings, making him a charter member of what I like to think of as the schematic school of late Modernism (other members would include Bruce Nauman, Lee Lozano and Chris Burden).

Art didn’t really grab Oldenburg until he was an adult. “The Art Institute of Chicago was a mystery to me back in those years,” he said. “Where I’d go was the Field Museum and look at things rather than looking at art. I think I’ve really always been more interested in things than in anything else.”

At Yale, which he entered in 1946, he was drawn to literature and studied with the formalist critic Cleanth Brooks, but he was an eccentric student at best. “I actually left once before I graduated,” he said. “One day, I just got on a train and came to New York and sat on a park bench in front of City Hall and read ‘Moby-Dick.’ ” His early 20s were spent in a peripatetic drift that was equally Kerouacian: cub reporter in Chicago, sent to find bodies floating in the river; ad agency stint drawing insects for an insecticide company; dishwasher in Oakland, where he traded drawings for rent. In San Francisco he met the poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and in Los Angeles he feared for his life. “I sat next to two guys at a diner who were plotting a murder, honest to God. L.A. was really a terrifying place for me that first time.”

But his wandering, he said, gave him the courage to try New York. He moved there in 1956, and it was as if the city had been waiting for him. The Abstract Expressionist revolution was running low on gas. The year before, Robert Rauschenberg had made “Bed,” one of his first so-called combines, a melding of painting and sculpture, by drawing and splashing paint on his pillow and his patchwork quilt and stretching them on a wooden frame. Not long before, Jasper Johns had begun his edge-to-edge American flags, rendering an icon not as an image in a painting but as an object in itself. Formal orthodoxies were being detonated in studios all over Manhattan, and Oldenburg could feel the tremors.

“I felt like the Ab Ex painters weren’t saying very much, and I wanted work that would say something, be messy, be a little mysterious,” he said. “Nineteen fifty-nine was the turning point. I was painting these brushy paintings — figurative — and then, thankfully, it all just fell apart.”

Drawing on a longstanding interest in the primitivism of Jean Dubuffet and thinkers about ritual and symbolism like Sigmund Freud and his pupil Wilhelm Stekel, he began making raw pieces that seemed to come straight from the id. They included the first iterations of Ray Gun, a mutable symbol for himself roughly in the shape of a toy laser pistol, a form that continues to fascinate him to this day. (On a visit to the studio’s second floor, he came across a piece of cardboard with three ray-gun shapes on it that appeared to be old raisin cookies nibbled into shape and then glued down. “Not sure what this was for,” he said, looking it over quizzically.) His other alter-ego, my favorite, is a geometrically minimalist mouse head that evokes Mickey and the reels of a film projector, as well as a kind of twilight-zone Modernist future. This symbol took its most improbable physical form in his “Mouse Museum.” An obsessive collection of small pieces and punning found objects (plastic bananas in conversation with dildos), the museum was born in his studio and eventually came to inhabit a snug, vitrine-filled, gallery-size structure shaped like the mouse head, designed by him and van Bruggen; the collection has been periodically exhibited, including a showing at Documenta 5 in Kassel, Germany, in 1972.

In the space of less than five years, in the short-lived but highly fertile gallery scene that sprung up in the East Village and at the legendary Green Gallery on 57th Street, he helped birth not only Pop Art but performance art as well, in maniacal productions with sculpture as props, staged with his first wife, Patty, now Patty Mucha, and compatriots who would later go on to fame as well, like Lucas Samaras and Carolee Schneemann. At one of these performances, “World’s Fair II” (1962), Oldenburg hung a soft sculpture depicting an upside-down New York City skyline from the ceiling in front of an audience in a rented storefront. Many performances consisted of the artist and Patty rolling around or dancing on a debris-covered floor. Writing at the time, the poet Frank O’Hara observed that Oldenburg “actually does what is most often claimed wrongly in catalog blurbs: transform his materials into something magical and strange.”

AS HE APPROACHES his ninth decade, Oldenburg has slowed his once-furious pace of productivity, but he is still at work on public projects and large-scale sculpture. He’s finishing a private commission in California called “Dropped Bouquet,” a colorful maquette of which sits in his studio, and he’ll have a show of new works at Pace Gallery this month in N.Y.C. His energy — some of which goes into a stationary bike he is using to strengthen his legs — remains remarkable. Nearing the end of the third hour of our interview, he kept trying and failing to bring it to a close, spotting other things to talk about, ferrying me up and down in the building’s creaky old freight elevator, big enough to fit a small car.

“I like living in the studio,” he said. “You have the ability to see everything. And you can always change things any way you want them.”

Unlike some other old masters of the New York downtown scene (Jasper Johns, who now lives in Connecticut; Rauschenberg, who died in 2008 and spent much of the later part of his life in Florida) Oldenburg has remained resolutely in the city that nourished his work, with only a couple of periods away in Los Angeles and France, where he and van Bruggen bought and renovated a chateau.

“I don’t get out as much anymore, but I feel like the city is here when I want it,” he said. His daughter, who remembers the scavenged toys she and her brother were allowed to choose from the heaping garbage barrels her father amassed for his work, told me, “It’s always kind of a mystery to me how things still work their way in here. He’s very good at keeping things that he wants to use for later.”

As if to prove her point, he took us to see some small assemblage works he has been tinkering with, simple but unruly arrangements of inconsequential junk on small metal shelves. One in progress consisted of not much more than a cardboard figure of a pinup girl, a brown foam Berenstain Bears novelty headband, some paint-dipped stirrers and a piece of red rope. It looked unaccountably like a deconstructed view of Cezanne’s bathers.

“I put things here and I look at them for a long time and if they don’t belong, well, they’ll get up and walk.” He stared intently at a small plastic toy ladybug, perched tentatively on the edge of the conglomeration. “I told her to get lost,” he said, “but she’s still here.” Hopefully, he added, “Maybe she’ll stay.”",Claes Oldenburg Is (Still) Changing What Art Looks Like,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/t-magazine/claes-oldenburg.html

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

Two months later, Fox News and its parent, 21st Century Fox, forced Mr. O’Reilly out.

What changed? The allegations against Mr. O’Reilly, once conveniently swept aside, had suddenly become a problem. They had become a problem because they had become public (through the same Times reporters who first wrote about the $32 million payout, Emily Steel and Michael S. Schmidt).

In a similar turn of events, earlier this month, Mr. Weinstein did not last a week at his company after The Times and then The New Yorker detailed sexual harassment and abuse claims against him going back decades.

Now, a national reckoning is underway. Allegations of harassment and abuse have prompted action at Amazon Studios, where a female producer’s accusation forced the resignation of its chief, Roy Price; at the APA talent agency, where allegations from at least three men against the agent Tyler Grasham led to his firing; at Vox Media, which dismissed its editorial director, Lockhart Steele, after a woman accused him of misconduct on Medium without naming him; and at Nickelodeon, which severed ties with “The Loud House” creator Chris Savino after several women leveled accusations.

But it is a reckoning long delayed. And a big reason for the delay has to do with the out-of-court settlements and the nondisclosure agreements that go with them.

It was a nondisclosure agreement that turned off the spigot of accusations against the comedian and actor Bill Cosby, who was forced to grapple with women’s complaints when a former Temple University athletic department employee, Andrea Constand, accused him of drugging and sexually assaulting her in 2005. After some dozen others made similar charges in support of her case, Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand reached a confidential settlement.

And it was a nondisclosure agreement that brought to a close the flurry of media attention that followed the lawsuit filed against Mr. O’Reilly by the former Fox News producer Andrea Mackris in 2004. Her silence — along with agreeing to the public statement that there had been “no wrongdoing whatsoever” — went for about $9 million.

Those are only the best known examples. The entertainment news and gossip archives are filled with reports of celebrity sexual harassment cases written in disappearing ink.

Take the summer of 2010. Two women filed lawsuits accusing the actor Casey Affleck of harassment during the filming of “I’m Still Here.” Around the same time, the actress Kristina Hagan charged that the television star David Boreanaz had harassed her when she was an extra on his Fox show “Bones.” Her high-profile lawyer, Gloria Allred, went before a cluster of cameras to declare that Ms. Hagan was “looking forward to her day in court.”

View all New York Times newsletters.

But all three women struck confidential agreements resolving their cases against the men, who denied the claims against them. Mr. Affleck went on to win an Oscar, and Mr. Boreanaz is a star of the new CBS drama “SEAL Team.”

I reached out to Ms. Allred on Friday to discuss what many people were coming to view as the systemic silencing of women — a stratagem that, yes, compensates the accusers, but also enriches the lawyers who arrange the deals and, arguably, leaves other women vulnerable. Wasn’t that system, I asked, stifling a broader discussion?

“My duty as an attorney is to my client and to assist her and protect her and support her in what she thinks is best for her life,” Ms. Allred told me. “I don’t think any woman should be sacrificed for the ‘cause.’”

For a number of women, she said, a confidential settlement is the right outcome. “Some clients want to protect their privacy — they don’t want anybody to know,” she said.

In most cases, Ms. Allred said, if there is no confidentiality agreement, there is no shot at a settlement. And she disputed the notion that out-of-court settlements somehow let the alleged harassers off scot-free.

”If the accused sexual harasser is paying my client $500,000, or $1 million or $2 million, that’s not nuisance value,” she said. “That’s an admission that the accused feels that he has risk and that he has done something that he should not have done.”

Still, Mr. O’Reilly has lately asserted that he struck the deals only to “protect my family.” Over the weekend, he used his website to call the latest Times report a “smear piece.”

In return for the $32 million he was said to have paid Ms. Wiehl, Mr. O’Reilly bought more than her silence. As part of the deal, the Times reported, all text messages and other communications between them were destroyed, and he got an affidavit, signed by Ms. Wiehl, in which she attested that she had “no claims” regarding the allegations in her initial complaint.

Because of such agreements, it required months and months of reporting on the part of those who nailed down the stories on Mr. O’Reilly and Mr. Weinstein — just as they stymied so many earlier efforts by others. Jessica E. Lessin, the editor in chief of the tech news website The Information, said that the use of nondisclosure agreements slowed its investigation into sexual harassment allegations in Silicon Valley — specifically, against Justin Caldbeck of Binary Capital. (He resigned from Binary and apologized, saying it was wrong to “leverage a position of power in exchange for sexual gain.”)

“The freedom to tell your story shouldn’t be easily signed away,” Ms. Lessin told me. “It doesn’t mean there aren’t cases where it’s reasonable to use them, but they appear so frequently that it is a sign that women are being forced to sign away their rights to free speech.”

Binary, by the way, was protected by another form of legal silencing — nondisparagement clauses attached to employment contracts, which, as The Times reported in July, the company sought to use to keep complaints from going public. The Weinstein Company had a similar provision.

The New York State Legislature is considering legislation that would void contract provisions that keep employees from bringing harassment and discrimination claims.

“Perhaps he didn’t realize the kind of message his criticism sends to young women across the country about how men continue to view the issue of speaking out about sexual harassment,” she wrote. “Perhaps it’s his own history of harassment of women which has, as you both knew, resulted in payouts to more than one woman, including recently, that blinded him to the folly of saying anything other than ‘I am sorry for the women of this company who never should have gone through that.’”

Ms. Kelly, who worked at Fox News from 2004 until January of this year, also criticized Irena Briganti, the network’s top communications executive, for “vindictiveness.”

Ms. Briganti did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News, said, “Irena is a valued colleague and she has our full support.”

Ms. Kelly is a month into her role as host of “Megyn Kelly Today.” The show’s ratings have gotten off to a rough start: For the week of Oct. 9, she had about 2.3 million viewers, a 23 percent drop from the figure for the same time slot a year ago.

Jeff Christensen/Associated Press 1958年的今天，《蓝精灵》首次出现在一本欧洲的漫画杂志上。

幕后故事

“他们只有两英寸高，非常像德国人。他们是蓝色的，住在森林深处。”

时报就是这样向读者介绍《蓝精灵》(Smurfs)的，这部卡通及系列周边是1958年的今天首次出现在一个欧洲的漫画杂志上的。

《蓝精灵》是比利时漫画家皮埃尔·库利福德(Pierre Culliford)的作品，他的作品都以笔名皮尤(Peyo)发表。

一开始，这些穿着制服、像小矮人一样的角色是在另一部漫画系列《施通福》(Schtroumpfs)中作为配角出现的，但他们迅速有了自己的专辑和电影（详细历史在此）。

在美国，他们以荷兰名字“斯莫夫”(Smurfs)流行了开来，并且于1981年开始在一个周六早间节目中播放后，成为了经久不衰的流行文化指称。

如今，在电脑游戏玩家中，“smurfing”的概念指的是技术高超的玩家匿名玩游戏的做法。在银行业，“smurfing”这个词意味着多人洗钱的一种方式。它还是一种1980年代的霹雳舞风格，并且存在着一种“蓝精灵”阴谋论。

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said.
Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls.
“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said.
“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said.","Having spent 15 years photographing child marriages around the world, Stephanie Sinclair is uniquely positioned to understand its lasting impact on communities and, especially, on the girls who were forced to wed against their will. “You can’t expect individuals who have been through significant abuse to just act normal as soon as they get out of that situation,” she said. “They need to be nurtured, to be given the time and the tools to heal.”

With this in mind, Ms. Sinclair last year started the Tehani Photo Workshop — named after an 8-year-old Yemeni bride — in partnership with the Samburu Girls Foundation. The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said. Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls. “The independence that comes with a such a career, the knowledge you acquire through meeting other people, and the freedom the camera gives you to express yourself can’t be underplayed,” she said. “Instinctively, I knew that a photo workshop could nurture the girls in a unique way.”

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

《华盛顿邮报》(The Washington Post)专栏作家安妮·阿普尔鲍姆长期以来一直住在东欧，撰写关于那里的文章，她最著名的作品是获得普利策奖的《古拉格：一部历史》(Gulag: A History)。但我最喜欢的是她1994年出版的《东西之间：跨越欧洲边界》(Between East and West: Across the Borderlands of Europe)，这本书怪异而新颖，讲述她从波罗的海旅行至黑海的经历，她所经过的地区和城市在20世纪里曾先后属于好几个不同的国家。例如，今天的乌克兰西部城市利沃夫(Lviv)曾是苏联的Lvov；之前在两次世界大战之间曾是波兰的Lwow；1914年之前，它又是奥匈帝国的莱姆堡(Lemberg)。这还不包括它曾在一战期间被沙皇俄国占领，在二战期间被纳粹德国占领，1918年被一个短命的乌克兰民族主义组织占领的经历。

在那次旅行中，她走访的大多数人都感到自己的民族身份受到现在所属的国家的威胁、这个国家在过去曾是他们的压迫者。他们觉得自己不公平地变成了立陶宛化的波兰人，或者是白俄罗斯化了的立陶宛人或鲁塞尼亚人——鲁塞尼亚人没有自己的国家，而其他人似乎都有自己的国家。这本书很有先见之明，因为近几年崛起的政治人士精心培养的正是这种怨愤的、受伤的民族或国家自豪感，从布达佩斯的维克托·欧尔班(Viktor Orban)、莫斯科的弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir Putin)，到华盛顿的唐纳德·特朗普。

这种冲突的民族主义幽灵也贯穿在阿普尔鲍姆的新书《红色饥荒：斯大林对乌克兰的战争》之中，该书详细讲述了于1933年达到顶峰的大饥荒，据估计，它导致500多万苏联人死亡，其中390多万为乌克兰人。斯大林从之前几年开始，无情地强迫数百万独立的小农进入新的集体农场，他确信这样能够提高生产力，养活苏联的城市。那些农民当然拒绝放弃自己的土地，纷纷屠杀和吃掉被要求跟他们一起带走的家畜，他们被带去集体农场后——有时是被枪逼着去的——几乎毫无劳动积极性。

这当然是故事的一部分，但阿普尔鲍姆更多强调了与今天关系重大的一点：长期以来，俄罗斯一直将乌克兰视为一块有利可图的殖民地，因此一直担心失去那块领土。甚至连解放农奴的改革者，沙皇亚历山大二世(Alexander II)也将乌克兰语书籍和杂志列为禁书，禁止在剧院和歌剧院中使用这种语言。当时，尽管乌克兰城市里有很多俄罗斯人，但农村地区大部分人都讲乌克兰语，然而，学校里的儿童总体上必须接受俄罗斯语教育。

一战快结束时，各个帝国纷纷崩溃，在这种混乱之中，乌克兰宣布独立，但它著名的肥沃黑土和黑海港口成为各种相互对抗的独立运动的诱人战利品，遭到白俄罗斯人、布尔什维克以及其他邻国争夺。经过数年极度血腥的争夺之后（1919年，基辅经历了十几次易手），乌克兰被两个新生国家瓜分：波兰和苏联，后者抢占了大部分领土。

阿普尔鲍姆写道，甚至在实施灾难性的集体农业生产之前，俄罗斯的新统治者就已“再次遵循沙皇设定的先例”，“他们查封了乌克兰语报纸，禁止在学校使用乌克兰语，关闭了乌克兰语剧院”。1920年代中期，苏联政权稳固确立后，开始尝试一项新政策，就像在苏联的其他非俄罗斯地区一样，给予乌克兰语官方语言的地位，允许出版权威的乌俄词典。

然而，这个实施有限宽容政策的时期并没有让乌克兰人成为幸福的苏联人，只是引发了近800万居住在俄罗斯的乌克兰人建立更多乌克兰语学校的呼声；乌克兰人还要求进一步扩展边界，以纳入那些乌克兰人居住的地区。克里姆林宫感到警惕，因此迅速扭转了政策。



1920年代末期，东正教的乌克兰教派遭到镇压，数以万计的乌克兰教师和知识分子遭到逮捕，其中45人在哈尔科夫歌剧院接受了一场作秀式的审判。在学校和图书馆中，数以千计的乌克兰语书籍被清理出去。那个字典项目如今被判定为颠覆行动，很多项目工作人员遭到逮捕和枪杀。一些乌克兰词语被规定不得在报刊上使用，必须以更近似俄语的词汇代替。官方甚至从乌克兰语的西里尔字母表中删掉了一个字母，让它看上去更像俄文，仿佛字母表也犯了叛国罪，不得不受到惩罚。

然后是一个完全不合情理的计划，迫使苏联最高产的一些农民放弃土地，搬到未经尝试的新集体农庄。这不仅是强行开展一个失败的意识形态规划，其执行过程也极为残酷，令数以百万计的乌克兰农民忍饥挨饿。农民家中不允许私藏粮食：共产党积极分子小队到他们家中搜查，掀开地板，用铁棒戳穿草堆，发现的东西一律没收，连下一年的庄稼种子也不放过。无数男女老少因饥饿而死，一具具瘦骨如柴的腐烂尸体在路边堆积起来，野狼侵占了废弃的农舍，然而搜查行动还在继续，搜出来的粮食有一部分被出口海外换取硬通货。当忠诚的党干部也开始表示反对时，他们遭到解职、监禁或枪杀。斯大林在1932年写信给亲信拉扎尔·卡冈诺维奇(Lazar Kaganovich)说道，如果对强征和集体化的抵制情绪不加以镇压，“我们就有可能失去乌克兰。”

有计划的饥荒，处死该国最优秀的艺术家与知识分子，对教会的破坏，以及对该国传统村庄文化的摧毁，这一切吓住了所有希望自治与独立的乌克兰人，令他们只能缄口不语。最终，过了60年，斯大林所担心的事情几乎在一夜之间发生了，俄罗斯真的失去了乌克兰。如今，普京决心恢复俄罗斯对乌克兰的影响或控制力，其背景的一部分正是20世纪之初两国人民交织在一起的这段悲惨历史。

阿普尔鲍姆辛勤挖掘了大量资料来源，包括饥荒幸存者的口述史；乌克兰的国家与地方档案（包括秘密警察档案）；以及俄罗斯于1990年代公开的档案——其后部分档案又遭到封存，但是许多学者事先已经把其中不少文件公之于众。历史学家罗伯特·考奎斯特（Robert Conquest）曾在30年前著有《悲伤的丰收》(The Hearvest of Sorrow)一书，堪称研究这段历史的开创性著作，但是阿普尔鲍姆收集的许多资料都是他当年无法得到的。

其中一段描述来自年轻的威尔士记者加雷斯·琼斯(Gareth Jones)，1933年，他在遭受饥荒的地区徒步走了40英里，离开这个国家后，他为这场浩劫写下了一份对于西方媒体来说非常罕见的亲历实录。琼斯曾为此受到赞扬，但是关于他，阿普尔鲍姆还讲述了另一个鲜为人知的故事：琼斯说出自己的经历之后，斯大林政府成功采取强硬手段，令英美驻莫斯科记者出言否认他所说的一切——尽管这些记者当中有些人还是琼斯的消息来源，把如果由他们自己报道就会遭到审查的信息透露给他。这个故事提醒人们，政客为了封锁或扭曲真相可以做出多么过分的行径——如今在很多国家，这个问题的严重性都不亚于80年前的苏联。

“Whatever Ms. Wilson said was not fabricated,” Ms. Johnson said.
When asked if she wanted to say anything to Mr. Trump, the young widow decided against delivering a message.
“I want to know why it took them 48 hours to find my husband,” Ms. Johnson said.
On Monday, Ms. Johnson also pushed back against Mr. Kelly’s criticism of Ms. Wilson for hearing the call.","On Monday, even as White House officials conceded privately that they had to find a way to move beyond the episode, Mr. Trump refused to back down, posting a message on Twitter that contradicted Ms. Johnson’s account after her interview was broadcast.

The president’s response seemed certain to keep alive the extraordinary squabble, which erupted a week ago when Mr. Trump was asked about the deadly ambush in Niger and asserted wrongly that previous presidents had not called the families of American troops killed in action. He then proceeded to call relatives of the soldiers killed in Niger, only to have Representative Frederica S. Wilson, a Florida Democrat who listened to Mr. Trump’s conversation with Ms. Johnson, criticize the president publicly for his words.

On Monday, Ms. Johnson supported Ms. Wilson, who has been feuding with both Mr. Trump and Mr. Kelly over the call.

“Whatever Ms. Wilson said was not fabricated,” Ms. Johnson said. “What she said was 100 percent correct.”

Ms. Johnson said that on the call, she let Mr. Trump do most of the talking as her anger grew. When asked if she wanted to say anything to Mr. Trump, the young widow decided against delivering a message.

She did, however, say that she was desperate to know more details about the disappearance and death of her husband, and described him as “caring” and a “great soldier.” The couple had known each other since she was 6 years old.

“I want to know why it took them 48 hours to find my husband,” Ms. Johnson said.

She also shared a deep concern over not being allowed to view her husband’s remains.

“They won’t show me a finger, a hand,” she said. “I know my husband’s body from head to toe and they won’t let me see anything,” she said. “I need to see my husband.”

After a service member is killed on the battlefield, the military’s mortuary affairs personnel often do everything they can to prepare the deceased for a potential viewing. In some cases, however, if the wounds are too grievous or the body is extremely disfigured, the military might suggest that the coffin remain sealed.

Tech. Sgt. Holly Roberts-Davis, who is in charge of public affairs at Dover Air Force Base’s mortuary affairs division, said that families were not allowed to see the remains of their loved ones until after the body is inspected and cleared by the division’s medical examiner. Once that is complete, the family is free to open the coffin.

The back and forth began after Sergeant Johnson and three Americans were killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger. The president called Ms. Johnson and said that her husband “knew what he signed up for,” and referred to the soldier as “your guy.” Ms. Wilson, a longtime family friend who accompanied Ms. Johnson and heard the call, recounted what the president said to several reporters and lamented that the president had offended the young widow, who was upset that the president did not seem to know Sergeant Johnson’s name.

Mr. Trump angrily disputed that account, saying that he “had a very nice conversation with the woman, with the wife, who sounded like a lovely woman.”

Last week, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that Ms. Wilson’s account was “totally fabricated,” although the woman who raised Sergeant Johnson said it was accurate. And Mr. Trump has continued to target the congresswoman, calling her “wacky.”

In a White House briefing, Mr. Kelly harshly criticized Ms. Wilson, who had known Sergeant Johnson’s family since he was in elementary school, for listening to the call. Mr. Kelly called the lawmaker an “empty barrel” and also misrepresented her remarks when he accused her of bragging about securing $20 million for an F.B.I. building in South Florida and twisting President Barack Obama’s arm.

Video of Ms. Wilson’s speech, released by The Sun Sentinel, a newspaper in South Florida, showed that during her nine-minute speech, Ms. Wilson never took credit for getting the money for the building, only for helping pass legislation to name the building after two fallen federal agents. She also never mentioned pleading with Mr. Obama, and she acknowledged the help of several Republicans, including John A. Boehner, then the House speaker; Representatives Mario Diaz-Balart and Carlos Curbelo; and Senator Marco Rubio.

On Monday, Ms. Johnson also pushed back against Mr. Kelly’s criticism of Ms. Wilson for hearing the call. The widow said she had asked the military official accompanying her family to put the call from President Trump on speakerphone so others could also hear his words.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Kelly “absolutely” stands by his Thursday remarks.

“General Kelly said he was ‘stunned’ that Representative Wilson made comments at a building dedication honoring slain F.B.I. agents about her own actions in Congress, including lobbying former President Obama on legislation,” Ms. Sanders said in a statement. “As General Kelly pointed out, if you’re able to make a sacred act like honoring American heroes about yourself, you’re an empty barrel.”

Over the weekend, the dispute continued with Mr. Trump posting Sunday on Twitter, “Wacky Congresswoman Wilson is the gift that keeps on giving for the Republican Party, a disaster for Dems. You watch her in action & vote R!”

Several women from the Congressional Black Caucus also wrote a letter demanding an apology from Mr. Kelly.

“We were appalled by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly’s statements where he called Congresswoman Wilson an ‘empty barrel’ and accused her of taking credit for securing funding for a new F.B.I. Building,” the lawmakers said.

“General Kelly’s comments are reprehensible,” the letter stated. “Congresswoman Wilson’s integrity and credibility should not be challenged or undermined by such blatant lies. We, the women of the Congressional Black Caucus, proudly stand with Congresswoman Wilson and demand that General Kelly apologize to her without delay and take responsibility for his reckless and false statements.”",Soldier’s Widow Says Trump Struggled to Remember Sgt.

“To see those deep characteristics of the Balkan people that I believe are common all over the peninsula.”The Balkan people were very hospitable, Mr. Nikolaou said, though he preferred to stay in the remote, rural areas.
That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.","Thodoris Nikolaou has spent the last three years — and counting — crisscrossing the Balkan Peninsula to create a visual mosaic of the region’s people and their stories. But for Mr. Nikolaou, the project, called “…Balkaniotheque” and sponsored by the Onassis Foundation, became more than a multifaceted look at the region. It has been a search for his very identity.

“I am a Greek,” said Mr. Nikolaou, who calls both Athens and Chalkis home. “And I have multiple identities. I belong in the East, in the West, but I also belong in the Balkans. This was forgotten for Greeks. None define themselves as Balkan. I had to find myself.”

Early on, Mr. Nikolaou said the project felt like psychoanalysis, a dive into his soul and the way he learned how to feel. He became fixated on the notion of a shared, repressed Balkan identity, one that he could unearth and restore to the collective memory.

“I wish to describe the Balkan soul,” he said. “Which seems to be dark and intractable, but it becomes simple, warm and human when it flames up.”

Mr. Nikolaou said he allowed the places to which he journeyed to choose him, not the other way around. In his travels, he’s been to nearly a dozen countries, exploring bustling capital cities as well as Roma ghettos and mountain villages.

“I made more than 20 trips trying not just to take photos, but to feel the Balkan reality,” he said. “To see those deep characteristics of the Balkan people that I believe are common all over the peninsula.”

The Balkan people were very hospitable, Mr. Nikolaou said, though he preferred to stay in the remote, rural areas. “There I met the most important people,” he said. “People totally free from the stress of our civilization. People with pain in their eyes but firstly, with big, big heart.”

He bore witness to funerals, celebrated at weddings and made intimate connections with those who opened their homes and lives to him. That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.

“The Balkans are a place where people look so different, but they are so alike in the way they face life,” he said. “And that must be what will lead us in the future. It may seem utopian, but deep inside me I believe that all people can live without borders. Even in the war-crushed Balkans, we can. It is enough to look at what it is that unites us. And what unites us is more important than what keeps us divided.”

The 2017 edition includes Route 710 in Pasadena, Calif., Interstate 70 in Denver, Interstate 375 in Detroit and, paved enemy No.
“When we put out a call last summer for freeways without a future, we got almost 75 recommendations,” she said.
It skirted the city’s waterfront and was demolished instead of rebuilt after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
“We had to make the big argument, the Jane Jacobs argument, that the freeway was harmful to the whole city,” he said.","One of the groups leading the new charge is Congress for the New Urbanism. Since 2008, it has published a biennial list called “Freeways Without Futures,” which names highways whose elimination would, according to its website, “remove a blight” from their cities. The 2017 edition includes Route 710 in Pasadena, Calif., Interstate 70 in Denver, Interstate 375 in Detroit and, paved enemy No. 1, the Scajaquada Expressway.

Lynn Richards, the president and chief executive officer of C.N.U., said that removing a highway is “a somewhat radical idea.” “There’s a lot of analysis that needs to go into it about where the traffic is going to go,” she said.

But already, several cities have removed or decommissioned existing highways, including Paris; Seoul, South Korea; Boston; and Portland, Ore. Last year, Rochester buried a portion of a downtown expressway known as the Inner Loop, a stretch of sunken highway the city’s mayor likened to a “moat.” It is being replaced with a boulevard on the same grade as the rest of the streetscape.

And because of a confluence of factors, including the embrace of ride-hailing services like Uber and the rebirth of cities as places to live, work, raise families and retire to, advocates like Ms. Richards see an “incredible opportunity” to remove even more pavement. “When we put out a call last summer for freeways without a future, we got almost 75 recommendations,” she said. “This can kick-start a conversation about the best way to spend infrastructure dollars.”

Many in-city highways were built during the post-World War II boom years with easy money from the 1956 Federal-Aid Highway Act. They hail from an age when the automobile was ascendant and were built to quickly move commuters in and out of urban centers; many of these highways were used by white suburbanites and built in low-income minority neighborhoods (“white men’s roads through black men’s homes,” went a saying in Washington).

Perhaps the greatest argument that removal advocates have is that so much of this infrastructure is nearing the end of its life span. In this era of tight budgets and political gridlock, it may be cheaper for local and state governments to remove a freeway rather than repair or build a new one.

If it sounds counterintuitive, if not crazy, to tear down a highway that still carries thousands of cars and trucks each day, there are a number of case studies to point to. One of the earliest and, to advocates, most successful, was San Francisco’s double-decker Embarcadero Freeway. It skirted the city’s waterfront and was demolished instead of rebuilt after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.

“The Embarcadero came out of the waterfront, and now the waterfront real estate is seeing tremendous value,” said Peter Park, a city planner in favor of removing highways in cities where neighborhoods have been “significantly disconnected.”

Not only in San Francisco but also in every case where a highway has been removed, Mr. Park argues, “the city has improved.”

Mr. Park was the planning director for Milwaukee when the city decommissioned the Park East Freeway spur in 2002. Less than a mile long, the highway hosted traffic snarls each day, but it had its supporters, especially among suburban commuters and truck drivers, and there was concern about what would happen if it was removed.

“The basic argument for it was, people will never get to the city without it,” said John Norquist, Milwaukee’s mayor at the time, who spearheaded the removal campaign. “Well, how do they get to Paris? The arguments were left over from this glorious age of motoring after World War II.”

The bill to demolish the Park East and restore the street grid was around $30 million, significantly less than the $80 to $100 million estimated cost to rebuild the 40-year-old freeway, Mr. Norquist said. He pointed to the rising land values and the slow-but-steady development along the 26-acre corridor in the years since — and the lack of a traffic apocalypse — as signs of success.

Mr. Norquist, who went on to run Congress for the New Urbanism for a decade and is now a semiretired consultant, said removing a highway is not just about addressing local residents’ concerns. “We had to make the big argument, the Jane Jacobs argument, that the freeway was harmful to the whole city,” he said.","Once So Chic and Swooshy, Freeways Are Falling Out of Favor",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/21/style/the-end-of-freeways.html

A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Photo

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

Photo

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Photo

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

In Germany, numerous cities, including the automaking centers Stuttgart and Munich, are considering bans of older diesel vehicles.
City governments are under pressure to ban diesel in order to avoid sanctions for excess pollution.
But consumers are abandoning diesel because of health concerns and fears that they may be compelled to park their cars outside city limits.
In Germany, Europe’s largest car market, sales of cars with diesel engines have fallen more than 20 percent during the last year.","The authorities will track who owes the new fees by using the same enforcement systems used for the congestion charge: Surveillance cameras will monitor vehicles that enter and leave the city center, and a failure to pay the levy will result in an additional fine.

“We’ve got a health crisis in London caused directly by the poor-quality air,” Mayor Sadiq Khan said in an interview with the BBC on Monday. “Roughly speaking, more than 9,000 Londoners die prematurely because of the poor quality air.”

Mr. Khan said air pollution contributed to the underdevelopment of children’s lungs and the development of maladies like asthma, dementia and strokes in adults. In a statement, the mayor said he himself had recently begun to suffer from asthma.

The mayor’s office posted a flurry of statistics online in support of the fee. It said drivers made roughly six million trips in London each day and roughly a third of them drove less than two kilometers, or about 1.2 miles.

Roughly 40 percent of air pollution in the city comes from diesel vehicles, Mr. Khan’s office said. Many of those are being driven short distances or for less-than-urgent reasons like “shopping, leisure and personal business,” it said.

“Many of these trips could be made in other ways,” it said. “Unnecessary car use is putting our health at risk.”

London’s action is likely to embolden other European cities to impose similar restrictions. Paris, Madrid and Athens have announced plans to ban diesels beginning in 2025. In Germany, numerous cities, including the automaking centers Stuttgart and Munich, are considering bans of older diesel vehicles.

Despite assertions by automakers that diesel is clean, studies by the German, French and British governments have found that virtually all manufacturers took advantage of loopholes in European Union regulations. That allowed them to weaken a vehicle’s emissions controls during everyday driving to reduce wear and tear on the car’s antipollution equipment.

As a result, levels of harmful nitrogen oxides in urban areas have remained high despite emissions standards that, on paper, have grown progressively more rigorous. City governments are under pressure to ban diesel in order to avoid sanctions for excess pollution.

The backlash against diesel has even become a threat to Germany’s economy, which is dependent on automaking. Until recently more than half of new cars sold in Europe had diesel engines, largely because of tax breaks that ensure that diesel fuel is less expensive at the pump.

But consumers are abandoning diesel because of health concerns and fears that they may be compelled to park their cars outside city limits. In Germany, Europe’s largest car market, sales of cars with diesel engines have fallen more than 20 percent during the last year.",London Adds Charge for Older Diesel Vehicles to Fight Pollution,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/business/london-diesel-congestion-charge.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

A month ago, Mr. Rajoy promised that Catalonia would never hold an illegal referendum on independence, while Mr. Puigdemont told Catalan voters that they would.
After the referendum, Mr. Puigdemont and Mr. Rajoy engaged in a game of chicken, exchanging ultimatums.
Mr. Puigdemont could still forestall the application of Article 155 if he decides to call new elections himself, pre-empting Mr. Rajoy.
“But the worse way would have been if Mr. Rajoy had now tried to act very minimally and then still have failed.”","“You need mistakes on both sides to get entangled in such a difficult and undesirable situation,” said Pablo Simón, a politics professor at the Carlos III University in Madrid.

Catalan separatists have been flouting Spain’s Constitution, he argued, but “the central government could have searched for political dialogue and really reached out to the more moderate Catalans.”

“Between fiercely defending the status quo in Spain and claiming the right to self-determination,” Mr. Simón added, “there are a lot of gray areas that have simply been left unexplored.”

Separatism has century-old roots in Catalonia, a region that has its own culture and language. It was one of the factors that plunged Spain into a civil war in the 1930s that was then followed by a lengthy dictatorship under Gen. Francisco Franco.

But after Franco’s death in 1975, Catalonia endorsed Spain’s democratic Constitution. Working hand in hand with politicians in Madrid, conservative politicians in Catalonia acted as a buffer against smaller parties advocating secessionism.

Still, the desire for a distinct identity was not slaked. Catalans tried to finesse greater autonomy for themselves, striking a deal in 2006 that was approved in a Catalan referendum — as well as by both Catalan and Spanish lawmakers — and one that might have forestalled the current crisis over yet more extreme demands.

But Spain’s constitutional court rejected part of that text in 2010 after Mr. Rajoy’s Popular Party had campaigned fiercely against it.

In each and every subsequent round of the conflict, Mr. Rajoy and Mr. Puigdemont have both raised the stakes and boxed themselves into a corner by making irreconcilable pledges.

No small amount of the momentum that thrust the country into crisis was the desire to save face by both men, who were playing to vastly different political constituencies.

Above all, Mr. Rajoy could not afford to appear weak. In his decisions, he was looking beyond Catalonia at the rest of Spain, where a firm stance has allowed him to reclaim a national leadership that was seriously put at risk in 2016, following two inconclusive national elections amid major corruption scandals afflicting his governing Popular Party.

Catalan secessionism also allowed Mr. Rajoy to rope in the main opposition Socialist party into a shared commitment to defend Spanish unity.

Mr. Puigdemont, on the other hand, gained by playing to the home crowd with promises of independence that always amounted to castles in the air, in a European Union committed to defending its member states against any rebellion by one of the Continent’s regions.

This dynamic steadily widened the gap between the two leaders.

A month ago, Mr. Rajoy promised that Catalonia would never hold an illegal referendum on independence, while Mr. Puigdemont told Catalan voters that they would.

On Oct. 1, almost 2.3 million voters defied a Spanish police crackdown to vote overwhelmingly for independence, in a referendum that was held without legal guarantees and was boycotted by most Catalan citizens opposed to secession.

After the referendum, Mr. Puigdemont and Mr. Rajoy engaged in a game of chicken, exchanging ultimatums.

Then on Saturday, Mr. Rajoy set in motion what Ernesto Ekaizer, a Madrid-based journalist, described as “a bulldozer” to quash secessionism.

By invoking Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, Mr. Rajoy now intends to remove Mr. Puigdemont and other separatist leaders from office, and call new elections within six months.

Article 155, a vaguely worded provision in the Constitution that has never before been tested, in effect allows the central government to strip the autonomy of a region that is “seriously prejudicing the general interests of Spain.”

Writing on Sunday in Ara, a Catalan separatist newspaper, Mr. Ekaizer warned that Mr. Rajoy’s intervention could backfire and “won’t do anything more than make the situation more serious.”

Indeed, the path ahead in such a scenario is treacherous. Not least, Catalans have already voted for a regional Parliament where a majority of lawmakers support secession, even without so far winning a majority of the votes in the region. There is not much reason to believe the outcome of a new vote would be different.

Mr. Rajoy and the Spanish courts may be tempted to ban hard-line separatist parties and their politicians. But the impulse may only lead them further down a path that Catalans see as increasingly repressive, as Madrid attempts to get the lawmakers it wants in Catalonia, not the ones it has.

Mr. Rajoy is likely to get approval on Friday for his emergency measures from the Spanish Senate, where his conservative party holds a majority.

Separately, the Catalan Parliament is set to meet this week to review what Mr. Puigdemont described as Mr. Rajoy’s decision to “eliminate our self-government and our democracy.”

While the chasm between both sides is wide, it may not be unbridgeable.

Mr. Puigdemont could still forestall the application of Article 155 if he decides to call new elections himself, pre-empting Mr. Rajoy.

Alternately, he could get his separatist lawmakers to vote for a unilateral declaration of independence, as he recently threatened.

“We’re reaching the end of a poker game in which both players have now shown their trump cards but not actually put them on the table,” said Antón Costas, an economics professor at the University of Barcelona.

“So however bad things look, there is still a final opportunity to have neither a declaration of independence nor Article 155,” he said.

But such an off-route may easily be passed given the speed of Catalonia’s crisis. With each missed opportunity to defuse the dispute, the gulf between the sides only widens.

In 2012, coinciding with the global financial crisis and the meltdown of Spain’s banking sector, grievances over the failure to gain greater autonomy turned instead into Catalan demands for a better fiscal deal for the prosperous region, which Mr. Rajoy rejected.

That rebuff pushed Catalonia’s conservative government to embrace an independence project whose appeal on the street grew. Even after Spain came out of recession in late 2013, the independence movement was in full flow.

In defiance of Spain’s courts and government, Catalonia held a nonbinding independence vote in 2014 that was followed by regional elections in 2015, in which an unwieldy alliance of separatist parties won most seats in the Catalan Parliament, but only 48 percent of the vote.

Since then, Mr. Puigdemont has used Mr. Rajoy’s stonewalling as a reason to pursue his statehood project unilaterally, under self-made Catalan laws, rather than those of Spain.

Mr. Rajoy didn’t negotiate earlier because he probably assumed that “demands for independence were linked to economic problems and would evaporate once the crisis was over,” said Mr. Simón, the politics professor.

Now, Mr. Rajoy is committed to using the “logical tool” of Article 155, even if taking charge of Catalonia is “a high-risk operation, which can provoke disobedience by civil servants and peaceful resistance by citizens,” Mr. Simón added.

Still, Mr. Rajoy has won significant cross-party backing for his strategy in Catalonia, said Luis Garicano, a leading member of the center-right Ciudadanos party that has been a staunch ally of Mr. Rajoy in opposing Catalan secessionism.

“It’s never good news that things should get this far, but what is very, very good news is that there is a lot of unity among the constitutional forces, especially with the Socialists,” Mr. Garicano said.

“We can’t know for sure what comes next,” Mr. Garicano added. “But the worse way would have been if Mr. Rajoy had now tried to act very minimally and then still have failed.”","In Catalonia Crisis, Shared Blame for ‘a Difficult and Undesirable Situation’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/world/europe/catalonia-spain-carles-puigdemont-mariano-rajoy.html

“The book release would have been terrifying regardless,” she said, adding that it was even more so “with the new complications in my life.”

“I’ve never done anything like this,” she added. “I get to hide behind characters.”

She’s resigned herself to fielding questions about the split, and says that if she had published the memoir a year from now, she would have had time to reflect on and address their separation in the book. “The story is kind of dull,” she said. “It’s a little bit like, two incredibly busy people that care a lot for each other got really busy.”

Ms. Faris’s editor at Dutton, Jill Schwartzman, said she was confident that the memoir wouldn’t be overshadowed by Ms. Faris’s separation because it’s ultimately a funny and revealing look at Ms. Faris, through the lens of her relationships.

“Unqualified,” which grew out of Ms. Faris’s popular podcast, is goofily self-deprecating, casually profane and occasionally raw, earnest and blunt, like Ms. Faris herself. She seems determined to catalog her own flaws and foibles — an offensive tactic, she admits, against critics who would gladly pile on. She concedes that she can be heedless and impulsive in love.

But coming on the heels of her separation from Mr. Pratt, the book often reads like a love letter — or now, a heartfelt epitaph — to a marriage.

Ms. Faris chronicles the highs and lows, but mostly the highs, of their courtship and marriage. In a chapter titled, “Take Me Home Tonight. Literally,” Ms. Faris recalls developing a crush on Mr. Pratt while working on the comedy “Take Me Home Tonight,” when she was still married to the actor Ben Indra. (After realizing she was attracted to Mr. Pratt, Ms. Faris told Mr. Indra over the phone that she wanted a divorce, then announced to everyone on set that she had left her husband.)

Later on, she describes how, on one of her first dates with Mr. Pratt, she ate a fly to impress him. She also reveals trying moments, like the wrenching weeks after their son Jack was born prematurely and had to spend about a month in the neonatal intensive care unit. In what would have been a stressful time for any parents, Ms. Faris and Mr. Pratt had the additional burden of facing paparazzi who stalked them at the hospital entrance.

With characteristic self-effacement, Ms. Faris also addresses the downsides of being a famous Hollywood couple, including her feelings of insecurity when Mr. Pratt starred with Jennifer Lawrence in the sci-fi epic “Passengers” and the tabloids speculated that they were a couple: “Of course it’s hurtful and also embarrassing when people are saying your husband is cheating on you — even if it’s patently untrue,” Ms. Faris writes.

Mr. Pratt — who went from playing a lovable, dimwitted side character on the NBC sitcom “Parks and Recreation” to full-blown movie stardom, with leading roles in blockbusters like “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “Jurassic World” — is a looming presence in “Unqualified,” from the first page to the acknowledgments. Ms. Faris dedicated the book to him, and thanks him for “being just about the best person I know.”

In his foreword to the book, Mr. Pratt obliquely references the separation, and intentionally butchers the spelling of “foreword,” as part of a running joke that he doesn’t know what the word means. “When I was asked to write the forward for ‘Unqualified,’ Anna’s memoir, I immediately said yes without even thinking about it,” he writes. “And boy did a lot happen between then and now. So much. Like … soooo much.” Mr. Pratt also makes an extended guest appearance later in the book, in a chapter titled, “She Said, He Said: What It’s Like to Be a Couple in Hollywood,” which consists entirely of dialogue between them. (A publicist for Mr. Pratt said he was unable to comment for this article because “his schedule is completely over committed at this point.”)

Ms. Faris, 40, grew up in Edmonds, Wash., and has been acting since she was 9. She got a degree in English literature from the University of Washington, then moved to Los Angeles. Her first role in a major film was playing Cindy Campbell in “Scary Movie,” a campy horror parody. In the ensuing years, she was often cast as the drunk girl, the ditsy sidekick or the adorable goofball. Eventually, she started producing and landing leading roles in comedies like “The House Bunny” and “What’s Your Number?” Next year, she stars in a remake of the 1987 romantic comedy “Overboard,” which originally featured Goldie Hawn as a self-involved heiress.

In 2015, she started a podcast, “Anna Faris Is Unqualified,” a show that has been described as a mash-up between Marc Maron and Dear Abby. On the show, Ms. Faris and her co-host, Sim Sarna, take calls from listeners and dole out relationship advice, often with celebrity guests weighing in (T.J. Miller, Lisa Kudrow, Aubrey Plaza and Chelsea Handler have all made appearances). The podcast gave her the idea for the book.

In the last chapter of “Unqualified,” Ms. Faris noted that she started seeing a therapist while writing the book, and that she has grown skeptical of the idea of “closure” following a breakup.

“I just wanted to make sure that anyone who was actually willing to read the book felt like I wasn’t glorifying my life at all. I am clearly a flawed person,” she said in the interview. “This is terrifying,” she added — that word again — “that I’m writing about stuff that makes me feel incredibly vulnerable.”",Is Anna Faris Unqualified?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/books/anna-faris-book-chris-pratt.html

Not much is known about the people who built the edifices, but they are thought to have constructed them at least 2,000 years ago and maybe as far back as 9,000 years ago, according to Dr. Kennedy. They are believed to be the ancestors of the modern-day Bedouin people in the region.

The most well-known of the basalt boulder structures are the “kites,” which were first identified by air pilots in the 1920s. Each looks like a child’s kite, complete with strings and long fluttering tails that are two-dimensionally flattened into the ground.

Archaeologists think ancient nomadic tribes used the kites, which can be more than a mile long, for hunting. The structure’s two long converging walls would funnel stampedes of gazelles into the body of the kite, where they would be slaughtered.

But the lava fields extend beyond Jordan’s borders into countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia. So do their mysteries. Saudi Arabia in particular offers a wealth of harrats that are just out of Dr. Kennedy’s reach.

“We would have loved to fly across into Saudi Arabia to take images. But you never get the permission,” he said. “And then along comes Google Earth.”

In 2004, Dr. Abdullah Al-Saeed, a neurologist and founder of the Desert Team, a group of amateur archaeologists in Saudi Arabia, explored the bleak lava field known as Harrat Khaybar. He saw walls of stones stacked about three feet high, but said that he did not appreciate their unique design at that time.

Then in 2008 he returned to the same spot from his desktop computer.

“When I saw the updated images of Harrat Khaybar from Google Earth, I was literally stunned and could not sleep that night,” Dr. Al-Saeed said in an email. “Flying like a bird all over the Harrat from one enigmatic structure to another! How come we passed by these structures without appreciating their design?”

He spoke to his colleagues, and they set out to investigate the most striking structure they saw in person. The Harrat Khaybar was more than 550 miles from Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. So they took a plane to a nearby city, rented a car and set out for the volcanic domes. In order to navigate the rocky terrain, they had to do much of their exploration on foot through the lava field.

“The question we always discuss while investigating them is, why here? Why in this stony, frightful, rugged land?” he said. He snapped several photos and sent them along with the Google images to archaeologists like Dr. Kennedy for feedback.

“Absolute bafflement.” That’s what Dr. Kennedy said he felt when he first saw the satellite images. Suddenly, he was confronted with structures quite different from anything he had ever seen before. He called them gates because when looked at horizontally, they resemble a simple fence with two thick upright posts on the sides connected by one or more long bars.

“They don’t look like funerary, for disposing of dead bodies. They don’t look like structures where people lived, and they don’t look like animal traps,” he said. “I don’t know what they are.”

More Reporting on Archaeology

For nearly a decade, he has painstakingly cataloged nearly 400 gates. In 2011, his work was featured by Google in a video (for which he was paid). The longest gate he had identified was more than 1,600 feet long, though most were between 160 and 500 feet long. Sometimes the posts were as thick as 30 feet. One gate is intertwined with a kite.

Next he hopes to get accurate dating of the gates, which he suspects may in some cases be older than the kites, and perhaps the oldest man-made structures in the landscape. He invites armchair archaeologists to search the harrats online and share any finds with him.

“More will be found as more people get involved in scouring the landscape from satellite imagery,” he said.

Stephan Kempe, a retired professor of physical geology at Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany, who was not involved in the paper, called the gate structures interesting and said that the new study was one of a series of papers describing previously unnoticed structures in the Saudi Arabian lava fields.

“There are many other features that have only recently been understood as forming classes of prehistoric ‘geoglyphs’ that were widespread in an area thought to be very barren and devoid of human impact,” he said in an email.

He added that he would have liked to have seen some suggestions from Dr. Kennedy as to what the gates may have been used for, if only to dissuade people from speculating as to extraterrestrial origins, as they have regarding the Sphinx and the Nazca Lines in Peru.

This is not exactly an avant-garde idea. I learned it from my mom, who learned it from hers, and so on, back until what I would imagine was the dawn of time. This has always been the role of the black mother in the community. We watch the kids. All of them. This is that “village” that we hear so much about but that has somehow been forgotten. All I’ve done is try to revive its spirit.

We were brought to that corner in June 2015 when a mother was murdered while breaking up a fight. That summer there was another murder one block to the east and then another one block to the west. A police siege and an unlawful search of a 94-year-old woman’s home also happened on the block that summer.

The children saw all of this, and unfortunately, those will always be their memories. They’ll never forget the sobbing over an aunt shot on the street, the fear of the police who lined the big boys up and took them to jail. This was what their summers had looked like for so long. As a mom and a human being, I could not go back to my home unbothered. These were my memories now, too. I didn’t want them, and I didn’t want the children to have them. So we made brand-new ones.

After just three summers on the block, violent crime and gun-related incidents in that census tract have declined dramatically. And this has had a ripple effect as far as a mile out. The neighborhood elementary school attended by a majority of our children has also seen improvements in student performance. All of this has happened with no real resources, new jobs or governmental assistance.

The most frequently asked question we get is: How did you do it? It’s simple. We cared. We put on hot-pink T-shirts, got our lawn chairs and a couple of packs of hot dogs, and went to the corner and cooked some dinner. We showed up and established a presence in the neighborhood. We’re also creating small community centers in vacant lots around the city, where kids can play, study and get a hot meal.

We also listened to the people there. They told us how to stop gun violence in their neighborhood and pretty much all the other ones just like it. They told us they needed resources, jobs and skills training. They told us they needed schools that could prepare their children to compete in a world that will soon be run by computers. They need a share of that $95 million planned for a new police and firefighter training center, because now the community polices itself.

They told us that it was great that their children were learning their rights in school but that they wanted more qualified teachers who could teach them to read and write. And with a chunk of that $95 million, we could afford it. Sure, we still have gang violence. The cure for that is bringing jobs and resources to impoverished neighborhoods. We know that.

Senator John McCain took what was widely perceived as a jab at President Trump during an interview that aired on Sunday, as he condemned the ways in which wealthier Americans avoided serving in the Vietnam War.

Speaking on C-Span, Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, used bone spurs as an example of the kind of condition that allowed some to avoid being drafted during the conflict. Mr. Trump was exempted from military service after receiving a diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels.

“One aspect of the conflict, by the way, that I will never, ever countenance is that we drafted the lowest-income level of America and the highest-income level found a doctor that would say that they had a bone spur,” Mr. McCain said. “That is wrong.”

Trump on Monday tried to keep the fires burning, sending out a tweet that said, “Two dozen N.F.L. players continue to kneel during the National Anthem, showing total disrespect to our Flag & Country. No leadership in NFL!”

What he overlooks is that over the past year, N.F.L. players have sustained a national dialogue about social justice that often only briefly pops up after police shootings or society-rending riots.

Whether you like it or not, the N.F.L is among the most watched pieces of entertainment on the planet, with a massive platform. Many players have used it to provide poignant moments.

The Seahawks’ Michael Bennett brought a military wife to tears of understanding as he exchanged views with veterans outside the gates of the team’s practice complex. His teammate Doug Baldwin Jr. joined N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman in support of the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2017.

The Steelers’ Alejandro Villanueva, a West Point graduate with a Bronze Star for valor as a platoon leader in Afghanistan, memorably stood by himself with his hand over his heart during the anthem as his team waited off field. He then movingly explained why he could not turn his back on the flag and apologized to his teammates for botching the team’s plans and making them look bad.

None of it has done much good for Kaepernick or the team that he once took to the Super Bowl. Last week, he filed a complaint against the N.F.L., accusing all 32 teams of colluding to keep him out of the league. He is an activist now and has more than likely kissed away whatever slim chance he had to play in the N.F.L again.

On Sunday, there were plenty of empty seats here and about half the filled ones were inhabited by fans wearing the blue and white of the Cowboys. Levi’s Stadium hasn’t been a popular home for the 49ers since opening in 2014. Fans complain that the tickets are too expensive and the commute is too far from San Francisco.

Still, it was a jarring sight on an afternoon that San Francisco legend Joe Montana and more than 30 members of the 49ers’ Super Bowl winning teams were here at halftime to honor another icon, Dwight Clark, who is battling the neurological disease A.L.S. It was Montana and Clark who teamed up for “The Catch” in 1982, one of the most famous plays in N.F.L history, a 6-yard pass in the back of the end zone in the final minute to beat the Cowboys and advance to the Super Bowl.

Those glory days seem like ancient history. In the locker room after the game, Kaepernick and social awareness meant little to a winless and beaten up team. C.J. Beathard, the rookie quarterback who was sacked five times, summed up the 49ers’ season like a 10-year veteran.

Sure, it was a massacre, but hardly a last stand.

“Yeah, we are 0-7. There’s only one way to go, and that’s up,” he told reporters. “And we’ve got a lot of season left ahead of us to get better, turn the season around and make something out of it.”","Two Teams, One Anthem: An N.F.L.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — There are two kinds of people: Those who like their crosswords knotty and difficult, and those who pray for mercy just so they can make some headway. Eventually, and with enough practice, the mercy-seekers become the challenge-seekers. And then they claim that they have given up on doing the early week puzzles, because those are way too easy.

It’s a fair point. For some solvers, the Monday and Tuesday puzzles don’t present much of a challenge, but those puzzles are not really for them. They are for the people still getting the hang of solving, and for the ones who can appreciate a good, straightforward theme. They are for those who like to start their week on a positive note, with a win.

So the solvers who crave more of a challenge wait all week for the Friday and Saturday puzzles — they might even indulge themselves in a Thursday, with its gimmicky themes — and claim to be disappointed if the Friday is “too easy” for them. Don’t say “No, I would never do that”: I’ve seen you on Twitter.

I have news for those solvers: Today’s puzzle is not that hard, which, of course, is a totally subjective call. I didn’t find it hard. But I’ve also been solving every single day for a very long time. Maybe I’m just on the wavelength of the constructor, Peter Wentz. But it’s easy to make this puzzle fall. Sorry. Maybe Saturday will be harder.

SPECIAL POST — A team from Japan won the 26th World Puzzle Championship, which ended Saturday in Bangalore, India. The U.S.A. and Germany finished second and third.

The three-day competition — a companion to the World Sudoku Championship, held earlier in the week — drew 169 contestants from 27 countries. Over three days, the competitors tackled more than 300 pencil-and-paper puzzles involving logic, numbers and pictures. There were no crosswords or other puzzles testing vocabulary or knowledge, so everyone could compete on an equal basis irrespective of language or nationality.

In some rounds, lasting up to 60 minutes, the puzzles were so challenging that many contestants scored zero points. Three example puzzles from the competition, not the hardest ones, appear below.

Look to this age alone.

But however self-confident Mao’s early dreams of glory, his supreme leadership was far from preordained. On the eve of his coming out as a Marxist at age 27, he was an unsophisticated provincial nationalist. He gloomily dismissed the chances of the new Chinese republic surviving, wondered about Hunan becoming an American state and advocated that all of the Chinese provinces should become separate countries.

It was only in November 1920 that he admitted defeat: The Hunanese did not have the vision to appreciate his ideas. He wrote to his activist friends in the provincial capital to say that he would henceforth be a socialist. He was just in time.

Communist cells had been organized in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities, and in mid-1921, the first congress of the Chinese Communist Party was held. Mao, who had quickly organized a Communist group in Hunan, achieved the cachet of being one of only 12 delegates to attend. He was thus an early tiger.

The Soviet agents who funded and masterminded the organization of the early C.C.P. reported to the Comintern, the agency for spreading Soviet ideas and influence abroad. With memories of defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5, and competing with Japan for influence in Manchuria, the Soviets needed a strong China as an ally against Japanese expansionism.

The fledgling C.C.P. was too weak. The Soviets decided to bolster the well known revolutionary who had helped bring down the Manchu dynasty but had then been pushed aside by warlords: Sun Yat-sen.

They provided him with funds, reorganized his Nationalist party, known as the K.M.T., and helped him to train an army. C.C.P. members were instructed by Comintern agents to back the K.M.T., and even become members, but to retain their allegiance to the Communists. The plan was for the C.C.P. to take over the K.M.T. from within after the Chinese warlords were conquered by this united front.

Most of the C.C.P. leadership opposed the Comintern policy; they thought collaboration with the “bourgeois” K.M.T. would demoralize their members. But the piper called the tune, and they joined the K.M.T., few more readily than Mao.

Two events set Mao off on a new, career-shaping course. The first was Chiang Kai-shek’s attack on the Communist Party. By 1927, after Sun Yat-sen’s death, Chiang Kai-shek had taken over the leadership of the K.M.T., and he had conquered much of the southern half of the country. Aware of the Soviets’ long-term aim for a C.C.P. takeover of the K.M.T., he short-circuited the plan in May 1927 by ordering the slaughter of Communists, mainly in Shanghai. Communist leaders scattered in flight.

The other event was Mao’s experience with peasant power. After the death of their parents, Mao and his two brothers owned a valuable property back in their home village that had been built up by their father. The family had made the transition from poor to rich peasants. And though he had grown up surrounded by the miseries of rural life, as a fledgling Communist, Mao had been focusing on the urban proletariat until Moscow, realizing that China was different, ordered more attention be paid to the peasantry.

Mao became active in peasant affairs, and his transformative experience was witnessing and chronicling an uprising in his native Hunan. In a famous passage, he rejected allegations that the peasants had gone too far:

A revolution is not the same as inviting people to dinner or writing an essay or painting a picture or embroidering a flower; it cannot be anything so refined, so calm and gentle.

Witnessing the bloodshed in the Hunanese countryside, Mao was discovering his other persona. As the scholar-diplomat Richard Solomon first pointed out, Mao reveled in “luan,” or upheaval. When young, Mao had written that for change to come about, China must be “destroyed and reformed.” He now realized that only the peasantry could bring that about. Mao would be the monkey king to lead that destruction.

The primary source for the monkey king is the classic Chinese novel “The Journey to the West.” Ostensibly about the famous Chinese monk Xuan Zang, who made the arduous crossing of the Himalayas to seek out original Buddhist scriptures in India, “Journey” is a fantastical tale in which Sun Wukong, the monkey king, plays a major role as the monk’s escort. In the early 1960s, when the C.C.P.’s quarrel with the Soviet Communist Party was underway, Mao praised the monkey king:

A thunderstorm burst over the earth,

So a devil rose from a heap of white bones.

The deluded monk was not beyond the light,

But the malignant demon must wreak havoc.

The Golden Monkey wrathfully swung his massive cudgel

And the jade-like firmament was cleared of dust.

Today, a miasmal mist once more rising,

We hail Sun Wu-kung, the wonder-worker.

Mao then rose from guerrilla chief in the late 1920s to a party leader in the mid-1930s on the Long March, the flight of the C.C.P. from the southeast to the northwest to escape Chiang Kai-shek’s attacks. This was an epic event in Communist annals because it took a year, covered some 6,000 miles and reduced the 85,000 who had set out to a mere 8,000 by the time they reached the northwest. He absorbed two lessons: All power grew out of the barrel of a gun; and most of the time peasants were very difficult to organize because they had fields to tend and families to feed.

From the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s, Mao played his tiger role. He led an increasingly strong and efficient party and army that survived the anti-Japanese war and then defeated Chiang and the K.M.T. in the civil war of the late 1940s. From 1949 until 1956, Mao presided over the installation of the Communist dictatorship in China, rooting out all opposition, real or imagined, and transforming the ownership of the means of production from private hands to socialist control.

It was then that he dabbled in the monkey business for the first time. From the point of view of a dutiful C.C.P. cadre, “monkey business” could be defined as any measure that would disrupt the party’s standard operating procedures. Cadres did not appreciate it when Mao in 1956 exhorted intellectuals to “Let a hundred flowers bloom” and a year later again encouraged intellectuals to criticize the conduct of the party. As members of the ruling elite, the cadres resented being criticized, and Mao, having promised that the criticisms would only be like a light rain, quickly wound up the campaigns when they turned into a typhoon, and purged the critics.

Mao truly became the monkey king by starting the Cultural Revolution in 1966 to dispel the “miasmal mist” of Soviet-style “revisionism” from the C.C.P. Now, it was the youth of China, not the peasants, who were to be his agents of destruction, as major party and government departments were trashed and their officials humiliated and purged.

For Mao, the Cultural Revolution ended in 1969 with the appointment of a new, and hopefully more revolutionary, leadership. But though he had dealt the age-old bureaucratic system of China a terrible blow, he knew that it could rise again from the ashes. He always emphasized that China would have to experience regular Cultural Revolutions.

But when Mao’s chosen successor, Hua Guofeng, repeated that dictum, he sealed his fate. Deng Xiaoping and his fellow survivors did not want any more monkey kings plunging the party and the country into chaos again.

And yet today, China’s current ruler, Xi Jinping, with his relentless anticorruption drive to make officials more honest, has unleashed another Cultural Revolution against the bureaucracy, albeit one that is controlled from the center not from the streets.

This is the action of a monkey king. There is no chaos today, but there surely is widespread fear and resentment as his mighty cudgel claims more victims.

The 19th Communist Party Congress currently underway will confirm that Mr. Xi is top tiger, the most powerful ruler since Mao. But Mr. Xi will have to ensure that his alternate persona as monkey king does not loom too large. As the revolutionary founder, Mao could never have been toppled.

Though things were far from stable outside the city, Ms. Angulo experienced “privileged opulence,” as she called it: a kidney-shaped pool, a governess, children’s parties with “acrobats, fire-eaters, puppet theater, and even the occasional Russian dancing bear.” Outside the city, warlords were jockeying for power, and Japan was threatening.

After nine years, a reassignment took the family to Hawaii, but two years later they were back in China, this time in Shanghai, where her father took command of a ship stationed there. “Life in Shanghai was more frenetic than in Peking,” she wrote, with a swirl of nationalities on hand.

Ms. Angulo, though, had embarked on a different life. Despite the bombs, the parties continued in Shanghai, and at one of them, she met an American lieutenant, James Rockwell. They were married, and in 1940, when he was recalled to duty in the United States, she accompanied him.

He died in 1996; Ms. Angulo is survived by a daughter, Alix Rockwell Jacobs; two grandsons; and two great-grandchildren.

Researchers have even found occurrences among sign language users. (Those, they call tip-of-the-finger states.)

We’re more likely to draw blanks on words we use less frequently — like abacus or palindrome — but there are also categories of words that lead to tip-of-the-tongue states more often.

Proper names are one of those categories. There’s no definitive theory, but one reason might be that proper names are arbitrary links to the people they represent, so people with the same name don’t possess the same semantic information the way that common nouns do, Abrams said.

We want to be in control, or at least to give control to trained professionals, like doctors. We don’t want computers to be in charge.

Researchers at Penn and the University of Chicago have conducted some clever experiments that capture this phenomenon. They asked participants to complete tasks (like predicting which business-school applicants would go on to successful careers) and compare their performance with a computer algorithm’s. After the computer made a mistake, people were reluctant to use it again. After the people made mistakes, their self-confidence didn’t budge.

They rationalized their own imperfections, while obsessing over the computer’s shortcomings. It didn’t matter that the human beings made more mistakes — a lot more — than the computer.

So it is with driving. Human driving is a public-health scourge. More than 37,000 Americans died in crashes last year, most from human error. In my community, the heartbreaking toll included a mother, father and their teenage son, killed when a speeding car slammed into their car on one of those busy suburban roads. Their teenage daughter survived.

The death count from cars exceeds that from guns. So if you are outraged by guns and want things to change, you should feel the same about car crashes.

Technology creates an opportunity to save lives. Computers don’t get drowsy, drunk or distracted by text messages, and they don’t have blind spots. Just look at commercial airlines: Automation has helped all but eliminate fatal crashes among American air carriers. The last one happened in 2009.

The technology for semi-driverless cars still isn’t good enough or cheap enough. The $50,000 Volvo I was driving — like a Tesla I’ve tried — got confused by unpainted lane lines, for instance, and I had to take over. But the technology is improving rapidly. Within a few years, many cars will have sophisticated crash-avoidance systems.

I expect that we will agonize about using them, out of both legitimate caution and irrational fear. Any driverless crashes will be sensationalized, as has already happened, while we ignore tens of thousands of deaths from human crashes. But I still expect that driving will be revolutionized sooner than many people now understand.

Those researchers at Penn and Chicago also studied the circumstances in which people get comfortable with computer control, and found a theme: When the choice isn’t all or nothing — when people have “even a slight amount” of control — they are more open to automation.

That’s where driving is headed. The shift will be gradual, not sudden, as Google’s chief economist, Hal Varian, told me. Cars will handle many tasks, while a human driver will have override power. The combination won’t be perfect, but it can be much better than the status quo.

My own experience also leads me to think that attitudes may change quickly. One of the more powerful forces in human psychology is known as the familiarity principle. After people have experience with something, they usually feel more positively about it.

I began my short time with the Volvo too nervous to use some features. By the end, I was confident that the car made me safer. Now that I’m back to driving a nearly decade-old Toyota, I miss the things that initially made me anxious.",Driverless Cars Made Me Nervous.

Major League Baseball had experimented with helmets before Mr. Hale’s work. When he formally introduced his Little League helmet in 1958 at the Little League Congress in Chicago, he staged a demonstration of a helmet that was being used in major league games. When his cannon unleashed a 95-mile-an-hour fastball, the helmet split from top to bottom.

Mr. Hale’s dual-earflap helmet became mandatory for Little League batters and runners in 1961. At its World Series that year, he later recalled, a boy was struck in the helmet by a pitch and fell to the ground.

“After being examined by a doctor, he hopped up and ran to first base,” Mr. Hale recounted in “More Than a Bat and a Ball: My 60 Years at Little League,” an autobiography, written with Mary Ellen Gardner, that was published by Little League Baseball in 2015. “No one wants to see a child in peril, but for me that was the ultimate field test and outcome.”

Mr. Hale also invented a catcher’s helmet with a mask attached to it and a chest protector that guards the catcher’s throat. He worked with Alcoa Aluminium and other companies to develop aluminum bats as a cost-effective alternative to wooden bats, which often shattered and had to be replaced.

Aluminum bats became controversial for the speed with which balls leave them, compared with that of wooden bats, and for the injuries that have been caused by them. Aluminum bats and others made of composite materials are used at youth, high school and college levels. Little League bats are moving toward meeting a standard in which they would perform like wooden ones.

In the 1970s Mr. Hale was chairman of a committee of the National Academy of Sciences that developed a new military helmet made of Kevlar.

Creighton J. Hale was born on Feb. 18, 1924, in Hardy, Neb. (He was given a middle initial but not a middle name.) His father, Russell, was a farmer, teacher and school superintendent. His mother, the former Anita Fay Farthing, was a teacher and homemaker.

As a boy, Mr. Hale played baseball but was more interested in boxing, football (he wore a leather helmet), basketball and track. He was so competitive, he wrote, that he entered a state typewriting speed competition as a teenager and won the 15-minute contest.

After serving in the Navy, he graduated from Colgate University in upstate New York, then earned a master’s in physiology at Springfield College in Massachusetts, where he taught for five years and worked on military research, including testing a more ergonomic infantry pack. He received a doctorate in the physiology of muscular activity from New York University.

While at Springfield, he was asked by Branch Rickey, the renowned Brooklyn Dodgers executive who by then had become the general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates, to develop a way to measure a player’s skills and predict his performance. (The tests he devised did not provide many answers.)

The Little League was a boys-only organization when Mr. Hale became its executive vice president in 1971. A case brought to the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights by the National Organization for Women changed that; a hearing officer ruled in 1973 that the prohibition against female players violated state and federal anti-discrimination laws.

Mr. Hale testified at the hearing that studies showed that the bones of females were weaker than those of males.

Girls began playing in the Little League in 1975 after the league’s charter was amended.

Stephen D. Keener, the Little League’s president and chief executive, said in a telephone interview that while Mr. Hale “defended the Little League position in the early 1970s that girls were not permitted to play,” he “would later say, ‘If I knew then what I know now, we were defending the indefensible.’ ”

Mr. Hale became president of the Little League in 1973 and its chief executive 10 years later. He retired in 1994.

During his tenure, Little League greatly expanded around the world.

“When I started here in 1980, we were in 18 or 19 countries, and we’re in 84 countries now,” said Mr. Keener, who succeeded Mr. Hale. “That’s largely due to his commitment to grow the game globally.”

In addition to his son, Mr. Hale is survived by his wife, the former Beverly Gray, who worked at Little League for 50 years; his daughter, Kathy Dumanis; 10 grandchildren; nine great-grandchildren; and his brother, Russell. Mr. Hale’s first marriage, to the former Rita Hugo, ended in divorce.

“Little League is not a baseball program, it’s a leadership program,” Mr. Hale told The Sioux City Journal in 1992. “We use baseball as a vehicle to do other things. There’s no place for 2.6 million kids on major league teams.”","Creighton Hale, 93, Inventor of Little League Helmet, Dies",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/obituaries/creighton-hale-dead-inventor-of-little-league-helmet.html
