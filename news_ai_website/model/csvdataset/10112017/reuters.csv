Separately, Tillerson said there was no indication that Lebanon’s former prime minister, Saad al-Hariri, was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will but that the United States was monitoring the situation, according to a press pool report of his remarks.

Tillerson, who is traveling with President Donald Trump on an Asia trip, made the comments following talks with his Saudi counterpart this week.

Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia’s future king, has tightened his grip on power through an anti-corruption purge by arresting royals, ministers and investors including billionaire Alwaleed bin Talal who is one of the kingdom’s most prominent businessmen. He was among 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers who were detained.

Asked about the Saudi purge, Tillerson said he had spoken with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir about the situation on Wednesday and that the recent crackdown did not yet amount to formal arrests.

“Based on that conversation, it’s well intended. How disruptive it’s going to be remains to be seen,” Tillerson said, adding that the situation was “still a bit unclear.”

“It’s my understanding that they’re characterizing these as not really arrests at this point but they’re presenting people with evidence of what they think the wrongdoing is to see if there’s a willingness to want to make things right.”

“It raises a few concerns until we see more clearly how these particular individuals are dealt with,” Tillerson added.

His view contrasted with that of Trump, who has praised the Saudi purge and expressed confidence in the king and crown prince.

Tillerson also said that Jubeir had assured him that Hariri’s decision to resign was taken “on his own.”

The United States was watching the situation “very carefully,” supporting “the legitimate government of Lebanon” and “asking other outside parties to stay out of it,” he added.

“If he’s going to step down, as I understand it, he needs to go back to Lebanon to make that official. I‘m hopeful that if that is still his intent to leave that he’ll do that so that the government of Lebanon can function properly,” Tillerson said.

Russian number one Rublev, the highest-ranked qualifier for the tournament at 37th in the world, dominated his fellow 20-year-old with superior firepower to win 4-1 4-3(6) 4-1 in little over an hour at the Fiera Milano.

It was too easy for Chung in the opening two sets but 65th-ranked Medvedev emerged from his slumber to make a match of it.

Chung re-asserted his authority in the third set, although he did have to save three break points when leading 2-0 -- letting out a huge roar as he made his way back to his seat.

He then broke again to finish the job.

Coric, who perhaps regretted battling back from two sets down to win his final round-robin match against Karen Khachanov despite already having qualified, looked jaded and took his frustration out on his racket.

Twice he broke frames in the third set as Rublev raced away to victory and a final against either Chung Hyeon or fellow Russian Daniil Medvedev who are in action later.

Coric was too passive in the first set but revived in the second after coach Christian Schneider told his player, through headphones, to “give me more energy”.

The Croatian got himself into a tiebreak but a poor forehand at 6-6 gave Rublev a second set point and he made no mistake.

One of the many innovations at the Next Gen Finals, the headphone exchanges between coach and player make for interesting listening for the crowd and TV audiences and Coric’s reaction to losing the second set was candid.

“I don’t know what to do any more,” he said, before crumbling to defeat.

Coric even became irate with one live Hawkeye call -- the system that has replaced human line judges at the event.

Rublev, who came into the tournament on the back of three straight defeats, said it was his best performance so far and hopes to reverse his crushing round-robin loss to Chung.

”We’ll see if I can change something,“ he told reporters. ”The first match here, I wasn’t playing that aggressive. I didn’t play that good. I was missing a lot.

Its $1.5 billion of handouts will enrich farmers, fishermen, rubber traders and other interests. In terms of upgrading competitiveness, it falls woefully short.

Najib has talked a good reform game since he assumed control of the United Malays National Organisation – the party that has dominated the country for 70 years – in 2009. He pledged to dismantle a 46-year-old affirmative-action programme championed by his father, former Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, which afforded the ethnic Malay majority preferred access to government jobs, universities and housing. He also promised to lower trade barriers. But apart from implementing a goods and services tax in 2015, nothing much else has happened.

Instead Najib stuck with the low-wage manufacturing formula, delaying a transformation to a higher-value services economy. Even as Chinese companies began eating into Malaysia’s export market share, Najib protected government-linked companies at the expense of the more competitive private sector. As a result, per-capita income looks stalled at $9,500 a year, suggesting Malaysia is snared in the “middle-income trap”, a term referring to the economic plateau many developing nations reach as incomes near $10,000 per annum and cheap labour cost advantages evaporate.

The scandal surrounding 1Malaysia Development Berhad may have sapped what appetite for reform the prime minister had left. Set up by Najib, the fund remains at the heart of multibillion-dollar embezzlement and money laundering probes ranging from Washington to Zurich.

This latest budget is heavy on goodies, such as eliminating tolls on highways through politically contested districts, and it throws more bonuses at the bloated civil service. It’s otherwise devoid of fresh ideas to increase innovation, boost wage equality, reduce living costs, or share more of the 5.2 percent growth rate with non-Malays. Since 2015 Malaysia has fallen five places in the World Economic Forum’s competitiveness report, to 23rd from 18th.

The giveaways may be an attempt to fight off a comeback by Mahathir Mohamad, whose premiership, which ran from 1981 to 2003, is credited for transforming the country into an Asian tiger. Mahathir dismissed Najib’s spending priorities as “sweets”.

The government denies that economic progress has paused.

The coalition said on Monday it would close all air, land and sea ports in Yemen to stem the flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran, after Saudi Arabia intercepted a missile fired toward its capital Riyadh.

The al Wadea border crossing, linking Saudi Arabia with territory in eastern Yemen controlled by the Saudi-backed government, was reopened on Thursday, a Yemeni official and witnesses said, letting food and other supplies across.

The United Nations has said that a total blockade of Yemen could cause a famine that could kill millions. The government-held southern port of Aden was reopened on Wednesday, but ports in Houthi-held areas are still shut.

The Houthis, drawn mainly from Yemen’s Zaidi Shi‘ite minority and allied to long-serving former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, control much of the country including the capital San‘aa. Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies have been waging war against them on behalf of the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, based in Aden.

The Saudis and their allies say the Houthis get weapons from their arch-foe, Iran. Iran denies arming the Houthis and blames the conflict in Yemen on Riyadh.

FUEL AND VACCINES RUNNING OUT

Yemen’s stocks of fuel and vaccines will run out in a month unless the Saudi-led coalition allows aid into the blockaded port of Hodeidah and the airport at San‘aa, UNICEF’s representative in the country said on Friday.

Meritxell Relano, speaking by phone to reporters in Geneva, said fuel prices had risen 60 percent and there were urgent concerns about a diphtheria outbreak, as well as food shortages because of the port closure.

“The situation that was already catastrophic is just getting worse,” she said. “The impact of this is unimaginable in terms of health and diseases.”

After two years of civil war, Yemen has 7 million people on the brink of famine and has had 900,000 suspected cholera cases in the past six months.

United Nations aid chief Mark Lowcock said on Wednesday that if the coalition did not allow humanitarian aid access to Yemen, it would cause “the largest famine the world has seen for many decades, with millions of victims.”

The cholera epidemic had abated in recent weeks with the number of cases slowing amid a major push to fight the disease. But the World Health Organization said the progress could be reversed by the blockade.

“If the closure is not stopped in the coming days, we may see that the progress is stopped,” WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a briefing in Geneva. “We can see even more cases and more deaths as a result of not being able to get access to people.”

The closure of Hodeidah port prevented a ship setting sail from Djibouti with 250 tonnes of WHO medical supplies on Wednesday. Trauma kits in particular are running short.

“If the hostilities continue and the ports remain closed, we will not be able to perform life-saving surgeries or provide basic healthcare,” Chaib said.

Germany will double its aid to UNICEF for Yemen to 20 million euros this year to help deal with looming famine, bringing its total annual aid to Yemen to 70 million, a spokeswoman for the development ministry said on Friday.

“The suffering of the people in Yemen is inconceivable and it threatens to become much worse,” Development Minister Gerd Mueller told Passauer Neue Presse newspaper. “We must act now to prevent the death by starvation of millions of women, children and men.”",Saudi-led coalition opens Yemen border crossing; aid agencies warn of famine,https://www.reuters.com/article/yemen-security/saudi-led-coalition-opens-yemen-border-crossing-aid-agencies-warn-of-famine-idINKBN1DA2AH

The government will let foreigners control financial-sector joint ventures, and says it will eliminate ownership caps completely in a few years. Western financiers have been burned by such promises before. But the $10 trillion in uninvested savings languishing in local banks, plus a burgeoning wealth management industry, should encourage experienced players to take a second swing.

Foreign interest in securities joint ventures involving Chinese partners has steadily waned over the past decade, due to lacklustre performance and differences over strategy - the latter aggravated by the lack of control. At the same time, overseas interest in mainland stocks and bonds has faded in the face of volatility, policy opacity, and the difficulty of repatriating profits. China has gone without foreign money that would have helped it meet its own goal of cutting overall indebtedness.

The relaxation of the rules, coming after U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit, marks a diplomatic solemnification of a process already underway. In June, UK-based HSBC (HSBA.L) was allowed to set up a majority-owned securities joint venture. Foreign asset managers have been launching wholly owned entities in anticipation of the full opening of China’s mutual fund industry, which Z-Ben Advisors estimates to have $1.7 trillion under management. It’s the second-largest market of its kind in the region, growing at a rollicking compound growth rate of 29 percent.

It’s true, local competitors look intimidating. Domestic giants like CITIC (600030.SS) and Haitong Securities (600837.SS) have moved steadily up league tables, and the fund management industry is cutthroat. Distortions in Chinese stock, bond and derivatives markets are unresolved. But as execution and efficiency become more important than plain old access to cheap capital, the Western players ought to have an advantage.

Foreign institutions have another selling point: they have big businesses outside of the People’s Republic. There’s a massive pile of cash held uninvested by the Chinese middle class, that could be put to more productive use. As Chinese warm to overseas stocks and bonds, foreign firms who jump in now will be well-positioned to sell into the trend. That’s worth the effort.

CONTEXT NEWS

- The Chinese government on Nov. 11 said it will raise foreign ownership limits in domestic financial firms, a long-anticipated step allowing foreign partners to take more control. The changes include raising the limit on foreign ownership in joint-venture firms involved in the futures, securities and funds markets to 51 percent from the current 49 percent.

- Full foreign ownership of local firms involved in the futures, securities and funds markets will be permitted after three years, while full overseas ownership of insurance firms will be allowed after five years. The foreign ownership limit of 20 percent on a single entity basis and 25 percent on an aggregate basis of any Chinese owned bank and financial asset management company will be removed.

- The announcement followed a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to China, during which the two sides announced of bilateral deals and investments which the Chinese government said were worth a combined $250 billion.

- Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao told a news conference that the change will come into effect following drafting of related rules.

The White House and Republican lawmakers have attacked the firm, Fusion GPS, over the dossier compiled by a former British spy that is central to investigations in Congress and by a special counsel into conclusions by U.S. spy agencies that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election and wanted to help Trump win.

The sources told Reuters that the negative information that Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya wanted to give to Republican Trump’s campaign at a June 2016 meeting in New York had been dug up by Fusion GPS in an unrelated investigation.

Trump’s congressional supporters have suggested that because Fusion also conducted research for lawyers representing a Russian firm in the unrelated matter, the dossier was part of a Russian campaign to help Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Trump backers call the 35-page report a “dodgy dossier” financed by Clinton supporters.

Russia has repeatedly denied allegations of meddling in the U.S. election and Trump denies any collusion between his campaign and Moscow officials.

In an interview with Bloomberg on Monday, Veselnitskaya said she went to the Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner, and top campaign adviser Paul Manafort to show them proof of tax evasion by major Democratic donors.

She said Donald Jr. asked her for written evidence that illegal funds went to Clinton’s campaign, Bloomberg reported.

Emails made public earlier this year by Trump Jr. showed that a publicist for the son of one of his father’s Russian business contacts helped introduce Veselnitskaya and advised him that she and her associates had “sensitive” information that could damage Clinton.

“I love it,” Trump Jr. responded, according to the emails.

In December, 2014, the sources said, Veselnitskaya, who then was involved in litigation pitting her Russian client against British-American financier William Browder, received a legal research memo reporting that the Ziff Brothers, two New York financiers allied with Browder, had made a large contribution to a Clinton charity.

The memo had been prepared by Fusion, which had been hired to conduct legal research on Browder by Baker and Hostetler law firm. The firm represented Russian businessman Denis Katsyv, who was engaged in disputes with Browder and U.S. prosecutors.

Glenn Simpson, one of Fusion GPS’ founders, met with Veselnitskaya about that litigation before and after her meeting with Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort, according to a source familiar with the matter.

However, a source familiar with 10 hours of testimony Simpson gave the Senate Judiciary committee in August said he told investigators he did not know of Veselnitskaya’s Trump Tower meeting until reports of it appeared in the media.

Representatives of the Judiciary Committee’s Republican majority did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Manafort declined to comment.

Representatives for Trump Jr. and Kushner could not immediately be reached for comment and neither could a U.S.-based lawyer for Veselnitskaya.

Two sources said the Fusion GPS work for Baker and Hostetler that produced the information Veselnitskaya offered Trump Jr. and his associates was unrelated to the firm’s work for Perkins Coie, a law firm that represented the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s campaign.

Perkins Coie has acknowledged that it paid $1.02 million to Fusion for research related to Donald Trump and his campaign.","Trump, Clinton camps both offered slice of dossier firm's work: sources",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-fusion/trump-clinton-camps-both-offered-slice-of-dossier-firms-work-sources-idUSKBN1D937W

Mattel, the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels, has been struggling to boost sales. Last month the company suspended its dividend and warned it would miss forecasts for revenue this year.

European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Bank of England head Mark Carney will form an all-star panel on Tuesday at an ECB-hosted conference in Frankfurt.

The subject? “Challenges and opportunities of central bank communication.”

Curve-flattening on both sides of the Atlantic, but more markedly in the United States, suggests investors have doubts over the future path of inflation and may be starting to price in a downturn just as the global economy picks up speed.

Since the Fed began raising rates in 2015, the difference between long- and short-term U.S. yields has shrunk to levels not seen since before the 2008 financial crisis, reaching 67 basis points US2US10=RR -- its flattest in a decade -- in the past week.

That partly reflects uncertainty about the passage of a Republican-sponsored bill to cut U.S. taxes, which has hauled down longer-term projections of inflation while expectations for upcoming rate increases push short-term yields higher.

With curve-flattening typically signaling a muted outlook for both growth and inflation, the trend suggests investors see a risk that the Fed’s current monetary tightening cycle will start to slow the world’s biggest economy.

A flatter curve, which makes lending less profitable, also poses a risk to the banking sector, nursed back to fragile health by central banks after it nearly collapsed a decade ago. But with crisis-era policies still largely in place, how would central banks cushion the impact of a downturn?

RECESSION RISK

S&P Global Ratings said in the past week that it sees a 15-20 percent risk of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months based on economic conditions, government policy uncertainty and continued gradual tightening by the Fed.

Citing economic indicators that show the expansion is either in or approaching a late cycle -- though not overheating -- it forecast robust GDP growth in the second half of 2017.

“Still, monetary policy risk remains in the coming months that is not captured in our quantitative assessment,” S&P said.

”The economy has now more or less closed the output gap ...That means monetary policy is more likely to transition away from the current accommodative stance.

Arrangement of various world currencies including Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, US Dollar, Euro, British Pound, pictured in Warsaw, January 26, 2011. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel

“Furthermore, if a sizeable fiscal stimulus from the U.S. government is to indeed go through in the coming months, it increases the chance of the Fed tightening policy more aggressively.”

Market expectations that the Fed will continue to tighten gradually have generally been preserved by U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to appoint Jerome Powell as Fed Chair when Yellen’s term expires in February.

But with a number of Fed vacancies to be filled, analysts at ING say the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee could yet take on a hawkish hue.

“The combination of upside risks to growth and mounting inflationary pressures, as well as a hawkish rotation in the make-up of Fed voters, suggests that markets are too cautious in only pricing in one (rate) hike next year,” they wrote.

“We’re expecting a December rate hike, and these various factors mean there is upside risk to our call for two further rate rises next year. What’s more, the long end of the (yield) curve will also have to deal with additional supply from the Fed’s balance sheet reduction programme.”

Powell, a 64-year-old Fed board governor and former investment banker, will take over an economy that has been expanding for more than eight years and where unemployment has fallen to its lowest since the early 2000s.

Under his leadership the Fed is widely expected to continue to raise borrowing costs gradually, as Yellen began to do in late 2015, and to shrink the central bank’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet.

It has raised rates twice this year and is widely expected to do so again -- to a target range of 1.25 to 1.5 percent -- next month.

Investors in Europe are also focused on potential future price growth, although the European Central Bank’s more accommodative stance means a different dynamic for bond markets.

The hunt for returns drove the German yield curve, Europe’s benchmark, to its flattest in about two months in the past week, though that trend was reversed on Thursday and Friday.

Market measures of long-term inflation expectations in the bloc have risen in recent months but remain well below the ECB’s near-2-percent target, giving funds confidence that the value of those investments will not be materially eroded. EUIL5YF5Y=R

The ECB’s decision last month to extend its asset purchase program until at least September and pledge to keep rates at record lows until well after that scheme ends have helped push bond yields across the bloc to multi-month lows.

The European Commission said on Thursday that it expected the euro zone economy to grow at its fastest pace in a decade this year before slowing somewhat. A flash estimate of third-quarter GDP in the euro area will be released on Tuesday and October’s inflation reading on Thursday.

Bitcoin has been on a tear in recent months, with a vertiginous sevenfold increase in value since the start of the year that has led to many warnings the bitcoin market - now worth well over $100 billion - has become a bubble that is about to burst.

It reached a record high of $7,888 around 1800 GMT on Wednesday after a software upgrade planned for next week that could have split the cryptocurrency in a so-called “fork” was suspended.

But it has quickly retreated from that peak, falling to as low as $6,718 around 1330 GMT on Friday. It later recovered a touch to trade around $6,880 by 1645 GMT, but that was still down almost 4 percent on the day.

“Bitcoin is all ups and downs,” said Thomas Bertani, chief executive of Eidoo, a cryptocurrency wallet provider that recently became the first startup in the space to take out a full-page advert in the Wall Street Journal newspaper.

“The market realized that the price rise was an over-reaching, so people started selling... (and) there are many long and short positions that amplify price movements.”

As bitcoin tumbled, Bitcoin Cash, which was generated from another software split on Aug.1, surged, trading up as much as 35 percent on the day to around $850, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.

Bitcoin Cash’s transactions are processed in so-called “blocks” that are larger in capacity than bitcoin‘s, so can therefore in theory allow for more transactions to be processed at any given time, making transaction fees much cheaper.

The fork that had been planned for next week, known as “SegWit2x”, had also intended to increase the capacity of the blocks, and could thus have reduced fees for bitcoin transactions.

Any investors, therefore, that see bitcoin more as a currency than a store of value might be choosing to buy into Bitcoin Cash now that Segwit2x had been scrapped, Bertani said.

“People who had been supporting Segwit2x could as an alternative move to Bitcoin Cash,” he said.

According to one of the sources, the 86-year-old executive chairman of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) offered to buy CNN in both conversations.

Another source said Murdoch had “zero interest” in owning CNN.

Representatives of Twenty-First Century Fox, AT&T and Time Warner, CNN’s parent, declined comment.

CNN has become a sticking point in antitrust approval of AT&T’s $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), hatched in October 2016.

Justice Department staff have recommended that AT&T sell either its DirecTV unit or Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting unit - which includes CNN - a government official told Reuters on Thursday, in order to gain antitrust approval.

On Thursday Stephenson said he had no interest in selling CNN and that he was ready to defend the deal in court if necessary.

According to one of the sources on Friday, Murdoch called Stephenson twice, unprompted, on May 16 and Aug. 8 and on both occasions asked if CNN was for sale. Stephenson replied both times that it was not, according to the source.

‘NO SENSE’

It would not be the first time Murdoch has attempted to take control of CNN.

His Twenty-First Century Fox made an $80 billion offer for Time Warner in 2014 but abandoned the plan in the face of Time Warner’s resistance. At that time, Fox had planned to divest CNN - which competes with Fox News - in order to avoid antitrust issues.

There is no law against a company owning two cable networks, but there is a Federal Communications Commission prohibition on owning two broadcast networks. A Fox deal with CNN could also raise antitrust concerns because of the market share that a combined company would have among cable news viewers.

“I have been called and asked if I would sell CNN by numerous people,” Stephenson told the New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday. But he added: “Selling CNN makes no sense.”

Fox has held talks in the last few weeks to sell most of its film and television assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), CNBC reported this week, which would leave the company with its Fox News, sports programming and broadcasting stations..

Twenty-First Century Fox would sell its stake in European satellite broadcaster Sky Plc (SKYB.L) in a deal with Disney, according to CNBC’s report. Fox is trying to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own but the bid is strongly opposed by some lawmakers and has been subject to lengthy regulatory scrutiny.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

Segóvia, que foi indicado ao cargo por escolha pessoal do presidente Michel Temer e com o apoio de políticos do PMDB implicados na Lava Jato, substitui o delegado Leandro Daiello, que permaneceu à frente da PF por mais tempo, 6 anos e 10 meses.

A reunião ocorreu no Ministério da Justiça. Segundo a assessoria de imprensa da pasta, o que ocorreu nesta sexta-feira foi uma “mera assinatura” do termo de posse. A cerimônia de transmissão do cargo, disse o órgão, ocorrerá no dia 20 de dezembro, quando haverá “discursos, entrevistas e demais ações protocolares”.

Não houve aviso da assessoria do ministério ou da PF para a imprensa de que haveria essa reunião. Contudo, uma equipe televisiva da Rede Globo esteve presente ao encontro.

Em rápida entrevista após a posse, segundo informações da assessoria do órgão publicada no site do Ministério da Justiça, Segóvia afirmou que pretende reforçar o combate à corrupção, com a ampliação e melhoria da Lava Jato e criação de mais operações.

“A Lava Jato na realidade é uma das operações de combate à corrupção no país. O que a PF pretende é aumentar, ampliar o combate à corrupção. Então não será só uma ampliação, uma melhoria na Lava Jato, será em todas as operações que a PF já vem empreendendo. Bem como ampliar, criar novas operações”, disse o novo diretor-geral.

Para Segóvia, uma única certeza é que a corrupção no Brasil é sistêmica, mas existe a PF, o Ministério Público Federal e outros órgãos que a combatem e pretendem continuar cada vez mais fortes nessa atuação.

Ao ser questionado sobre ingerência política na PF, o novo diretor-geral disse que “a política, na realidade, faz parte da vida do ser humano”.

“Então, como diretor-geral, eu tenho que realmente trabalhar politicamente com vários órgãos, várias instituições, o que não quer dizer que a gente não combata os crimes, que são cometidos por pessoas. As instituições não cometem crimes, as pessoas cometem crimes. Nas empresas, os funcionários cometem crimes, as empresas não cometem crimes”, disse.

Quanto a mudanças na cúpula da instituição, Segóvia informou que já teve reuniões com os diretores e superintendentes regionais e todos estão tranquilos.

”A gente está começando a trabalhar o processo de transição natural dentro da Polícia Federal. Pretendemos continuar o trabalho e é natural que, com o tempo, haja mudanças“, disse. “Com certeza sempre tem gente que está cansado e quer sair, e tem gente que está novo e quer entrar, isso é natural”, completou.

Segundo apuração da Reuters, o delegado Sandro Torres Avelar é apontado como principal nome para assumir o cargo de secretário-executivo da PF, na prática, o número dois da corporação.

Avelar foi filiado ao PMDB e ocupou o cargo de secretário de Segurança Pública em Brasília com o aval direto do ex-assessor especial do presidente Michel Temer, o ex-vice-governador do Distrito Federal e também presidente do partido na capital, Tadeu Fillipelli.

New York police identified the assailant as Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old Uzbek national, who left a handwritten note in the truck that pledged his allegiance to Islamic State. American security officials did not immediately find evidence that directly tied Saipov with Islamic State. So far, U.S. officials consider him as a “lone wolf” attacker who was inspired by the militant group, but not directed by its leaders or operatives.

“The gist of the note was that the Islamic State would endure forever,” John Miller, New York’s deputy police commissioner, said at news conference on Wednesday. “He appears to have followed almost exactly the instructions that ISIS has put out on its social media channels to its followers.”

Inspired by Islamic State’s detailed propaganda, these lone wolf assailants have turned trucks and other vehicles into highly effective killing machines.

U.S. officials say Saipov appears to have followed instructions distributed by Islamic State in one of its magazines, Rumiyah (Arabic for “Rome”), which in November 2016 called on sympathizers to carry out truck attacks against Western targets. It also urged followers to leave behind notes declaring support for the group and its leaders.

With the fall of Mosul and Raqqa, the last urban centers under Islamic State’s control in Syria and Iraq, the group has now lost most of the territory it once dominated. It’s tempting to assume that the group has been defeated. But it poses a new threat: as a militant organization that can still exploit social media and recruit sympathizers around the world to kill in its name. Islamic State will now invest more of its resources in a “leaderless jihad” that does not need a physical state.

The severe loss of territory in Iraq and Syria means that routes for foreign jihadists to reach the self-declared caliphate have evaporated. But the group still has the capability to attract recruits, raise funds, secure weapons and inspire sympathizers to carry out attacks around the world.

While Islamic State has organized assaults that required months of training and planning -- such as the November 2015 attacks in central Paris, which killed 130 people -- it has moved steadily toward inspiring loosely coordinated and sometimes haphazard attacks by self-radicalized perpetrators.

The latest wave of attacks fits into appeals by Islamic State’s leaders for their supporters to carry out self-directed assaults that use any means necessary -- including trucks, cars, knives and axes -- to kill civilians, especially in the West.

These lone wolf attacks are the result of an organized, decade-old movement within Islamic jihadism to decentralize attacks and make them more diffuse. This trend predated the emergence of Islamic State, and it can be traced back to al Qaeda after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Some of al Qaeda’s leaders were worried that the U.S.-led war after Sept. 11 would hamper their ability to carry out centrally planned attacks, so they sought ways for sympathizers to act on their own.

Islamic State expanded that strategy far beyond al Qaeda’s original conception. In relying on lone wolf attacks by individuals who are self-radicalized and have only a tangential understanding of jihadist ideology, Islamic State is able to project a greater reach than it actually has.

In September 2014, Abu Muhammed al-Adnani, at the time the Islamic State’s top spokesman, issued an audiotaped appeal that explained these new tactics. Adnani, who was killed two years later in a U.S. air strike in Syria, urged the group’s sympathizers to use whatever means at their disposal to attack American and French citizens, and virtually any other Western civilians. “If you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman, or any of their allies,” he said. “Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him.”

Since Adnani’s statement, it became clear that Islamic State would adopt the “leaderless jihad” strategy. For two years, the group has inspired lone attackers to act in its name, especially in the West. These attacks allowed Islamic State’s leaders to create an illusion of strength to make up for their battlefield losses.

In recent months, Islamic State has quickly claimed responsibility for a spate of attacks on civilians in Europe -- especially in Britain and France -- and in the Middle East. In March, a driver mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London, killing five people before being shot by security forces as he tried to break into Parliament. In May, a suicide bomber killed 22 in an attack on a concert arena in Manchester.

In June, three assailants sped across London Bridge in a van, killing eight by ramming into pedestrians and stabbing people with hunting knives. And in August, suicide attackers stormed a Shi’ite mosque in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, killing at least 30 worshipers and wounding dozens.

The threat extends beyond the West and the Middle East. Islamic State fighters from Southeast Asia -- including some who recently battled Philippine security forces in the city of Marawi during a five-month siege -- are starting to return home, especially to Malaysia and Indonesia. These militants would pose a threat because of their battlefield experience, guerrilla warfare training and networks they established while fighting in Iraq and Syria.

To combat this more complex range of threats posed by Islamic State and its sympathizers, governments throughout the world will need to do more than simply continue military strikes against targets in Iraq and Syria. It will also mean greater vigilance in monitoring clandestine networks set up by Islamic State operatives -- and adjusting to a new enemy that is constantly adapting its methods.",Commentary: NY truck attack part of Islamic State’s ‘leaderless jihad’,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bazzi-afterislamicstate-commentary/commentary-ny-truck-attack-part-of-islamic-states-leaderless-jihad-idUSKBN1D162G

According to one of the sources, the 86-year-old executive chairman of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) offered to buy CNN in both conversations.

Another source said Murdoch had “zero interest” in owning CNN.

Representatives of Twenty-First Century Fox, AT&T and Time Warner, CNN’s parent, declined comment.

CNN has become a sticking point in antitrust approval of AT&T’s $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), hatched in October 2016.

Justice Department staff have recommended that AT&T sell either its DirecTV unit or Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting unit - which includes CNN - a government official told Reuters on Thursday, in order to gain antitrust approval.

On Thursday Stephenson said he had no interest in selling CNN and that he was ready to defend the deal in court if necessary.

According to one of the sources on Friday, Murdoch called Stephenson twice, unprompted, on May 16 and Aug. 8 and on both occasions asked if CNN was for sale. Stephenson replied both times that it was not, according to the source.

‘NO SENSE’

It would not be the first time Murdoch has attempted to take control of CNN.

His Twenty-First Century Fox made an $80 billion offer for Time Warner in 2014 but abandoned the plan in the face of Time Warner’s resistance. At that time, Fox had planned to divest CNN - which competes with Fox News - in order to avoid antitrust issues.

There is no law against a company owning two cable networks, but there is a Federal Communications Commission prohibition on owning two broadcast networks. A Fox deal with CNN could also raise antitrust concerns because of the market share that a combined company would have among cable news viewers.

“I have been called and asked if I would sell CNN by numerous people,” Stephenson told the New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday. But he added: “Selling CNN makes no sense.”

Fox has held talks in the last few weeks to sell most of its film and television assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), CNBC reported this week, which would leave the company with its Fox News, sports programming and broadcasting stations..

Twenty-First Century Fox would sell its stake in European satellite broadcaster Sky Plc (SKYB.L) in a deal with Disney, according to CNBC’s report. Fox is trying to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own but the bid is strongly opposed by some lawmakers and has been subject to lengthy regulatory scrutiny.

The airline in September canceled 20,000 flights, saying rostering problems had left it without enough standby pilots to operate without significant delays. The resulting wave of passenger outrage threatened to undo the success of its ‘Always Getting Better’ customer service drive.

Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers has responded by promising pilots improved pay and conditions, which it says exceed those offered by rivals.

In the memo, Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said almost 20 of Ryanair’s 86 bases had voted for the pay deal as of Friday. However, a number of bases, including its largest hub at London Stansted, have rejected the offer.

Some pilots have been using September’s rostering issue to press for better conditions and the creation of a pan-European representative body; Ryanair has long opposed recognizing unions.

Ryanair said in the memo sent on Friday that it would “dramatically increase” the number of pilots employed directly rather than by outside agencies; over 180 first officers would be offered Ryanair contracts in November, and 300 more offers would be made by December.

It also said it had hired 1,040 new pilots this year, with the newest entrants receiving the better pay terms, and that it expected another 400 to join by March, bringing its crewing ratio to 11.0 pilots per aircraft from 10.5 by the time the busy European summer schedule begins.

A new crew control mobile phone app has also been introduced to speed up the logging of absences, and the memo says Ryanair will double the number of base managers to eight in the weeks ahead to “respond even faster to even more pilot queries”.

“We have launched an Always Flying Better (AFB) program to fill the infrastructure gaps in pilot communications, admin support and effective structures for resolving pilot queries,” Wilson said.

Wilson also said a problem with allocated leave for December had caused inconvenience to a small number of pilots.

Some pilots have said that a significant number of their colleagues have reported being assigned annual leave days without consultation.

The fate of AT&T Inc’s (T.N) $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), hatched in October 2016, looks set to end up in court as the two sides have so far failed to agree on what conditions AT&T needs to meet in order to gain antitrust approval.

Justice Department staff have recommended that AT&T sell either its DirecTV unit or Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) Turner Broadcasting unit, which includes news company CNN, a government official told Reuters on Thursday, on the grounds that a combined company would raise costs for rival entertainment distributors and stifle innovation.

AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson said on Thursday he would not sell CNN to win antitrust approval and would fight the government in court if the two sides could not reach an agreement.

“If we feel like litigation is a better outcome then we will litigate,” Stephenson told the New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday. He said the company had been ready to go to court the day the deal was announced in October 2016.

TRAVEL BAN COULD BE PRECEDENT

The deal took on broader political significance soon after it was announced when Trump attacked it on the campaign trail last year, vowing that as president his Justice Department would block it. He has not commented on the transaction since taking office in January.

Trump’s aggressive campaign comments have harmed legal arguments of his administration before.

Earlier this year, an appeals court refused to reinstate a ban on travelers from a group of Muslim-majority nations on the grounds that it illegally targeted people of one religion.

Explaining the decision, the chief judge cited a statement on Trump’s campaign website calling for a ”total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” The U.S. Supreme Court later partially reinstated the travel ban.

OVER BY APRIL

Stephenson has rejected the Justice Department’s arguments against the deal, saying it was a classic “vertical” merger that removed no competitors from any market and denied the company would be too powerful.

He said a combined AT&T and Time Warner would create a data and advertising company competing against the newest and most disruptive entrants into the media sector: Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, not other wireless phone companies.

Stephenson told the conference he has no reason to think Trump would be a factor in the deal’s approval and said he hoped the matter would be settled well before the April 22, 2018 deadline when parties can walk away from a deal.

The head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, said in a statement late on Thursday that he has “never been instructed by the White House” on the AT&T deal.

AT&T told the Justice Department on Monday that it believed it had complied with all legal requirements for the deal to be cleared, a person briefed on the matter said. That sets a deadline for the government to sue if it wants to block the merger. Officials said that detail could be as early Nov. 27.

A heavy metal rendition of the Catalonian national anthem ""Els Segadors,"" or ""The Reapers"" has turned a virtually unknown Virginia-based band, A Sound of Thunder, into celebrities in the politically sensitive region in northeastern Spain. Within days of its release, the song racked up more than a million hits on YouTube, making it the band's most popular single since they started in 2008. Thousands of Catalonians voted for independence from Spain during a banned referendum in October that ended in violence and spurred a constitutional crisis in the euro zone's fourth-biggest economy. Back in Manassas, Virginia, Nina Osegueda, the band's lead singer, made a quick decision to release a video of the band's version of ""Els Segadors"" on Youtube. Osegueda, whose mother is Catalan, has strong ties to the region and originally recorded the anthem as a tribute to her mother. The song was never intended to be released as a single, but instead was part of the band's new full-length album, ""It Was Metal,"" to be released in March 2018. The violence that surrounded the referendum vote changed all that. ""We have a couple other singles that we were planning on releasing in advance to show people what the new album is going to sound like,"" she said. ""But then the vote happened and 800 people were injured by the police trying to vote. So I said we should try and just put the song out to show our support against police brutality."" ""Suddenly it was spreading all over the place... And then I noticed that someone shared us on Twitter and it wound up actually being a Catalan politician,"" Osegueda said. Music stations in Catalonia picked up the song and Osegueda was interviewed on several radio shows. The attention she has received has spread to her relatives as her Catalonian uncle was interviewed on local radio. On the band's YouTube page, fans have left messages saying they prefer the metal version to the original and many have said the song has struck an emotional chord. Osegueda recorded some parts of the song in Catalan. She doesn't speak the language and singing with proper pronunciation was intimidating, but she says the enthusiasm and support from her new found fans has been humbling. ""You know, we're not on a label. We do everything ourselves. So when we see this many people responding, it's like it's overwhelming,"" Osegueda said. The band, whose albums have been crowdfunded through various Kickstarter campaigns, will tour Catalonia for the first time in December, just days before regional elections on Dec. 21. They have shows planned in Barcelona, Tarragona and other Catalonian cities. For Osegueda, who has traveled to Catalonia a number of times, the upcoming visit feels different. ""I've always enjoyed going there on vacation. But now it's a lot deeper because there's so many people out there who saw our song as inspiration. So I feel like I definitely have a deeper connection now,"" she said.",Virginia heavy metal band strikes chord with Catalonia anthem,https://www.reuters.com/video/2017/11/09/virginia-heavy-metal-band-strikes-chord?videoId=372941926&videoChannel=118169&channelName=Editors%27+Picks

Russian number one Rublev, the highest-ranked qualifier for the tournament at 37th in the world, dominated his fellow 20-year-old with superior firepower to win 4-1 4-3(6) 4-1 in little over an hour at the Fiera Milano.

He then broke again to finish the job.

Coric was too passive in the first set but revived in the second after coach Christian Schneider told his player, through headphones, to “give me more energy”.

The Croatian got himself into a tiebreak but a poor forehand at 6-6 gave Rublev a second set point and he made no mistake.

One of the many innovations at the Next Gen Finals, the headphone exchanges between coach and player make for interesting listening for the crowd and TV audiences and Coric’s reaction to losing the second set was candid.

“I don’t know what to do any more,” he said, before crumbling to defeat.

Coric even became irate with one live Hawkeye call -- the system that has replaced human line judges at the event.

Rublev, who came into the tournament on the back of three straight defeats, said it was his best performance so far and hopes to reverse his crushing round-robin loss to Chung.

”We’ll see if I can change something,“ he told reporters. ”The first match here, I wasn’t playing that aggressive. I didn’t play that good. I was missing a lot.

“So I hope tomorrow I can show a better game.”","Rublev thrashes Coric, sets up Chung rematch in Next Gen final",https://www.reuters.com/article/tennis-nextgen/tennis-rublev-thrashes-coric-sets-up-chung-rematch-in-next-gen-final-idINKBN1DA2U5

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Secondo un analista, chiusa la porta, almeno per i prossimi mesi, a operazioni straordinarie, inclusa la separazione della rete, diversi investitori speculano al ribasso anche in vista dell‘ingresso di Iliad in Italia a inizio 2018.

La cessione di Tim Brasil è esclusa. “E’ un asset strategico, fa parte del nostro perimetro e può creare molto valore nei prossimi anni”, dice Genish durante la call con gli analisti sui risultati.

La separazione della rete, anche societaria, sembra piuttosto improbabile. “Stiamo trattando con il governo per realizzare l‘applicazione del Golden Power”, aggiunge Genish. “Ma nessuno ci ha chiesto la separazione”.

L‘AgCom, secondo alcune fonti, sta valutando se chiedere a Tim la separazione societaria.

Genish conferma le trattative con l‘autorità “per realizzare l‘equivalenza di accesso per tutti gli operatori”, ricordando però che la separazione societaria o l‘Ipo dell‘infrastruttura non sono mai stata realizzate in Europa.

E, in ogni caso, “anche nello scenario estremo, nessuno ha mai suggerito che il gruppo perdesse il controllo della rete”.

Apertura invece per attività di m&a sulla controllata delle torri Inwit, ma con tutti i limiti del caso. “Inwit è importante, ma non possiamo dire che sia strategica. Sta dando risultati molto soddisfacenti, ma il settore si sta evolvendo, si va verso il consolidamento. Siamo aperti a qualunque operazione sempre che sia conservata la nostra influenza strategica” sul gruppo.

Per quanto riguarda il mercato del mobile, rispondendo a una domanda sull‘arrivo di Iliad, Genish garantisce che non ci saranno scosse al ribasso sui prezzi e che l‘Arpu di Tim “continuerà a essere forte”.

Alle 16,50 Tim perde il 2,1% a 73 centesimi, dopo un ribasso fino all‘8% circa subito dopo i dati e un successivo recupero nel terreno positivo, con scambi per 222 milioni di pezzi da una media giornaliera di 94,1 milioni.

Tim tocca un livello intraday a 66,70 centesimi che non vedeva dal 21 novembre 2016.

TRIMESTRE IN LINEA, EBITDA DEBOLE PER STRAORDINARIE

Tim ha chiuso il trimestre con ricavi in linea con il consensus, Ebitda di poco inferiore e conferma le previsioni su 2017 e del piano industriale.

Una nota della società annuncia che, nel trimestre, il gruppo ha registrato ricavi a 4,907 da 4,843 miliardi dello stesso trimestre del 2016; Ebitda reported a 2,099 da 2,152 miliardi; debito netto finanziario adjusted a 26,228 miliardi.

L‘Ebitda organico è pari a circa 2,2 miliardi nel trimestre.

L‘Ebitda di 2,1 miliardi risente di 127 milioni di accantonamenti per ricorsi legali e procedure regolatorie e di esborsi legati a trattamenti di fine rapporto.

L‘Ebitda domestic reported è più debole delle previsioni e si attesta a 1,694 miliardi, in calo su anno del 6,5%, dopo il +11% del primo trimestre e il +1% del secondo.

Se si escludono le componenti straordinarie la variazione su anno è pari a -2,4%, nella definizione “like for like” si registra invece un aumento del 4,3%.

Il consenso pubblicato sul sito della società indica che gli analisti stimavano in media ricavi del trimestre a 4,909 miliardi, in rialzo dello 0,7% annuo; Ebitda reported a 2,206 miliardi, +2,5%; Ebitda domestic reported a 1,827 miliardi, +0,9%; debito netto adjusted a 26,184 miliardi.

Il gruppo conferma gli obiettivi sul 2017 e quelli del piano industriale per un aumento organico dell‘Ebitda “low single digit” e vede al 2018 un rapporto tra debito netto rettificato ed Ebitda reported sotto 2,7.

“These stories are true,” he said in a statement emailed to Reuters and other news outlets.

Five women detailed sexual misconduct allegations against the Emmy-winning comedian in a New York Times report published on Thursday, including three women who said he had masturbated in front of them. The allegations dated back 15 years.

C.K. released his statement after his upcoming film “I Love You Daddy” was scrapped for release on Friday, and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) canceled a planned special with the comedian because of the allegations.

Television network FX, a unit of 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O), also severed its ties with C.K.

“He will no longer serve as executive producer or receive compensation on any of the four shows we were producing with him – ‘Better Things,’ ‘Baskets,’ ‘One Mississippi’ and ‘The Cops’,” FX Networks and FX productions said on Friday in an emailed statement.

C.K. said in his statement that he has “been remorseful of my actions. And I’ve tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I’m aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves ” his statement added.

He is the latest celebrity in the entertainment business to be accused of sexual misconduct by people coming forward in the wake of allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein and actor Kevin Spacey.

C.K., 50, said he had “spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want. I will now step back and take a long time to listen.” He did not make clear how long he would be stepping back for.

The comedian, best known for his TV comedy series “Louie,” acknowledged he had misused used his power over the women, who were in the early stage of their careers at the time.

Two of the women in the New York Times article, comedians Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov, said C.K. had invited them to his hotel room after a comedy festival in Aspen, Colorado, in 2002 and then masturbated in front of them.

“The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly,” C.K. said, adding that he thought it was ok to show his genitals to women if he asked them first.

“You asked but we never said yes,” Goodman and Wolov tweeted on Friday after his apology.

Netflix said earlier that what it called C.K’s “unprofessional and inappropriate behavior with female colleagues” had led the streaming service to decide not to produce a planned second stand-up special with him.

Film distributor The Orchard said it would not be moving forward with the release next week of “I Love You, Daddy.” The movie was written and directed by C.K. and he also appears in the film as the father of a 17-year-old girl who has a romance with a 68-year-old filmmaker.

Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) HBO said on Thursday that C.K.’s past projects with the network, including 2006’s “Lucky Louie” series, would be removed from its on-demand services and that the comedian would no longer participate in its Nov. 18 televised “Night of Too Many Stars: America Unites for Autism Programs.”","Comedian Louis C.K. admits sexual misconduct, entertainment outlets cut ties",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1DA2DO-OCAEN

The future EU/UK land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is one of three issues -- along with the exit bill and safeguarding expatriate rights -- that Brussels wants broadly solved before it decides in December whether to give the green light to move on to talks on future trade relations.

“I think that there is a way to go between the two negotiating teams to be able to provide credible answers and sufficient progress in the context of the Irish border before we can move on to Phase Two,” Coveney told Irish state broadcaster RTE.

“While we welcome the language we get from the British government in the context of north-south challenges... there has always been a scepticism on how we are going to get there in the context of the British approach to Brexit as a whole.”

The Irish government has called on Britain to do more than simply promise a “hard” border will not return between it and Northern Ireland, which until a 1998 peace deal was separated by military checkpoints because of 30 years of sectarian violence in the British province.

The best way to achieve this is by maintaining the same regulations on both sides of the border, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Friday, adding that this did not amount to a demand that any part of the UK remain in the EU customs union.

That point was underlined in a working paper circulated to governments by the EU’s Brexit task force this week, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. It said it was essential the UK committed to ensuring no regulatory divergence emerges from the customs union if it wants to prevent a hard border.

While Britain restated its commitment on Friday to avoid erecting any physical infrastructure on the border, it also plans to quit the customs union and does not want to be bound by EU rules and regulations once it leaves.

Brexit minister David Davis said a deal on the border was only possible in the context of talks on future trade and that “cannot amount to creating a new border inside the UK”, a nod to the Northern Ireland unionists backing his government firmly opposed to the province staying in the customs union.

LOGIC OF BREXIT

Coveney said the working paper showed that the other 26 EU countries remained “absolutely in sync” with Ireland on the issue and EU diplomats said there had been no shift in position.

While some analysts saw it pushing for Northern Ireland to effectively remain in the customs union and single market in order to ensure regulations remained the same on both sides of the border, it can equally be read as suggesting the whole United Kingdom must not let its rules diverge far from the EU.

“This is simply confronting the British with the logic of Brexit and the avoidance of a hard border,” one senior EU diplomat said.

Either London ensures no regulatory divergence between north and south but allows divergence between Great Britain and Northern Ireland that would create an effective customs border in the Irish Sea, he added.

Or, to avoid a new internal UK border as Davis said, the UK as a whole must continue to follow EU market rules and standards closely – something that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier called for on Thursday.

“They need to clarify this to have sufficient progress,” one Irish official said.

Asked whether Ireland might veto a move onto trade talks, Coveney said he did not think it was helpful “at this stage” to talk about individual countries blocking things.",Ireland sees 'a way to go' before agreement on border in Brexit talks,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-ireland/ireland-says-still-a-way-to-go-before-agreement-on-irish-issues-in-brexit-talks-idUKKBN1DA10J

With a host of established players missing, England’s callow defence was routinely sliced open in the first period and they needed debutant goalkeeper Jordan Pickford to keep the Germans at bay.

But England also had some bright moments, with midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek making an assured debut and having great chances at the start and end of the match.

England manager Gareth Southgate, shorn of more than half his likely first-choice side, will be pleased with much that he saw, despite the result leaving England still searching for their first home win over their old rivals since 1975.

Germany were also in somewhat experimental mode and their coach Joachim Loew will have been delighted in particular with an impressive display by Leroy Sane as his team stretched their unbeaten run to 20 games since losing to France in the Euro 2016 semi-finals.

England’s young starting team boasted 101 caps between them and one of the debutants, Tammy Abraham, was a centimetre away from scoring with his first touch in international football after 90 seconds.

Germany too were without some heavyweight players and gave a debut to defender Marcel Halstenberg and had goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen making his second appearance.

GERMANY DOMINATE

They soon took control as Sane clipped a 20-metre curler against the bar after 20 minutes, Pickford saved well from Timo Werner and Phil Jones headed Sane’s follow-up off the line.

Jones, the team’s most experienced player, then limped off and another debutant, Liverpool’s 20-year-old Joe Gomez, took his place to trim England’s cap count to less than Germany midfielder Mesut Ozil’s personal tally of 86.

The lack of experience and familiarity was exposed again soon afterwards when Pickford went full length to again deny Werner as Sane was seemingly given the freedom of Wembley.

Ter Stegen made an excellent reflex save to get low and palm clear striker Jamie Vardy’s header early in the second half but the steam then gradually left the game.

Midfielder Jack Cork came on as a late substitute to make it five England debuts on the night and another replacement, Jesse Lingard, should really have won it with the last kick of the match but his close-range shot flew over the bar.

England captain Eric Dier said: “I think we did well. Obviously against a well-oiled machine they will have periods in the game where they control possession but I didn’t think they hurt us. And we had our periods, broke well at times and are actually disappointed we haven’t scored.”

After negotiations in Brussels, the first in a month, Brexit Secretary David Davis said during a news conference with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier it was time for “political discussions” to break a deadlock that has left both sides frustrated about a lack of progress.

“Political” talks has in the past been code for Prime Minister Theresa May addressing fellow EU leaders directly, over the heads of Barnier and the EU executive, in order to square a circle in which Brussels will not address the future without a firm line from London on settling what the EU sees as past debts and May will not settle without assurances about future trade.

May is due at a Brussels summit on Dec. 14-15 but EU officials insist that any breakthrough must be agreed at lower level first and weeks in advance to let the other 27 members agree a joint position. Progress in December is important for May as businesses seek clarity by the new year, when many will take investment decisions dependent on conditions after Brexit.

A British budget due on Nov. 22 will, however, complicate the task for May in persuading hardline Brexit supporters of any need to meet Brussels’ demand for tens of billions of euros to cover liabilities incurred in 44 years of EU membership.

Barnier stressed that he was not looking for a number from London but for a clearer undertaking than May gave in September on how far Britain would “honor its obligations”.

“It is absolutely vital if we are to achieve sufficient progress in December,” Barnier told reporters, adding not all details had to be settled but there needed to be “sincere and real progress”.

The clarifications should come within the next two weeks, Barnier said: “If that’s not the case, then we will continue and that will pull back the opening of discussions on the future.”

“POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS”

He said progress had to be made on all three key issues of the divorce talks - the money, the rights of EU citizens in Britain and how to avoid a “hard border” with EU-member Ireland.

Davis said both sides made substantial technical progress on all the issues that need to be addressed. “This is now about moving into the political discussions that would enable both of us to move forward,” he said.

British discussions with other national governments do not appear to have breached the unity of the 27 for now. And German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, the bloc’s most powerful leaders, have taken a particularly tough line on the money issue in Brussels.

The EU executive has said Britain will owe it around 60 billion euros when it leaves. London has challenged the legal reasoning behind that but has not offered its own figure.

One thing that was clarified on Friday was exactly when Britain would leave the Union. The EU had previously defined “Brexit hour” as “midnight” on March 29, 2019, exactly two years after May triggered the process. But it was unclear whether that meant midnight in Brussels or London.

May and Barnier made statements on Friday stating that Brexit will happen in London at 11 p.m. (2300 GMT) on Friday, March 29. That will be midnight in the EU capital.

Davis repeated the declaration made by May in September in Florence that EU countries will not need to pay more or receive less for the remainder of the current EU long-term budget ending in December 2020: “The UK will honor the commitments we made during the period of our membership,” he said.

Barnier said both sides moved ahead on citizens’ rights and that Britain gave “useful” clarifications on a process through which EU citizens could obtain a “settled status” but the EU needed reassurances on how such a system would work.

He said issues related to family reunification, the right to export social security benefits and the role of the European Court of Justice still need work.

On the problems of avoiding a “hard border” between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland, Davis and Barnier said more work must be done.","EU wants Brexit money this month, Davis seeks 'political' fix",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-barnier/eu-wants-brexit-money-this-month-davis-seeks-political-fix-idUSKBN1DA1IW?il=0

U.S. energy companies added nine oil drilling rigs this week, the second increase in three weeks, bringing the total count up to 738, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report. [RIG/U]

Brent futures fell 41 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $63.52 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled down 43 cents at $56.74 per barrel.

Earlier in the week, Brent rose to $64.65, its highest since June 2015, and WTI hit $57.92, its highest since July 2015.

Both contracts were rose more than 2 percent this week, which was the fifth consecutive increase.

Traders said higher prices in recent weeks were the result of efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to tighten the market by cutting output, as well as strong demand and rising political tensions.

There are also expectations in the market that OPEC’s next meeting on Nov. 30 will agree to extend cuts beyond the current expiry date in March 2018.

“Market participants expect OPEC to extend the production cuts beyond March 2018 and stocks to decline further,” analysts at Commerzbank said, noting, however, that “the higher price level should lead to a further rise in U.S. shale oil production.”

U.S. production was forecast to rise to 9.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 and a record 10.0 million bpd in 2018 from 8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to federal energy projections this week. Output peaked at 9.6 million bpd in 1970. [EIA/M]

Goldman Sachs also warned of greater price volatility ahead, citing rising tensions in the Middle East, especially between OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iran, along with soaring U.S. oil production.

Hezbollah’s leader said Saudi Arabia had declared war on Lebanon and his Iran-backed group, accusing Riyadh of detaining Saad al-Hariri and forcing him to resign as Lebanon’s prime minister to destabilize the country.

“The political situation in Saudi Arabia remains sufficiently volatile to spike crude values by at least 50 cents at any given time as was the case (Thursday),” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Chicago-based energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a report, noting he did not expect Friday’s oil rig count to exert much price impact.

Another factor supporting prices was strong demand in southeast Asia, where the number of tankers holding oil in storage around Singapore and Malaysia has halved since June.

Mowery cited Moore’s overwhelming popularity with Alabama’s Republican voters, who he said would tend to distrust allegations published in the Post.
On his Senate campaign website, Moore said he was suspended “for upholding the sanctity of marriage as between one man and one woman.”","(Reuters) - A woman has accused Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama, of initiating a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 years old and he was 32, the Washington Post reported on Thursday, prompting top Republicans to say he should step aside if the allegations prove true.

Moore, 70, the state’s former chief judge, vehemently denied the allegations, calling them “completely false and a desperate political attack.”

U.S. President Donald Trump would want Moore to step aside if the allegations against him are true, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Friday.

“Like most Americans, the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a person’s life,” Sanders said.

“However, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside,” she said, as Trump arrived in Vietnam on his 12-day Asia tour.

In a series of Twitter posts later in the day, Moore cast the published allegations against him part of a bid to “silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me,” adding “I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!”

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, working with a slim 52-48 majority, called on Moore to drop out of the race “if these allegations are true.” Several other Republicans, including Texas Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, and Utah Senator Mike Lee, all of whom endorsed Moore, echoed that sentiment.

At least two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and John Thune of South Dakota, said Moore should step aside immediately, with McCain calling the accusations “deeply disturbing and disqualifying.”

Leigh Corfman, now 53, told the Post she met Moore at a courthouse in 1979 when Moore offered to keep her company on a bench outside of a hearing room while her mother was inside for child custody proceeding.

Moore, at the time an assistant district attorney, asked for the girl’s phone number and days later took her to his house, where they engaged in sexual activity before she asked to be taken home, Corfman said.

The story also quoted three other women who said Moore dated them when they were between 16 and 18 years of age and he was in his early 30s, though none said they had sexual contact with Moore.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm the allegations.

The Moore campaign accused the Post of colluding with Democrats to tarnish his reputation with false accusations.

The Post said none of the women had donated to or worked for Moore’s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, or for his Republican primary rivals, and that Corfman said she had voted for Republicans in the past three presidential elections, including for Donald Trump in 2016.

POPULAR WITH ALABAMA REPUBLICANS

Moore has consistently led in polls over Jones. He was considered a heavy favorite in deeply Republican Alabama in the Dec. 12 special election to fill the seat of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

It remains to be see whether Thursday’s allegations can buoy Jones’ long-shot bid, which would represent a major upset for Democrats and narrow Republicans’ current edge in the Senate.

Jones’ campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Post story.

No matter what happens, Moore will remain on the ballot on Dec. 12 since a candidate’s name cannot be removed within 76 days of the election, according to the office of Alabama’s secretary of state.

If, however, the state party tells election officials that it wants to withdraw its nominee, or if Moore himself decided to do so, election officials would not certify any votes cast for Moore. Write-in candidates are also allowed under state law.

Alabama political strategist David Mowery, who has worked for candidates of both parties, said the chance of Moore bowing out of the race was “less than zero,” and that it was almost as improbable for state party officials to abandon him in favor of a last-minute write-in candidate.

Mowery cited Moore’s overwhelming popularity with Alabama’s Republican voters, who he said would tend to distrust allegations published in the Post. Nevertheless, he said Democrats would seize on the scandal to boost fund-raising.

Moore, who has made his moral and religious beliefs the heart of his pitch to voters, prevailed over several Republican opponents in a closely contested primary that saw Trump, McConnell and most Senate Republicans support the incumbent who had been appointed to Sessions’ seat, Luther Strange.

The race exposed rifts between the Republican Party’s conservative base and its Washington-based establishment. Moore’s candidacy was heavily promoted by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, who has vowed to support grassroots challengers next year to take on Republican incumbents.

On several occasions, Moore has made controversial statements and taken positions that have cost him his job. He has condemned homosexuality and said he believes some U.S. communities are living under Islamic religious law.

He first became a national figure in the early 2000s, when he lost his position as Alabama chief justice after refusing a court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from outside the courthouse.

After winning his position back in 2012, he was again forced out after defying the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage by ordering probate judges not to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

On his Senate campaign website, Moore said he was suspended “for upholding the sanctity of marriage as between one man and one woman.”",Republican Senate candidate Moore hit by sexual misconduct allegations,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-moore/republican-senate-candidate-moore-hit-by-sexual-misconduct-allegations-idUSKBN1D9320?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

“Doing business in Cuba is a very long-term proposition,” said Nelson, who has visited eight times in two years.","HAVANA (Reuters) - Packed into a remote corner of a pavilion, just 13 U.S. companies took stands at Cuba’s sprawling trade fair this year, in a sign of how firms’ interest in doing business on the island has dwindled in the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency.

Last year, amid enthusiasm following a detente in relations agreed between former President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro in 2014, 33 U.S. companies took stands at the fair, the premier event on Cuba’s business calendar.

The mood was very different at this year’s edition, which took place last week in Havana. While China brought a record company delegation, and more than 150 Spanish businesses packed into five pavilions, the handful of U.S. businessmen were downbeat.

“I’ve never seen it this deserted,” said Jay Brickman, vice president of Florida-based shipping company Crowley Maritime Corp, who has been attending the fair for 15 years. “People have really gotten discouraged, and feel they maybe should be investing their time someplace else.”

U.S. companies embraced Cuba in the wake of the detente, jostling for a foothold in an opening market of 11 million consumers.

Thanks to travel-related exemptions to the embargo, U.S. airlines restored regular flights. Starwood Hotels, a subsidiary of Marriott International Inc (MAR.O), took over management of a Cuban hotel and cruise operators like Florida-based Carnival Cruise Line (CCL.N) included Cuba in their itineraries.

But worsening U.S. relations as well as growing awareness of the difficulty of doing business in Cuba put a dampener on that.

Trump in June ordered tighter trade and travel restrictions including a ban on business with the military, which controls vast swathes of the economy. The regulations were unveiled on Wednesday.

“This is a huge step backwards,” said former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez, the Cuban-born head of the U.S.-Cuba Business Council. “We had made so much progress.”

An unfolding diplomatic crisis over allegations of attacks on U.S. diplomats in Havana is adding to the gloom.

Cuba Trade magazine, based in Miami, last month cut its issuance from monthly to bi-monthly, citing the deteriorating business environment under Trump. Several Cuba business conferences in the United States have also been canceled since June, including an agriculture conference in Chicago.

Following the Obama detente, U.S. farmers hoped for legislation allowing them to access credit for exports to Cuba. But Trump has made it clear he is not about to ease, let alone lift, the embargo.

“We need to get the diplomatic issue off the table first,” said Louisiana Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain, adding U.S. food exports to Cuba could total $1 billion if relations were normalized.

HARDER

Even before Trump took office, some of the interest fizzled as companies realized doing business in Cuba was hard with its red tape, shortage of hard currency, poor telecommunications and labor restrictions.

Online payments company PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) sent its chief executive in Obama’s delegation on his historic visit to Cuba in March 2016. It had been interested in making its Xoom money transfer service available in Cuba but said operational challenges were too great.

“When we are able to deliver the speed, convenience and security our customers have come to expect from Xoom, we will launch in Cuba,” a PayPal spokeswoman told Reuters.

Still, some companies made headway. After receiving all the necessary licenses under Obama, the Puerto Rican dealer for U.S. heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) last week agreed to open a distribution center in Cuba’s Mariel special development zone.

Future deals with Mariel, which boasts tax and customs breaks, will not be possible, as it features on a list published Wednesday of 180 government entities that Americans are now banned from doing business with.

“The Mariel restriction particularly sticks out because it is the most dynamic and exciting opportunity in Cuba,” said James Williams, president of lobby group Engage Cuba.

The diplomatic crisis has also complicated the logistics for U.S. businesses. The Trump administration in September expelled 15 Cuban diplomats, including all those dealing with U.S. businesses.

The following week, the chair of the port of Cleveland, Darrell McNair, traveled to Havana to sign an agreement with Cuba’s port authority. He said the now-disbanded embassy commercial team had been instrumental in arranging his visit.

“Cutbacks obviously are going to slow things down,” he said.

LONG-TERM PLAY

The tougher environment under Trump has separated the wheat from the chaff, some business consultants say.

“The serious players who understand the risks are staying the course,” said Pedro Freyre, who heads the international practice at Miami-based law firm Akerman LLP.

Jeff Nelson said his firm Strategic Staffing Solutions, which provides companies with IT and other services, was prepared to put in the time laying the groundwork for business with Cuba given the potential of its educated workforce.

“Doing business in Cuba is a very long-term proposition,” said Nelson, who has visited eight times in two years.

Some companies were pursuing deals behind closed doors so as to not lose capital with the Trump administration, consultants said. Many Obama-era exemptions to the embargo remain in place.

The publication of the new regulations at least provided clarity about what was allowed.

“Companies know where they stand now and there are definitely opportunities still,” said Gutierrez. “Every day that goes by is just the missed opportunity where someone else is building a brand, someone else is building awareness among Cubans.”",Blooming U.S. business interest in Cuba wilts under Trump,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-usa-trade/blooming-u-s-business-interest-in-cuba-wilts-under-trump-idUSKBN1DA1VJ

Zhao and her husband Huang Youlong, through a company they controlled - Tibet Longwei Culture Media Co - made a failed attempt to buy 29.1 percent of Zhejiang Wanjia Co in late 2016. Zhejiang Wanjia was later taken over by another investor and renamed Zhejiang Sunriver Culture Co.

But Tibet Longwei’s bid drew scrutiny of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) regarding information disclosure and takeover-financing ability.

The regulator stated that the bid made misleading statements and major omissions in disclosures, according to a filing by Zhejiang Sunriver to the Shanghai stock exchange.

The bidder’s actions “severely impacted market order, hurt medium and small investors’ confidence in the market, and undermined fairness, justice and openness of the market,” the regulator said, according to the filing.

Zhao, Huang and Tibet Longwei could not be contacted for comment by phone. CSRC also could not be reached immediately for comment. Zhejiang Sunriver said in an emailed statement to Reuters it will “disclose information in a timely manner in accordance with law for any follow-up”.

The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation across the Group of 20 Economies (G20),

is expected to announce in coming weeks a switch in focus from insurers’ size to their activities when deciding whether to subject them to increased regulatory scrutiny, said the source, who requested anonymity because the matter has not been made public.

Companies singled out for such scrutiny are required to hold extra capital to cover potential losses, increasing overall business costs and potentially reducing shareholder returns.

The insurance industry has been lobbying for years for regulators to move to the activities-based approach, arguing that their huge size should not automatically qualify them as systemically risky and on the hook for onerous bank-like capital rules.

The shift in the FSB’s approach to designating globally systemically important insurers, or GSIIs, follows pressure from the U.S. Treasury Department, which has been pushing the FSB to ease up on insurers and asset managers, the source said.

A spokesman for the FSB declined to comment.

The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged to overhaul regulations introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and put U.S. interests first when engaging in international bodies such as the FSB and the Basel Committee of banking supervisors.

In September, a group of U.S. regulators - known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council - removed AIG from its domestic list of systemically important insurers, raising questions over whether the FSB would keep AIG on its global list and continue to add new firms.

In a policy report published last month, the U.S. Treasury rejected the idea of singling out specific asset management and insurance firms as systemically risky and criticized the FSB for mission-creep and a lack of transparency.

The U.S. Treasury is shortly due to release a policy report on the FSOC designation process and powers, which critics including regulatory experts and insurers have said are too opaque and unaccountable.

AIG BAILOUT

AIG helped spark the global financial crisis, and the labeling of major financial institutions as systemically important stems largely from its $182 billion U.S. government-led rescue in September 2008. The bailout came just before the company would have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection amid mounting losses on its derivatives book.

Worried the insurance giant was “too big to fail,” the government stepped in to prevent further chaos to the financial system. The company ultimately repaid taxpayers in full by the end of 2012, with a profit of $22.7 billion, according to AIG.

Since then, regulators have primarily focused on the size of a company’s overall assets when assessing the risk they pose to the global financial system.

Moving to an activities-based approach could see firms on the list that largely engage in traditional insurance activities removed, but other non-designated insurers that use their cash to invest in risky assets, or which deploy high levels of leverage, added.

The suspension of the 2017 review means the 2016 list of nine GSIIs - which also includes MetLife Inc (MET.N), Allianz SE (ALVG.DE) and Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (601318.SS) - will continue to stand for at least the next 12 months until the FSB has completed an assessment based on the new methodology, the source said.",Exclusive: Global regulators to ditch 'too big to fail' gauge for insurers - source,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-financial-insurers-exclusive/exclusive-global-regulators-to-ditch-too-big-to-fail-gauge-for-insurers-source-idUSKBN1DA2J7?il=0

A decisão de Aécio agravou ainda mais a cizânia entre os tucanos, com aliados de Tasso, que lançou-se candidato ao comando da sigla nesta semana, criticando o senador mineiro, abatido por acusações de irregularidades no âmbito da delação premiada de executivos da J&F, holding que controla a JBS.

O ex-governador Alberto Goldman foi indicado por Aécio para comandar o PSDB interinamente até a convenção nacional do partido, marcada para 9 de dezembro, quando Tasso deverá disputar o comando partidário com o governador de Goiás, Marconi Perillo.

“Acredito que o restabelecimento da coesão, com tolerância à variabilidade das opiniões internas, mas também com firmeza de propósitos, requer que o presidente designado do PSDB, Alberto Goldman, crie condições para que líderes experientes e respeitados, como o governador de São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, assumam posição central no partido”, escreveu Fernando Henrique, em uma rede social.

“Se porventura tal convergência não se concretizar, o que porá em risco as chances do PSDB, já disse que apoiarei a candidatura do senador Tasso Jereissati à presidência do partido. Com isso, não faço ressalvas ao direito do governador de Goiás, Marconi Perillo, a quem respeito por sua fidelidade ao PSDB e pelo bom governo que faz”, disse FHC. “A vitória de um ou de outro não corresponde à vitória do bem contra o mal: precisamos permanecer juntos.”

Na mensagem, Fernando Henrique diz ainda fazer um “apelo ao bom senso e às responsabilidades nacionais dos líderes do partido para que busquem restabelecer a unidade”, diante do que chamou de “acirramento” causado pela destituição de Tasso da presidência interina do PSDB.

Para o ex-presidente, a coesão interna entre os tucanos é “requisito para enfrentarmos a próxima campanha eleitoral propondo as transformações pelas quais o país clama”.

Fernando Henrique também defendeu o apoio do PSDB às reformas que tramitam no Congresso Nacional, afirmando que elas fazem “parte do que acreditamos e do que pregamos”. Defendeu, ainda, mudanças estatutárias para criar “canais mais amplos para participação dos filiados na escolha dos candidatos”.

Alckmin tem sido apontado como nome mais provável do PSDB para disputar a Presidência da República na eleição do ano que vem e já disse publicamente ter a intenção de novamente concorrer ao Planalto, depois de perder para o ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva em 2006.

O prefeito de Manaus, Arthur Virgílio, também já manifestou vontade de disputar a candidatura tucana e o prefeito de São Paulo, João Doria, embora não tenha admitido publicamente a vontade de concorrer, tem se movimentado nacionalmente com uma série de viagens pelo país e pelo exterior.

A disputa entre os tucanos têm como principal fator divergências internas em torno do apoio da sigla ao governo do presidente Michel Temer, em que o PSDB tem quatro ministros --Antonio Imbassahy (Secretaria de Governo), Bruno Araújo (Cidades), Aloysio Nunes (Relações Exteriores) e Luislinda Valois (Direitos Humanos).

France became the first Western country to indicate that Saudi Arabia was holding Hariri against his will, saying it wished for him to have “all his freedom of movement and be fully able to play the essential role that is his in Lebanon”.

Hariri’s resignation has plunged Lebanon into crisis, thrusting the small Arab country back to the forefront of regional rivalry between the Sunni Muslim monarchy Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite revolutionary Iran.

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, said Saudi Arabia’s detention of Hariri, a long-time Saudi ally who declared his resignation while in Riyadh last Saturday, was an insult to all Lebanese and he must return to Lebanon.

“Let us say things as they are: the man is detained in Saudi Arabia and forbidden until this moment from returning to Lebanon,” Nasrallah said in a televised speech.

“It is clear that Saudi Arabia and Saudi officials have declared war on Lebanon and on Hezbollah in Lebanon,” he said.

His comments mirror an accusation by Riyadh on Monday that Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war on the conservative Gulf Arab kingdom.

Riyadh says Hariri is a free man and he decided to resign because Hezbollah was calling the shots in his government. Saudi Arabia considers Hezbollah to be its enemy in conflicts across the Middle East, including Syria and Yemen.

Western countries have looked on with alarm at the rising regional tension.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned other countries and groups against using Lebanon as vehicle for a larger proxy fight in the Middle East, saying Washington strongly backed Lebanon’s independence and respected Hariri as a strong partner of the United States, still referring to him as prime minister.

“There is no legitimate place or role in Lebanon for any foreign forces, militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the Lebanese state,” Tillerson said in a statement released by the U.S. State Department.

Tillerson told reporters on Friday there was no indication that Hariri was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will but that the United States was monitoring the situation.

The French foreign minister said earlier on Friday that he also believed Hariri was a free man - a statement at odds with the later French foreign ministry comment that it wanted Hariri to have “all his freedom of movement”.

Hariri has made no public remarks since announcing his resignation in a speech televised from Saudi Arabia, saying he feared assassination and accusing Iran and Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world.

Two top Lebanese government officials, a senior politician close to Hariri and a fourth source told Reuters on Thursday that the Lebanese authorities believe Hariri is being held in Saudi Arabia.

Nasrallah said Saudi Arabia was encouraging Israel to attack Lebanon. While an Israeli attack could not be ruled out entirely, he said, it was unlikely partly because Israel knew it would pay a very high price. “I warn them against any miscalculation or any step to exploit the situation,” he said.

“Saudi will fail in Lebanon as it has failed on all fronts,” Nasrallah said.

Riyadh has advised Saudi citizens not to travel to Lebanon, or if already there to leave as soon as possible. Other Gulf states have also issued travel warnings. Those steps have raised concern that Riyadh could take measures against the tiny Arab state, which hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees.

Hariri’s resignation is being widely seen as part of a Saudi attempt to counter Iran as its influence deepens in Syria and Iraq and as Riyadh and its allies battle Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Hariri’s resignation unraveled a political deal among rival factions that made him prime minister and President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, head of state last year.

The coalition government included Hezbollah, a heavily armed military and political organization.

STUCK BETWEEN “ANTAGONISTIC INTERESTS”

Aoun told Saudi Arabia’s envoy on Friday that Hariri must return to Lebanon and the circumstances surrounding his resignation as prime minister while in Saudi Arabia were unacceptable, presidential sources said.

An “international support group” of countries concerned about Lebanon, which includes the United States, Russia and France, appealed for Lebanon “to continue to be shielded from tensions in the region”. In a statement, they also welcomed Aoun’s call for Hariri to return.

In comments to Reuters, top Lebanese Druze politician Jumblatt said Lebanon did not deserve to be accused of declaring war on Saudi Arabia. “For decades we’ve been friends,” he said.

“We are a country that is squeezed between two antagonistic interests, between Saudi Arabia and Iran,” he said. “The majority of Lebanese are just paying the price ... Lebanon can not afford to declare a war against anybody.”

The Saudi foreign minister accused Hezbollah of a role in the launching of a ballistic missile at Riyadh from Yemen on Saturday. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen was an act of “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

Nasrallah mocked the Saudi accusation that Iran and Hezbollah were behind the firing of the missile from Yemen, saying Yemenis were capable of building their own missiles.",Hezbollah says Saudi declares Lebanon war with Hariri detention,https://www.reuters.com/article/lebanon-politics-hezbollah/hezbollah-says-saudi-declares-lebanon-war-with-hariri-detention-idINKBN1DA1YI

And the scrutiny of offshore funds has already begun - banks in the United Arab Emirates are being asked to give up details about Saudi citizens detained in the investigation. The UAE, and Dubai in particular, are popular destinations for Saudi money. Commercial bankers told Reuters that UAE regulators had asked for details on the accounts of 19 Saudis. Almost all of those 19 - including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal - have been detained in the inquiry. Commercial bankers said UAE authorities had not explained why they wanted the information, but believed it was at the behest of the Saudi government. Central bank officials in the UAE were not available to comment. The move is seen as a possible precursor to those accounts being frozen, and huge amounts of money could be at stake.

The U.S.-listed, $19 billion iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF rose 0.22 percent at $87.11, while the $13.1 billion SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF, gained 0.47 percent at $36.68.

Both funds shed about 1.0 percent on the week, for their steepest drop in three months.

Investors pulled $621.9 million from U.S. junk portfolios in the latest reporting week, following outflows of $1.2 billion the previous week, according to Lipper data.

Bank of America Corp analysts said in a note on Friday that volatility in high-yield has been “driven primarily by a confluence of several meaningful and yet only loosely related events,” including the collapse of the Sprint Corp and T-Mobile U.S. Inc merger, the U.S. Justice Department’s challenges to the AT&T Inc and Time Warner Inc merger, a credit downgrade for Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and other industry-specific news along with the potential for tax reform to be delayed.

“The impact on related (high yield) names has been significant enough to cause a market-wide reaction,” they wrote.

“Only a dozen names in the index have been responsible for half of HY index widening so far this week.”

The analysts also said the flatness of the yield curve has been hurting high yield, partly by hurting bank stocks, which benefit from a steeper yield curve that allows them to borrow cheaply, lend at higher rates and profit from the difference.

The junk bond ETF sell-off was “meaningful,” the Bank of America analysts said, “but not extreme moves by the standards of this asset class.” “Overall, we find a modest correction to be both natural and welcome in the context of the relentless tightening in (high yield) spreads we have seen so far this year, and over the past two months in particular.”",U.S. junk bond sector ends rough week on calmer note,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-investment-bonds-highyield-etf/u-s-junk-bond-sector-ends-rough-week-on-calmer-note-idUSKBN1D92UH?il=0

Le mouvement de correction sur les taux longs se poursuit parallèlement après leur récent repli lié notamment aux annonces fin octobre de la Banque centrale européenne (BCE).

À Paris, le CAC 40 a perdu 0,50% (10,66 points) à 5.380,72 points. A Francfort, le Dax a cédé 0,42% et à Londres, le FTSE a abandonné 0,68%.

Paris et Francfort avaient cédé jeudi plus de 1%, un recul lié à la fois à des interrogations sur l‘évolution de la politique monétaire de la BCE, qui ont favorisé la remontée des rendements obligataires, et aux doutes sur la réforme fiscale américaine.

PRISES DE BÉNÉFICES

Un brusque repli du Nikkei, qui a brutalement décroché jeudi en séance, a également contribué au repli des indices en Europe comme aux Etats-Unis. L‘indice japonais a de nouveau fléchi vendredi, de 0,82%.

“Les actions en Europe sont légèrement dans le rouge avec des traders toujours nerveux après le recul d‘hier (jeudi)”, explique David Madden (CMC Markets).

“La baisse rapide d‘hier a amené les traders à penser au chemin parcouru par les marchés depuis quelques mois, ce qui a conduit à des prises de bénéfices”, ajoute-t-il.

Sur le marché obligataire, la tendance reste au rebond des rendements des emprunts d‘Etat. Celui du dix ans allemand s‘est ainsi rapproché du seuil de 0,4% avant de s‘apaiser.

“Du côté des taux longs, le repli dans le sillage du dernier Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE pouvait légitiment paraître excessif. La correction était attendue”, relèvent les gérants de LBPAM.

Le marché obligataire européen réagit aussi à la remontée des anticipations d‘inflation en zone euro, pointe pour sa part Alexandre Baradez, analyste marchés chez IG.

Les swaps d‘inflation à cinq ans dans cinq ans, une mesure des anticipations de hausse de prix à moyen terme, sont remontés à 1,68%, un plus haut depuis mars.

ALTICE SOUFFRE ENCORE

Aux valeurs en Europe, Spie a terminé en tête du Stoxx 600 avec un gain de 5,82% après des résultats salués par les investisseurs.

ArcelorMittal a pris 3,37%, la plus forte hausse du CAC 40, après des trimestriels conformes aux attentes et la confiance affichée par le sidérurgiste pour 2018.

La lanterne rouge de l‘indice parisien est pour PSA, qui perdu 3,91% après un abaissement de recommandation de Kepler Cheuvreux sur le constructeur et sa filiale d‘équipements Faurecia (-0,79%).

Ailleurs en Europe, la chute la plus spectaculaire du Stoxx 600 est pour le groupe italien d‘aéronautique et de défense Leonardo, qui a chuté de 21,55%, sa plus forte baisse sur une séance depuis 20 ans, après avoir réduit ses prévisions pour prendre en compte les difficultés de son activité d‘hélicoptères.

A la baisse également, Altice, maison-mère de l‘opérateur télécoms SFR, a perdu 3,38% au lendemain de l‘annonce de la démission du directeur général Michel Combes et du retour aux commandes du fondateur Patrick Drahi, une réorganisation pourtant destinée à apaiser les inquiétudes des investisseurs après la chute récente du cours de Bourse.

A l‘heure de la clôture en Europe, Wall Street recule légèrement sur fond de craintes d‘un report à 2019 de l‘allègement de la fiscalité sur les entreprises promis aux marchés par Donald Trump.

Les doutes des marchés sur la capacité du président américain à faire passer une réforme très attendue pénalisent le dollar, qui se stabilise face à un panier de devises de référence mais ne s‘en dirige pas moins vers sa plus forte baisse hebdomadaire en quatre semaines.

Sur le marché pétrolier, les cours du brut s‘équilibrent autour de 64 dollars le baril pour le Brent et de 57 dollars pour le brut léger américain (West Texas Intermediate, WTI).

L‘or, lui, cède du terrain et revient sous les 1.280 dollars l‘once après avoir touché jeudi un pic de trois semaines dans un climat général favorable à son statut de valeur refuge.","La semaine finit dans le rouge, l'aversion au risque se confirme",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idFRKBN1DA2G5-OFRBS

First, he committed to addressing the shortcomings of the Iran nuclear deal, without terminating it. Second, he called for a comprehensive strategy to counter Iranian aggression throughout the Middle East. More sanctions, however, will not be enough to accomplish either of these goals.

Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, at a news conference in Tehran, May 22, 2017. TIMA via REUTERS

The president’s twin objectives of fixing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the nuclear deal is known, and confronting Iran’s destabilizing regional behavior are closely connected. Barack Obama overlooked Tehran’s military expansion into Iraq and Syria, among other actions, for the purpose of winning Iranian cooperation on the nuclear issue. The result was not just a disastrous deal, but a diminished U.S. ability to accomplish any of its strategic objectives in the region.

To defend our vital interests in the Middle East and potentially improve a deeply flawed nuclear deal, the United States must first rebuild leverage by countering Tehran’s growing aggression and influence in the region. That cannot be accomplished overnight. Nor can it be done solely through the use of sanctions or the threat of withdrawal from the agreement.

Along with more sanctions, and before trying to fix or abandon the deal, policymakers must develop a comprehensive strategy, utilizing every element of American power, to rebuild and apply counter-pressure against the full spectrum of Iran’s destabilizing behaviors.The Gemunder Center Iran Task Force at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), which we co-chair, recently detailed such a strategy, consisting of two elements.

U.S. President Donald Trump discusses the Iran nuclear deal in the White House, October 13, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque

First, restore credible U.S. military leverage against Iran. American officials should prepare – and make clear they are preparing – contingency plans to defend the United States and its allies from Iranian nuclear-capable missiles. The United States should be prepared to shoot down Iranian nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, including test launches, and respond forcefully to any Iranian harassment of U.S. naval vessels. To this end, it should deploy the Aegis missile defense system to the Persian Gulf (like we already do in Europe and East Asia).

It is also critical that the United States has a post-Islamic State strategy for Syria, including more assistance to our allies on the ground in holding territory hard-won from IS. This is necessary to prevent Iran, Hezbollah and their proxies from dictating that country’s future and consolidating a land bridge from Iran to Lebanon.

Second, Washington must take the lead in assembling a coherent regional coalition against Iran. This will require more concerted cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to develop robust missile defenses against Iran’s region-wide proliferation of advanced missiles.

The Trump administration and Congress must also augment the recent Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on defense aid to Israel by removing Obama-era caps on missile defense assistance. The MoU must be treated as the floor, not the ceiling, for bilateral cooperation against Iran’s and Hezbollah’s growing presence and capabilities on Israel’s northern borders. Similarly, we must ensure U.S. and Gulf air and maritime defenses can operate in close coordination as Iran’s military capabilities expand under the nuclear deal.

Trump is absolutely right to call the JCPOA “unacceptable” in its current form. By allowing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic missile program, and conventional arms purchases to expire over the next 15 years, the JCPOA actively grants Iran the right to become a de facto ICBM-armed, militarily modernized nuclear power.

We applaud the cooperation of the president and Congress to increase sanctions on Iran. But more needs to be done.",Commentary: How Trump can prevent a nuclear Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afterislamicstate-edelman-commentary/commentary-how-trump-can-prevent-a-nuclear-iran-idUSKBN1D01ZY

U.S. Senate Republicans released a tax plan on Thursday that differed from a version put forth by the House of Representatives on several key fronts, including putting off corporate tax cuts for a year.

Expectations of lower taxes, one of President Donald Trump’s key campaign promises, have helped drive the S&P 500 up 20 percent since the 2016 presidential election.

Failure to cut corporate taxes would increase concerns about Trump’s ability to pass legislation and could shake markets that have been banking on lower tax rates to boost company earnings.

The S&P 500 on Friday stood at 18.1 times expected earnings, the highest since 2004, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.

Arrow Funds Director of Research John Serrapere put the chances of successfully passing meaningful tax cuts at 50 percent, and he warned that failing could trigger a correction of as much as 15 percent in stocks.

“There’s not a lot of confidence. I‘m not pessimistic, but there are a lot of pieces that need to be put together,” Serrapere said.

The Dow .DJI fell 0.17 percent to end at 23,422.21, while the S&P 500 .SPX slipped 0.09 percent to 2,582.3.

France became the first Western country to indicate that Saudi Arabia was holding Hariri against his will, saying it wished for him to have “all his freedom of movement and be fully able to play the essential role that is his in Lebanon”.

Hariri’s resignation has plunged Lebanon into crisis, thrusting the small Arab country back to the forefront of regional rivalry between the Sunni Muslim monarchy Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite revolutionary Iran.

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, said Saudi Arabia’s detention of Hariri, a long-time Saudi ally who declared his resignation while in Riyadh last Saturday, was an insult to all Lebanese and he must return to Lebanon.

“Let us say things as they are: the man is detained in Saudi Arabia and forbidden until this moment from returning to Lebanon,” Nasrallah said in a televised speech.

“It is clear that Saudi Arabia and Saudi officials have declared war on Lebanon and on Hezbollah in Lebanon,” he said.

His comments mirror an accusation by Riyadh on Monday that Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war on the conservative Gulf Arab kingdom.

Riyadh says Hariri is a free man and he decided to resign because Hezbollah was calling the shots in his government. Saudi Arabia considers Hezbollah to be its enemy in conflicts across the Middle East, including Syria and Yemen.

Western countries have looked on with alarm at the rising regional tension.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned other countries and groups against using Lebanon as vehicle for a larger proxy fight in the Middle East, saying Washington strongly backed Lebanon’s independence and respected Hariri as a strong partner of the United States, still referring to him as prime minister.

“There is no legitimate place or role in Lebanon for any foreign forces, militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the Lebanese state,” Tillerson said in a statement released by the U.S. State Department.

Tillerson told reporters on Friday there was no indication that Hariri was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will but that the United States was monitoring the situation.

The French foreign minister said earlier on Friday that he also believed Hariri was a free man - a statement at odds with the later French foreign ministry comment that it wanted Hariri to have “all his freedom of movement”.

Hariri has made no public remarks since announcing his resignation in a speech televised from Saudi Arabia, saying he feared assassination and accusing Iran and Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world.

Two top Lebanese government officials, a senior politician close to Hariri and a fourth source told Reuters on Thursday that the Lebanese authorities believe Hariri is being held in Saudi Arabia.

Nasrallah said Saudi Arabia was encouraging Israel to attack Lebanon. While an Israeli attack could not be ruled out entirely, he said, it was unlikely partly because Israel knew it would pay a very high price. “I warn them against any miscalculation or any step to exploit the situation,” he said.

“Saudi will fail in Lebanon as it has failed on all fronts,” Nasrallah said.

Riyadh has advised Saudi citizens not to travel to Lebanon, or if already there to leave as soon as possible. Other Gulf states have also issued travel warnings. Those steps have raised concern that Riyadh could take measures against the tiny Arab state, which hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees.

Hariri’s resignation is being widely seen as part of a Saudi attempt to counter Iran as its influence deepens in Syria and Iraq and as Riyadh and its allies battle Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Hariri’s resignation unraveled a political deal among rival factions that made him prime minister and President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, head of state last year.

The coalition government included Hezbollah, a heavily armed military and political organization.

STUCK BETWEEN “ANTAGONISTIC INTERESTS”

Aoun told Saudi Arabia’s envoy on Friday that Hariri must return to Lebanon and the circumstances surrounding his resignation as prime minister while in Saudi Arabia were unacceptable, presidential sources said.

An “international support group” of countries concerned about Lebanon, which includes the United States, Russia and France, appealed for Lebanon “to continue to be shielded from tensions in the region”. In a statement, they also welcomed Aoun’s call for Hariri to return.

In comments to Reuters, top Lebanese Druze politician Jumblatt said Lebanon did not deserve to be accused of declaring war on Saudi Arabia. “For decades we’ve been friends,” he said.

“We are a country that is squeezed between two antagonistic interests, between Saudi Arabia and Iran,” he said. “The majority of Lebanese are just paying the price ... Lebanon can not afford to declare a war against anybody.”

The Saudi foreign minister accused Hezbollah of a role in the launching of a ballistic missile at Riyadh from Yemen on Saturday. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen was an act of “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

Nasrallah mocked the Saudi accusation that Iran and Hezbollah were behind the firing of the missile from Yemen, saying Yemenis were capable of building their own missiles.",Hezbollah says Saudi declares Lebanon war with Hariri detention,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-lebanon-politics-jumblatt/hezbollah-says-saudi-declares-lebanon-war-with-hariri-detention-idUKKBN1DA0P3

Disney’s sharper focus on streaming comes amid subscriber losses at its legacy cable networks that include ESPN and ABC, which many viewers are deserting for cheaper, on-demand streaming options.

On Thursday, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger talked up his commitment to streaming, calling it the company’s “highest priority this year.”

In a step that will further cement Disney’s strong position as a content powerhouse, Iger also unveiled a deal to develop a new “Star Wars” trilogy.

Perhaps more importantly, Iger said Disney’s planned streaming service would be “substantially” cheaper than Netflix.

Analysts said the lower price likely reflected Disney’s relatively smaller content slate but that the move could help the service gain subscribers quickly.

“We think Disney wants strong uptake early on and that this move recognizes that the equity market rewards strong (streaming) subscriber growth,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Steven Cahall said.

To compete better with Netflix and other streaming services, Disney has also said it will keep new Disney releases out of Netflix, starting from 2019.

Disney was making all the right strategic decisions as it builds out the streaming business, Evercore ISI’s Vijay Jayant said.

The company is developing family-friendly streaming services that will sell directly to consumers. It will launch a sports-focused service called ESPN Plus in early 2018.

According to news reports, Disney has held talks in recent weeks about a potential acquisition of most of Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA.O) media assets including FX, National Geographic and its movie studio.

While Iger declined to comment on the speculation on Thursday, analysts said a deal could help Disney expand its content library as it prepares to launch the streaming service.

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

“These stories are true,” he said in a statement emailed to Reuters and other news outlets.

Five women detailed sexual misconduct allegations against the Emmy-winning comedian in a New York Times report published on Thursday, including three women who said he had masturbated in front of them. The allegations dated back 15 years.

C.K. released his statement after his upcoming film “I Love You Daddy” was scrapped for release on Friday, and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) canceled a planned special with the comedian because of the allegations.

Television network FX, a unit of 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O), also severed its ties with C.K.

“He will no longer serve as executive producer or receive compensation on any of the four shows we were producing with him – ‘Better Things,’ ‘Baskets,’ ‘One Mississippi’ and ‘The Cops’,” FX Networks and FX productions said on Friday in an emailed statement.

C.K. said in his statement that he has “been remorseful of my actions. And I’ve tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I’m aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves ” his statement added.

He is the latest celebrity in the entertainment business to be accused of sexual misconduct by people coming forward in the wake of allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein and actor Kevin Spacey.

C.K., 50, said he had “spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want. I will now step back and take a long time to listen.” He did not make clear how long he would be stepping back for.

The comedian, best known for his TV comedy series “Louie,” acknowledged he had misused used his power over the women, who were in the early stage of their careers at the time.

Two of the women in the New York Times article, comedians Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov, said C.K. had invited them to his hotel room after a comedy festival in Aspen, Colorado, in 2002 and then masturbated in front of them.

“The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly,” C.K. said, adding that he thought it was ok to show his genitals to women if he asked them first.

“You asked but we never said yes,” Goodman and Wolov tweeted on Friday after his apology.

Netflix said earlier that what it called C.K’s “unprofessional and inappropriate behavior with female colleagues” had led the streaming service to decide not to produce a planned second stand-up special with him.

Film distributor The Orchard said it would not be moving forward with the release next week of “I Love You, Daddy.” The movie was written and directed by C.K. and he also appears in the film as the father of a 17-year-old girl who has a romance with a 68-year-old filmmaker.

Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) HBO said on Thursday that C.K.’s past projects with the network, including 2006’s “Lucky Louie” series, would be removed from its on-demand services and that the comedian would no longer participate in its Nov. 18 televised “Night of Too Many Stars: America Unites for Autism Programs.”","Comedian Louis C.K. admits sexual misconduct, entertainment outlets cut ties",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-louis-ck/comedian-louis-c-k-admits-sexual-misconduct-entertainment-outlets-cut-ties-idUSKBN1DA2DO

Trump pressed China to do more to rein in North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and said bilateral trade had been unfair to the United States, but also praised Xi’s pledge that China would be more open to foreign firms.

Hours after Trump left Beijing on Friday, China said it would drop foreign ownership limits on local banks and asset management companies while loosening stake restrictions in securities firms and insurers - moves that have been long awaited by foreign financial firms.

Beijing faces intensifying pressure from Western governments and business lobbies to remove investment barriers and other rules that hobble overseas firms from operating in the country, as well as intellectual property theft.

Washington has refrained from pushing harder on trade because it needs China’s cooperation on North Korea, although Xi, at least in public, went no further than reiterating China’s determination to achieve denuclearization through talks.

Trump and Xi, who call themselves friends, also oversaw the signing of about $250 billion in commercial deals, a show that some in the U.S. business community and others say detracts from addressing structural impediments that puts them at a disadvantage to Chinese rivals.

China may be mistaken in thinking it had done enough to address U.S. concerns, and Trump could find people disappointed at home he didn’t make more progress on items like market access and North Korea, Paul Haenle, Director of the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, said.

“My concern is you may see a shift towards a much harder line coming from the U.S. administration. That will be a huge surprise to China and President Xi, especially given that Xi likely feels he has done a lot for Trump on this visit.”

Trump reiterated in a tweet just before leaving Beijing for the APEC summit of Asia Pacific leaders in Vietnam that he didn’t blame China for the trade gap between the two countries, adding that he had “very productive” meetings on trade and North Korea with Xi.

“I don’t blame China, I blame the incompetence of past Admins for allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. on trade leading up to a point where the U.S. is losing $100’s of billions. How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue? I would’ve done same!”

A U.S. industry source said the implication of Trump blaming his predecessors for the trade deficit is that Trump won’t make the same mistake - a warning to Xi, not a capitulation.

The Trump administration did not bring hard trade policy items to the discussion with Xi because U.S. officials don’t want to “argue over crumbs”, the source added.

“Barring some dramatic action on North Korea by Xi, there is going to be a hard turn in U.S. trade policy,” the source said.

A second source, who is close to the business delegation that traveled to Beijing this week, added that the Trump administration appeared poised to take a much harder line in the weeks ahead.

There were no obvious gaffes during the two-night stopover, and Trump and Xi seemed to enjoy being in each other’s company.

At a banquet on Thursday night in the Great Hall of the People, Trump and Xi dined on coconut chicken soup, spicy chicken, stewed beef with tomatoes and grouper fillets.

Chinese state media said the tone and outcome of Trump’s visit had been largely positive, saying Trump and Xi were setting a new blueprint for handling relations and managing their differences.

“China has tried its utmost, even at the sacrifice of Sino-North Korean relations,” influential tabloid the Global Times wrote in its editorial.

France became the first Western country to indicate that Saudi Arabia was holding Hariri against his will, saying it wished for him to have “all his freedom of movement and be fully able to play the essential role that is his in Lebanon”.

Hariri’s resignation has plunged Lebanon into crisis, thrusting the small Arab country back to the forefront of regional rivalry between the Sunni Muslim monarchy Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite revolutionary Iran.

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, said Saudi Arabia’s detention of Hariri, a long-time Saudi ally who declared his resignation while in Riyadh last Saturday, was an insult to all Lebanese and he must return to Lebanon.

“Let us say things as they are: the man is detained in Saudi Arabia and forbidden until this moment from returning to Lebanon,” Nasrallah said in a televised speech.

“It is clear that Saudi Arabia and Saudi officials have declared war on Lebanon and on Hezbollah in Lebanon,” he said.

His comments mirror an accusation by Riyadh on Monday that Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war on the conservative Gulf Arab kingdom.

Riyadh says Hariri is a free man and he decided to resign because Hezbollah was calling the shots in his government. Saudi Arabia considers Hezbollah to be its enemy in conflicts across the Middle East, including Syria and Yemen.

Western countries have looked on with alarm at the rising regional tension.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned other countries and groups against using Lebanon as vehicle for a larger proxy fight in the Middle East, saying Washington strongly backed Lebanon’s independence and respected Hariri as a strong partner of the United States, still referring to him as prime minister.

“There is no legitimate place or role in Lebanon for any foreign forces, militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the Lebanese state,” Tillerson said in a statement released by the U.S. State Department.

Tillerson told reporters on Friday there was no indication that Hariri was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will but that the United States was monitoring the situation.

The French foreign minister said earlier on Friday that he also believed Hariri was a free man - a statement at odds with the later French foreign ministry comment that it wanted Hariri to have “all his freedom of movement”.

Hariri has made no public remarks since announcing his resignation in a speech televised from Saudi Arabia, saying he feared assassination and accusing Iran and Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world.

Two top Lebanese government officials, a senior politician close to Hariri and a fourth source told Reuters on Thursday that the Lebanese authorities believe Hariri is being held in Saudi Arabia.

Nasrallah said Saudi Arabia was encouraging Israel to attack Lebanon. While an Israeli attack could not be ruled out entirely, he said, it was unlikely partly because Israel knew it would pay a very high price. “I warn them against any miscalculation or any step to exploit the situation,” he said.

“Saudi will fail in Lebanon as it has failed on all fronts,” Nasrallah said.

Riyadh has advised Saudi citizens not to travel to Lebanon, or if already there to leave as soon as possible. Other Gulf states have also issued travel warnings. Those steps have raised concern that Riyadh could take measures against the tiny Arab state, which hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees.

Hariri’s resignation is being widely seen as part of a Saudi attempt to counter Iran as its influence deepens in Syria and Iraq and as Riyadh and its allies battle Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Hariri’s resignation unraveled a political deal among rival factions that made him prime minister and President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, head of state last year.

The coalition government included Hezbollah, a heavily armed military and political organization.

STUCK BETWEEN “ANTAGONISTIC INTERESTS”

Aoun told Saudi Arabia’s envoy on Friday that Hariri must return to Lebanon and the circumstances surrounding his resignation as prime minister while in Saudi Arabia were unacceptable, presidential sources said.

An “international support group” of countries concerned about Lebanon, which includes the United States, Russia and France, appealed for Lebanon “to continue to be shielded from tensions in the region”. In a statement, they also welcomed Aoun’s call for Hariri to return.

In comments to Reuters, top Lebanese Druze politician Jumblatt said Lebanon did not deserve to be accused of declaring war on Saudi Arabia. “For decades we’ve been friends,” he said.

“We are a country that is squeezed between two antagonistic interests, between Saudi Arabia and Iran,” he said. “The majority of Lebanese are just paying the price ... Lebanon can not afford to declare a war against anybody.”

The Saudi foreign minister accused Hezbollah of a role in the launching of a ballistic missile at Riyadh from Yemen on Saturday. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen was an act of “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

Nasrallah mocked the Saudi accusation that Iran and Hezbollah were behind the firing of the missile from Yemen, saying Yemenis were capable of building their own missiles.",Hezbollah says Saudi declares Lebanon war with Hariri detention,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1DA1J2-OCATP

CNN has become a sticking point in antitrust approval of AT&T’s $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), hatched in October 2016.

Justice Department staff have recommended that AT&T sell either its DirecTV unit or Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting unit - which includes CNN - a government official told Reuters on Thursday, in order to gain antitrust approval.

On Thursday Stephenson said he had no interest in selling CNN and that he was ready to defend the deal in court if necessary.

According to one of the sources on Friday, Murdoch called Stephenson twice, unprompted, on May 16 and Aug. 8 and on both occasions asked if CNN was for sale. Stephenson replied both times that it was not, according to the source.

‘NO SENSE’

It would not be the first time Murdoch has attempted to take control of CNN.

His Twenty-First Century Fox made an $80 billion offer for Time Warner in 2014 but abandoned the plan in the face of Time Warner’s resistance. At that time, Fox had planned to divest CNN - which competes with Fox News - in order to avoid antitrust issues.

There is no law against a company owning two cable networks, but there is a Federal Communications Commission prohibition on owning two broadcast networks. A Fox deal with CNN could also raise antitrust concerns because of the market share that a combined company would have among cable news viewers.

“I have been called and asked if I would sell CNN by numerous people,” Stephenson told the New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday. But he added: “Selling CNN makes no sense.”

Fox has held talks in the last few weeks to sell most of its film and television assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), CNBC reported this week, which would leave the company with its Fox News, sports programming and broadcasting stations..

Twenty-First Century Fox would sell its stake in European satellite broadcaster Sky Plc (SKYB.L) in a deal with Disney, according to CNBC’s report. Fox is trying to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own but the bid is strongly opposed by some lawmakers and has been subject to lengthy regulatory scrutiny.

U.S. crude oil CLc1 reached its highest this week in more than two years at nearly $58 a barrel, boosted by rising tensions in the Middle East.

Canada's so-called ""petro-currency"" CAD= has historically traded in the same direction as oil CLc1, one of the country's major exports.

But the correlation between the currency and the commodity has turned negative in recent months after the Bank of Canada raised interest rates in July and September for the first time since 2010 and then undercut expectations for further increases this year.

(For a graphic on 'Canadian dollar rolling three-month correlation with crude oil' click reut.rs/2zs3NzM)

A slower path for rate hikes is widely expected, and spreads between Canadian and U.S. bonds have steadied after a period of volatility. CABONEA

That does not mean oil will then resume driving the currency, strategists said.

“You’ve got a very large gray range where (higher) oil doesn’t really spur on significant new investment,” said Mark Chandler, head of Canadian fixed income and currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “And ... declines in oil to very low levels really don’t spur further cutbacks.”

The changed dynamic could also reduce the impact crude has on the outlook for Canada’s economic growth.

Investment in Canada’s energy sector had already been cut back after crude slumped in 2014, while oil sands projects tend to have high upfront costs.

A move above $70 a barrel is needed for oil to drive the currency, Chandler said.

U.S. crude oil CLc1 reached its highest this week in more than two years at nearly $58 a barrel, boosted by rising tensions in the Middle East.

Higher prices tend to encourage more production from U.S. shale producers and could encourage more investment in alternative sources of energy, such as wind and solar power.

“In the past, whenever oil prices spiked higher, traders would extrapolate that increase into the future and they would take the Canadian dollar higher,” said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.

“But today ... a spike higher in oil prices could ultimately accelerate the green energy revolution and push oil prices lower in the future.”

Just as the petro-currency tag has lost its luster for some, the usefulness of tracking oil to predict the value of the Canadian dollar has been further hampered by the emergence of the United States as a net exporter of the commodity.

“The interaction between oil prices, the greenback and the Canadian dollar has gotten far more complex,” said Karl Schamotta, director of global markets strategy at Cambridge Global Payments.

Last year, amid enthusiasm following a detente in relations agreed between former President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro in 2014, 33 U.S. companies took stands at the fair, the premier event on Cuba’s business calendar.

The mood was very different at this year’s edition, which took place last week in Havana. While China brought a record company delegation, and more than 150 Spanish businesses packed into five pavilions, the handful of U.S. businessmen were downbeat.

“I’ve never seen it this deserted,” said Jay Brickman, vice president of Florida-based shipping company Crowley Maritime Corp, who has been attending the fair for 15 years. “People have really gotten discouraged, and feel they maybe should be investing their time someplace else.”

U.S. companies embraced Cuba in the wake of the detente, jostling for a foothold in an opening market of 11 million consumers.

Thanks to travel-related exemptions to the embargo, U.S. airlines restored regular flights. Starwood Hotels, a subsidiary of Marriott International Inc (MAR.O), took over management of a Cuban hotel and cruise operators like Florida-based Carnival Cruise Line (CCL.N) included Cuba in their itineraries.

But worsening U.S. relations as well as growing awareness of the difficulty of doing business in Cuba put a dampener on that.

Trump in June ordered tighter trade and travel restrictions including a ban on business with the military, which controls vast swathes of the economy. The regulations were unveiled on Wednesday.

“This is a huge step backwards,” said former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez, the Cuban-born head of the U.S.-Cuba Business Council. “We had made so much progress.”

An unfolding diplomatic crisis over allegations of attacks on U.S. diplomats in Havana is adding to the gloom.

Cuba Trade magazine, based in Miami, last month cut its issuance from monthly to bi-monthly, citing the deteriorating business environment under Trump. Several Cuba business conferences in the United States have also been canceled since June, including an agriculture conference in Chicago.

Following the Obama detente, U.S. farmers hoped for legislation allowing them to access credit for exports to Cuba. But Trump has made it clear he is not about to ease, let alone lift, the embargo.

“We need to get the diplomatic issue off the table first,” said Louisiana Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain, adding U.S. food exports to Cuba could total $1 billion if relations were normalized.

HARDER

Even before Trump took office, some of the interest fizzled as companies realized doing business in Cuba was hard with its red tape, shortage of hard currency, poor telecommunications and labor restrictions.

Online payments company PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) sent its chief executive in Obama’s delegation on his historic visit to Cuba in March 2016. It had been interested in making its Xoom money transfer service available in Cuba but said operational challenges were too great.

“When we are able to deliver the speed, convenience and security our customers have come to expect from Xoom, we will launch in Cuba,” a PayPal spokeswoman told Reuters.

Still, some companies made headway. After receiving all the necessary licenses under Obama, the Puerto Rican dealer for U.S. heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) last week agreed to open a distribution center in Cuba’s Mariel special development zone.

Future deals with Mariel, which boasts tax and customs breaks, will not be possible, as it features on a list published Wednesday of 180 government entities that Americans are now banned from doing business with.

“The Mariel restriction particularly sticks out because it is the most dynamic and exciting opportunity in Cuba,” said James Williams, president of lobby group Engage Cuba.

The diplomatic crisis has also complicated the logistics for U.S. businesses. The Trump administration in September expelled 15 Cuban diplomats, including all those dealing with U.S. businesses.

The following week, the chair of the port of Cleveland, Darrell McNair, traveled to Havana to sign an agreement with Cuba’s port authority. He said the now-disbanded embassy commercial team had been instrumental in arranging his visit.

“Cutbacks obviously are going to slow things down,” he said.

LONG-TERM PLAY

The tougher environment under Trump has separated the wheat from the chaff, some business consultants say.

“The serious players who understand the risks are staying the course,” said Pedro Freyre, who heads the international practice at Miami-based law firm Akerman LLP.

Jeff Nelson said his firm Strategic Staffing Solutions, which provides companies with IT and other services, was prepared to put in the time laying the groundwork for business with Cuba given the potential of its educated workforce.

“Doing business in Cuba is a very long-term proposition,” said Nelson, who has visited eight times in two years.

Some companies were pursuing deals behind closed doors so as to not lose capital with the Trump administration, consultants said. Many Obama-era exemptions to the embargo remain in place.

The publication of the new regulations at least provided clarity about what was allowed.

“Companies know where they stand now and there are definitely opportunities still,” said Gutierrez. “Every day that goes by is just the missed opportunity where someone else is building a brand, someone else is building awareness among Cubans.”",Blooming U.S. business interest in Cuba wilts under Trump,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-usa-trade/blooming-u-s-business-interest-in-cuba-wilts-under-trump-idUSKBN1DA1VJ?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation across the Group of 20 Economies (G20),

is expected to announce in coming weeks a switch in focus from insurers’ size to their activities when deciding whether to subject them to increased regulatory scrutiny, said the source, who requested anonymity because the matter has not been made public.

Companies singled out for such scrutiny are required to hold extra capital to cover potential losses, increasing overall business costs and potentially reducing shareholder returns.

The insurance industry has been lobbying for years for regulators to move to the activities-based approach, arguing that their huge size should not automatically qualify them as systemically risky and on the hook for onerous bank-like capital rules.

The shift in the FSB’s approach to designating globally systemically important insurers, or GSIIs, follows pressure from the U.S. Treasury Department, which has been pushing the FSB to ease up on insurers and asset managers, the source said.

A spokesman for the FSB declined to comment.

The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged to overhaul regulations introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and put U.S. interests first when engaging in international bodies such as the FSB and the Basel Committee of banking supervisors.

In September, a group of U.S. regulators - known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council - removed AIG from its domestic list of systemically important insurers, raising questions over whether the FSB would keep AIG on its global list and continue to add new firms.

In a policy report published last month, the U.S. Treasury rejected the idea of singling out specific asset management and insurance firms as systemically risky and criticized the FSB for mission-creep and a lack of transparency.

The U.S. Treasury is shortly due to release a policy report on the FSOC designation process and powers, which critics including regulatory experts and insurers have said are too opaque and unaccountable.

AIG BAILOUT

AIG helped spark the global financial crisis, and the labeling of major financial institutions as systemically important stems largely from its $182 billion U.S. government-led rescue in September 2008. The bailout came just before the company would have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection amid mounting losses on its derivatives book.

Worried the insurance giant was “too big to fail,” the government stepped in to prevent further chaos to the financial system. The company ultimately repaid taxpayers in full by the end of 2012, with a profit of $22.7 billion, according to AIG.

Since then, regulators have primarily focused on the size of a company’s overall assets when assessing the risk they pose to the global financial system.

Moving to an activities-based approach could see firms on the list that largely engage in traditional insurance activities removed, but other non-designated insurers that use their cash to invest in risky assets, or which deploy high levels of leverage, added.

The suspension of the 2017 review means the 2016 list of nine GSIIs - which also includes MetLife Inc (MET.N), Allianz SE (ALVG.DE) and Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (601318.SS) - will continue to stand for at least the next 12 months until the FSB has completed an assessment based on the new methodology, the source said.",Exclusive: Global regulators to ditch 'too big to fail' gauge for insurers - source,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-financial-insurers-exclusive/exclusive-global-regulators-to-ditch-too-big-to-fail-gauge-for-insurers-source-idUSKBN1DA2J7

The airline in September canceled 20,000 flights, saying rostering problems had left it without enough standby pilots to operate without significant delays. The resulting wave of passenger outrage threatened to undo the success of its ‘Always Getting Better’ customer service drive.

Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers has responded by promising pilots improved pay and conditions, which it says exceed those offered by rivals.

In the memo, Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said almost 20 of Ryanair’s 86 bases had voted for the pay deal as of Friday. However, a number of bases, including its largest hub at London Stansted, have rejected the offer.

Some pilots have been using September’s rostering issue to press for better conditions and the creation of a pan-European representative body; Ryanair has long opposed recognizing unions.

Ryanair said in the memo sent on Friday that it would “dramatically increase” the number of pilots employed directly rather than by outside agencies; over 180 first officers would be offered Ryanair contracts in November, and 300 more offers would be made by December.

It also said it had hired 1,040 new pilots this year, with the newest entrants receiving the better pay terms, and that it expected another 400 to join by March, bringing its crewing ratio to 11.0 pilots per aircraft from 10.5 by the time the busy European summer schedule begins.

A new crew control mobile phone app has also been introduced to speed up the logging of absences, and the memo says Ryanair will double the number of base managers to eight in the weeks ahead to “respond even faster to even more pilot queries”.

“We have launched an Always Flying Better (AFB) program to fill the infrastructure gaps in pilot communications, admin support and effective structures for resolving pilot queries,” Wilson said.

Wilson also said a problem with allocated leave for December had caused inconvenience to a small number of pilots.

The House was set to vote on its measure next week. But the Senate’s timetable was less clear.

An MLP is a limited partnership that is publicly traded and, as such, enjoys the benefits of paying no tax at the company level as well as the liquidity that comes with being traded on a major stock exchange.

They generally deal in the production, processing, storage and transport of commodities such as oil and natural gas, which makes them sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the underlying commodity. A high dividend yield also makes them attractive in low interest rate environments.

But there has been a dislocation this year, as WTI CLcv1 and Brent LCOcv1 crude oil have climbed about 20 percent since the end of August yet MLPs have yet to follow suit.

“If you told me what oil did, interest rates did, credit spreads, all of these things so far this year, I would say MLPs should be up 10 percent this year,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.

“Oil prices going above $55 a barrel, interest rates remaining pretty low, U.S. oil production seems to be pretty strong - if you take those factors and triangulate then MLPs should be a lot higher.”

A recent Reuters poll showed oil will likely rally into 2018 with periods of volatility as an anticipated extension of OPEC-led output restrictions offsets higher U.S. production.

The Alerian MLP Index .AMZ is down more than 4 percent since Aug. 31 and nearly 15 percent for the year despite the climb in oil prices. That lags well behind the gain of more than 4 percent in the broad S&P 500 .SPX since Aug. 31 and 15 percent gain for the year.

That decline has made MLPs cheap and coupled with their high dividend yields in a low interest rate environment, should make them attractive to investors.

The average dividend yield of MLPs in the Alerian index stands at 7.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Enbridge Energy Partners (EEP.N), at 16.08 percent, and Suburban Propane Partners (SPH.N) at 14.47 percent, currently have the highest dividend yields in the index.

“You buy things that are cheap, that have good income, you sit there and collect your dividend checks and kind of wait it out,” said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.

“Fortunately you get these big dividends and it offsets a lot of the pain.”

One factor that could work against MLPs could be seasonality, as investors begin to engage in tax-loss selling by the end of the year, when investors dump underperforming stocks in order to reduce or negate capital gains taxes.

The Alerian index has also become less correlated with oil prices themselves, with a 50-day correlation of negative 0.66 to U.S. crude, the biggest disconnect in four years. So as oil prices have increased, MLPs have gone in the other direction.

That could indicate investors are not convinced oil prices will continue to rally.

“You get into these bear super cycles, these long periods where it is really hard for prices to get going because there is just too much supply everywhere and it doesn’t go away,” said John LaForge, Head of Real Asset Strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in Sarasota, Florida.

“If oil prices are not going to be headed above $60 and staying above $60, the growth profile for more and more projects just isn’t there and I’m not going to bid up an MLP.”","MLPs poised for bounce, but could be short-lived",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-weekahead/mlps-poised-for-bounce-but-could-be-short-lived-idINKBN1DA2LY

The federal government said it wants an excise tax on all cannabis products of C$1 (79 cents) per gram (0.04 ounce), or 10 percent of the retail price, whichever is higher. Excise taxes are paid by manufacturers.

Consumers would be levied federal and provincial sales taxes, which could boost the final price of marijuana by up to 15 percent, depending on the province.

“The federal proposal to share revenue 50-50 is not reasonable or sufficient,” said Jessica Martin, spokeswoman for Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa. “The transition to a legalized and regulated system will come with significant incremental costs to the province.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government wants to allow recreational marijuana across the entire country by July 2018, making it the first Group of Seven country to do so. But it has left many of the details, including how it will be sold, up to the provinces.

Federal and provincial authorities want the total cost of a cannabis product to be low enough to discourage people from the illegal market.

Marijuana producers’ shares rose as the plan was similar to one Trudeau outlined last month. Canopy Growth Co rose 2.7 percent to C$19.88, while Aphria Inc was up 3.7 percent at C$8.49.

Some provinces have expressed concern about how much it will cost to implement and supervise the new market, laying the groundwork for a potential conflict between the two levels of government.

Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, said each province needs to have the flexibility to support its own distribution system.

Canada’s federal and provincial finance ministers are set to discuss legalization of pot at a meeting next month in Ottawa.

Member of Parliament Bill Blair, the government’s point person on marijuana legalization, said total tax revenue could be as much as around C$1 billion, though he said that was a very high estimate and will depend on how big the market is.

Trudeau promised in his 2015 election campaign to legalize marijuana, saying it would keep the drug out of the hands of underage users and reduce related crime.

However, opposition has been brewing among some in the Canadian Senate, which could put quick passage of the law in jeopardy.","Canada proposes splitting pot tax, draws ire from Ontario",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1DA29N-OCATP

Ieri, sulle banche venete, la commissione ha ascoltato separatamente la testimonianza di Carmelo Barbagallo, capo della vigilanza di Via Nazionale, e di Angelo Apponi, direttore generale Consob, ma non si è andati avanti con l‘annunciato ‘faccia a faccia’.

Non è escluso tuttavia che i parlamentari tornino a chiedere il confronto diretto una volta letti in dettaglio i verbali di seduta.

Per ora ciò che resta agli atti è lo scambio di critiche reciproco: Consob accusa Bankitalia di averla informata tardivamente o affatto di quanto era emerso di rilevante durante le ispezioni alle due banche venete; Bankitalia ha chiarito il suo punto di vista e ha citato una informativa, datata 25 novembre 2013, in cui avvisava Consob che Veneto banca valutava le azioni in modo incoerente rispetto al contesto di crisi economica. Per Bankitalia quello sarebbe stato un warning sufficiente.

Martedì 14 novembre la commissione apre un nuovo capitolo e ascolterà i magistrati che stanno indagando su Mps, ricapitalizzata dallo Stato con 3,9 miliardi nell‘ambito di un salvataggio che prevede anche 1,5 miliardi di ristoro per i titolari di obbligazioni junior.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan budget watchdog in Washington, on Friday called a Senate Republican tax plan a “fatally flawed budget buster,” likening it to Republican legislation in the House of Representatives that the House tax committee has approved.

Both measures would add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the annual budget deficit and the $20 trillion national debt, according to congressional tax analysts.

The watchdog group estimated that $900 billion of the projected $1.5 trillion deficit increase would come from business tax cuts. The remainder would come from individual tax cuts, including a cut in the estate tax on inheritance that would help only the richest Americans, it said.

Republicans hold a tenuous 52-48 majority in the Senate. For that reason, if they lose the support of only three senators from their ranks, they cannot pass a tax bill as long as Democrats stay united in their opposition.

Nearly 10 months into his presidency, with his party in control of the House and the Senate, Trump is still without a major legislative victory. Failing to get a tax bill through the Senate could cost Republicans in November 2018’s midterm elections.

The Tax Foundation, another nonpartisan group, said the Senate plan would add $1.78 trillion to the deficit over a decade. It estimated that over the same time frame lower taxes would expand the U.S. economy by 3.7 percent, add 925,000 full-time jobs, raise wages by 2.9 percent and generate enough new tax revenue to erase all but $516 billion of the deficit effect.

DEFICIT REVERSAL

For decades, Republicans positioned themselves as deficit hawks, refusing to raise the debt limit, opposing Democratic spending programs and warning of crushing federal debts being passed on to future generations of Americans.

The tax plans now being debated represent a stark reversal, with congressional Republican leadership and tax law writers urging passage of deficit-expanding tax changes. Only a handful of Republican senators already have publicly voiced misgivings.

After the Senate plan was released on Thursday, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in a statement, “I remain concerned over how the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt by opting for short-term fixes, while ignoring long-term problems for taxpayers and the economy.”

Senator James Lankford said in a statement, “As we work on tax relief, we must also not lose sight of our responsibilities to protect the nation, provide basic government services and confront our federal debt.”

Senator Bob Corker, another Republican and a critic of Trump, did not comment after the Senate bill’s release but signaled fiscal concerns after the House issued its plan, saying he did not want tax cut legislation that added to the deficit.

“The current tax reform debate shows Congress just can’t seem to shake its addiction to debt,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

“If tax cuts paid for by debt are signed into law, Congress will have sent a massive, budget-busting tax bill to our children to pay, and it will result only in a short-term sugar high with little to no economic improvement over the long term,” she said.

The House is due to vote on passage of its tax bill next week. The Senate Finance Committee is due to begin formal consideration of the Senate’s version on Monday.

The Senate panel’s chairman, Republican Orrin Hatch, said he hopes to have the bill approved and sent to the full Senate by the end of next week. The House and Senate would need to agree on a single piece of legislation, pass it and send it to Trump for his signature.",Deficit worries complicate path for Republican tax cuts,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/deficit-worries-complicate-path-for-republican-tax-cuts-idUSKBN1DA2V2

After negotiations in Brussels, the first in a month, Brexit Secretary David Davis said during a news conference with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier it was time for “political discussions” to break a deadlock that has left both sides frustrated about a lack of progress.

“Political” talks has in the past been code for Prime Minister Theresa May addressing fellow EU leaders directly, over the heads of Barnier and the EU executive, in order to square a circle in which Brussels will not address the future without a firm line from London on settling what the EU sees as past debts and May will not settle without assurances about future trade.

May is due at a Brussels summit on Dec. 14-15 but EU officials insist that any breakthrough must be agreed at lower level first and weeks in advance to let the other 27 members agree a joint position. Progress in December is important for May as businesses seek clarity by the new year, when many will take investment decisions dependent on conditions after Brexit.

A British budget due on Nov. 22 will, however, complicate the task for May in persuading hardline Brexit supporters of any need to meet Brussels’ demand for tens of billions of euros to cover liabilities incurred in 44 years of EU membership.

Barnier stressed that he was not looking for a number from London but for a clearer undertaking than May gave in September on how far Britain would “honor its obligations”.

“It is absolutely vital if we are to achieve sufficient progress in December,” Barnier told reporters, adding not all details had to be settled but there needed to be “sincere and real progress”.

The clarifications should come within the next two weeks, Barnier said: “If that’s not the case, then we will continue and that will pull back the opening of discussions on the future.”

“POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS”

He said progress had to be made on all three key issues of the divorce talks - the money, the rights of EU citizens in Britain and how to avoid a “hard border” with EU-member Ireland.

Davis said both sides made substantial technical progress on all the issues that need to be addressed. “This is now about moving into the political discussions that would enable both of us to move forward,” he said.

British discussions with other national governments do not appear to have breached the unity of the 27 for now. And German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, the bloc’s most powerful leaders, have taken a particularly tough line on the money issue in Brussels.

The EU executive has said Britain will owe it around 60 billion euros when it leaves. London has challenged the legal reasoning behind that but has not offered its own figure.

One thing that was clarified on Friday was exactly when Britain would leave the Union. The EU had previously defined “Brexit hour” as “midnight” on March 29, 2019, exactly two years after May triggered the process. But it was unclear whether that meant midnight in Brussels or London.

May and Barnier made statements on Friday stating that Brexit will happen in London at 11 p.m. (2300 GMT) on Friday, March 29. That will be midnight in the EU capital.

Davis repeated the declaration made by May in September in Florence that EU countries will not need to pay more or receive less for the remainder of the current EU long-term budget ending in December 2020: “The UK will honor the commitments we made during the period of our membership,” he said.

Barnier said both sides moved ahead on citizens’ rights and that Britain gave “useful” clarifications on a process through which EU citizens could obtain a “settled status” but the EU needed reassurances on how such a system would work.

He said issues related to family reunification, the right to export social security benefits and the role of the European Court of Justice still need work.

On the problems of avoiding a “hard border” between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland, Davis and Barnier said more work must be done.","EU wants Brexit money this month, Davis seeks 'political' fix",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-barnier/deal-on-divorce-bill-vital-for-next-future-ties-talks-eus-barnier-idUKKBN1DA1IQ

SBI, the nation’s top lender with a share of more than fifth of the banking assets, reported on Friday a lower-than-expected profit, but its bad loan additions during the three months to end-September slowed sharply and pushed the overall bad-loan ratio down.

Its stock surged more than 6 percent after the results.

Helped by a stake sale in its life insurance arm, SBI said its second-quarter net profit was 15.82 billion rupees ($243.3 million), compared with a restated net loss of 5.57 billion rupees a year earlier. The profit was lower than analysts’ estimates of 26.96 billion rupees, marred by a rise in provisions.

Newly appointed SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar, who took over last month, said they used the cushion from the insurance stake sale to bolster provisions and improve the coverage ratio by 431 basis points in a quarter to 65.1 percent.

“The idea is that we enhance our loss absorption capacity,” he told reporters on a conference call, adding they aimed to further improve the provision coverage ratio as the banking sector moves towards international accounting standards.

Given the grim situation, the Indian government last month announced a $32 billion recapitalisation of state lenders to help resolve bad loans and kick-start lending growth.

SBI, which has the biggest share of the soured loans, merged its five subsidiary banks with itself earlier this year, driving a jump in its non-performing loans as of June to almost 10 percent. That ratio eased to 9.83 percent at end-September, while the additions to bad loans during the quarter was nearly a third of the rise in the previous three months.

“The results were comforting to see and is probably the best set of numbers from SBI that we’ve seen in the recent past especially when there is still uncertainty over non performing loans issue,” said Aalok Shah, a banking sector analyst at Mumbai’s Centrum Broking.

Bank of India, the market’s sixth-biggest lender by assets which also reported on Friday, posted a better-than-expected 41 percent rise in second-quarter profit and a narrower bad-loan ratio.

The banking sector faces a rise in provisions for loan losses after a central bank order to cover at least 50 percent of the loans to companies being sent to bankruptcy court. A dozen of the biggest loan defaulters are already at the bankruptcy court, while nearly 30 more could be headed there after December.

SBI said it has more than 50 percent provision coverage for the bankruptcy cases.

SBI shares closed 6.3 percent higher in a Mumbai market that ended up 0.12 percent on Friday. The stock has gained about 30 percent in the past one month to be the second-best performer among the constituents in the main market index.

The poll found 32 percent of Americans think the wealthy will benefit most, compared to 14 percent who think all Americans will benefit and 14 percent who think large U.S. corporations will benefit most.

Congress is working to try to enact the most sweeping overhaul of the tax code since the 1980s that would lower taxes for millions of individual tax payers and slash the rate paid by corporations. The proposal would also eliminate most individual tax deductions, a move that could result in some taxpayers seeing an increase in their total bill to the government while others see a decrease.

Despite an insistence by Republicans that their goal is help the middle class, only 8 percent of Americans think that demographic will benefit the most, the poll, which was conducted Nov. 3-8, found.

Republicans and Democrats are divided on who they think tax reform would help the most. Among Republicans, 26 percent think all Americans will benefit, followed by 16 percent who think the wealthy will benefit most, the poll found.

But among Democrats, 46 percent think that wealthy will benefit most, with only 7 percent thinking all Americans will benefit and 17 percent who think corporations will benefit.

And while those polled did not think that the middle class will benefit most, an overwhelming majority thought that they should.

However, 76 percent said it was more important to cut taxes for corporations than it was to cut taxes for the wealthy.

When it comes to specific changes, the poll found that 46 percent of Americans oppose limiting the mortgage interest deduction, compared to 35 percent who support the change.

The strongest opposition came to the Republican proposal to eliminate deductions for medical expenses, with 54 percent saying they are against the change and 32 percent saying they support it.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted in early November online in English throughout the United States.

Federal lawmakers have criticized Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc for not doing enough to identify and block Russian agents from buying ads on their services. U.S. authorities say the ads were intended to influence voters during the 2016 presidential election.

U.S. law permits foreign entities to advertise about certain issues if they disclose such spending, but it is unlawful for them to interfere in elections.

In September, the Federal Election Commission, which sets campaign finance rules, voted to consider ensuring that those disclosure rules apply to online activity. It opened a public comment period that is set to expire Monday.

In the letter, Google on Thursday offered its formal response to the FEC’s deliberation.

“Now more than ever, we must work together to improve transparency, enhance disclosures and reduce foreign abuse and influence in U.S. elections,” the company wrote.

The stance marks an about-face from 2010 when Google sought an affirmative exemption from a requirement that an ad should state who purchased it. The commission did not reach a consensus on the exemption at the time.

Google now is calling on the commission to extend disclosure rules that apply to TV and print ads to the Web.

“Google strongly supports the commission’s proposal to proceed with a rulemaking so that the commission can provide the clarity that campaigns and other political advertisers need to determine what disclaimers they are required to include.”

The company, which is the world’s top seller of online ads, also asked federal regulators and lawmakers to expand restrictions on foreign participation in elections to cover content distributed and advertised on the Internet.

Ratifying such provisions could give tech companies guidance on how to treat soft influence, or content from organizations such as RT, a Russian news outlet that has drawn concerns from lawmakers for peddling propaganda on Facebook and Google’s YouTube service.

In its letter, Google also reiterated plans to offer the public a database of election ads purchased through its service. In addition, the company has said information about buyers would be more accessible.

The Venice, California-based firm, whose March stock market debut was the hottest of any tech stock in years, reported revenue and user growth for the third quarter well below Wall Street expectations as it struggles to compete with Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) Instagram.

Snap’s shares tumbled as much as 20 percent in after-hours trading, before paring losses to trade at $12.57. Snap went public at a price of $17 a share.

Snap has disappointed investors each quarter of its brief existence as a public company.

User growth in the last three months was well below what investment analysts expected. Daily active users rose to 178 million in the third quarter from 173 million in the second quarter. Analysts had expected 181.8 million, according to research firm FactSet.

Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said the company was launching the redesign after hearing for years that Snapchat was difficult to understand or hard to use.

“We are going to make it easier to discover the vast quantity of content on our platform that goes undiscovered or unseen every day,” Spiegel told analysts on a conference call.

The 27-year-old CEO said there was a “strong likelihood” the redesign would be disruptive in the short term, but said Snap was willing to take the risk for long-term gain.

Such a radical change so soon after an IPO is unusual.

Snap is not the only social media company looking to revive growth by changing its look. Microblogging service Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) said on Tuesday it would roll out 280-character tweets to users across the world, double the length of its iconic 140-character tweets.

Asked on the analyst call what Snapchat’s redesign would look like, Spiegel said the company had been studying the evolution of mobile content feeds such as Twitter streams and the Facebook News Feed and saw room for a “personalized content service.”

Spiegel said the company next year would also build more tools for people to share with broad audiences beyond their friends, the type of public broadcasting common on Instagram and Twitter.

“It seems like a significant amount of change in a short period of time,” analyst Rich Greenfield of BTIG told Spiegel on the call. He asked what led to the shifts.

Spiegel said Snap needed to evolve rapidly. “We’re just not afraid to make changes in the long-term interest of the business,” he said.

REVENUE MISS

Snaps’s third-quarter revenue, the bulk of which comes from advertisements, rose to $207.9 million from $128.2 million. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $236.9 million.

Average revenue per user rose to $1.17 in the quarter, from 84 cents a year earlier, but missed analysts’ average estimate of $1.30.

Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan said revenue was affected by a shift toward a software-based auction system for selling ads - a method employed by Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google - which has driven down the average price.

The auction system hit revenue in the short term but “builds the foundation for long-term scalable revenue,” Khan said in written remarks. He said Snap more than tripled revenue from small- and medium-sized businesses in the third quarter compared with the first half of the year.

Snap is far behind Facebook and Google in making its ad system accessible to small businesses and should move faster, said Greg Portell, a consultant at A.T. Kearney.

“I think they spent a little too much time being different,” Portell said.

Snap recorded a $39.9 million charge in the quarter related to excess inventory of its “Spectacles,” sunglasses with a built-in camera.

INVESTORS SOUR

Snap posted a net loss of $443.2 million, or 36 cents per share, compared with a loss of $124.2 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.

Wall Street had expected a loss of 32 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Snapchat, popular among millennials for the bunny faces and floral tiaras that can be added to pictures, allows users to chat through a series of disappearing photos and videos. Users can also post images and videos as “stories” - ephemeral posts that can be viewed in chronological order and disappear after 24 hours.

Before the quarterly release, Snap’s share price was already down 39 percent from its close on March 2, its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Facebook’s shares were up 32 percent over that time.

Facebook’s Instagram said in September that it had 500 million daily active users.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

“The shuttle did what it was supposed to do, in that its sensors registered the truck and the shuttle stopped,” the city said.

The Automobile Association of America (AAA) of Southern Nevada, one of the shuttle’s sponsors, said it would assist the safety board’s investigation.

“Working together and sharing information will ensure this new technology is safely implemented for the public, and that’s AAA’s top priority,” the organization said in a statement.

The shuttle is also sponsored by the city of Las Vegas, Keolis North America and the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada.

Reporter Jeff Zurschmeide, who was on the shuttle at the time of the crash, said the self-driving vehicle did what it was programmed to do but not everything a human driver might do.

“That’s a critical point,” Zurschmeide wrote on digitaltrends.com. “We had about 20 feet of empty street behind us (I looked), and most human drivers would have thrown the car into reverse and used some of that space to get away from the truck. Or at least leaned on the horn and made our presence harder to miss.”

The crash follows a rising number of incidents involving human drivers behaving improperly or recklessly around self-driving cars. There have been 12 crashes in California alone since Sept. 8 involving General Motors Co’s self-driving unit, Cruise Automation. All were the fault of human drivers in other vehicles, GM told regulators.

The NTSB investigated a May 2016 crash of a Tesla Inc Model S that killed a driver using the vehicle’s semi-autonomous “Autopilot” system. In September, the board recommended that auto safety regulators and automakers take steps to ensure that semi-autonomous systems were not misused.",U.S. safety board to probe self-driving shuttle crash in Las Vegas,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-selfdriving/u-s-safety-board-to-probe-self-driving-shuttle-crash-in-las-vegas-idUKKBN1DA2K1?il=0

Justice Minister Aimee Laurentine Kanyana said Burundi would not cooperate with the Netherlands-based court, from which it formally withdrew on Oct. 26. The ICC still claims jurisdiction over crimes committed while Burundi was a member.

“The government of Burundi heard a rumour through international media reports that ICC has given authorisation to its prosecutor to start an investigation on Burundi,” she told a news conference.

“The government rejects that decision and reiterates its firm determination that it will not cooperate with ICC or any other fraudulent manipulation intending to ... extend mandate of the ICC on the Burundi territory.”

On Thursday, the court said it had approved a prosecution request to investigate war crimes allegedly committed by Burundi’s government and allied groups against political foes from April 2015 to October 2017.

Burundi was plunged into violence in April 2015 when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced that he would seek a third term in office.

The opposition said the move was unconstitutional and violated a peace deal that ended a civil war in 2005. He won the vote in a July 2015 election boycotted by most opposition parties.

At least 450 people have been killed in politically-related violence since then, rights groups say.

The ICC said on Friday said the crimes alleged to have occurred between April 2015 and October 2017 include murder, imprisonment, torture, rape, enforced disappearances and persecution.

U.N. rights investigators and independent activists have accused government forces of widespread violations and of running a campaign of terror.

Around 400,000 people have fled to neighbouring countries amid the unrest, which has crippled Burundi’s economy.

Charles Nditije, exiled head of Burundi’s opposition platform CNARED, welcomed the ICC’s announcement.

“The good news is that top government officials responsible for crimes against humanity and other atrocities will be prosecuted,” he told Reuters.

“It is a victory for justice in Burundi, it is a victory for those who want the return of peace and rule of law to Burundi.”

Armel Niyongere, a lawyer representing families of victims of the violence, said he would help the investigation.

“The ICC decision is an important victory for the victims of the Burundi regime’s repression. On our side, we will continue to work more closely with the office of ICC prosecutor, until justice is done,” he said.",Burundi rejects war crimes probe but opposition welcomes it,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1DA1SA-OZATP

The Bombardier Q400 turboprop plane with 52 passengers and four crew on board was on route from Belfast City Airport to Inverness when an emergency was declared.

The aircraft circled over the Irish Sea before making the emergency landing and coming to rest with its nose cone on the tarmac at Belfast International Airport. One person was slightly injured.

“Flybe can confirm that one passenger was taken to hospital with a minor hand injury following an incident involving one of our aircraft this afternoon which landed with its nose gear raised at Belfast International Airport,” a spokesman for the airline said.

The airline said it was sending a specialist team to Belfast to “do all we can to understand the cause of this incident”.

Last month, Flybe issued a profit warning, citing higher than expected aircraft maintenance costs, and said it aimed to improved the reliability of the Bombardier Q400 in particular.

The airline is handing back six Q400 jets this year, part of a strategy to shrink its fleet. By next March, it will be operating 54 Q400s, over two-thirds of its fleet total.

Bombardier were not immediately available for comment.

The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation across the Group of 20 Economies (G20),

is expected to announce in coming weeks a switch in focus from insurers’ size to their activities when deciding whether to subject them to increased regulatory scrutiny, said the source, who requested anonymity because the matter has not been made public.

Companies singled out for such scrutiny are required to hold extra capital to cover potential losses, increasing overall business costs and potentially reducing shareholder returns.

The insurance industry has been lobbying for years for regulators to move to the activities-based approach, arguing that their huge size should not automatically qualify them as systemically risky and on the hook for onerous bank-like capital rules.

The shift in the FSB’s approach to designating globally systemically important insurers, or GSIIs, follows pressure from the U.S. Treasury Department, which has been pushing the FSB to ease up on insurers and asset managers, the source said.

A spokesman for the FSB declined to comment.

The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged to overhaul regulations introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and put U.S. interests first when engaging in international bodies such as the FSB and the Basel Committee of banking supervisors.

In September, a group of U.S. regulators - known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council - removed AIG from its domestic list of systemically important insurers, raising questions over whether the FSB would keep AIG on its global list and continue to add new firms.

In a policy report published last month, the U.S. Treasury rejected the idea of singling out specific asset management and insurance firms as systemically risky and criticized the FSB for mission-creep and a lack of transparency.

The U.S. Treasury is shortly due to release a policy report on the FSOC designation process and powers, which critics including regulatory experts and insurers have said are too opaque and unaccountable.

AIG BAILOUT

AIG helped spark the global financial crisis, and the labeling of major financial institutions as systemically important stems largely from its $182 billion U.S. government-led rescue in September 2008. The bailout came just before the company would have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection amid mounting losses on its derivatives book.

Worried the insurance giant was “too big to fail,” the government stepped in to prevent further chaos to the financial system. The company ultimately repaid taxpayers in full by the end of 2012, with a profit of $22.7 billion, according to AIG.

Since then, regulators have primarily focused on the size of a company’s overall assets when assessing the risk they pose to the global financial system.

Moving to an activities-based approach could see firms on the list that largely engage in traditional insurance activities removed, but other non-designated insurers that use their cash to invest in risky assets, or which deploy high levels of leverage, added.

The suspension of the 2017 review means the 2016 list of nine GSIIs - which also includes MetLife Inc (MET.N), Allianz SE (ALVG.DE) and Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (601318.SS) - will continue to stand for at least the next 12 months until the FSB has completed an assessment based on the new methodology, the source said.",Exclusive: Global regulators to ditch 'too big to fail' gauge for insurers - source,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-global-financial-insurers-exclusive/exclusive-global-regulators-to-ditch-too-big-to-fail-gauge-for-insurers-source-idUKKBN1DA2KR?il=0

What does surprise lobbyists, however, is the sheer number of wins in getting the Trump administration to roll back or delay unfavorable regulations in its first 10 months. And it is occurring despite White House dysfunction and distraction.

The lobbyists say it is a stark departure from the approach of the Obama administration, which had a reputation for aloofness toward business and sought to limit the influence of lobbyists, whom it saw as beholden to special interests. The Trump White House is listening to them, they say. It is returning their phone calls. And it is working to eliminate regulations they view as detrimental to the ability to prosper.

When 15 lobbyists and business leaders recently held talks with Trump administration officials on energy infrastructure and climate change, they were surprised by the officials' opening question: ""Do you have a regulation that we could put on a list to try to eliminate? Is there something that is impeding you from growing?""

In that moment, one of the lobbyists at the meeting knew it was a new era. “That as an opening was not the way the Obama administration approached meetings,” she said.

“It’s night and day,” between the Trump and Obama administrations, said James Thurber, a professor in the public affairs school at American University, who studies lobbying and its effects.

Trump promised to “drain the swamp,” an oath that came with plans to curb lobbying and end a “culture of corruption.” The campaign stump speech line had a populist appeal, but one person’s swamp dweller is another’s job creator.

Some of the 16 lobbyists spanning nine different industries interviewed by Reuters acknowledged that many people view them as part of the problem in Washington, not the solution, and that their growing influence may be seen by those as a negative.

Spending so far this year on lobbyists is on pace to exceed spending in 2016, according to the OpenSecrets website, with $2.43 billion spent over the first nine months compared to $2.38 billion at the same point in 2016.

After taking office in January, Trump quickly made it easier to get into the White House.

He reversed President Barack Obama’s restrictions that sought to keep lobbyists at bay by physically barring many of them from the White House - a rule that critics said did nothing more than move meetings with lobbyists to coffee shops across the street. And Trump has stopped the public disclosure of White House visitors’ logs, so now lobbyists come and go with less concern that their presence at the White House will be scrutinized.

Most lobbyists refused to speak on the record because they did not want to reveal anything about their private discussions with the administration. Lobbyists are also acutely aware that anything they say will be used by critics who think Trump has tilted too much toward corporate interests.

The White House did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this article.

The coal, steel, oil and gas industries are some of the clear winners, with easier access to the Trump administration and more deregulation of their industries, said Stan Veuger, a fellow at the conservative thinktank American Enterprise Institute who studies politics and the economy.

That business has been given more access and even more control of certain regulatory issues is “fair criticism and praise if you want to call it that,” said Veuger.

There are big losers, too. Consumer advocacy and environmental groups warning about the perils of climate change, who enjoyed easy access to the Obama White House, have largely been shut out of a Trump White House that is more skeptical of climate change and believes Obama over-reached with some of his measures to protect consumers.

SOME WINS

It was no secret that Trump wanted to greenlight the Dakota Access Pipeline to move oil from North Dakota to Illinois despite the fierce opposition of environmentalists and American Indian tribes whose land was being used. He spoke about it frequently during the campaign. Then Trump gave the energy industry more than they had hoped for.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents all the large refiners, had asked the administration to speed the permitting process for drilling and building new facilities. When Trump signed his executive order authorizing the pipeline only four days after taking office, he also granted this wish.

A number of business trade groups asked the Trump administration to suspend a rule, created during the Obama years, that would require companies to disclose to the government any communications they have with employees during union disputes. In June, the Trump Labor Department did just that, citing the opposition from business.

Among the other wins for business, the Labor Department delivered on a top priority of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobbying group and Wall Street brokerages when it reversed an Obama-era rule aimed at brokers who recommend inappropriate retirement investments.

The administration also side-stepped the process to repeal regulations by implementing delays and holds on rules.

For instance, in the final months of the Obama administration the Bureau of Land Management created a rule governing methane and waste prevention over the strong objections of groups representing oil and gas companies.

API wrote to Ryan Zinke, Trump’s secretary of the interior, in May asking him to postpone implementation of the rule. The Trump administration announced it would and even cited the lobbyists’ objections as the reason.

Of course, it is not perfect harmony between Trump and business. Dozens of corporate leaders abandoned advisory business councils set up by Trump after he appeared to side with white supremacists following a white nationalist rally in Virginia that resulted in the death of a protester.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has spent the past few weeks ringing alarm bells over Trump’s various positions on the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

And yet, said Neil Bradley, one of the top lobbyists for the chamber, “I have even found in times when we may not see eye to eye with the administration on something, we have cordial, timely discussions that are substantive.”",'Open Sesame:' Lobbyists cheer warmer welcome in Trump White House,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-lobbying/open-sesame-lobbyists-cheer-warmer-welcome-in-trump-white-house-idUSKBN1D714U

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

The government and President Andrzej Duda have been negotiating since July, when Duda unexpectedly vetoed legislation backed by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party to overhaul the Polish court system.

“We’ve reached a preliminary agreement ... I hope that in late November we could discuss the project in parliament,” PiS parliamentary deputy and negotiator Stanislaw Piotrowicz said on Friday.

The proposals vetoed by Duda would have immediately removed all current Supreme Court judges unless they had the approval of the justice minister. Parliament would have gained the right to name most of the National Council of the Judiciary, which would nominate future candidates to preside over the Supreme Court.

By giving parliament effective control over appointing - and sacking - senior judges, the proposals raised alarms in the rest of the European Union, of which Poland is a member. The EU said they undermined the independence of the courts and threatened the rule of law.

The proposed compromise would still give parliament the right to name members of the National Council of the Judiciary, but that would require a three-fifths majority in the lower house of parliament, Piotrowicz said. Opposition parties would gain the right to propose judges, too.

If candidates failed to gain approval, they could be chosen by a simple majority, he said.

The PiS says the judicial system needs to be reformed because the courts are slow, inefficient and steeped in a communist-era mentality.

Duda’s veto of parts of the reforms and his proposed limits on its authority over the court system created a stalemate that could have stalled the party’s plans to reform not just the courts but the media and the electorate system as well.

Statistics Canada on Friday reported a net gain of 35,300 jobs - all of them due to a boost in full-time positions - but added the jobless rate had edged up to 6.3 percent as more people sought work.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 15,000 extra jobs and predicted the unemployment rate would stay at 6.2 percent.

The Bank of Canada, citing the need to remove monetary stimulus as the economy strengthened, raised interest rates in July and September and said it would closely review data before deciding whether to hike again.

Average hourly wages were up 2.4 percent from a year earlier, the strongest year-over-year increase since April 2016.

“Most importantly, we saw a little bit more acceleration in wages ... the labor data does support tighter (monetary) policy at some point next year and perhaps sooner than later,” said Andrew Kelvin, a senior rates strategist at TD Securities.

The Bank of Canada said last week various measures of wage growth remained below their historical averages.

The Canadian dollar quickly rose to C$1.2728 against the greenback, or 78.57 U.S. cents, up from C$1.2829, or 77.95 U.S. cents before the report was released.

Statscan said full-time employment jumped by 88,700 jobs while part-time positions dipped by 53,400.

On a year-over-year basis, employment rose by 308,100, or 1.7 percent, while the six-month average for employment growth was 29,700 jobs, up from 24,300 in September.

Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the Bank of Canada would be “mildly encouraged” by the increase in year-over-year wage growth.

“But I think they need to see more evidence before they can consider raising rates again,” he said in a phone interview.

Separate trade data for September was much gloomier, possibly tempering the central bank’s enthusiasm for a third rate hike in quick succession.

Statscan said the trade deficit remained at C$3.18 billion ($2.50 billion) as imports and exports dropped for a fourth consecutive month.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a shortfall of C$3.00 billion. Since Statscan started compiling trade data in 1946, exports and imports never both declined for four months in a row.

But politics can change quickly: Democrats lost the governors’ races in New Jersey and Virginia in 2009 and took heavy losses in the 2010 congressional midterms, yet Barack Obama won reelection in 2012. Yesterday’s wins may portend Democratic gains in Congress in 2018. But maybe they won’t.

The true implication of the 2017 elections is what they mean for redistricting and electoral reforms in the years to come.

Far more important to future election cycles than any help in prognosticating the public mood one or three years from now is what the results mean for the next round of redistricting that begins in 2021. Although the next redistricting process will not occur for another four years, what happened in elections throughout the country this week will have a significant impact. The governors, state legislators, mayors, and city council members elected this year will play a major role in drawing district lines – and thus setting the course for American democracy.

Under the U.S. Constitution, once a decade states must redraw their legislative lines for Congress, state legislatures, and even local governments like city councils. That task falls in most states to state legislatures and the state’s governor. The legislature will take the data it receives from the 2020 Census and draw district lines for congressional seats and the legislature itself, and the governor will decide whether to approve or veto those maps. City councils often use similar processes for their own lines.

It matters, then, who is charged with the task of drawing those maps. Politicians of both parties engage in extreme partisan gerrymandering, where they draw the lines to help their own political parties and their own electoral interests. The politicians essentially pick their constituents, instead of the other way around.

During the 2011 redistricting, Republicans controlled the majority of statehouses and governor’s mansions. They used that power to entrench their control. That is why, for example, Republicans won 60 of Wisconsin’s 99 state legislative seats in the 2012 election with only 48 percent of the vote. Similar tactics created disproportionately Republican state legislatures and congressional delegations across the country. In Pennsylvania, another swing state, Republicans gerrymandered their way into winning 13 of the state’s 18 congressional seats with only half of the votes cast in 2012. In Southern states such as North Carolina and Texas, Republicans drew districts that limit Democratic seats by minimizing the representation of minorities such as Latinos and African-Americans, which courts have ruled violates the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.

Although it tends not to disempower under-represented minorities, Democrats frequently engage in gerrymandering too: Democrats in Maryland passed a pro-Democratic map that plaintiffs challenged as an unlawful partisan gerrymander. The litigation is still ongoing. City Councils are also not immune from the problem, often drawing the lines for their own elections that favor the incumbents or the party in control.

What yesterday’s elections mean, then, is that Democrats can greatly influence the redistricting process, at least in Virginia. (New Jersey uses an independent redistricting commission.) Democrats can, if they want, draw maps that will favor their side through 2030. Even if the Supreme Court overturns Wisconsin’s gerrymander in a highly-watched case this term, there still will be wiggle room for partisans to skew the maps toward their favor.

Fifty-nine of the nation’s 100 largest cities also held elections in 2017, mostly for mayor and city council. These smaller governmental entities will also engage in redistricting in 2021. Given that many of these positions have four-year terms, those elected this week will still be in office when the actual redistricting process begins.

And it is not just redistricting at stake. State legislatures have the power to enact numerous rules that affect the voting process, such as voter ID requirements or early voting periods. In 2016, Virginia’s Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe restored the voting rights of thousands of felons. This year’s Republican gubernatorial candidate in Virginia, Ed Gillespie, probably would not have done the same had he been in office. Gillespie also supports a strict voter ID requirement, which tends to reduce turnout among groups of voters who skew Democratic such as non-whites and young people. That kind of shaping of the electorate could have a significant impact on who wins Virginia – a key swing state − in the 2020 presidential election.

In New Jersey, Republican Governor Chris Christie vetoed a bill to implement automatic voter registration, in which the government would place eligible voters on the registration rolls, allowing them to opt-out instead of requiring them to opt-in. Automatic voter registration, which began in Oregon and is now sweeping the country, increases turnout. Democrat Phil Murphy’s win in New Jersey means that automatic voter registration will now likely become law – again impacting future elections. Automatic voter registration also might come to Washington state because a Democratic candidate is leading in the vote count from Tuesday in a race that will determine majority control of the state senate.

Of course, deciding who may vote should not be a partisan issue. Independent commissions or other nonpartisan approaches should determine redistricting. It should be easy and convenient for every eligible voter to participate. But that is not the current reality of American politics.

The best way to think about the 2017 elections is to consider them not for what they mean for Donald Trump but how they will determine the rules of elections for a decade or more.

The cash-strapped OPEC nation’s move last week to summon bondholders to debt talks roiled investors, who remain concerned about the government’s ability to restructure amid U.S. sanctions that effectively bar U.S. banks from rolling over the country’s debt into new bonds.

But signs that a delayed $1.2 billion payment due on a bond from state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] was finally being made, plus state electric utility Corpoelec’s declaration that it had made a key coupon payment seemed to bolster investor confidence in the country’s ability to pay - at least for now.

Brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co Inc said in a research note that the utility’s $28 million payment had raised the chances of bondholders getting paid other upcoming bond coupons, while adding: “we think how Monday’s meeting goes will be a more important determinant of whether these coupons will be paid.”

Earlier, Wilmington Trust issued a notice of default for the $650 million bond issued by Electricidad de Caracas, a company known as Corpoelec since its 2007 nationalization.

Corpoelec via Twitter said it had in fact made the coupon payment on Nov. 8 but acknowledged “operational changes” had affected transactions, a nod to U.S. sanctions that have led banks to be more cautious about Venezuelan dealings.

Wilmington Trust did not answer calls seeking comment.

Investors have been on edge since Maduro last week made a confused announcement that he would restructure future debt payments but continue to pay.

Venezuela’s 2022 bond was up 4.950 points to bid 26.950 points, while PDVSA’s 2020 VE151299784= bond was up 5.500 points to bid 78.500.

CREDIT EVENT?

Market optimism was heavily driven by news that settlement agent DTC has told creditors that it has received the principal payment on the PDVSA 2017N bond, which matured last week.

The full payment of $1.169 billion, which includes $1.121 billion in principal and $47 million in interest, was due on Nov. 2. Bondholders contacted on Friday said they still had not received the funds.

Despite Friday’s optimism, prices for credit default swaps - a form of insurance against default known as CDS - have soared in the last week and now reflect a PDVSA default being almost imminent.

A committee of derivatives industry group ISDA will reconvene on Monday to discuss whether PDVSA has triggered a credit event through the late payment of the 2017N, ISDA said on its website on Friday. An affirmative decision would trigger payment on credit default swaps.

Prices have jumped most for the shortest-dated CDS contracts - with the 6-month contract PDVT6MUSAC=MP price leaping more than 10-fold at one point.

The default probability associated with PDVSA’s 6-month contract was 99.86 percent as of Thursday evening, according to data provider Markit, up from around 57 percent in early November.

Doubts remain about how widespread investor participation in Monday’s meeting will be.

U.S.-based creditors are not prohibited from attending the meetings, but are barred from dealings with officials like Vice President Tareck El Aissami, designated by Maduro to lead the talks, even though he is under sanction for alleged drug trafficking.

Venezuela has promised investors that he and other officials under U.S. sanction will not participate in the debt talks, but multiple investors have told Reuters they expect to sit out the Monday talks.

“These stories are true,” he said in a statement emailed to Reuters and other news outlets.

Five women detailed sexual misconduct allegations against the Emmy-winning comedian in a New York Times report published on Thursday, including three women who said he had masturbated in front of them. The allegations dated back 15 years.

C.K. released his statement after his upcoming film “I Love You Daddy” was scrapped for release on Friday, and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) canceled a planned special with the comedian because of the allegations.

Television network FX, a unit of 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O), also severed its ties with C.K.

“He will no longer serve as executive producer or receive compensation on any of the four shows we were producing with him – ‘Better Things,’ ‘Baskets,’ ‘One Mississippi’ and ‘The Cops’,” FX Networks and FX productions said on Friday in an emailed statement.

C.K. said in his statement that he has “been remorseful of my actions. And I’ve tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I’m aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves ” his statement added.

C.K., 50, said he had “spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want. I will now step back and take a long time to listen.” He did not make clear how long he would be stepping back for.

The comedian, best known for his TV comedy series “Louie,” acknowledged he had misused used his power over the women, who were in the early stage of their careers at the time.

Two of the women in the New York Times article, comedians Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov, said C.K. had invited them to his hotel room after a comedy festival in Aspen, Colorado, in 2002 and then masturbated in front of them.

“The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly,” C.K. said, adding that he thought it was ok to show his genitals to women if he asked them first.

“You asked but we never said yes,” Goodman and Wolov tweeted on Friday after his apology.

Netflix said earlier that what it called C.K’s “unprofessional and inappropriate behavior with female colleagues” had led the streaming service to decide not to produce a planned second stand-up special with him.

Film distributor The Orchard said it would not be moving forward with the release next week of “I Love You, Daddy.” The movie was written and directed by C.K. and he also appears in the film as the father of a 17-year-old girl who has a romance with a 68-year-old filmmaker.

Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) HBO said on Thursday that C.K.’s past projects with the network, including 2006’s “Lucky Louie” series, would be removed from its on-demand services and that the comedian would no longer participate in its Nov. 18 televised “Night of Too Many Stars: America Unites for Autism Programs.”","Comedian Louis C.K. admits sexual misconduct, entertainment outlets cut ties",https://www.reuters.com/article/people-louis-ck/comedian-louis-c-k-admits-sexual-misconduct-entertainment-outlets-cut-ties-idINKBN1D9364?il=0

France became the first Western country to indicate that Saudi Arabia was holding Hariri against his will, saying it wished for him to have “all his freedom of movement and be fully able to play the essential role that is his in Lebanon”.

Hariri’s resignation has plunged Lebanon into crisis, thrusting the small Arab country back to the forefront of regional rivalry between the Sunni Muslim monarchy Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite revolutionary Iran.

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, said Saudi Arabia’s detention of Hariri, a long-time Saudi ally who declared his resignation while in Riyadh last Saturday, was an insult to all Lebanese and he must return to Lebanon.

“Let us say things as they are: the man is detained in Saudi Arabia and forbidden until this moment from returning to Lebanon,” Nasrallah said in a televised speech.

“It is clear that Saudi Arabia and Saudi officials have declared war on Lebanon and on Hezbollah in Lebanon,” he said.

His comments mirror an accusation by Riyadh on Monday that Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war on the conservative Gulf Arab kingdom.

Riyadh says Hariri is a free man and he decided to resign because Hezbollah was calling the shots in his government. Saudi Arabia considers Hezbollah to be its enemy in conflicts across the Middle East, including Syria and Yemen.

Western countries have looked on with alarm at the rising regional tension.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned other countries and groups against using Lebanon as vehicle for a larger proxy fight in the Middle East, saying Washington strongly backed Lebanon’s independence and respected Hariri as a strong partner of the United States, still referring to him as prime minister.

“There is no legitimate place or role in Lebanon for any foreign forces, militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the Lebanese state,” Tillerson said in a statement released by the U.S. State Department.

Tillerson told reporters on Friday there was no indication that Hariri was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will but that the United States was monitoring the situation.

The French foreign minister said earlier on Friday that he also believed Hariri was a free man - a statement at odds with the later French foreign ministry comment that it wanted Hariri to have “all his freedom of movement”.

Hariri has made no public remarks since announcing his resignation in a speech televised from Saudi Arabia, saying he feared assassination and accusing Iran and Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world.

Two top Lebanese government officials, a senior politician close to Hariri and a fourth source told Reuters on Thursday that the Lebanese authorities believe Hariri is being held in Saudi Arabia.

Nasrallah said Saudi Arabia was encouraging Israel to attack Lebanon. While an Israeli attack could not be ruled out entirely, he said, it was unlikely partly because Israel knew it would pay a very high price. “I warn them against any miscalculation or any step to exploit the situation,” he said.

“Saudi will fail in Lebanon as it has failed on all fronts,” Nasrallah said.

Riyadh has advised Saudi citizens not to travel to Lebanon, or if already there to leave as soon as possible. Other Gulf states have also issued travel warnings. Those steps have raised concern that Riyadh could take measures against the tiny Arab state, which hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees.

Hariri’s resignation is being widely seen as part of a Saudi attempt to counter Iran as its influence deepens in Syria and Iraq and as Riyadh and its allies battle Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Hariri’s resignation unraveled a political deal among rival factions that made him prime minister and President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, head of state last year.

The coalition government included Hezbollah, a heavily armed military and political organization.

STUCK BETWEEN “ANTAGONISTIC INTERESTS”

Aoun told Saudi Arabia’s envoy on Friday that Hariri must return to Lebanon and the circumstances surrounding his resignation as prime minister while in Saudi Arabia were unacceptable, presidential sources said.

An “international support group” of countries concerned about Lebanon, which includes the United States, Russia and France, appealed for Lebanon “to continue to be shielded from tensions in the region”. In a statement, they also welcomed Aoun’s call for Hariri to return.

In comments to Reuters, top Lebanese Druze politician Jumblatt said Lebanon did not deserve to be accused of declaring war on Saudi Arabia. “For decades we’ve been friends,” he said.

“We are a country that is squeezed between two antagonistic interests, between Saudi Arabia and Iran,” he said. “The majority of Lebanese are just paying the price ... Lebanon can not afford to declare a war against anybody.”

The Saudi foreign minister accused Hezbollah of a role in the launching of a ballistic missile at Riyadh from Yemen on Saturday. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen was an act of “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

Nasrallah mocked the Saudi accusation that Iran and Hezbollah were behind the firing of the missile from Yemen, saying Yemenis were capable of building their own missiles.",Hezbollah says Saudi declares Lebanon war with Hariri detention,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-politics/hezbollah-says-saudi-declares-lebanon-war-with-hariri-detention-idUSKBN1DA1J2

A dispute over iPhone royalties left the U.S. chipmaker vulnerable to an opportunistic offer from its acquisitive rival. Settling could preserve Qualcomm’s independence – but it all depends on whether Apple thinks a bigger Broadcom would be slavishly devoted to the handset maker, or just surlier.

Qualcomm and Apple came to blows over royalties the chipmaker collects on mobile gadgets, most of which use its technologies. The actual payments aren’t disclosed, but analysts generally peg them at about $10 per phone. When Apple filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm and told its suppliers to stop paying these fees earlier this year, it helped push Qualcomm’s share price down by $10 per share, in subsequent months, to the $54.84 at which it traded last Thursday, the day before Broadcom’s interest was reported.

Settling might make the $70-per-share bid less compelling. Analysts project Apple should sell around 250 million phones next year. If it agreed a lower rate of, say, $7.50 per phone, with a post-tax margin of 85 percent, that would yield almost $1.6 billion in profit. Put this on a multiple of 10, and that’s worth about $16 billion – or roughly $11 per share. And that’s before any catch-up payments for previously withheld sums that Qualcomm might be able to claw back.

Should Apple play along? It depends who the $905 billion smartphone maker thinks is a more malleable counterpart. Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan is open to renegotiating the Qualcomm contract should it prevail, according to people familiar with its thinking. The promise of $3 billion in annual cost savings from the merger more than defrays the opportunity cost of giving Apple a good deal. Winning the good graces of boss Tim Cook might also result in additional chip sales to the tech giant.

Whatever Tan says, though, his priority is likely to be maximizing the returns on his new acquisition. A big motivation for acquiring rivals is usually gaining heft over customers, and Broadcom already derives over 10 percent of its revenue from Apple. Furthermore, the lengthy antitrust process for a Broadcom-Qualcomm merger means it might be a year before Tan could negotiate properly anyway.

WADA said it was confident the file acquired by its Investigations and Intelligence department is the Moscow anti-doping laboratory’s testing data from January 2012-August 2015.

Despite repeated calls for Russia to cooperate with international bodies to stamp out doping, Russian authorities have always denied the state’s role in the scandal.

WADA said it was finalizing the forensic analysis of the enormous backup file and expected to provide more information at its executive committee and foundation board meetings in Seoul on Nov. 15-16.

The doping agency said it had briefed the International Olympic Committee’s Schmid and Oswald Commissions, which are conducting investigations into Russian doping.

The new information could be a damaging blow to Russia’s chances of competing at February’s Pyeongchang Winter Games.

The IOC has said it will decide at its executive board meeting from Dec. 5-7 on the participation of Russian competitors in Pyeongchang.

Last year, a WADA commissioned report by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren found that more than 1,000 Russian competitors in more than 30 sports were involved in a conspiracy to conceal positive drug tests over a period of five years.

Investigations also uncovered sample tampering at the Sochi Olympics, including the switching of samples through a hole in the laboratory wall.

Russia escaped a blanket ban at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro although it was, and remains, barred from competing in international athletics events.

The country’s Paralympic Committee and anti-doping agency RUSADA are also still suspended over the doping scandals.

NEW INTELLIGENCE

WADA said its independent Compliance Review Committee on Friday was considering the new intelligence, which will shape the recommendation it intends to make to the foundation board on whether to declare RUSADA compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code.

”WADA continues to stand firmly behind the outcomes of the Agency’s independent McLaren Investigation,” WADA president Craig Reedie said in a statement.

“This new intelligence serves to reinforce our requirement of Russian authorities that they too publicly accept the outcomes; so that, we can all move forward in rebuilding public trust and confidence in Russian sport.”

One of the conditions placed on Russia before it could be rule compliant was that authorities responsible for the country’s anti-doping program, including the Ministry of Sport and the National Olympic Committee, publicly accept the outcomes of the McLaren Investigation, which uncovered widespread state-sponsored doping at the Sochi Olympics.

But in recent days Russian officials have pushed back on doping allegations, arguing that they have been politically motivated.

According to a draft of the final statement seen by Reuters and due to be released on Saturday in Vietnam, the 11 countries committed to “the core elements” of a deal while making clear more work remains.

Moving ahead with TPP would be a boost for the principle of multilateral trade agreements after U.S. President Donald Trump ditched it this year in favor of an “America First” policy that he reiterated at an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam.

Any kind of TPP deal looked in doubt earlier in the week after officials said Vietnam’s chief negotiator had walked out of one round of talks and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau then skipped a leaders’ meeting on the pact.

Negotiators returned to the table on Friday and agreed on some basics of what they called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).

Partly to counter China’s growing dominance in Asia, Japan had been lobbying hard for the TPP pact, which aims to eliminate tariffs on industrial and farm products across the 11-nation bloc whose trade totalled $356 billion last year.

The final statement said a “limited set of provisions” from the original deal would be suspended, adding further technical work was needed on four areas that still needed consensus “to prepare finalised text for signature”.

It did not say when that might happen.

“There is a lot of work left to be done but I think we have made good progress today,” Canadian Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told reporters in Vietnam late on Friday.

Canada, which has the second biggest economy among remaining TPP countries after Japan, had said it wanted to ensure an agreement that would protect jobs.

Champagne, who blamed “a misunderstanding about the schedule” for Trudeau’s absence, specifically mentioned the auto sector and cultural protection as areas needing more work.

Speaking separately, a Canadian official said the nations had “agreed to a framework towards the deal” with work programs to handle various outstanding issues.

As well as the cuts to tariffs, the TPP agreement has provisions for protecting the environment, workers’ rights and intellectual property - one of the major sticking points after the departure of the United States.

Canada’s position has been further complicated by the fact that it is simultaneously renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with the Trump administration.

At a speech in Danang, Trump set out a strong message making clear he was only interested in bilateral deals in Asia which would never put the United States at a disadvantage.

China’s President Xi Jinping, meanwhile, used the same forum to stress multilateralism and said globalization was an irreversible trend.

APEC, whose leaders hold their full summit on Saturday, has itself been buffeted by the changes under Trump.

Talks between trade and foreign ministers from the group failed to reach agreement on their usual joint statement in the face of U.S. demands to remove language about supporting free trade and fighting protectionism.","TPP countries agree to keep trade deal alive, much work remains",https://www.reuters.com/article/apec-summit/tpp-countries-agree-to-keep-trade-deal-alive-much-work-remains-idINKBN1DA2PP

The move, announced on Friday by vice finance minister Zhu Guangyao, comes a day after U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated calls for better access to Chinese markets in meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Xi is driving broad economic reforms by opening up China’s capital markets, internationalizing the yuan currency, and seeking technical know-how through the pursuit of massive inbound and outbound investments.

The latest changes include raising the limit on foreign ownership in joint-venture firms involved in the futures, securities and funds markets to 51 percent from the current 49 percent.

They will take effect immediately following the drafting of specific related rules, Zhu told a news conference, adding China is “formulating a timetable and roadmap for financial sector reform and opening up”.

The foreign business community gave a cautious welcome to the news.

“Financial services further opening definitely has been high on our list,” said Ken Jarrett, President of American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.

“It’s a step in the right direction. We’ll have to see the detailed rules. In China you always have to pay attention to the fine print to see how quickly it moves, but to finally ease up on the cap is something that is welcome.”

The plan to ease ownership restrictions comes as Beijing faces mounting pressure from Western governments and business lobbies to remove investment barriers and onerous regulations that restrict overseas companies’ operations in its markets.

During his trip to Beijing this week, Trump said that trade between the two nations was unfair, and called for greater market access for U.S. companies.

“We really have to look at access, forced technology transfer, and the theft of intellectual property, which just, by and of itself, is costing the United States and its companies at least $300 billion a year,” Trump said.

“Both the United States and China will have a more prosperous future if we can achieve a level economic playing field. Right now, unfortunately, it is a very one-sided and unfair one.”

CHANNELING FOREIGN MONEY

Reuters reported on Tuesday that China planned to allow global banks to take a stake of up to 51 percent in their onshore securities ventures for the first time and tie up with local non-financial firms.

China has been sluggish to give foreign players more access to its financial sector, but has promised to quicken the pace as foreign investment into Asia’s economic powerhouse slows.

It has implemented strict capital controls to contain capital outflows, while opening up new channels for foreign money to come into the domestic markets.

Foreign financial firms are still small players in the financial sector, and the sheer size of the market is a big lure for overseas players.

Western investment banks operating through joint ventures with local partners in China have struggled to make much headway in the last decade, with many of them loss-making as they struggle to win business against much larger local rivals. A Reuters survey of data from China’s Securities Association in 2014 found that the average sino-foreign JV lost 21 million yuan a year over the prior 10 years.

However, several have said they would be keen to invest more in China and do more broking and investment banking if they had full control over their joint ventures.

UBS (UBSG.S), which holds a 25 percent interest in domestic firm UBS Securities Co Ltd, said the changes on Friday were an important step in further opening up China’s financial sector.

“China is a key market for UBS and, as indicated previously, we continue to work towards increasing our stake in UBS Securities Co Ltd”, said Eugene Qian, Chairman of UBS China Strategy Board and a member of the Asia Pacific Executive Committee.

Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which earlier this year increased its stake in joint venture Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities from 33 percent to the then upper limit of 49 percent, said the reforms would create new momentum for the finance industry in China.

“Morgan Stanley is committed to growing our businesses in China,” said a spokesman for the firm.

TOO LITTLE TOO LATE?

Some industry watchers said the changes are too little too late.

“This looks good, but in reality it is pretty small and it is too late,” said Keith Pogson, head of the Asia financial services team at EY.

“If you are an international investment bank, you will be there for the sake of your global franchise and having it as part of your network, not because you think you will make much money in China.”

All the same, markets reacted positively to the news, with insurers and futures-related firms rallying strongly.

New China Life Insurance (601336.SS) jumped nearly 6 percent after the announcement, while Ping An Insurance (2318.HK) (601318.SS) advanced more than 4 percent and China Pacific Insurance Group (601601.SS) rose over 3 percent.

China will drop foreign ownership restrictions on local banks and asset management companies, Zhu said.

Full foreign ownership of local firms involved in the futures, securities and funds markets will not be permitted until after three years, while full overseas ownership of insurance firms will be allowed only after five years.

1/DELEVERAGING DISCOMFORT China's market participants are having a hard time deciding if the government's intent to redouble efforts to deleverage the economy are good for stock prices. The stock market .SSEC has been volatile since the 19th Communist Party congress in mid-October, particularly after China's central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said authorities will do their best to fend off risks from excessive optimism that could lead to a ""Minsky Moment"", while other policymakers pledged to strengthen financial regulation.

Government bond yields have risen on expectation lending markets will remain tight. But the worst fears about the deleveraging exercise seem to be abating. This week, the blue-chip index has hit two-year highs, while stock funds are selling faster and margin lending in the stock markets is at levels last seen in early 2016. The newly formed Financial Stability and Development Committee has pledged to prevent instability, and the securities regulator is sending signals it is going to be tough and rigorous in approving new share offerings.

The CSI’s banking sub-index is still hurting but the healthcare index, a barometer of economic and financial optimism, is at record highs. In contrast, start-up board ChiNext .CHINEXTP once the darling of local investors and a hotbed for speculation, is on the decline.

2/ RAW POWER

U.S. stocks are striking record highs on a weekly, if not daily, basis of late as a nearly nine-year bull market grinds ever onward even as Congress and the Trump administration struggle to deliver their long-promised tax reform. It prompts analysts, economists, investors and other market observers to repeatedly ask: When is the correction coming?

One popular indicator, devised by Ed Yardeni at Yardeni Research, does not suggest a turn around in equities is at all imminent. Yardeni’s ‘Boom-Bust Barometer’ divides the CRB industrial raw materials spot index by the four-week moving average of U.S. first-time claims for unemployment benefits.

Its premise is that if industrial raw materials prices are rising - which on balance they have been - and the U.S. job market is stable or strengthening - which it is - then the outlook for growth and equities is constructive. When the S&P 500 is overlaid, it appears that Yardeni’s ‘BBB’ is a reliable coincidental indicator for U.S. equities.

The brief dive in the BBB in September and October was largely do to the short-lived jump in jobless benefits claims caused by hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Claims have since dropped back to recent trend and the BBB has recovered.

3/ JUNK IN THE YARD

Nervous traders fretting about how long the bull market can carry on and what might spark the long-awaited correction would do worse than keep their other eye on high yield, or “junk”, bonds. The rally they’ve been on this year puts the stock market charge in the shade, and by some measures they are the most expensive assets in the world right now. A selloff here could ripple quickly and deeply across all markets. The first signs of these tremors were felt this week. Global high yield bonds had their biggest fall since March on Thursday, and European junk bonds their biggest fall in a year. Outflows from high yield bond funds stand at $1.8 billion in just two weeks, according to Lipper, and are the highest in two months, according to EPFR. No surprise that Wall Street and other major stock markets wobbled. There’s precedence too - the 20 percent market correction in 2015-16 was in large part sparked by the collapse of the junk bond market. Will history repeat itself?

4/SHIFTING SANDS

Markets will be watching the fast-moving developments in the Middle East where Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince in midst of a major consolidation of his power and Lebanon has been thrown into turmoil again by the surprise resignation of its Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri.

Local stock markets have the dollar-bonds of many Gulf and Middle Eastern states have been left at either record or multi-year lows and traders will now be on alert for any sign that these countries currency pegs are a risk of being abandoned.

Lebanese officials have said they believe Hariri is being held in Saudi Arabia, while Riyadh and other Gulf countries have warned their citizens against travel to Lebanon, sparking speculation Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince may be sizing up a strike at Hezbollah.

Meanwhile Saudi intercepting a ballistic missile that it said was fired toward Riyadh by the Iran-allied Houthi militia controlling large parts of neighbouring Yemen has added to the tension.

5/ CURVE CONTROL

Along with stubbornly low volatility and productivity, one of the conundrums dominating economic and market debate recently is the flatness of bond yield curves. The U.S. curve, in particular, is subject of much debate. It’s the flattest in over a decade and dragging other yield curves around the world down with it.

Is this the traditional signal that slowing growth is just around the corner, or are other forces keeping longer-dated yields down? What is clear is, for whatever reason, demand for long-dated bonds is pretty strong. The euro zone bond market faces its first major test since the ECB announced it will gradually begin pulling back its extraordinary stimulus, with 25-30 billion euros of bond supply next week.

Demand at these auctions will give us an indication of whether the bond market can ride the storm of lower policy support. Spain’s auction of 50-year bonds on Thursday will be closely scrutinized.

Europe’s largest automaker is already the subject of a probe by the BaFin watchdog over suspected insider trading related to its “Dieselgate” scandal, and an investigation by Braunschweig prosecutors over suspected market manipulation.

Earlier this week, a German court also ruled an independent auditor should be appointed to investigate Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) cheating of U.S. diesel engine tests, boosting investors’ hopes for compensation.

On Friday, German magazine Der Spiegel reported that Volkswagen’s (VW) CEO at the time, Martin Winterkorn, informed then-Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt and the head of Germany’s KBA motor vehicle watchdog on Sept. 21, 2015, about the extent of the carmaker’s cheating.

But VW did not make public until Sept. 22, 2015, that about 11 million cars worldwide were fitted with emissions-cheating software and that it would set aside billions of euros to cover the potential cost of the scandal.

“We are looking at this process with a view to a potentially unauthorized disclosure of inside information,” a spokesman for BaFin said, confirming the Der Spiegel report.

VW declined to comment on the latest BaFin investigation, but reiterated its view that its management board “duly fulfilled” its obligations regarding capital market disclosure rules.

Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, which bled support to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the Sept. 24 election, are trying to forge a coalition government with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the environmentalist Greens.

The chiefs of the parties huddled on Friday evening to review progress in the talks thus far, but planned no statements.

They had initially hoped to agree on the outlines of a coalition deal by Friday after the two smaller parties dropped demands this week on tax and climate policy, but later decided to meet again on Sunday before a final push by full delegations for an outline deal next week.

Still, the overall tone was more upbeat than at the end of the previous week.

“We’re heading into the home stretch,” Horst Seehofer, head of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), told reporters.

Seehofer and FDP leader Christian Lindner said they were optimistic that the exploratory talks could be wrapped up next week, paving the way for weeks of detailed negotiations about the exact terms of a coalition contract.

But Michael Kellner, a top negotiator for the Greens, demanded more compromises from the other parties.

GIVING GROUND

The FDP this week gave ground by agreeing to accept more modest income tax cuts than a campaign pledge of 30-40 billion euros ($35-46 billion) of relief.

In an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel on Friday, Lindner also signaled a readiness to compromise on the euro zone’s European Stability Mechanism, moving away from a campaign pledge to shut down the rescue fund.

The Greens for their part dropped their insistence on fixed dates for shutting down coal-fired power stations and banning cars with internal combustion engines.

But the parties remain divided on whether or not to push for a euro zone budget, on Europe’s banking union and on the use of drones in military conflicts, as well as German participation in foreign military missions, according to draft papers seen by Reuters.

They must also agree how to meet key targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, how to deal with the pollution caused by diesel cars already on the road, and whether to introduce a law that would ease tax rates for venture capital projects.

If the parties fail to reach agreement, Germany could be forced into a new election that could unsettle investors at a time when many in the European Union are looking to Europe’s biggest economic power for leadership on issues ranging from euro zone governance to transatlantic relations.

Merkel, seeking a fourth term as chancellor, hopes to reach agreement in the exploratory talks by Nov. 16.

She plans to take the broad outlines of what is agreed to key conservative party leaders in five meetings the following weekend, the CDU said.",German parties see momentum in coalition talks despite lingering divisions,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-politics/german-parties-see-momentum-in-coalition-talks-despite-lingering-divisions-idUKKBN1DA2Q3

When a resident organized a beach clean-up that collected 33 tons of rubbish in a single summer, British-Ethiopian safari organizer Ben Morrison decided he couldn’t stand by while his beloved island was ruined.

So the tall, bearded 42-year-old decided to try to design a traditional dhow, or sailing boat, from recycled plastic, offering a market to recyclers and persuading locals to conserve shrinking woodland.

“It is getting harder and harder for boat builders to find wood. I hope that this project will allow the ancient skills of boat building to live on, by shifting from ever-scarce wood to plastic,” Morrison told Reuters.

Plastic pollution is a growing global problem, with patches of sea larger than some countries covered in plastic soup that strangles or poisons wildlife. The U.N. says by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish unless drastic action is taken.

In August, Kenya introduced one of the world’s toughest bans on plastic bags mandating four years in prison or a fine of $40,000 for even using one.

The East African country is now contemplating measures to control plastic bottles, said John Konchellah, chairman of the National Environment Management Authority.

“We want to see plastic bottles out of circulation,” he told Reuters. “We want to borrow some technology from the region like PETCO in South Africa, where major manufacturers came together with a body that recycles plastic bottles.”

Petco is a company formed by the South African plastics industry to recycle some types of plastic.

Morrison, working with eight expert Kenyan boat builders, is using plastic planks from the fledgling local recycling industry to build his boat, which he hopes to sail to Cape Town in South Africa.

“We struggle to produce a consistent material out of the recycled plastic,” he said. “It’s not easy. Sometimes we receive plastic planks from the factory that are full of air bubbles. We can’t build with them and so we have to start from the beginning again.”

Ali Skanda, a 44-year-old master boat builder, said in his childhood there was no litter on Lamu’s sandy golden beaches - just fishermen, dhows and donkeys. Now many donkeys are dying from eating plastic, he said - and so are turtles, cows and other animals.

“At the beginning I thought it was a crazy idea. How could I build a boat out of plastic?” he asked. “Some people have been asking what we can do about this problem. There is so much plastic scattered. This is something we can do.”",Kenya craftsmen to build boat out of plastic waste,https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKBN1DA237

Trump pressionou Pequim a fazer mais para conter as ambições nucleares norte-coreanas e disse que o comércio bilateral tem sido injusto com os EUA, mas também louvou a promessa do líder chinês, Xi Jinping, de que a China será mais aberta a empresas estrangeiras.

Horas depois de Trump deixar a capital chinesa nesta sexta-feira, a China disse que anulará os limites para a propriedade estrangeira de bancos locais e de empresas de administração de bens, além de afrouxar as restrições à posse de ações de firmas de bens financeiros e seguradoras -- medidas esperadas há tempos por companhias financeiras estrangeiras.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

After a dismal quarter that wiped out another one-fifth of Snap’s market value in after-hours trading on Tuesday, it’s no wonder the company revealed Tencent’s enlarged stake. It didn’t have to, as Snap made perfectly clear in documents submitted to regulators. Its multi-class share structure, which is so abysmal it has inspired stock-index creators to reject the company from inclusion, excuses it from having to notify investors of any changes.

Getting revenge on throngs of short-sellers can’t have been the only reason. It’s also helpful for Snap to let rivals like Facebook know it has a new deep-pocketed backer. Worth some $469 billion, Tencent is a more formidable force than Snap, whose shares are trading below the price at which they debuted in March. Snap also said it “looks forward to sharing ideas and experiences” with the Shenzhen-based company, which has found creative ways with payments and games to keep nearly one billion users glued to WeChat.

Tencent has been slowly striking U.S. allegiances, including with Tesla, as it plots global expansion.

The airline in September canceled 20,000 flights, saying rostering problems had left it without enough standby pilots to operate without significant delays. The resulting wave of passenger outrage threatened to undo the success of its ‘Always Getting Better’ customer service drive.

Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers has responded by promising pilots improved pay and conditions, which it says exceed those offered by rivals.

In the memo, Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said almost 20 of Ryanair’s 86 bases had voted for the pay deal as of Friday. However, a number of bases, including its largest hub at London Stansted, have rejected the offer.

Some pilots have been using September’s rostering issue to press for better conditions and the creation of a pan-European representative body; Ryanair has long opposed recognizing unions.

Ryanair said in the memo sent on Friday that it would “dramatically increase” the number of pilots employed directly rather than by outside agencies; over 180 first officers would be offered Ryanair contracts in November, and 300 more offers would be made by December.

It also said it had hired 1,040 new pilots this year, with the newest entrants receiving the better pay terms, and that it expected another 400 to join by March, bringing its crewing ratio to 11.0 pilots per aircraft from 10.5 by the time the busy European summer schedule begins.

A new crew control mobile phone app has also been introduced to speed up the logging of absences, and the memo says Ryanair will double the number of base managers to eight in the weeks ahead to “respond even faster to even more pilot queries”.

“We have launched an Always Flying Better (AFB) program to fill the infrastructure gaps in pilot communications, admin support and effective structures for resolving pilot queries,” Wilson said.

Wilson also said a problem with allocated leave for December had caused inconvenience to a small number of pilots.

Some pilots have said that a significant number of their colleagues have reported being assigned annual leave days without consultation.

Raila Odinga boycotted the Oct. 25 election because he said it would be unfair, leaving President Uhuru Kenyatta to win with 98 percent of the vote. The Supreme Court called the poll after it annulled a first presidential election held in August on procedural grounds.

“Mainstream Kenyans feel so deeply cheated they are openly toying with the idea of secession,” Odinga told an audience in Washington, D.C.

His speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank, was broadcast live on Kenyan television.

“The biggest problem in Kenya right now is exclusion ... unless they (the problems) are addressed they will tear the country apart,” he said. ​“As things stand now, anger and radicalization is growing by the day.”

A small number of politicians in Odinga’s opposition alliance have discussed the idea of his strongholds seceding from Kenya but the idea has not gained wide popularity.

Odinga’s supporter base is concentrated along Kenya’s coast, in city slums and in his western strongholds, areas that have traditionally felt excluded from political power and the opportunities for patronage it offers.

Odinga’s supporters are currently boycotting three companies they say are backing the government. The opposition has called for protests on Friday.

In his speech, Odinga noted Kenya’s four presidents since independence had all come from the Kikuyu or Kalenjin communities, even though the country had 44 recognized ethnic groups. Kenyatta is a Kikuyu and his deputy, who has made clear his intention to run in the next election, is a Kalenjin.

Earlier this week, Odinga told Reuters he wanted a caretaker government for six months while preparations were made for new elections.

Government officials reject the idea, saying Odinga had his chance to compete in October.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

Active disease was observed in 23.5 percent of RTH258 patients versus 33.5 percent of Eylea patients at 16 weeks, Novartis said, of its investigational treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), where abnormal, leaky blood vessels can cause blindness.

A second, similar study found active disease in 21.9 percent of RTH258 patients versus 31.4 percent of those on Eylea for the condition affecting 20-25 million people worldwide.

Novartis in June touted initial data showing its drug may require fewer injections directly into the eye than Eylea, while matching it on vision and safety measures.

The Basel-based drugmaker hopes this latest analysis lends RTH258 additional muscle when matched head-to-head with Eylea as well as Lucentis, which Roche sells in the United States.

“When you take all of that together ... we believe we have a very compelling proposition,” Vas Narasimhan, Novartis’s chief drug developer who will become CEO in 2018, said on a conference call.

Novartis, which released the data at the American Academy of Opthalmology conference in New Orleans, predicts RTH258 annual sales will top $1 billion and aims to file for U.S. approval in late 2018.

Making it a success is by no means clear sailing.

For one, Novartis owns Lucentis rights in Europe where it has contractual obligations to continue marketing that drug. Analysts say cannibalization from RTH258 will be a challenge.

Competition abounds, too: Eylea, with $5 billion in annual sales, has made inroads against the $3.2 billion-per-year Lucentis, whose 2020 U.S. patent expiration will expose it to cheaper copies.

Moreover, Roche’s cancer drug Avastin is effective in off-label AMD use and has won favor because it costs a fraction of Lucentis and Eylea. In Britain, Novartis and Bayer are fighting doctor groups aiming to switch to Avastin.

NEEDLE IN THE EYE

Other would-be rivals are racing to market, too.

Allergan, whose investigational Abicipar is in Phase III trials, is also trumpeting prospects of reduced injections compared to Lucentis. Gene therapies may also be on the distant horizon.

Still, Novartis’s Narasimhan remains optimistic for RTH258’s reception when it hits the market, likely in 2019.

“When you actually see an image of a patient having a needle inserted into their eye, this is something patients definitely want to avoid,” he said.

“Retinal surgeons have busy offices and want to do more complex retinal surgery. Today, they have offices filled with patients waiting for injections.”",Novartis posts eye drug data amid play for Eylea's turf,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-novartis-eye-drug-bayer/novartis-posts-eye-drug-data-amid-play-for-eyleas-turf-idUKKBN1DA2Y4

Ma per rendere possibile l‘abbandono anticipato del carbone, che costerà circa 3,8-4 miliardi di euro, occorre realizzare una serie di infrastrutture - gasdotti ed elettrodotti - che assicurino la sicurezza energetica.

Per questo, ha avvertito il ministro dello Sviluppo Economico Carlo Calenda, occorre che “Regioni e Comuni” non facciano ricorsi contro le singole opere, perché altrimenti si mette a rischio “l‘obiettivo di decarbonizzare la produzione elettrica entro il 2025”.

Sarà un Dpcm a stabilire nel dettaglio la lista dettagliata delle infrastrutture strategiche, ha detto Calenda.

La fase di transizione, per rimpiazzare gli 8 gigawatt forniti oggi dal carbone, sarà assicurata soprattutto dal gas, ha spiegato Calenda. Attraverso la realizzazione di nuovi gasdotti (oltre a Tap e Eastmed, Calenda ha citato anche “un possibile Corridoio Sud nel caso in cui il NorthStream vada in porto, per non essere spiazzati”), l‘uso di aste e non più delle tariffe per i servizi di rigassificazione di Gnl, la revisione degli oneri di sistema per le imprese più “gasivore”.

INVESTIMENTI PER 175 MILIARDI

Complessivamente, la Sen pone l‘obiettivo di ridurre la dipendenza energetica dall‘estero (dal 76% al 64% nel 2030) e soprattutto le emissioni di anidride carbonica: rispetto al valore delle emissioni nel 1990, il target è -39% nel 2030 e -63% nel 2050.

Per farlo, gli investimenti previsti ammontano a 175 miliardi di euro: 110 per l‘efficienza energetica, 30 per reti e infrastrutture gas ed elettrico, 35 per le fonti rinnovabili.

Oltre ad abbandonare il carbone, l‘impegno della Sen è quello di ridurre di 13 milioni di tonnellate equivalenti di petrolio (Mtep) i consumi primari di prodotti petroliferi entro il 2030, aumentare l‘efficienza energetica del 30% rispetto al dato tendenziale entro lo stesso anno e incrementare il ricorso alle fonti rinnovabili.

Per le rinnovabili, rilevato che l‘Italia ha già superato nel 2015 il target previsto per il 2020 (17%), la Sen pone l‘obiettivo generale di aumento al 28% sui consumi generali entro il 2030, così diviso: fonti rinnovabili elettriche al 55%, termiche al 30%, trasporti al 21%.

Il governo prevede anche, ha detto il ministro dell‘Ambiente Gian Luca Galletti, che nel 2030 circolino sulle strade italiane circa 5 milioni di auto elettriche.

Il documento specifica che fino al 2020 saranno promossi nuovi investimenti tramite incentivi sulla produzione, estendendo le aste competitive e anche adottando un approccio di neutralità tra tecnologie con costi simili e “facendo ricorso a regimi di aiuto differenziati per piccoli impianti e tecnologie innovative”.

Dopo il 2020, dice ancora il documento, “i meccanismi di supporto alle rinnovabili evolveranno verso la market parity”, passando da incentivi diretti sulla produzione a “politiche abilitanti e semplificazione regolatoria”.

E’ prevista anche la semplificazione dell‘iter di autorizzazione per il cosiddetto repowering per impianti eolici e idrici.

The American gymnast is the most prominent athlete to come forward so far about Nassar, who is in jail awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to federal child pornography charges.

“I am angry. I‘m really upset,” Raisman, who captained the ‘Final Five’ U.S. women to the most dominant Olympic victory in the team event at the 2016 Rio Games, said in a clip released by “60 Minutes.”

“When I see these young girls that come up to me, and they ask for pictures or autographs, whatever it is ... I just want to create change so that they never, ever have to go through this.”

Nassar’s attorneys, Matt Newburg and Shannon Smith, each said that due to a gag order imposed they had no comment.

According to “60 Minutes,” more than 130 women, many of them former athletes, have filed civil lawsuits alleging that Nassar, who was involved with USA Gymnastics for nearly three decades before his tenure ended in 2015, sexually abused them under the guise of treating them for hip, back and other athletic injuries.

Nassar, once a team doctor for Olympians at USA Gymnastics and a former employee at Michigan State University, has pled not guilty to charges of sexual assault.

The 23-year-old Raisman was first treated by Nassar when she was 15. She details the abuse allegations in a new book called “Fierce” that offers new insights into a scandal that goes to the highest level of her sport.

Raisman is the second member of the ‘Fierce Five’ gymnasts who won a team gold at the 2012 London Olympics to allege abuse by Nassar, joining McKayla Maroney.

Maroney, who could not be reached for comment, said last month on Twitter that Nassar’s abuse of her began when she was 13 and was disguised as “medically necessary treatment.”

USA Gymnastics conducted a review of its procedures for handling sexual misconduct issues following reports last year that the organization turned a blind eye to allegations.

Steve Penny resigned in March as head of USA Gymnastics and the federation adopted a number of reforms in June that it said will help to better prevent and respond to future cases of abuse.

USA Gymnastics, which this week announced Kerry Perry as the organization’s new president and chief executive, commended Raisman for coming forward.

“We are appalled by the conduct of which Larry Nassar is accused, and we are very sorry that any athlete has been harmed during her or his gymnastics career,” said USA Gymnastics.

“Aly’s passion and concern for athlete safety is shared by USA Gymnastics.”

Raisman, who is calling for major changes at USA Gymnastics, the national governing body for her sport, was asked in the interview why Nassar’s accusers did not speak up sooner.

“Why are we looking at why didn’t the girls speak up? Why not look at ‘What about the culture?'” said Raisman. “What did USA Gymnastics do, and Larry Nassar do, to manipulate these girls so much that they are so afraid to speak up?”",Aly Raisman says she was abused by team doctor: CBS '60 Minutes',https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1DA2KO-OCASP

South Africa’s rand weakened on Thursday after comments by President Jacob Zuma raised concerns about higher spending on education, which would put added strain on the country’s already stretched public finances.

The Mail & Guardian newspaper said a presidential fiscal committee had presented a document to Zuma outlining possible cuts to fund free higher education for lower-income students as well as plugging a swelling budget deficit.

Options included cuts to the social grants that are the main source of income for around 17 million people - a third of the population - and slashing the budgets for housing, infrastructure and the armed forces.

A freeze on civil servant wage hikes was also on the cards, the newspaper reported.

The Presidency and Treasury did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

According to a draft of the final statement seen by Reuters and due to be released on Saturday in Vietnam, the 11 countries committed to “the core elements” of a deal while making clear more work remains.

Moving ahead with TPP would be a boost for the principle of multilateral trade agreements after U.S. President Donald Trump ditched it this year in favor of an “America First” policy that he reiterated at an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam.

Any kind of TPP deal looked in doubt earlier in the week after officials said Vietnam’s chief negotiator had walked out of one round of talks and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau then skipped a leaders’ meeting on the pact.

Negotiators returned to the table on Friday and agreed on some basics of what they called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).

Partly to counter China’s growing dominance in Asia, Japan had been lobbying hard for the TPP pact, which aims to eliminate tariffs on industrial and farm products across the 11-nation bloc whose trade totalled $356 billion last year.

The final statement said a “limited set of provisions” from the original deal would be suspended, adding further technical work was needed on four areas that still needed consensus “to prepare finalised text for signature”.

It did not say when that might happen.

“There is a lot of work left to be done but I think we have made good progress today,” Canadian Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told reporters in Vietnam late on Friday.

Canada, which has the second biggest economy among remaining TPP countries after Japan, had said it wanted to ensure an agreement that would protect jobs.

Champagne, who blamed “a misunderstanding about the schedule” for Trudeau’s absence, specifically mentioned the auto sector and cultural protection as areas needing more work.

Speaking separately, a Canadian official said the nations had “agreed to a framework towards the deal” with work programs to handle various outstanding issues.

As well as the cuts to tariffs, the TPP agreement has provisions for protecting the environment, workers’ rights and intellectual property - one of the major sticking points after the departure of the United States.

Canada’s position has been further complicated by the fact that it is simultaneously renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with the Trump administration.

At a speech in Danang, Trump set out a strong message making clear he was only interested in bilateral deals in Asia which would never put the United States at a disadvantage.

China’s President Xi Jinping, meanwhile, used the same forum to stress multilateralism and said globalization was an irreversible trend.

APEC, whose leaders hold their full summit on Saturday, has itself been buffeted by the changes under Trump.

Talks between trade and foreign ministers from the group failed to reach agreement on their usual joint statement in the face of U.S. demands to remove language about supporting free trade and fighting protectionism.","TPP countries agree to keep trade deal alive, much work remains",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apec-summit/tpp-countries-agree-to-keep-trade-deal-alive-much-work-remains-idUSKBN1DA2MW

Once a celebration for China’s lonely hearts, Singles’ Day has become a 24-hour extravaganza that outsells Black Friday and Cyber Monday U.S. sales combined, and acts as a barometer for China’s consumers.

After a star-studded event in Shanghai late on Friday counted down to the sale’s midnight start, Alibaba said gross merchandise volume (GMV) topped 10 billion yuan in a little over three minutes, and had almost doubled, to 19.1 billion yuan, in under six minutes - beating the entire day’s sales in 2012.

Alibaba alone saw $17.7 billion of goods sold on its platform at last year’s Singles’ Day.

The event gets shoppers around China scouting for bargains and loading up their online shopping carts, while delivery men - and robots - are braced for an estimated 1.5 billion parcels expected over the next six days.

“This is a big event for China, for the Chinese economy,” co-founder and Alibaba vice chairman Joseph Tsai said ahead of the sales bonanza. “On Singles’ Day, shopping is a sport, it’s entertainment.”

Tsai said rising disposable incomes of China’s “over 300 million middle-class consumers” was helping drive the firm’s online sales - and would continue. “This powerful group is propelling the consumption of China,” he said.

Analysts and investors will closely watch the headline sales number, which is likely to top last year’s total. Spending rose by nearly a third at 2016’s sale - the eighth iteration of the event - but that was slower than the 60 percent increase logged in 2015.

At Alibaba’s Friday night gala, co-founder and chairman Jack Ma hosted guests including actress Nicole Kidman, singer Pharrell Williams and Chinese musicians and film stars such as Zhang Ziyi and Fan Bingbing.

SLOWER GROWTH

The excitement around the shopping blitz, however, masks the challenges facing China’s online retailers such as Alibaba and JD.com Inc (JD.O), which are having to spend more to compete for shoppers in a broader economy where growth is slowing.

“A lot of the lower hanging fruit has been picked and there’s increased competition for a share of consumer spending,” said Matthew Crabbe, Asia Pacific research director at Mintel.

He estimated Alibaba’s Singles’ Day sales growth would likely slow to around 20 percent. Online retailers were being forced to push offline as well as overseas to attract new shoppers, and the overall online retail market was close to “saturation”.

“They’re having to spill over out of the purely online realm into the wider consumer market,” Crabbe said.

This has sparked deals to buy bricks-and-mortar stores in China, and overseas tie-ups especially in Southeast Asia. Technology, too, has been key, with virtual reality dressing rooms and live fashion shows to attract shoppers to haute couture.

Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group, noted that brands were being more careful with the deals they have on offer this year to avoid “margins getting killed”, and were often asking for deposits in advance.

In previous years, most prices were often halved.

“I think prices seem high and I‘m totally lost as to the rules (about discounts),” said Gao Wantong, 21, a student in Beijing, though he said he still planned to stay up late to grab early sales.

Fu Wenyue, a 23-year-old dresser in Shanghai, said she had already spent around 4,000 yuan ($600) on clothes, cosmetics and kitchen utensils in pre-event sales, transactions ahead of the day which officially only go through once midnight strikes.

“I’ve bought some stuff already, but I haven’t finished shopping yet,” she said.

Illegal crop burning in farm states surrounding New Delhi, vehicle exhausts and swirling construction dust have contributed to what has become an annual crisis.

Authorities will use the fire trucks in areas with high concentrations of toxic dust, said Ritesh Kumar Singh, an environment ministry official, after a meeting of civil servants from the city government and four neighbouring states.

Another ministry official who did not wish to be identified said water cannon - usually used by police for riot control - would also be employed.

“Sprinkling water is the only way to bring down the dangerous pollution levels,” said Shruti Bhardwaj, an environmental official charged with monitoring air quality.

The thick blanket of grey air and pollutants has enveloped Delhi for four days. A U.S. embassy measure of tiny PM 2.5 particles, showed a reading of 523 at nine a.m. on Friday. The upper limit of “good” air is just 50.

PM 2.5 is about 30 times finer than a human hair. The particles can be inhaled deep into the lungs, causing heart attacks, strokes, cancer and respiratory diseases.

Delhi’s air has been consistently in the “hazardous” zone for days, despite measures such as a halt to construction and restrictions on car use including raising parking charges fourfold and a licence plate “odd-even” rule on alternate days. Commercial trucks are banned from the city unless they are transporting essential commodities.

AIR PURIFIERS AND MASKS

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the leader of Delhi, has called the capital a “gas chamber”. Affluent residents and large companies have been placing bulk orders for air purifiers and masks.

“I have installed six air purifiers in my home and closed all the windows, but my eyes are still watering,” said Ranveer Singhal, a commodity trader living in a leafy neighbourhood of the city.

Organisers of music festivals and open air parties cancelled events after the Central Pollution Control Board said air quality could deteriorate further during the weekend.

Pronab Sarkar, president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators, said air pollution had also hit tourism.

The National Green Tribunal has directed the Delhi government and neighbouring states to stop farmers from burning crop residue, but many have no choice, unable to afford machinery to clear fields instead.

The federal government said the states of Punjab and Rajasthan had failed to use funds allocated to them to help them in crop residue management and farm mechanisation.

Punjab, known as India’s grain bowl, disputed the claims. A state government official said the funds were specifically meant for farm mechanisation, not for stopping the burning of straw.",Fire trucks to spray Delhi amid deepening smog emergency,https://in.reuters.com/article/india-pollution/delhi-to-be-sprayed-from-on-high-amid-deepening-smog-emergency-idINKBN1DA0UY

Founder Bikram Choudhury, who built a worldwide following with classes of 26 yoga postures in rooms heated to 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40.6°C), has been accused of sexual assault by his yoga practitioners, students, instructors and teacher trainees.

The Simi Valley, California-based company said in a bankruptcy court filing on Thursday in the Central District of California that its liabilities were worth up to $50 million. It listed assets of up to $1 million, suggesting that its largest creditors - women who are owed money for court judgments awarded against Choudhury - will not be paid in full.

They include Miki Jaffa Bodden, former head of legal and international affairs at Choudhury’s yoga school who has an $8 million claim stemming from a wrongful dismissal case that included sexual harassment claims.

Bodden alleged that Choudhury repeatedly subjected her to vulgar sexual gestures and offensive comments about women and minority groups.

“Birkram Choudhury created a hyper-sexualized, offensive and degrading environment for women by, among other things, demanding that female staffers brush his hair and give him massages,” Bodden said in her 2013 lawsuit.

She also accused him of pressuring her to cover up sexual harassment of women, and in a separate lawsuit filed this year, of fraudulently transferring assets such as luxury cars including a Ferrari and a Bentley to avoid paying judgments against him.

A warrant for Choudhury’s arrest was issued in May.

Petra Starke, who moved from her job as lawyer in the Obama White House to chief executive of the Bikram Yoga College of India in 2013, complained of wrongful dismissal, sexually inappropriate conduct and “racist tirades.” She has a $5.1 million claim.

Sharon Clerkin, who sued claiming she was fired for becoming pregnant, is owed $3.6 million.

The bankruptcy filing, which included affiliates Bikram Inc and Bikram Yoga College of India, follows heightened social awareness over sexual misconduct in the wake of allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Kevin Spacey and comedian Louis C.K.

The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the week lower for the first time in nine weeks.

U.S. Senate Republicans released a tax plan on Thursday that differed from a version put forth by the House of Representatives on several key fronts, including putting off corporate tax cuts for a year.

Expectations of lower taxes, one of President Donald Trump’s key campaign promises, have helped drive the S&P 500 up 20 percent since the 2016 presidential election.

Failure to cut corporate taxes would increase concerns about Trump’s ability to pass legislation and could shake markets that have been banking on lower tax rates to boost company earnings.

The S&P 500 on Friday stood at 18.1 times expected earnings, the highest since 2004, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.

Arrow Funds Director of Research John Serrapere put the chances of successfully passing meaningful tax cuts at 50 percent, and he warned that failing could trigger a correction of as much as 15 percent in stocks.

“There’s not a lot of confidence. I‘m not pessimistic, but there are a lot of pieces that need to be put together,” Serrapere said.

The Dow .DJI fell 0.17 percent to end at 23,422.21, while the S&P 500 .SPX slipped 0.09 percent to 2,582.3.

The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC edged up 0.01 percent to 6,750.94.

For the week, the Dow lost 0.5 percent and the S&P 500 slipped 0.21 percent. The Nasdaq gave up 0.2 percent for the week, snapping six weeks of weekly gains.

Intel (INTC.O) fell 1.55 percent and Apple (AAPL.O) lost 0.33 percent, both accounting more than any other companies for the S&P 500’s decline.

Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors fell, with the energy index’s .SPNY 0.81 percent dip leading the decliners as oil prices fell.

Nvidia (NVDA.O) jumped 5.27 percent and hit a record high after the chipmaker’s revenue forecast for the current quarter topped estimates.

A rise in media stocks also helped limit the slide.

Disney (DIS.N) rose 2.05 percent as the promise of a new “Star Wars” trilogy overshadowed its weak quarterly results.

Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) jumped 4.08 percent while News Corp (NWSA.O) climbed 5.15 percent.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.08-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Rockwell, 49, who recently played a Klansman and a brutish Texas colonel, currently co-stars as a racist, angry police officer in the movie “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.”

“I think he’s very lonely. I think he was probably abused. His father hit him when he was a kid, and he’s got a weird relationship with his mom,” Rockwell told Reuters of his character, Dixon.

“All this adds to a lot of complexity,” he added.

“Three Billboards,” out in U.S. theaters on Friday, stars Frances McDormand as Mildred, a woman on a mission to get the local police in her small Missouri hometown to properly investigate the murder of her daughter.

The film, produced by Fox Searchlight, has already attracted awards buzz and strong critical praise for both McDormand and Rockwell.

McDormand’s hardened, foul-mouthed Mildred places questions on three large billboards about the town’s police efforts that cause her to clash with law enforcement, particularly Dixon.

“None of these characters live in the black and white. They live in the gray,” Rockwell said.

“Three Billboards” writer and director Martin McDonagh said Dixon isn’t a “representation of a thing or an idea or a group.” Furthermore, Dixon’s character in “Three Billboards” is forced to face humility and he ends the film in an unexpected place.

“If I was just writing a strictly racist brute, then you wouldn’t have found the hope or the change or the humanity in him,” McDonagh said.

While “Three Billboards” was first written about eight years ago, its exploration of a small, isolated town and a racist police officer has some resonance with present day racial tensions in America. McDonagh and Rockwell said they hoped the film sparked conversations around the issue.

“I think it’s good to put out a film that starts off in a place of anger and rage but kind of has a lot of hope and humanity to it too,” McDonagh said.",Sam Rockwell grapples with race and anger in 'Three Billboards',https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-film-threebillboards/sam-rockwell-grapples-with-race-and-anger-in-three-billboards-idUKKBN1DA2RV

The House was set to vote on its measure next week. But the Senate’s timetable was less clear.

“I would say a compromise will be reached,” said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities.

The purge was already under way. Within hours security forces had rounded up dozens of members of Saudi Arabia’s political and business elite, mostly in the capital and the coastal city of Jeddah. Among them were 11 princes as well as ministers and wealthy tycoons.

Some were invited to meetings where they were detained. Others were arrested at their homes and flown to Riyadh or driven to the Ritz Carlton, which has been turned into a temporary prison.

The detainees were allowed a single, brief phone call home, a person familiar with the arrests told Reuters.

“They don’t receive calls and are kept under tight security. No one can go in or out,” the insider said. “It is obvious that there was a lot of preparation for it.”

The purge was ordered by 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Officially next in line to the throne to his father, King Salman, he is now in effect running the country which he has said he will transform into a modern state.

To do that - and in an attempt to shore up his own power - he has decided to go after the Saudi elite, including some members of the royal family, on accusations such as taking bribes and inflating the cost of business projects. Those arrested could not be reached for comment.

At stake is political stability in the world’s largest oil producer. The Crown Prince’s ability to rule unchallenged depends on whether the purge is successful.

The Crown Prince believes that unless the country changes, the economy will sink into a crisis that could fan unrest. That could threaten the royal family and weaken the country in its regional rivalry with Iran.

THE “CORRUPTION STICK”

Prince Mohammed decided to move on his family, the person familiar with events said, when he realized more relatives opposed him becoming king than he had thought.

“The signal was that anyone wavering in their support should watch out,” said the person familiar with the events. “The whole idea of the anti-corruption campaign was targeted toward the family. The rest is window dressing.”

King Salman said the purge was in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money”. Insiders said the accusations were based on evidence gathered by the intelligence service.

Government backers have rejected suggestions that the campaign is really about eliminating political enemies. There was no immediate comment from the royal court on this story.

Among those now holed up at the Ritz Carlton hotel is Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who is head of the powerful National Guard and Prince Mohammed’s cousin.

Miteb was in his farm house in Riyadh when he was called to a meeting with the Crown Prince. Such an invitation, even at night, would not be unusual for a senior official and would not have aroused suspicion.

“He went to the meeting and never came back,” said a second insider who has connections to some of those who were detained.

Others held include Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who is chairman of international investment firm Kingdom Holding and a cousin of Prince Mohammed, and Prince Turki bin Abdullah, former governor of Riyadh province and a son of the late King Abdullah.

Some royal watchers said tensions were laid bare during family meetings over the summer. One insider said it was widely known to Prince Mohammed that some of the powerful royals, including Miteb, were resentful about his elevation.

Prince Mohammed, who is widely known in Saudi Arabia by his initials MbS, had said openly in interviews that he would investigate the kingdom’s endemic corruption and would not hesitate to go after top officials.

The vehicle was an anti-corruption committee created by King Salman, and announced on Nov. 4. The king put the Crown Prince in charge, adding another power to the many he has been given in the past three years.

Saudi authorities have questioned 208 people in the anti-corruption investigation and estimate at least $100 billion has been stolen through graft, the attorney-general said on Thursday. The head of the committee said investigators had been collecting evidence for three years.

By launching a war on corruption, the prince has combined a popular cause with the elimination of an obstacle to acceding to the throne.

“MbS used the corruption stick which can reach any one of them,” said Jamal Khashoggi, a former adviser to Prince Turki al-Faisal, intelligence chief from 1979 to 2001. “For the first time we Saudis see princes being tried for their corruption.”

But Khashoggi, who lives in the United States, said Prince Mohammed was being selective in his purge.

“I believe MbS is a nationalist who loves his country and wants it to be the strongest but his problem is that he wants to rule alone,” he said.

DE FACTO RULER

Prince Mohammed was appointed defense minister in 2015 when King Salman became monarch. In June, the King named him heir to the throne, pushing aside his older cousin Mohammed bin Nayef, a veteran head of the security apparatus. The royal family acquiesced and by September the Crown Prince had rounded up and jailed religious and intellectual opponents.

The latest detentions are intended to help him push through reforms that promise the greatest change since the reign of King Abdulaziz, founder of the current Saudi state in the 1930s.

That state has rested on an enduring accommodation between the royal family and the Wahhabist clerics who control the hardline version of Islam that originated in Saudi Arabia.

The ruling family promised to give Saudis comfortable lives and a share of the country’s oil wealth. In return, their subjects have offered political submission and promised to follow the country’s strict religious and social codes.

King Abdulaziz, who was also known as Ibn Saud, died in 1953. Since then, Saudi Arabia has been run by the king and below him there has been a group of princes, none of them strong enough to impose his will against the wishes of the others.

Decisions have mostly come through consensus. That arrangement has meant social and political change has been glacial although it has also kept the kingdom stable.

But in moves that position Prince Mohammed as the new Ibn Saud, the Crown Prince is tearing down pillars of rule that had been eroding under the weight of population growth and low oil prices.

Consensus has been replaced by what critics say is one-man rule, opposed by some princes although they would not risk saying so in public.

In the past few decades, every Saudi king had one or two of his brothers, sons or nephews by his side advising and sharing in governance. But Prince Mohammed has not appointed any of his brothers or other close family to top positions, instead relying on a team of advisers -- mainly Saudis though some are U.S.- or British-trained.

King Salman, 82, still has the last word on everything. But he has delegated the running of the kingdom’s military, security, economic, foreign and social affairs to Prince Mohammed. There has been speculation for months, denied by court officials, that the king will soon abdicate the throne to MbS.

Even the Crown Prince’s age is remarkable. The last three kings have reached the throne aged 61, 80 and 79. Prince Mohammed is effectively in charge at 32.

NO GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS

Prince Mohammed says he offers a new social contract: A state that functions better than the rigid bureaucracy of the past, opportunities to have fun and an economy that will create jobs that can last, whatever happens in oil markets.

In September he announced that Saudi women will be given the right to drive. Just three weeks ago, during a conference for investors at the same Ritz Carlton that now houses the targets of his purge, he unveiled a plan for a $500-billion futuristic city where sexes could mingle and robots outnumber humans.

The prince has also drawn up a blueprint to wean Saudi Arabia off its dependence on oil and its subjects off state subsidies and government jobs. The public listing of national oil company Saudi Aramco, planned next year, is its centerpiece.

There are no guarantees the prince’s ambitions will succeed.

Even some admirers ask whether his reach exceeds his grasp. His top-down approach, brooking no opposition, could scare off investors wanting assurances about rule of law and security. Without huge investor support, he will struggle to meet the aspirations of Saudi youth.

War in Yemen, a dispute with the Gulf emirate of Qatar and growing tension with Iran is a concern to investors too.

It should help that Prince Mohammed, following the example of Ibn Saud, sees the importance of forging a special bond with the United States.

During a visit to Saudi Arabia in May, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Riyadh to lead an alliance against Iran and its attempt to cut a Shi‘ite axis through Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.

Soon afterwards, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates blockaded Qatar, accusing its ruling Al Thani dynasty of supporting Iran and Islamist terrorism. Trump gave his backing. After the arrests of the past week, Trump tweeted support, saying those arrested had been “milking their country for years”.

One insider close to the royal family said the National Guard was unlikely to react strongly to Miteb’s removal. He said there had been no resistance to the ousting of Mohammed bin Nayef at the interior ministry and the National Guard would be no different.",A house divided: How Saudi Crown Prince purged royal family rivals,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests-crownprince-insight/a-house-divided-how-saudi-crown-prince-purged-royal-family-rivals-idUSKBN1DA23M

“Ich bin jetzt am Freitagabend mit der Woche sehr zufrieden”, sagte CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer nach den Beratungen. Es gebe aber einen “Berg an Problemen.” Spitzenunterhändler der anderen Parteien äußerten sich nach den Beratungen ebenfalls unzufrieden, dass wenige Tage vor der für den 17. November angepeilten Endrunde der Sondierungen von CDU, CSU, FDP und Grünen noch immer eine große Zahl an Streitfragen ungelöst sei. Bei Einzelpunkten habe es sogar Rückschritte gegeben. Am Sonntag soll ein Chefgespräch deshalb Klarheit über den weiteren Lauf der Sondierung bringen.

Die Generalsekretäre der Parteien zogen nach stundenlangen Beratungen dennoch eine positive Zwischenbilanz, nachdem neue Sondierungspapiere etwa für Europa, Bildung, Innen, Digitales und Arbeit besprochen worden waren. Die Spitzen von CDU, CSU, FDP und Grüne einigten sich etwa im Bereich Bildung und Forschung auf Projekte mit einem Kostenvolumen von mehr als 16 Milliarden Euro in den kommenden vier Jahren.

“Es zeichnet sich schon jetzt ab, dass es einen gemeinsamen Rahmen (...) geben kann”, sagte FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer. CSU-Generalsekretär Andreas Scheuer sprach vom Übergang in die “dritte Phase”. Grünen-Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner forderte aber mehr Kompromissbereitschaft. Zuvor waren erneut Differenzen zwischen der CSU und den Grünen sichtbar geworden. Scheuer hatte den grünen “Bösartigkeit” vorgeworfen, weil sie sich über eine Blockadehaltung der CSU beklagt hatten. Hinter den Kulissen warfen sich die Parteien gegenseitig vor, bereits getroffene Absprachen immer wieder infrage zu stellen.

Am Freitagnachmittag wurde die große Runde der Jamaika-Sondierer über den Stand der Beratungen informiert. Ein Abschluss der Sondierungsgespräche ist für Donnerstag geplant. Danach wollen die Parteichefs die Zustimmung für den Beginn von Koalitionsgesprächen einholen. Kanzlerin Angela Merkel will nach der CDU-Klausurtagung Mitte November die Mandats- und Amtsträger ihrer Partei in fünf Konferenzen in Stuttgart, Düsseldorf, Hannover, Leipzig und Darmstadt informieren. Die CDU bestätigte einen entsprechenden Bericht des “Tagesspiegel”.

SPIELRAUM VON 30 MILLIARDEN EURO

Beim Thema Europa gab es keine Einigung in der Frage, wie in der EU Investitionen gefördert und angeschlagenen Euro-Staaten geholfen werden kann. In anderen Bereichen wie der Bildung gab es dagegen Vorfestlegungen, die auch mit Ausgaben versehen waren. Bei der Digitalisierung wird in dem Sondierungspapier etwa ein Kostenrahmen für den angestrebten Ausbau der Internet-Übertragungsgeschwindigkeit in den Gigabit-Bereich bis 2025 von 20 Milliarden Euro genannt. Einig waren sich die Experten auch über eine verpflichtende Rentenversicherung für Selbstständige und den Ausbau der privaten Rentenversicherung.

Den Expertenvorschlägen müssen die Chefs der vier Parteien allerdings noch zustimmen. Viele Vorhaben würde wohl am Ende unter einen Finanzierungsvorbehalt gestellt, hieß es in Sondierungskreisen. Dieses Verfahren hatte auch die große Koalition 2013 in den Koalitionsverhandlungen gewählt. Auch hier sollen die Parteichefs und Chefunterhändler am Sonntag eine Vorentscheidung treffen. Denn es gibt andere milliardenteure Wünsche wie den Abbau des Soli, eine Steuerreform oder Mehrausgaben für Europa, Verteidigung und Entwicklungshilfe. Eine Jamaika-Koalition kann dem Bundesfinanzministerium zufolge in den kommenden vier Jahren aber nur mit einem zusätzlichen finanziellen Spielraum von maximal 30 Milliarden Euro rechnen.

SONDIERUNG IN UNTERSCHIEDLICHEN RUNDEN

Im Politikfeld Arbeit, Pflege und Gesundheit hatten sich die Unterhändler auf eine Ausdehnung der Riester-Rente auf Selbstständige geeinigt. Die Unterhändler von Union, Grünen und FDP wollen laut einem Arbeitsgruppenpapier mit Stand Donnerstagabend gerade für Gründer neben der Riester-Option noch eine Pflicht-Rente. Mehr tun wollen die Sondierer auch gegen Altersarmut von Geringverdienern: “Uns eint der Wille, dass jemand, der länger gearbeitet hat, im Alter mehr haben soll als die Grundsicherung.” Geplant sei zudem eine Verbesserung der Erwerbsminderungsrente. In der Alten- und Krankenpflege ist ein Sofortprogramm geplant. In dem Reuters vorliegenden Papier der Fachgruppe heißt es: “Es werden Sofortmaßnahmen für eine bessere Personalausstattung in der Altenpflege und im Krankenhausbereich ergriffen und dafür zusätzliche Stellen zielgerichtet gefördert.”

Seehofer hatte vor Beginn der Gespräche am Freitag nochmals an die gemeinsame Verantwortung der Unterhändler gemahnt. “Wir wissen um unsere Verantwortung gegenüber der Bevölkerung. Die werden wir wahrnehmen.” Er dementierte wie CSU-Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt, dass die CSU wegen der parteiinternen Querelen um Seehofers Zukunft in den Gesprächen geschwächt sei.",Jamaika-Sondierer sammeln Milliarden-Pläne - und Probleme,https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-koalition-idDEKBN1DA2WP

Using 3D technology, the Scan Pyramids Project allows visitors wearing headsets to take a guided tour inside the Grand Gallery, the Queen’s Chamber and other ancient rooms not normally accessible to the public, without leaving Paris.

“Thanks to this technique, we make it possible to teleport ourselves to Egypt, inside the pyramid, as a group and with a guide,” said Mehdi Tayoubi, co-director of Scan Pyramids, which on Nov. 2 announced the discovery of a mysterious space inside the depths of the Pyramid.

The void itself is visible on the tour, appearing like a dotted cloud.

“What is new in the world of virtual reality is that from now on you are not isolated but there are several of us, you’re in a group, you can take a tour with your family. And you can access places which you usually can’t in the real pyramid.”

While partly designed as a fun experience, the “collaborative immersion” project allows researchers to improve the technologies they used to detect the pyramid void and think about what purpose it may have served.

The pyramid, built in around 2,500 BC and one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, was a monumental tomb soaring to a height of 479 feet (146 metres). Until the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889, the Great Pyramid stood as the tallest manmade structure for more than 4,000 years.

While there are passage ways into it and chambers in various parts, much of the internal structure had remained a mystery until a team from France’s HIP Institute used an imaging method based on cosmic rays to gain a view inside.

So-called muon particles, which originate from interactions with rays from space and atoms in Earth’s upper atmosphere, are able to penetrate hundreds of metres through stone before being absorbed. That allows for mapping inside stone structures.

“Muon tomography has really improved a lot due to its use on the pyramid and we think that muography will have other applications in other fields,” said Tayoubi. “But we also wanted to innovate and imagine devices to allow the wider public to understand what this pyramid is, understand it from within.”

When looking through their 3D goggles, visitors can see the enormous stones of the pyramid as if they were real, and walk virtually along its corridors, chambers and hidden spaces.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

Just 36 hours earlier, the city had been filled with nearly as many rival activists − this time waving uni-starred flags, yelling “Viva la República Catalana!” to show their support for the Catalan Republic, the new, sovereign country theoretically created when Catalonia’s autonomous provincial government Friday controversially declared itself free of Spain.

In the time between the two marches, Spain’s conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had dismissed Catalonia’s independence declaration as “null and void”; fired the Catalonia cabinet; dissolved Catalonia’s parliament; called new elections, and announced the central government was stepping in to oversee the regional authorities, which until Friday had held substantial powers of self-rule.

Rajoy’s action, declared Catalonia Vice President Oriol Junqueras, was a “coup d’état” directed by the “anti-democratic” prime minister in Madrid. “The president of the country is and will be Carles Puigdemont,” said Junqueras, referring to Catalonia’s regional president in a piece for the newspaper El Punt Avui. Junqueras is correct about one thing: a coup has indeed rattled this province. But the instigators aren't in Madrid. Despite appearing rigidly authoritarian, Rajoy has Spanish law, the courts, the national Senate, the king, and the 1978 constitution solidly backing his actions in lassoing runaway Catalonia back into Spain. It is not the Spanish government, but the separatists in Catalonia, where a July poll showed 41 percent wanted independence and 49 percent wanted to stay in Spain, who are undermining democracy in this land.

Junqueras, Puigdemont and their social media-savvy band of separatists, have leveraged historical grudges to create rancor and division, making a mockery of the very democracy they claim to desire by saying that it’s Spain, with elections, a healthy constitution, and a decentralized government, that is undemocratic.

Puigdemont, an avowed independence supporter and onetime-mayor of Girona, was an unelected appointee to the regional president’s seat in Jan. 2016, chosen by a parliamentary coalition that shared little but a desire for separatism. Dubbed “the accidental president,” he became the first leader of Catalonia to refuse to pledge loyalty to Spain’s constitution and king.

Filling their cabinet only with like-minded members, Puigdemont and Junqueras emphasized independence above all and promised a referendum on leaving Spain. However, Spain’s constitution, approved by 90 percent of Catalan voters in 1978, holds that the regions can only secede if all Spanish voters approve it. In spite of that, Puigdemont ignored Rajoy’s warnings and the Constitutional Court’s ruling that a vote on independence was unconstitutional and illegal.

For months, the separatist faction of the Barcelona-based government made misleading promises. An independent Catalonia would remain in the European Union, they said − even though the EU had said that declaring independence would effectively be resigning from the group. A report from the regional Ministry of Economy, headed by Junqueras, concluded that international investment would rise and wealthy Catalonia would remain economically viable despite warnings from major businesses that they’d move their headquarters, and perhaps relocate entirely if independence was declared.

Separatists riled up the populace with fervent rallies, where they claimed the national government in Madrid was robbing Catalonia, and depicting Catalans as victimized and oppressed. On Sept.7, the secessionist camp in parliament pushed through a bill on holding the referendum ignoring standard procedure, including discussion and advance notice it would be on the agenda. While 52 of the 135 parliamentarians left in disgust, the bill passed with 72 votes.

Puigdemont and Junqueras appeared to revel in the calls from Rajoy to drop the plebiscite scheduled for Oct. 1, perhaps realizing that any move from the national government would be seen as Goliath stomping on David. On that count, they were right. Instead of ignoring it, Madrid sent out national police to try to prevent the vote from taking place. The police were largely unsuccessful and their attempt short-lived, but the images of them battering doors, knocking down the elderly, dragging voters down stairs, pulling women by their hair and shooting at civilians with rubber bullets did more to alarm the world and rally support for the separatist call than any advertising campaign could have achieved. Later reports showed the number of injuries, initially thought to be over 800, had been exaggerated, as had some reports of victimization.

Missing in the dramatic imagery beamed worldwide was the fact that the disorganized vote was marred by more than violence: as Madrid tried to shut down voting stations, basic polling safeguards were overlooked and the Catalan government announced that regardless of registration, Catalans could cast ballots anywhere − creating the potential for repeat voting. Since voters had been warned by Madrid that the referendum was illegal, it was largely boycotted by those who wanted to stay in Spain; only some 2 million Catalans of 5 million-plus potential voters cast their ballots. Despite this low turnout and allegations of voter fraud, the Catalan government hailed the result as a 90 percent vote for independence.

After nearly four weeks of double-speak and canceled announcements about independence − during which over 1,000 businesses moved their headquarters outside Catalonia and tourism plummeted − Puigdemont referred the issue to the regional parliament, which held a secret ballot about it on Oct 27. Of the 135 parliamentarians, 70 wrote yes, 10 wrote no, and the rest stormed out. Many left Spanish flags on their empty chairs. Before the hour was out, Spain’s Senate in Madrid agreed to invoke the constitution’s never-before-used Article 155, giving Madrid the authority to suspend Catalonia’s government. Hours later, Rajoy announced that the central government was taking over.

Puigdemont, Junqueras and other Catalan cabinet members may now face charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Puigdemont slipped off to Brussels, where his Belgian lawyer says he will not return to Spain. Junqueras still wants to tackle the creation of his new republic, writing in a New York Times op-ed column published Wednesday that Catalonia would not retreat. “In a battle for self-determination and the recognition of rights, one does not win with the first punch,” he said.

It will be an uphill battle even in the unlikely event that the central government lets Junqueras stay in office. A new poll, just published in El Mundo, shows the number of Catalans supporting independence has dropped to 33 percent.

Funcionários trabalham em fábrica de Ribeirão Preto (SP) 15/9/2016 REUTERS/Nacho Doce

Em todo o processo de discussão e aprovação da norma, apoiadores e críticos da nova legislação discordaram praticamente de todos os aspectos da mudança. De maneira geral, os entusiastas da medida apostam no potencial dela em modernizar a economia brasileira, enquanto os queixosos alegam que a alteração vai precarizar, ainda mais, as relações trabalhistas no Brasil.

De todo modo, uma avaliação corrente é que o setor privado não deverá começar a celebrar logo no início da vigência da Lei 13.467 uma enxurrada de novas contratações de empregados que prevejam, por exemplo, alterações e flexibilizações nas jornadas de trabalho.

A estimativa é que as mudanças não devem ter impacto imediato, sendo necessário um tempo para que as principais dúvidas passem pelo crivo do Judiciário, para que então a norma comece a ser incorporada mais amplamente em negociações entre empregadores e empregados.

Uma das principais mudanças é que a nova legislação garante força de lei à negociação de acordos coletivos para alguns pontos. Antes não havia essa previsão em lei, embora a Constituição e o entendimento dos tribunais reconhecessem esse tipo de acordo.

Empresários receiam que o chamado ativismo da Justiça do Trabalho possa inibir inicialmente contratações com base na nova lei. Ao todo, a nova norma mexeu em quatro leis, inserindo e alterando mais de 110 dispositivos legais.

O presidente do Conselho de Relações do Trabalho da Confederação Nacional da Indústria (CNI), Alexandre Furlan, prevê que as mudanças vão demorar três anos para terem eficácia plena.

Ainda assim, a aposta de defensores da norma é que ela vai ajudar a impulsionar a recriação de postos de trabalho por melhorar o que consideram ser “distorções” da atual famosa CLT, a lei trabalhista ainda da era Vargas, criada 70 anos atrás, apesar de várias atualizações ao longo do tempo. Atualmente, o país tem 13 milhões de desempregados, segundo dados do IBGE, parte deles resultado da profunda recessão enfrentada pelo país nos últimos anos.

Na avaliação de apoiadores, a adoção de novos tipos de contrato de trabalho, como o intermitente e o teletrabalho (home office), e a prevalência das negociações coletivas e até acordos individuais, em casos, por exemplo, de horas extras e banco de horas de trabalho, são apontados como fatores que podem dinamizar a economia e também dar maior segurança jurídica para as empresas.

Iniciativas previstas na nova lei, como o fatiamento das férias e a adoção de banco de horas, já deverão ser colocadas em prática imediatamente. Mas outras questões deverão ter impacto somente no médio prazo, com o término das atuais convenções coletivas de trabalho, novos acordos e o “teste” da Justiça do Trabalho.

“Se conseguirmos corrigir esses problemas, o mercado de trabalho melhora, o ambiente de negócios também e indiretamente favorece a criação dos empregos”, disse Hélio Zylberstajn, professor da Universidade de São Paulo (USP), ao ressalvar que não há, em sua opinião, projeções estatísticas confiáveis de quanto poderia ser o impacto das mudanças para o acréscimo de postos de trabalho no Brasil.

Para o estudioso, o problema do país é a incerteza do empregador de ser surpreendido com passivos trabalhistas e imprevisibilidade quanto ao passado. “Nossa Justiça do Trabalho é arbitrária e enviesada”, criticou Zylberstajn, também coordenador do projeto Salariômetro da Fundação Instituto de Pesquisas Econômicas (Fipe).

ABUSO

Os críticos da nova lei, contudo, afirmam que não há provas de que as mudanças vão gerar novos postos de trabalho. Ao contrário, dizem que a tendência é que as relações trabalhistas fiquem cada vez mais precarizadas. Sustentam ainda que os salários, em geral, serão achatados, assim como ocorreu em países que fizeram reformas, como a Espanha e o México.

“A reforma apenas retira direitos”, afirmou o procurador-geral do Trabalho, Ronaldo Curado Fleury, que chegou a sugerir a Temer o veto integral a lei aprovada pelo Congresso. “Entendo que não há nenhuma relação entre a retirada de direitos e a geração de empregos”, reforçou ele, ao argumentar que estudos internacionais não mostram essa correlação.

O chefe do Ministério Público do Trabalho criou três grupos para passar um pente fino em todos os aspectos da norma. O primeiro é para avaliar a inconstitucionalidade --o trabalho desse grupo, por exemplo, já gerou uma ação do ex-procurador-geral da República Rodrigo Janot no Supremo Tribunal Federal contestando um eventual fim da gratuidade do acesso à Justiça.

Ainda há grupos para analisar a adequação da lei às convenções e tratados internacionais e outro para interpretar a lei em relação a todo o conjunto de normas brasileiras. Curado Fleury contesta a alegação de que atualmente há abusos da Justiça Trabalhista. Segundo ele, com base em dados do Conselho Nacional de Justiça, mais de 50 por cento das ações nesse ramo da Justiça referem-se a pedidos de verbas rescisórias não pagas, como aviso prévio e 13º salário e outras indenizações.

O presidente da Associação Brasileira de Advogados Trabalhistas, Denis Einloft, faz coro às críticas e considera uma falácia dizer que a mudança da lei vai gerar mais empregos. Ele se vale da experiência brasileira, afirmando que num passado recente o país chegou a crescer a elevadas taxas e viver com alto emprego mesmo com a legislação anterior.

“A partir da segunda-feira, primeiro dia útil, vai ser uma incógnita para os dois lados da relação, o trabalhador e o empregado”, disse Denis Einloft, ao prever que o próximo presidente terá de fazer uma nova reforma para aperfeiçoar a legislação.

Furlan, da CNI, avalia que se “criou um temor tanto do lado de quem emprega quanto do lado do trabalhador”.

Apesar das dúvidas, para ele, a nova legislação, vai garantir uma relação profissional mais próxima da atual conjuntura do país. “Antes se precisava do sindicato para tudo, agora não”, completou.

CONTESTAÇÕES

Apesar das intensas críticas ao texto, somente dois pontos estão formalmente contestados no STF: a ação movida pelo ex-procurador da República Rodrigo Janot sobre a gratuidade e outro, por uma confederação de trabalhadores, que questiona o fim da obrigatoriedade na cobrança do imposto sindical.

A avaliação dos profissionais ouvidos pela Reuters é que a eficácia da reforma será testada no dia a dia, a partir da avaliação dos casos que poderão gerar demandas na Justiça do Trabalho e que poderão até chegar ao Supremo.

Entidades patronais e a Advocacia-Geral da União, segundo uma fonte, preparam-se para tentar barrar uma eventual enxurrada de ações na Justiça do Trabalho. Se isso ocorrer, estão dispostos a levar demandas diretamente ao Supremo --usando um novo tipo de recurso, a Ação Declaratória de Constitucionalidade-- para que a corte decida logo se determinado trecho da nova lei está de acordo com a legislação vigente e a Constituição.

A intenção com isso é evitar que os casos se arrastem por anos, até décadas, em cortes inferiores até chegar ao STF e, dessa forma, garantir segurança jurídica para ambos os lados.","ENFOQUE-Polêmica, reforma trabalhista entra em vigor com cautela do empresariado",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1DA2NJ-OBRTP

The exhibit drew protests by far-right activists when it was shown in the east German city of Dresden last February. Demonstrators said it belittled the memory of the city’s own devastating bombing during World War Two.

Halbouni said the exhibit, which evoked a scene from 2015 when Syrian rebels sought to protect Aleppo from government snipers, was meant to send a message of unity.

It was installed a day after the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

“The Brandenburg Gate is a symbol of destruction and of the end of war. It was also a symbol of division, but then came to represent unity,” Halbouni told Reuters TV.

Thousands of jubilant Germans climbed on top of the Berlin Wall near the 18th-century gate after the wall fell in November 1989, reclaiming what was a no-man’s land during the years of division between the former Communist east and West Germany.

Entitled “Monument,” the red and white buses stand just one block from the Holocaust memorial, a somber reminder of the millions killed during the Nazi regime of World War Two.

“This is an installation against war and against all that is going wrong in this world,” the artist said.

It is part of the Berliner Herbstsalon, or “Autumn Salon,” which includes 100 cultural events organized by the Maxim Gorki Theatre across the German capital.

Passersby stopped to eye the 12-metre-high buses.

“It’s a little bizarre, but ... that’s art,” said Dieter Krapp, a tourist from the Eifel region in western Germany.

Florian Breitenwieser, a Berliner, said the exhibit was a reminder of the peace and well-being Germany now enjoys.

France became the first Western country to indicate that Saudi Arabia was holding Hariri against his will, saying it wished for him to have “all his freedom of movement and be fully able to play the essential role that is his in Lebanon”.

Hariri’s resignation has plunged Lebanon into crisis, thrusting the small Arab country back to the forefront of regional rivalry between the Sunni Muslim monarchy Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite revolutionary Iran.

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, said Saudi Arabia’s detention of Hariri, a long-time Saudi ally who declared his resignation while in Riyadh last Saturday, was an insult to all Lebanese and he must return to Lebanon.

“Let us say things as they are: the man is detained in Saudi Arabia and forbidden until this moment from returning to Lebanon,” Nasrallah said in a televised speech.

“It is clear that Saudi Arabia and Saudi officials have declared war on Lebanon and on Hezbollah in Lebanon,” he said.

His comments mirror an accusation by Riyadh on Monday that Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war on the conservative Gulf Arab kingdom.

Riyadh says Hariri is a free man and he decided to resign because Hezbollah was calling the shots in his government. Saudi Arabia considers Hezbollah to be its enemy in conflicts across the Middle East, including Syria and Yemen.

Western countries have looked on with alarm at the rising regional tension.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned other countries and groups against using Lebanon as vehicle for a larger proxy fight in the Middle East, saying Washington strongly backed Lebanon’s independence and respected Hariri as a strong partner of the United States, still referring to him as prime minister.

“There is no legitimate place or role in Lebanon for any foreign forces, militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the Lebanese state,” Tillerson said in a statement released by the U.S. State Department.

Tillerson told reporters on Friday there was no indication that Hariri was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will but that the United States was monitoring the situation.

The French foreign minister said earlier on Friday that he also believed Hariri was a free man - a statement at odds with the later French foreign ministry comment that it wanted Hariri to have “all his freedom of movement”.

Hariri has made no public remarks since announcing his resignation in a speech televised from Saudi Arabia, saying he feared assassination and accusing Iran and Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world.

Two top Lebanese government officials, a senior politician close to Hariri and a fourth source told Reuters on Thursday that the Lebanese authorities believe Hariri is being held in Saudi Arabia.

Nasrallah said Saudi Arabia was encouraging Israel to attack Lebanon. While an Israeli attack could not be ruled out entirely, he said, it was unlikely partly because Israel knew it would pay a very high price. “I warn them against any miscalculation or any step to exploit the situation,” he said.

“Saudi will fail in Lebanon as it has failed on all fronts,” Nasrallah said.

Riyadh has advised Saudi citizens not to travel to Lebanon, or if already there to leave as soon as possible. Other Gulf states have also issued travel warnings. Those steps have raised concern that Riyadh could take measures against the tiny Arab state, which hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees.

Hariri’s resignation is being widely seen as part of a Saudi attempt to counter Iran as its influence deepens in Syria and Iraq and as Riyadh and its allies battle Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Hariri’s resignation unraveled a political deal among rival factions that made him prime minister and President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, head of state last year.

The coalition government included Hezbollah, a heavily armed military and political organization.

STUCK BETWEEN “ANTAGONISTIC INTERESTS”

Aoun told Saudi Arabia’s envoy on Friday that Hariri must return to Lebanon and the circumstances surrounding his resignation as prime minister while in Saudi Arabia were unacceptable, presidential sources said.

An “international support group” of countries concerned about Lebanon, which includes the United States, Russia and France, appealed for Lebanon “to continue to be shielded from tensions in the region”. In a statement, they also welcomed Aoun’s call for Hariri to return.

In comments to Reuters, top Lebanese Druze politician Jumblatt said Lebanon did not deserve to be accused of declaring war on Saudi Arabia. “For decades we’ve been friends,” he said.

“We are a country that is squeezed between two antagonistic interests, between Saudi Arabia and Iran,” he said. “The majority of Lebanese are just paying the price ... Lebanon can not afford to declare a war against anybody.”

The Saudi foreign minister accused Hezbollah of a role in the launching of a ballistic missile at Riyadh from Yemen on Saturday. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen was an act of “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

Nasrallah mocked the Saudi accusation that Iran and Hezbollah were behind the firing of the missile from Yemen, saying Yemenis were capable of building their own missiles.",Hezbollah says Saudi declares Lebanon war with Hariri detention,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-politics/hezbollah-says-saudi-declares-lebanon-war-with-hariri-detention-idUSKBN1DA1J2

Nas rodadas do pré-sal, que seguem o regime de partilha de produção, o governo arrecada dinheiro com um pagamento quase que imediato do bônus de assinatura do leilão e também com o óleo lucro, pago quando as áreas começam a produzir.

Com os dois leilões do pré-sal de 2017, a União levou 6,15 bilhões de reais, recursos que estão ajudando o governo a evitar um maior déficit nas suas contas.

Segundo as fontes, que falaram na condição de anonimato, o governo estima arrecadação semelhante à registrada na 2ª e 3ª rodadas realizadas ao final de outubro.

O bônus de assinatura das áreas da 4ª rodada será divulgado possivelmente na semana que vem, segundo as fontes. O assunto já foi encaminhado para o Ministério da Casa Civil, que deve publicar os detalhes do certame nos próximos dias.

“Achamos que já na semana que vem a Casa Civil libera isso para o Diário Oficial, mas o que posso adiantar é que a ordem de grandeza da 4ª rodada será a mesma das rodadas do pré-sal deste ano”, disse uma das fontes.

Em cada uma das rodadas do pré-sal deste ano, o governo ofertou quatro áreas, enquanto na licitação do ano que vem, marcada para junho, foram definidos cinco blocos: Três Marias, Dois Irmãos, Uirapuru, Saturno e Itaimbezinho, nas Bacias de Santos e Campos.

“A ordem de grandeza, a estimativa é que seja aí na casa dos 3 bilhões, e os números dos leilões deste ano são uma referência, e não vai ser muito diferente disso...”, adicionou a fonte.

O percentual de óleo lucro oferecido ao governo --que define os ganhadores nas licitações do pré-sal-- também deve ser semelhante na licitação de 2018 ao registrado nas rodadas de 2017, que chegaram a até 80 por cento em um dos blocos, segundo a expectativa das fontes.

A partir da divulgação do valor de bônus para as cinco áreas da 4ª rodada do pré-sal, a Petrobras terá 30 dias para manifestar o direito de preferência pelas áreas selecionadas para o certame.

De acordo com uma das fontes, o governo não pretende colocar um bônus de assinatura muito elevado, na casa de dois dígitos, para manter a atratividade do certame e não afastar potenciais interessados.

Uma terceira fonte, da área econômica do governo, disse à Reuters que o orçamento de 2018 não previu receitas oriundas dos leilões. A peça orçamentária foi enviada ao Congresso antes da reunião do CNPE.

Mas, de acordo com a fonte, “recursos novos” são bem-vindos.

As receitas do governo oriundas de leilões de áreas de petróleo podem aumentar ainda mais com a realização da 15ª rodada de blocos no regime de concessão, marcada para o março de 2018.

A 14ª rodada, realizada em setembro deste ano, sob regime de concessão, arrecadou em bônus 3,84 bilhões de reais, com 95 por cento desse montante sendo arrecadado em lances por blocos na Bacia de Campos, feitos por Petrobras e pela norte-americana Exxon Mobil, que voltou a realizar grandes investimentos no Brasil.","Governo estima arrecadar R$3 bi com rodada do pré-sal em 2018, dizem fontes",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1DA2L3-OBRBS

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan budget watchdog in Washington, on Friday called a Senate Republican tax plan a “fatally flawed budget buster,” likening it to Republican legislation in the House of Representatives that the House tax committee has approved.

Both measures would add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the annual budget deficit and the $20 trillion national debt, according to congressional tax analysts.

The watchdog group estimated that $900 billion of the projected $1.5 trillion deficit increase would come from business tax cuts. The remainder would come from individual tax cuts, including a cut in the estate tax on inheritance that would help only the richest Americans, it said.

Republicans hold a tenuous 52-48 majority in the Senate. For that reason, if they lose the support of only three senators from their ranks, they cannot pass a tax bill as long as Democrats stay united in their opposition.

Nearly 10 months into his presidency, with his party in control of the House and the Senate, Trump is still without a major legislative victory. Failing to get a tax bill through the Senate could cost Republicans in November 2018’s midterm elections.

The Tax Foundation, another nonpartisan group, said the Senate plan would add $1.78 trillion to the deficit over a decade. It estimated that over the same time frame lower taxes would expand the U.S. economy by 3.7 percent, add 925,000 full-time jobs, raise wages by 2.9 percent and generate enough new tax revenue to erase all but $516 billion of the deficit effect.

DEFICIT REVERSAL

For decades, Republicans positioned themselves as deficit hawks, refusing to raise the debt limit, opposing Democratic spending programs and warning of crushing federal debts being passed on to future generations of Americans.

The tax plans now being debated represent a stark reversal, with congressional Republican leadership and tax law writers urging passage of deficit-expanding tax changes. Only a handful of Republican senators already have publicly voiced misgivings.

After the Senate plan was released on Thursday, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in a statement, “I remain concerned over how the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt by opting for short-term fixes, while ignoring long-term problems for taxpayers and the economy.”

Senator James Lankford said in a statement, “As we work on tax relief, we must also not lose sight of our responsibilities to protect the nation, provide basic government services and confront our federal debt.”

Senator Bob Corker, another Republican and a critic of Trump, did not comment after the Senate bill’s release but signaled fiscal concerns after the House issued its plan, saying he did not want tax cut legislation that added to the deficit.

“The current tax reform debate shows Congress just can’t seem to shake its addiction to debt,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

“If tax cuts paid for by debt are signed into law, Congress will have sent a massive, budget-busting tax bill to our children to pay, and it will result only in a short-term sugar high with little to no economic improvement over the long term,” she said.

The House is due to vote on passage of its tax bill next week. The Senate Finance Committee is due to begin formal consideration of the Senate’s version on Monday.

The Senate panel’s chairman, Republican Orrin Hatch, said he hopes to have the bill approved and sent to the full Senate by the end of next week. The House and Senate would need to agree on a single piece of legislation, pass it and send it to Trump for his signature.",Deficit worries complicate path for Republican tax cuts,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/deficit-worries-complicate-path-for-republican-tax-cuts-idUSKBN1DA2V2?il=0

During 2016 and 2017, the U.N. monitors said a military campaign by government troops in the northwestern town of Wau and surrounding areas in Western Bahr el-Ghazal targeted civilians on ethnic grounds and displaced more than 100,000.

“The government has during much of 2017 deliberately prevented life-saving food assistance from reaching some citizens,” the monitors wrote. “These actions amount to using food as a weapon of war with the intent to inflict suffering on civilians the government views as opponents to its agenda.”

“The denial of aid had caused extreme food insecurity among large sections of the population, with malnutrition and death by starvation the documented outcome, in particular in the Greater Baggari area in Wau County,” they said in the report submitted to the U.N. Security Council’s South Sudan sanctions committee.

South Sudan’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. report.

South Sudan spiraled into civil war in late 2013, two years after gaining independence from Sudan, and a third of the 12 million population has fled their homes. The conflict was sparked by a feud between Kiir, a Dinka, and his former deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer, who is being held in South Africa.

The United Nations has warned that the violence in South Sudan was providing “fertile ground” for a genocide.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley visited the Juba late last month, where she told Kiir that the United States had lost trust in his government and risked losing Washington’s support if he did not pursue peace.

‘CATASTROPHIC’

The U.N. monitors reported that the government had regularly denied humanitarian aid access to certain parts of the population, in particular areas outside the town of Wau, which was visited by U.N. Security Council ambassadors in September last year.

“One of those areas, Greater Baggari, is noteworthy for the persistent and systematic nature of the government’s access denials, and the catastrophic humanitarian conditions that have resulted,” the independent U.N. monitors said.

In August, the government eased restrictions, allowing aid groups to distribute food and lifesaving assistance to more than 12,000 people in Greater Baggari. Villages had been looted and burned and crops destroyed, the U.N. monitors wrote.

One humanitarian assessment mission told the U.N. monitors that 164 young children and elderly had died from hunger and disease between January and September 2017.

The report by the U.N. monitors found that despite the catastrophic conditions across South Sudan, armed forces, groups and militias - particularly those affiliated with Kiir and Vice President Taban Deng Gai - continued to “actively impede both humanitarian and peacekeeping operations.”

U.N. peacekeepers have been deployed in South Sudan since 2011.

An East African bloc, IGAD, led two rounds of peace talks over two years, culminating in a brief power-sharing agreement signed by Kiir and Machar in 2015. But even as IGAD urges a new ceasefire, the warring parties are preparing for more fighting.

Shares of the chipmaker rose about 6 percent in morning trade on Friday - hitting a record of $217.18.

Nvidia’s gaming revenue in the latest quarter blew past Wall Street estimates but it was the data center business, the driver of future growth, that made analysts stand up and take notice as revenue in the unit more than doubled.

Revenue from the data center business, Nvidia’s second-biggest revenue contributor, rose to $501 million, beating analysts’ estimate of $474.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

“Datacenter results have been stronger than forecast and we underestimated the value the market would assign to this franchise,” Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah wrote in a client note.

Shah raised his rating on the stock to “neutral” from “reduce.”

The company, which gets the bulk of revenue from gaming where it supplies chips for gaming consoles, has seen explosive growth at its data centers operations.

Nvidia launched the Volta chips in May as part of its Tesla V100 data center graphic processing unit (GPU) that will power systems from artificial intelligence (AI) to driverless cars.

“Volta’s launch we suspect was a major catalyst for Intel to go back to the drawing board with its AI chip Nervana, the tactical need to use AMD GPU, and the hire of Raja Koduri to head Intel’s new Graphics effort,” said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann.

Early this week, chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) partnered with bitter rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) for a graphics chip that will help the chipmakers take on Nvidia.

Intel also named AMD’s ex-GPU head, Koduri, as chief architect of the newly-formed Core and Visual Computing Group​.

“Shipments of the Tesla V100 GPU began in Q2 and ramped significantly in Q3 driven primarily by demand from cloud service providers and high-performance computing,” Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call on Thursday.

Nvidia’s data centers business, which caters to clients such as Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) Azure, was a point of concern after a disappointing showing last quarter.

But the Volta chip changed all that.

“The ramp of Volta seems to be tracking well, and more importantly, has significant runway ahead, in our view, as a broader set of customers adopt the new architecture in the coming quarters,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a client note.

The company claims that Volta will fuel breakthroughs in every industry and humanity's moonshots like eradicating cancer, intelligent customer experiences and self-driving vehicles. bit.ly/2iJPeNN

At least 14 analysts raised their price target on the stock. SunTrust Robinson analysts were the most bullish with a price target of $253. Nomura raised its target to $190 from $110.

Out of 37 brokerages covering the stock, 20 have a “buy” or higher rating; 14 on “hold” and 3 on “sell” or lower.

On Saturday Nov. 4, guests at Riyadh’s Ritz Carlton were notified by the opulent hotel that: “Due to unforeseen booking by local authorities which requires an elevated level of security, we are unable to accommodate guests ... until normal operations are restored.”

The purge was already under way. Within hours security forces had rounded up dozens of members of Saudi Arabia’s political and business elite, mostly in the capital and the coastal city of Jeddah. Among them were 11 princes as well as ministers and wealthy tycoons.

Some were invited to meetings where they were detained. Others were arrested at their homes and flown to Riyadh or driven to the Ritz Carlton, which has been turned into a temporary prison.

The detainees were allowed a single, brief phone call home, a person familiar with the arrests told Reuters.

“They don’t receive calls and are kept under tight security. No one can go in or out,” the insider said. “It is obvious that there was a lot of preparation for it.”

The purge was ordered by 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Officially next in line to the throne to his father, King Salman, he is now in effect running the country which he has said he will transform into a modern state.

To do that - and in an attempt to shore up his own power - he has decided to go after the Saudi elite, including some members of the royal family, on accusations such as taking bribes and inflating the cost of business projects. Those arrested could not be reached for comment.

At stake is political stability in the world’s largest oil producer. The Crown Prince’s ability to rule unchallenged depends on whether the purge is successful.

The Crown Prince believes that unless the country changes, the economy will sink into a crisis that could fan unrest. That could threaten the royal family and weaken the country in its regional rivalry with Iran.

THE “CORRUPTION STICK”

Prince Mohammed decided to move on his family, the person familiar with events said, when he realized more relatives opposed him becoming king than he had thought.

“The signal was that anyone wavering in their support should watch out,” said the person familiar with the events. “The whole idea of the anti-corruption campaign was targeted toward the family. The rest is window dressing.”

King Salman said the purge was in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money”. Insiders said the accusations were based on evidence gathered by the intelligence service.

Government backers have rejected suggestions that the campaign is really about eliminating political enemies. There was no immediate comment from the royal court on this story.

Among those now holed up at the Ritz Carlton hotel is Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who is head of the powerful National Guard and Prince Mohammed’s cousin.

Miteb was in his farm house in Riyadh when he was called to a meeting with the Crown Prince. Such an invitation, even at night, would not be unusual for a senior official and would not have aroused suspicion.

“He went to the meeting and never came back,” said a second insider who has connections to some of those who were detained.

Others held include Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who is chairman of international investment firm Kingdom Holding and a cousin of Prince Mohammed, and Prince Turki bin Abdullah, former governor of Riyadh province and a son of the late King Abdullah.

Some royal watchers said tensions were laid bare during family meetings over the summer. One insider said it was widely known to Prince Mohammed that some of the powerful royals, including Miteb, were resentful about his elevation.

Prince Mohammed, who is widely known in Saudi Arabia by his initials MbS, had said openly in interviews that he would investigate the kingdom’s endemic corruption and would not hesitate to go after top officials.

The vehicle was an anti-corruption committee created by King Salman, and announced on Nov. 4. The king put the Crown Prince in charge, adding another power to the many he has been given in the past three years.

Saudi authorities have questioned 208 people in the anti-corruption investigation and estimate at least $100 billion has been stolen through graft, the attorney-general said on Thursday. The head of the committee said investigators had been collecting evidence for three years.

By launching a war on corruption, the prince has combined a popular cause with the elimination of an obstacle to acceding to the throne.

“MbS used the corruption stick which can reach any one of them,” said Jamal Khashoggi, a former adviser to Prince Turki al-Faisal, intelligence chief from 1979 to 2001. “For the first time we Saudis see princes being tried for their corruption.”

But Khashoggi, who lives in the United States, said Prince Mohammed was being selective in his purge.

“I believe MbS is a nationalist who loves his country and wants it to be the strongest but his problem is that he wants to rule alone,” he said.

DE FACTO RULER

Prince Mohammed was appointed defense minister in 2015 when King Salman became monarch. In June, the King named him heir to the throne, pushing aside his older cousin Mohammed bin Nayef, a veteran head of the security apparatus. The royal family acquiesced and by September the Crown Prince had rounded up and jailed religious and intellectual opponents.

The latest detentions are intended to help him push through reforms that promise the greatest change since the reign of King Abdulaziz, founder of the current Saudi state in the 1930s.

That state has rested on an enduring accommodation between the royal family and the Wahhabist clerics who control the hardline version of Islam that originated in Saudi Arabia.

The ruling family promised to give Saudis comfortable lives and a share of the country’s oil wealth. In return, their subjects have offered political submission and promised to follow the country’s strict religious and social codes.

King Abdulaziz, who was also known as Ibn Saud, died in 1953. Since then, Saudi Arabia has been run by the king and below him there has been a group of princes, none of them strong enough to impose his will against the wishes of the others.

Decisions have mostly come through consensus. That arrangement has meant social and political change has been glacial although it has also kept the kingdom stable.

But in moves that position Prince Mohammed as the new Ibn Saud, the Crown Prince is tearing down pillars of rule that had been eroding under the weight of population growth and low oil prices.

Consensus has been replaced by what critics say is one-man rule, opposed by some princes although they would not risk saying so in public.

In the past few decades, every Saudi king had one or two of his brothers, sons or nephews by his side advising and sharing in governance. But Prince Mohammed has not appointed any of his brothers or other close family to top positions, instead relying on a team of advisers -- mainly Saudis though some are U.S.- or British-trained.

King Salman, 82, still has the last word on everything. But he has delegated the running of the kingdom’s military, security, economic, foreign and social affairs to Prince Mohammed. There has been speculation for months, denied by court officials, that the king will soon abdicate the throne to MbS.

Even the Crown Prince’s age is remarkable. The last three kings have reached the throne aged 61, 80 and 79. Prince Mohammed is effectively in charge at 32.

NO GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS

Prince Mohammed says he offers a new social contract: A state that functions better than the rigid bureaucracy of the past, opportunities to have fun and an economy that will create jobs that can last, whatever happens in oil markets.

In September he announced that Saudi women will be given the right to drive. Just three weeks ago, during a conference for investors at the same Ritz Carlton that now houses the targets of his purge, he unveiled a plan for a $500-billion futuristic city where sexes could mingle and robots outnumber humans.

The prince has also drawn up a blueprint to wean Saudi Arabia off its dependence on oil and its subjects off state subsidies and government jobs. The public listing of national oil company Saudi Aramco, planned next year, is its centerpiece.

There are no guarantees the prince’s ambitions will succeed.

Even some admirers ask whether his reach exceeds his grasp. His top-down approach, brooking no opposition, could scare off investors wanting assurances about rule of law and security. Without huge investor support, he will struggle to meet the aspirations of Saudi youth.

War in Yemen, a dispute with the Gulf emirate of Qatar and growing tension with Iran is a concern to investors too.

It should help that Prince Mohammed, following the example of Ibn Saud, sees the importance of forging a special bond with the United States.

During a visit to Saudi Arabia in May, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Riyadh to lead an alliance against Iran and its attempt to cut a Shi‘ite axis through Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.

Soon afterwards, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates blockaded Qatar, accusing its ruling Al Thani dynasty of supporting Iran and Islamist terrorism. Trump gave his backing. After the arrests of the past week, Trump tweeted support, saying those arrested had been “milking their country for years”.

One insider close to the royal family said the National Guard was unlikely to react strongly to Miteb’s removal. He said there had been no resistance to the ousting of Mohammed bin Nayef at the interior ministry and the National Guard would be no different.",A house divided: How Saudi Crown Prince purged royal family rivals,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests-crownprince-insight/a-house-divided-how-saudi-crown-prince-purged-royal-family-rivals-idUSKBN1DA23M

Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer -

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

A map of Qatar is seen in this picture illustration June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

But not all countries in North Africa feel they have that freedom when they perceive a two-front ideological battle against IS and Iran.","These are challenging times for North Africa’s Muslim governments. Even as Islamic State is ousted from its strongholds in Iraq and Syria, the extremist group is continuing its battle against authorities in countries like Morocco, Algeria and Egypt.

On Oct. 16, the Egyptian military announced that six soldiers and at least 24 IS militants were killed in attacks on military outposts in North Sinai. That same weekend, Moroccan police arrested 11 members of an “extremely dangerous” IS-linked cell and seized chemical products used to make bombs. Algerian forces, meanwhile, have killed at least 71 Islamist fighters so far this year – the most since 2014.

The list of arrests, shootouts and seizure of passports from citizens who want to be foreign fighters goes on. But North African leaders have to navigate a particularly tortuous sectarian path. To avoid the perception that fighting extremism amounts to the persecution of the defenders of the faith, their governments have to be seen to be making visible gestures of Islamic piety – while also cracking down on Shi’ite proselytizing so as to rebut IS claims that authorities are complicit with Iran’s “plots and schemes” to carve up the region and spread Shi’ite Islam.

The Islamist PJD party in Morocco warned recently of a “sectarian Shi’ite invasion;” the Grand Mufti of Mauritania called on his country’s leaders to resist the “rising Shi’ite tide.” One North African government minister I interviewed denounced “the intrusion of Shi’ism through social media, university dormitories, high schools and even qur’anic schools,” concluding gravely, “I ask myself whether the Persians want to dominate the Arab world.”

After Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Bahrein, is North Africa the next realm of a more assertive Iranian foreign policy? These fears come from Iran’s attempt to expand its influence in Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia – and its “backyard:” Senegal, Niger, Guinea and Mali.

Iran’s foreign minister toured the region in June, meeting with heads of government in Algeria, Mauritania and Tunisia in search of improved ties. Iran may simply be looking for new economic partnerships to offset current sanctions, but its outreach is enough to make some local powers nervous. Around the same time, Iran launched satellites beaming Arabic-language Shi’ite religious programming into North African homes.

There are thought to be fewer than 20,000 Shi’ites in Algeria, and the government recently mandated the registration of all of them. The Algerian minister of religious affairs has said that Shi’ites have no right to spread their faith in Algeria, “because that causes sedition and other problems.” ""Algeria cannot play host to a sectarian war that does not concern it,” he explained in an interview. “Neither Shi'ism, nor Wahhabism nor any of the other sects are the product of Algerians, nor do they come from Algeria. We refuse to be the battleground for two external and foreign ideologies.” Diplomatic relations resist easy categories, however. Algeria is one of only a handful of countries, along with Iran, to maintain good relations with Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are Shi’ite. Algiers was Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s first stop in North Africa in June.

Given the tiny number of Shi’ites living in North Africa and the tight control over mosques in the region, widespread Shi’ite religious influence on the ground is unrealistic. Whether or not the scale of proselytism justifies the level of concern, Moroccan and Algerian leaders view Iran’s Africa policy as a threat to their domestic order and regional security. The prospect of sectarian strife exists for “heterodox” – i.e. non-Sunni – minorities scattered across the region, numbering in the millions who live under mainstream Sunni rule. Some of these groups are offshoots of Shi’ite Islam, but are not necessarily the source of conflict. In Algeria, their mere difference – and the government’s toleration of them – sometimes provokes attack from local hardliners.

North Africa’s Sunni governments struggle with the reality that two adversaries – Iran and IS – are the net beneficiaries of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the crushing of Sunni opposition in Syria in 2017. The decline of Saudi influence after the Sept. 11 attacks and the downfall of Sunni Baathist rule in Iraq enhanced Iran’s stature while diminishing Sunni Arab influence in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria – and opening a path for IS.

Officially, there is no Shi’ite minority in Morocco; unofficial estimates put the number at less than 2 percent. Nonetheless, the foreign ministry in Rabat has accused Iran of trying to alter “the kingdom’s religious fundamentals.” The bad blood is the legacy of a sour relationship between Ayatollah Khomenei and King Hassan II (the father of current Moroccan King Mohammed VI) in the 1980s. The Ayatollah’s claims of Islamic supremacy over all Muslims threatened the Moroccan King’s role as “Emir al Mouamine” – leader of the faithful – of scores of millions of followers across Northwest Africa. Hassan chaired the international council of Islamic scholars that declared the Ayatollah to be an apostate – “if he is Muslim, then I’m not” – and openly supported Iraq in its war with Iran.

In turn, Hassan thought he saw an Iranian hand behind his domestic travails. Tehran provided safe haven to the Moroccan armed opposition group Chabiba Islamiya, and Hassan publicly accused Iran of fomenting riots against rising living costs and the violent uprising in the northern Rif region that is home to many Berbers. Street contestation in the Rif region has again put Rabat off balance in 2017 and revived the accusations a generation later.

The contrast with neighboring Tunisia is significant. Tunis has enjoyed unbroken relations with Iran since 1990, including high-level exchanges before and after the January, 2011 revolution that sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. Trade with Iran increased significantly as a result, but hardly registered compared to much more significant trade with the EU, North Africa, China and Turkey. Tunisia prides itself on being an island of sectarian tolerance in a rapidly polarizing region. Senior religious affairs officials proudly state that they represent all religions, including Christians and Jews, although in reality the country has very few non-Sunni Muslims. After the January 15 revolution, Tunisia signed the United Nations Convention on Human Rights and helped protect religious freedom in Article 6 of its new constitution.

Saudi Arabia has maintained its natural advantage, however. A month after the Iranian foreign minister left Tunis, a Saudi government delegation arrived, including 53 businessmen. They signed agreements with the government worth $200 million in development projects, including several hospitals and the renovations of a historic mosque in Kairouan.

But not all countries in North Africa feel they have that freedom when they perceive a two-front ideological battle against IS and Iran. In response to the State Department’s admonishments on religious freedoms in Algeria, the Algerian Minister said: “If they want to accuse us of defending Islam and our historic traditions, then let them.”

The defeat of IS in Raqqa has bought time for North African governments to consolidate their religious communities. But that same defeat also removes an obstacle to Iranian influence – not unlike the fall of Baghdad almost 15 years ago. Don’t expect the competition for leadership from the Persian Gulf to be resolved anytime soon.","Commentary: In Sunni North Africa, fears of Iran’s Shi’ite shadow",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-commentary-laurence-afterislamicstate/commentary-in-sunni-north-africa-fears-of-irans-shiite-shadow-idUSKBN1CV376

Active disease was observed in 23.5 percent of RTH258 patients versus 33.5 percent of Eylea patients at 16 weeks, Novartis said, of its investigational treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), where abnormal, leaky blood vessels can cause blindness.

A second, similar study found active disease in 21.9 percent of RTH258 patients versus 31.4 percent of those on Eylea for the condition affecting 20-25 million people worldwide.

Novartis in June touted initial data showing its drug may require fewer injections directly into the eye than Eylea, while matching it on vision and safety measures.

The Basel-based drugmaker hopes this latest analysis lends RTH258 additional muscle when matched head-to-head with Eylea as well as Lucentis, which Roche sells in the United States.

“When you take all of that together ... we believe we have a very compelling proposition,” Vas Narasimhan, Novartis’s chief drug developer who will become CEO in 2018, said on a conference call.

Novartis, which released the data at the American Academy of Opthalmology conference in New Orleans, predicts RTH258 annual sales will top $1 billion and aims to file for U.S. approval in late 2018.

Making it a success is by no means clear sailing.

For one, Novartis owns Lucentis rights in Europe where it has contractual obligations to continue marketing that drug. Analysts say cannibalization from RTH258 will be a challenge.

Competition abounds, too: Eylea, with $5 billion in annual sales, has made inroads against the $3.2 billion-per-year Lucentis, whose 2020 U.S. patent expiration will expose it to cheaper copies.

Moreover, Roche’s cancer drug Avastin is effective in off-label AMD use and has won favor because it costs a fraction of Lucentis and Eylea. In Britain, Novartis and Bayer are fighting doctor groups aiming to switch to Avastin.

NEEDLE IN THE EYE

Other would-be rivals are racing to market, too.

Allergan, whose investigational Abicipar is in Phase III trials, is also trumpeting prospects of reduced injections compared to Lucentis. Gene therapies may also be on the distant horizon.

Still, Novartis’s Narasimhan remains optimistic for RTH258’s reception when it hits the market, likely in 2019.

“When you actually see an image of a patient having a needle inserted into their eye, this is something patients definitely want to avoid,” he said.

“Retinal surgeons have busy offices and want to do more complex retinal surgery. Today, they have offices filled with patients waiting for injections.”",Novartis posts eye drug data amid play for Eylea's turf,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-novartis-eye-drug-bayer/novartis-posts-eye-drug-data-amid-play-for-eyleas-turf-idUKKBN1DA2Y4?il=0

The move, announced on Friday by vice finance minister Zhu Guangyao, comes a day after U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated calls for better access to Chinese markets in meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Xi is driving broad economic reforms by opening up China’s capital markets, internationalizing the yuan currency, and seeking technical know-how through the pursuit of massive inbound and outbound investments.

The latest changes include raising the limit on foreign ownership in joint-venture firms involved in the futures, securities and funds markets to 51 percent from the current 49 percent.

They will take effect immediately following the drafting of specific related rules, Zhu told a news conference, adding China is “formulating a timetable and roadmap for financial sector reform and opening up”.

The foreign business community gave a cautious welcome to the news.

“Financial services further opening definitely has been high on our list,” said Ken Jarrett, President of American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.

“It’s a step in the right direction. We’ll have to see the detailed rules. In China you always have to pay attention to the fine print to see how quickly it moves, but to finally ease up on the cap is something that is welcome.”

The plan to ease ownership restrictions comes as Beijing faces mounting pressure from Western governments and business lobbies to remove investment barriers and onerous regulations that restrict overseas companies’ operations in its markets.

During his trip to Beijing this week, Trump said that trade between the two nations was unfair, and called for greater market access for U.S. companies.

“We really have to look at access, forced technology transfer, and the theft of intellectual property, which just, by and of itself, is costing the United States and its companies at least $300 billion a year,” Trump said.

“Both the United States and China will have a more prosperous future if we can achieve a level economic playing field. Right now, unfortunately, it is a very one-sided and unfair one.”

CHANNELING FOREIGN MONEY

Reuters reported on Tuesday that China planned to allow global banks to take a stake of up to 51 percent in their onshore securities ventures for the first time and tie up with local non-financial firms.

China has been sluggish to give foreign players more access to its financial sector, but has promised to quicken the pace as foreign investment into Asia’s economic powerhouse slows.

It has implemented strict capital controls to contain capital outflows, while opening up new channels for foreign money to come into the domestic markets.

Foreign financial firms are still small players in the financial sector, and the sheer size of the market is a big lure for overseas players.

Western investment banks operating through joint ventures with local partners in China have struggled to make much headway in the last decade, with many of them loss-making as they struggle to win business against much larger local rivals. A Reuters survey of data from China’s Securities Association in 2014 found that the average sino-foreign JV lost 21 million yuan a year over the prior 10 years.

However, several have said they would be keen to invest more in China and do more broking and investment banking if they had full control over their joint ventures.

UBS (UBSG.S), which holds a 25 percent interest in domestic firm UBS Securities Co Ltd, said the changes on Friday were an important step in further opening up China’s financial sector.

“China is a key market for UBS and, as indicated previously, we continue to work towards increasing our stake in UBS Securities Co Ltd”, said Eugene Qian, Chairman of UBS China Strategy Board and a member of the Asia Pacific Executive Committee.

Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which earlier this year increased its stake in joint venture Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities from 33 percent to the then upper limit of 49 percent, said the reforms would create new momentum for the finance industry in China.

“Morgan Stanley is committed to growing our businesses in China,” said a spokesman for the firm.

TOO LITTLE TOO LATE?

Some industry watchers said the changes are too little too late.

“This looks good, but in reality it is pretty small and it is too late,” said Keith Pogson, head of the Asia financial services team at EY.

“If you are an international investment bank, you will be there for the sake of your global franchise and having it as part of your network, not because you think you will make much money in China.”

All the same, markets reacted positively to the news, with insurers and futures-related firms rallying strongly.

New China Life Insurance (601336.SS) jumped nearly 6 percent after the announcement, while Ping An Insurance (2318.HK) (601318.SS) advanced more than 4 percent and China Pacific Insurance Group (601601.SS) rose over 3 percent.

China will drop foreign ownership restrictions on local banks and asset management companies, Zhu said.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan budget watchdog in Washington, on Friday called a Senate Republican tax plan a “fatally flawed budget buster,” likening it to Republican legislation in the House of Representatives that the House tax committee has approved.

Both measures would add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the annual budget deficit and the $20 trillion national debt, according to congressional tax analysts.

The watchdog group estimated that $900 billion of the projected $1.5 trillion deficit increase would come from business tax cuts. The remainder would come from individual tax cuts, including a cut in the estate tax on inheritance that would help only the richest Americans, it said.

Republicans hold a tenuous 52-48 majority in the Senate. For that reason, if they lose the support of only three senators from their ranks, they cannot pass a tax bill as long as Democrats stay united in their opposition.

Nearly 10 months into his presidency, with his party in control of the House and the Senate, Trump is still without a major legislative victory. Failing to get a tax bill through the Senate could cost Republicans in November 2018’s midterm elections.

The Tax Foundation, another nonpartisan group, said the Senate plan would add $1.78 trillion to the deficit over a decade. It estimated that over the same time frame lower taxes would expand the U.S. economy by 3.7 percent, add 925,000 full-time jobs, raise wages by 2.9 percent and generate enough new tax revenue to erase all but $516 billion of the deficit effect.

DEFICIT REVERSAL

For decades, Republicans positioned themselves as deficit hawks, refusing to raise the debt limit, opposing Democratic spending programs and warning of crushing federal debts being passed on to future generations of Americans.

The tax plans now being debated represent a stark reversal, with congressional Republican leadership and tax law writers urging passage of deficit-expanding tax changes. Only a handful of Republican senators already have publicly voiced misgivings.

After the Senate plan was released on Thursday, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in a statement, “I remain concerned over how the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt by opting for short-term fixes, while ignoring long-term problems for taxpayers and the economy.”

Senator James Lankford said in a statement, “As we work on tax relief, we must also not lose sight of our responsibilities to protect the nation, provide basic government services and confront our federal debt.”

Senator Bob Corker, another Republican and a critic of Trump, did not comment after the Senate bill’s release but signaled fiscal concerns after the House issued its plan, saying he did not want tax cut legislation that added to the deficit.

“The current tax reform debate shows Congress just can’t seem to shake its addiction to debt,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

“If tax cuts paid for by debt are signed into law, Congress will have sent a massive, budget-busting tax bill to our children to pay, and it will result only in a short-term sugar high with little to no economic improvement over the long term,” she said.

The House is due to vote on passage of its tax bill next week. The Senate Finance Committee is due to begin formal consideration of the Senate’s version on Monday.

The Senate panel’s chairman, Republican Orrin Hatch, said he hopes to have the bill approved and sent to the full Senate by the end of next week.

Uber immediately said it would appeal to higher courts against Friday’s decision by the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in central London.

The U.S. ride-hailing service has faced regulatory and legal setbacks around the world amid opposition from traditional taxi services and concern among some regulators. It has been forced to quit several countries, such as Denmark and Hungary.

Last year, two drivers successfully argued at a British employment tribunal that Uber exerted significant control over them to provide an on-demand taxi service and should grant them workers’ rights such as holiday entitlement and rest breaks.

That decision did not automatically apply to the app’s 50,000 drivers in Britain but was seen as likely to prompt more claims.

It could benefit workers at thousands of companies including firms in the “gig economy”, where individuals work for multiple employers without a fixed contract, such as courier Deliveroo.

The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which backed the two drivers, said these companies were “choosing to deprive workers of their rights”.

“Today’s victory is further proof, as if any more was needed, that the law is clear and these companies are simply choosing to deprive workers of their rights,” said Jason Moyer-Lee, the IWGB’s general secretary.

Uber says its drivers enjoy the flexibility of their work and are self-employed, entitling them in British law to only basic entitlements such as health and safety.

The firm argued in September that its drivers operate in the same way as minicabs, or private hire vehicles, which sprung up in Britain more than 50 years ago.

On Friday it confirmed it would appeal against the latest decision. A spokesman said the company had 14 days to submit its application and decide whether to apply to take the case to the Supreme Court, Britain’s top judicial body.

“Over the last year we have made a number of changes to our app to give drivers even more control,” said Uber UK’s Acting General Manager Tom Elvidge in a statement. “The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive.”

Yaseen Aslam, one of the drivers involved in the case, said they would continue their fight to ensure workers’ rights were respected.

“I am glad that the judge today confirmed what I and thousands of drivers have known all along: that Uber is not only exploiting drivers, but also acting unlawfully,” he said.

Uber, which is valued at around $70 billion with backers including Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, will be back in court on Dec. 11 to appeal a decision by London’s transport regulator to strip the app of its license.

Transport for London shocked Uber in September by deeming it unfit to run a taxi service and refusing to renew its license, citing the firm’s approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.",Uber loses UK appeal bid to overturn workers' rights decision,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-uber-britain/uber-loses-uk-appeal-bid-to-overturn-workers-rights-decision-idUKKBN1DA18P

Trump pressed China to do more to rein in North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and said bilateral trade had been unfair to the United States, but also praised Xi’s pledge that China would be more open to foreign firms.

Hours after Trump left Beijing on Friday, China said it would drop foreign ownership limits on local banks and asset management companies while loosening stake restrictions in securities firms and insurers - moves that have been long awaited by foreign financial firms.

Beijing faces intensifying pressure from Western governments and business lobbies to remove investment barriers and other rules that hobble overseas firms from operating in the country, as well as intellectual property theft.

Washington has refrained from pushing harder on trade because it needs China’s cooperation on North Korea, although Xi, at least in public, went no further than reiterating China’s determination to achieve denuclearization through talks.

Trump and Xi, who call themselves friends, also oversaw the signing of about $250 billion in commercial deals, a show that some in the U.S. business community and others say detracts from addressing structural impediments that puts them at a disadvantage to Chinese rivals.

China may be mistaken in thinking it had done enough to address U.S. concerns, and Trump could find people disappointed at home he didn’t make more progress on items like market access and North Korea, Paul Haenle, Director of the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, said.

“My concern is you may see a shift towards a much harder line coming from the U.S. administration. That will be a huge surprise to China and President Xi, especially given that Xi likely feels he has done a lot for Trump on this visit.”

Trump reiterated in a tweet just before leaving Beijing for the APEC summit of Asia Pacific leaders in Vietnam that he didn’t blame China for the trade gap between the two countries, adding that he had “very productive” meetings on trade and North Korea with Xi.

“I don’t blame China, I blame the incompetence of past Admins for allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. on trade leading up to a point where the U.S. is losing $100’s of billions. How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue? I would’ve done same!”

A U.S. industry source said the implication of Trump blaming his predecessors for the trade deficit is that Trump won’t make the same mistake - a warning to Xi, not a capitulation.

The Trump administration did not bring hard trade policy items to the discussion with Xi because U.S. officials don’t want to “argue over crumbs”, the source added.

“Barring some dramatic action on North Korea by Xi, there is going to be a hard turn in U.S. trade policy,” the source said.

A second source, who is close to the business delegation that traveled to Beijing this week, added that the Trump administration appeared poised to take a much harder line in the weeks ahead.

There were no obvious gaffes during the two-night stopover, and Trump and Xi seemed to enjoy being in each other’s company.

At a banquet on Thursday night in the Great Hall of the People, Trump and Xi dined on coconut chicken soup, spicy chicken, stewed beef with tomatoes and grouper fillets.

Chinese state media said the tone and outcome of Trump’s visit had been largely positive, saying Trump and Xi were setting a new blueprint for handling relations and managing their differences.

“China has tried its utmost, even at the sacrifice of Sino-North Korean relations,” influential tabloid the Global Times wrote in its editorial.

“Trump has gradually learned that Beijing is indeed making selfless contributions to promoting the denuclearization of the peninsula. He can’t demand more.”","Trump praises 'productive' China talks, but tough action seen ahead",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-asia-china/trump-praises-productive-china-talks-but-tough-action-seen-ahead-idUSKBN1DA03X?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

According to one of the sources, the 86-year-old executive chairman of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) offered to buy CNN in both conversations.

Another source said Murdoch had “zero interest” in owning CNN.

Representatives of Twenty-First Century Fox, AT&T and Time Warner, CNN’s parent, declined comment.

CNN has become a sticking point in antitrust approval of AT&T’s $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), hatched in October 2016.

Justice Department staff have recommended that AT&T sell either its DirecTV unit or Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting unit - which includes CNN - a government official told Reuters on Thursday, in order to gain antitrust approval.

On Thursday Stephenson said he had no interest in selling CNN and that he was ready to defend the deal in court if necessary.

According to one of the sources on Friday, Murdoch called Stephenson twice, unprompted, on May 16 and Aug. 8 and on both occasions asked if CNN was for sale. Stephenson replied both times that it was not, according to the source.

‘NO SENSE’

It would not be the first time Murdoch has attempted to take control of CNN.

His Twenty-First Century Fox made an $80 billion offer for Time Warner in 2014 but abandoned the plan in the face of Time Warner’s resistance. At that time, Fox had planned to divest CNN - which competes with Fox News - in order to avoid antitrust issues.

There is no law against a company owning two cable networks, but there is a Federal Communications Commission prohibition on owning two broadcast networks. A Fox deal with CNN could also raise antitrust concerns because of the market share that a combined company would have among cable news viewers.

“I have been called and asked if I would sell CNN by numerous people,” Stephenson told the New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday. But he added: “Selling CNN makes no sense.”

Fox has held talks in the last few weeks to sell most of its film and television assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), CNBC reported this week, which would leave the company with its Fox News, sports programming and broadcasting stations..

Twenty-First Century Fox would sell its stake in European satellite broadcaster Sky Plc (SKYB.L) in a deal with Disney, according to CNBC’s report. Fox is trying to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own but the bid is strongly opposed by some lawmakers and has been subject to lengthy regulatory scrutiny.

While House Republicans sought to remove federal tax exemption for private activity bonds (PABs), an outline of the Senate’s proposal released late on Thursday does not include that provision among its list of revenue raisers.

“When the Senate’s plan came out with no change to the tax exemption for private activity bonds, I think it gave the market a chance to take a sigh of relief,” said Alan Schankel, a managing director at Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott.

The termination of tax-exempt PABs in the House bill sent shock waves through the $3.8 trillion market after the Ways and Means Committee introduced it on Nov. 2.

Almost $102 billion of the bonds, which are issued through states and local governments for economic development projects, airports, and nonprofits like hospitals, were sold in 2015, according to a recent report from Wells Fargo Securities. That accounted for 27 percent of overall long-term municipal debt sold that year.

The House plan contends that eliminating the bonds will raise $38.9 billion for the federal government between 2018 and 2027.

Analysts have questioned that figure, arguing that it was wrong for lawmakers to assume that PAB issuers would sell a similar amount of taxable bonds for their purposes under the House plan.

“We feel more comfortable about (PABs’) future long term with the Senate bill,” said Tim Fisher, legislative and federal affairs coordinator for the Council of Development Finance Agencies, adding that his group plans to keep to keep up pressure on the House.

But Emily Swenson Brock, director of the Government Finance Officers Association’s (GFOA) Federal Liaison Center, cautioned that amendments to the Senate bill were expected over the weekend and that the status of PABs will not be absolutely clear until the final legislation is released.

The outline of the Senate bill is silent on other issuances the House measure would end, including tax-free debt for professional sports stadiums and tax-credit bonds.

SIMILARITIES

Like the House bill, the Senate’s measure eliminates the alternative minimum tax. That tax is applied to earnings from a small percentage of muni bonds sold by issuers such as airports and housing authorities that have substantial private-activity components in their deals.

Both proposals end tax-exempt status for advance refunding bonds, which issuers in the U.S. municipal bond market use to take advantage of lower interest rates before outstanding bonds can be called back from investors.

The GFOA’s Brock said various groups are trying to explain to Congress that the practice is a big cost saver for state and local governments, schools and other issuers.

In the meantime, issuers of the bonds are rushing to get deals done before year end, said Emilie Ninan, a bond lawyer and partner at Ballard Spahr LLP in Wilmington, Delaware.

“I don’t think anybody should be taking comfort that this is a done deal,” Ninan said of the Senate plan that appears to be kinder to the muni market than the House proposal.",Muni market breathes 'sigh of relief' over Senate tax plan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-municipals/muni-market-breathes-sigh-of-relief-over-senate-tax-plan-idUSKBN1DA2US?il=0

Costs relating to the $13 billion U.S. consumer-credit scorer’s recent massive cyber breach helped knock earnings down 27 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier. Revenue also took a big hit. And the likely biggest expenses – including a long list of unquantified legal exposures – are yet to rain down.

The Atlanta-based outfit led by interim Chief Executive Paulino Barros reported $87.5 million of pre-tax expenses in the period related to the hack that affected nearly 150 million U.S. consumers. Some are one-offs, and others won’t be. The company expects up to $75 million in additional expenses this quarter.

That may only be the tip of the iceberg. Equifax is one of a handful of credit-scoring companies that collect people’s data on a massive scale and sell it to lenders, making it almost systemically important. That arguably means the bar for protecting its data is higher than for other corporations. It now faces 240 class-action lawsuits in North America, and investigations by a who’s who of watchdogs, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, and the attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states. Equifax says it cannot yet estimate damages and fines, but there are likely to be some of both.

Although group-wide revenue was up in the third quarter, sales in its biggest division, which handles U.S. consumer-credit reports, fell 3 percent. That was a sharp turnaround from a 7 percent growth pace in the first half considering that the breach was made public only on Sept. 7. To give that result, the unit’s revenue in the last three weeks of the quarter would have had to slump by about a third from what was expected, according to Breakingviews calculations. Executives expect group revenue to decline by 3 to 4 percent in the fourth quarter as customers defer more orders.

Investors have lopped off about a quarter of Equifax’s market capitalization since the breach. That’s consistent with a sustained drop in profit on the scale of the third quarter, but it doesn’t allow for an extended slide in revenue or big legal outlays.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan budget watchdog in Washington, on Friday called a Senate Republican tax plan a “fatally flawed budget buster,” likening it to Republican legislation in the House of Representatives that the House tax committee has approved.

Both measures would add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the annual budget deficit and the $20 trillion national debt, according to congressional tax analysts.

The watchdog group estimated that $900 billion of the projected $1.5 trillion deficit increase would come from business tax cuts. The remainder would come from individual tax cuts, including a cut in the estate tax on inheritance that would help only the richest Americans, it said.

Republicans hold a tenuous 52-48 majority in the Senate. For that reason, if they lose the support of only three senators from their ranks, they cannot pass a tax bill as long as Democrats stay united in their opposition.

Nearly 10 months into his presidency, with his party in control of the House and the Senate, Trump is still without a major legislative victory. Failing to get a tax bill through the Senate could cost Republicans in November 2018’s midterm elections.

The Tax Foundation, another nonpartisan group, said the Senate plan would add $1.78 trillion to the deficit over a decade. It estimated that over the same time frame lower taxes would expand the U.S. economy by 3.7 percent, add 925,000 full-time jobs, raise wages by 2.9 percent and generate enough new tax revenue to erase all but $516 billion of the deficit effect.

DEFICIT REVERSAL

For decades, Republicans positioned themselves as deficit hawks, refusing to raise the debt limit, opposing Democratic spending programs and warning of crushing federal debts being passed on to future generations of Americans.

The tax plans now being debated represent a stark reversal, with congressional Republican leadership and tax law writers urging passage of deficit-expanding tax changes. Only a handful of Republican senators already have publicly voiced misgivings.

After the Senate plan was released on Thursday, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in a statement, “I remain concerned over how the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt by opting for short-term fixes, while ignoring long-term problems for taxpayers and the economy.”

Senator James Lankford said in a statement, “As we work on tax relief, we must also not lose sight of our responsibilities to protect the nation, provide basic government services and confront our federal debt.”

Senator Bob Corker, another Republican and a critic of Trump, did not comment after the Senate bill’s release but signaled fiscal concerns after the House issued its plan, saying he did not want tax cut legislation that added to the deficit.

“The current tax reform debate shows Congress just can’t seem to shake its addiction to debt,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

“If tax cuts paid for by debt are signed into law, Congress will have sent a massive, budget-busting tax bill to our children to pay, and it will result only in a short-term sugar high with little to no economic improvement over the long term,” she said.

The House is due to vote on passage of its tax bill next week. The Senate Finance Committee is due to begin formal consideration of the Senate’s version on Monday.

The Senate panel’s chairman, Republican Orrin Hatch, said he hopes to have the bill approved and sent to the full Senate by the end of next week. The House and Senate would need to agree on a single piece of legislation, pass it and send it to Trump for his signature.",Deficit worries complicate path for Republican tax cuts,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/deficit-worries-complicate-path-for-republican-tax-cuts-idINKBN1DA2V2?il=0

After underperforming major global indexes for much of the year, the TSX has rallied 7 percent since early September, fueled in large part by energy stocks that profited from a nearly 25 percent rise in U.S. crude oil prices.

Manulife Financial Corp ended down 2 percent to C$26.91 on Friday. Financial stocks gave back 0.7 percent, and accounted for five of the index’s six most influential decliners.

Wheaton Precious Metals Corp was the most impactful non-financial stock on the down side, losing 4.5 percent to C$25.53 after its third-quarter revenue fell short of forecasts.

Recently, his job has gotten easier, he says, in part because of President Donald Trump.

“I get calls on a daily basis and it typically starts with, ‘I don’t want to deal with this labor headache any more’,” said Fried, sales manager for Lely North America, which makes robotic dairy milking and feeding systems.

Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration through stepped-up arrests and border enforcement has shaken the U.S. agricultural sector, where as many as 7 in 10 farm workers are undocumented, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.

In addition, Republican lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation that would require all employers to check social security numbers against federal databases to ensure their workers are in the country legally, something that is now voluntary in all but a handful of states.

The get-tough approach ""has created a great deal of anxiety,"" said Tom Vilsack, chief executive of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, who was U.S. Agriculture Secretary for eight years under President Barack Obama.

The shift comes as the industry was already struggling to cope with a shrinking, aging workforce. That is ratcheting up pressure on the sector to embrace new technology.

Farmers and food companies increasingly are moving to automate dairy operations, chicken processing, crop production and harvesting. Even delicate crops such as strawberries and peaches are being considered for mechanization.

“You’d be a fool to not have a plan that moves you that way,” said Duff Bevill, who owns a vineyard management company in Sonoma County, California.

Pilgrim’s Pride Corp, (PPC.O) the second largest U.S. chicken producer, this year cited a tightening migrant labor market as key to its decision to invest in robots and X-ray technology for its slaughterhouses. The goal: to swap human hands for machines that can debone the front half of chickens and perform other chores.

“We’re investing heavily in automating our processes, taking labor out and making jobs easier,” Pilgrim’s CEO William Lovette said in an earnings call. He said the company also decided to increases wages.

In Gilroy, California, Christopher Ranch is likewise embracing new machinery. The largest North American producer of fresh garlic, Christopher Ranch will spend about $1 million this year for a new Spanish-made robot in its packing plant that inserts garlic heads into sleeves, according to Ken Christopher, vice president of the family-owned business.

A 2014 report by WinterGreen Research forecast significant growth in the use of robotics in “every aspect of farming, milking, food production” and other agricultural enterprises. The report put the market for agricultural robots at $817 million in 2013 and projected that it would reach $16.3 billion by 2020.

Sensing opportunity, investors are stepping up to address agriculture’s labor squeeze with new automation, helped by falling electronics costs and advancements in software, robotics and artificial intelligence.

Google Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), this year spearheaded a $10 million investment in Abundant Robotics, which is working on an apple-picking robot. It also participated in a $20 million funding round for Bowery Farming, which uses robotics to grow leafy greens indoors.

Elsewhere, farm machinery maker Deere & Co (DE.N) announced that it spent $305 million to buy precision weed-killing robot maker Blue River Technology. INCENTIVES TO AUTOMATE

While little official data exists to illustrate the impact of Trump’s immigration policies on farm laborers, there is no question that illegal migration is down sharply since he took office in late January.

The number of people caught trying to enter the United States illegally from Mexico dropped almost 60 percent between February and May compared the same period last year, according to government figures. Between late January to early September, the number of individuals arrested in the interior of the country by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) rose almost 43 percent over the same period in 2016.

Gary Wishnatzki, a third-generation strawberry farmer in Florida, says scarce labor convinced him to raise $5 million so far to build a robotic strawberry picker that he hopes someday will reduce his industry’s need for field hands.

Bruce Taylor, CEO of Taylor Farms, a Salinas, California producer of salads and chopped vegetables for stores and restaurants, says his company has automated 20 percent of its packing plant.

The company has also teamed with an equipment maker to build a mechanized romaine harvester that is currently in use, and it is exploring automation for iceberg lettuce, broccoli and other field crops, Taylor said.

RISING PAY

In the meantime, farmers are raising wages. Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s most recent farm labor report shows average wages during the week of April 9 to 15 were $13.23 per hour, up 4 percent from the same week a year ago.

“The mantra in agriculture right now is automate what you can and pay well for the labor you absolutely have to have,” said Paul Pittman, CEO of Farmland Partners Inc, (FPI.N) a real estate investment trust that invests in North American farm land.

To win the loyalty of its full-time production workers, garlic grower Christopher Ranch decided to raise pay by 50 percent between 2016 and 2018, getting a four-year jump on California’s mandated $15 minimum wage that will take effect in 2022.

“Companies need to find ways of adapting and adjusting,” Christopher, the executive, said. “We’re going to take a small financial hit, but we’re going to be ready.”

Under the plan, Flynn, who was fired by Trump after just 24 days in the job, and his son, Michael Flynn Jr, were to receive up to $15 million for forcibly removing Fethullah Gulen from his U.S. home and delivering him to the Turkish government, people familiar with the investigation told the Journal.

The alleged plan emerged during Mueller’s wider investigation of possible Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and any collusion by the Trump campaign.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses Gulen of instigating a failed coup in July 2016 and wants him extradited to Turkey to face trial. Gulen has denied any role in the coup.

A spokesman for Mueller’s team declined to comment on the report on Friday.

Flynn is a central figure in Mueller’s investigation because of conversations he had with then-Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year and because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he did for a Turkish businessman.

The Journal reported that FBI agents asked at least four people about a December meeting in New York where Flynn and Turkish government representatives discussed removing Gulen, according to people with knowledge of the FBI’s inquiries.

The December meeting about Gulen was also reported Friday by NBC, which cited people familiar with the probe. The group also discussed how to set free a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, Reza Zarrab. Zarrab is in prison in the United States on federal charges that he helped Iran skirt U.S. sanctions, NBC said.

A Reuters report on Oct. 26 said one of Flynn’s business associates, former CIA Director James Woolsey, pitched a $10 million contract to two Turkish businessmen to help discredit Gulen while Woolsey was an adviser to Trump’s election campaign.

Woolsey was a member of Flynn’s firm, the Flynn Intel Group, according to a Justice Department filing by the firm and an archive of the company’s website.

Both contracts were rose more than 2 percent this week, which was the fifth consecutive increase.

Traders said higher prices in recent weeks were the result of efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to tighten the market by cutting output, as well as strong demand and rising political tensions.

There are also expectations in the market that OPEC’s next meeting on Nov. 30 will agree to extend cuts beyond the current expiry date in March 2018.

“Market participants expect OPEC to extend the production cuts beyond March 2018 and stocks to decline further,” analysts at Commerzbank said, noting, however, that “the higher price level should lead to a further rise in U.S. shale oil production.”

U.S. production was forecast to rise to 9.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 and a record 10.0 million bpd in 2018 from 8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to federal energy projections this week. Output peaked at 9.6 million bpd in 1970. [EIA/M]

Goldman Sachs also warned of greater price volatility ahead, citing rising tensions in the Middle East, especially between OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iran, along with soaring U.S. oil production.

Meanwhile, Democrats and progressive groups, emboldened by Democratic election victories in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday, sought to capitalize on the accusations in support of the Democratic nominee, former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones.

Moore, a controversial former judge and a staunch Christian conservative, was accused by a woman of initiating a sexual encounter in 1979 when she was 14 years old and he was a 32-year-old prosecutor, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.

Three other women said he pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18, though none accused him of sexual contact.

The 70-year-old Moore again denied any wrongdoing on Friday during an appearance on conservative commentator Sean Hannity’s national radio show.

“These allegations are completely false and misleading,” Moore said of claims that he engaged in sexual misconduct.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which helps elect Republicans to the Senate, filed paperwork with federal election officials on Friday severing its fundraising relationship with Moore for the special election on Dec. 12.

Numerous Republican leaders either called on Moore to drop out immediately or said he should do so if the allegations prove true.

“Moore is unfit for office and should step aside,” former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said on Twitter.

But several Alabama Republican officials did not waver in their support of Moore.

The contrasting reactions echoed the rift exposed when Moore bested the incumbent, Luther Strange, in the Republican primary.

Strange was backed by Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies, while Moore’s candidacy earned the support of self-styled outsiders such as Steve Bannon, the former strategist for U.S. President Donald Trump.

Following the publication of the Washington Post story, several Democratic senators, including liberal Elizabeth Warren, sent email blasts to their donor lists, soliciting donations to Jones’ campaign.

The Democratic Party has been coordinating with the Jones campaign behind the scenes, offering logistical aid while wary of providing overt support such as television advertising in the deeply Republican state.

“The best thing that Democrats can do in the Alabama Senate race is make sure the Doug Jones campaign can run the strongest, most aggressive race that the campaign can,” said a Democratic operative, who requested anonymity.

Progressive groups MoveOn, Democracy for America and Indivisible expect the revelations to boost their grassroots efforts to engage voters in Alabama.

“We were planning to go bigger already,” Matt Blizek, who oversees election mobilization for MoveOn, said. “With the news and the fact that this is a close race, that’s only going to increase.”

A win for Jones could transform the political picture in Washington, where Senate Republicans hold a narrow 52-48 edge.

The race had been seen as a long shot for Democrats in Alabama, which has not elected a Democratic senator in a quarter century.

But a confluence of events even before Thursday had given some Democrats hope of an upset victory, despite Jones’ double-digit deficit in some opinion polls.

Moore was twice forced out of his position as the state’s chief justice, once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the courthouse and once for defying the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. Democrats have highlighted his penchant for incendiary statements about Muslims and homosexuality.

Zac McCrary, a veteran Democratic pollster based in Birmingham, Alabama, said he now sees Jones as the favorite.

“Roy Moore had much less margin for error than a Republican does traditionally in Alabama,” McCrary said. “Maybe for the first time in this campaign season, I would bet against Roy Moore representing Alabama in the U.S. Senate.”

But Jonathan Gray, a Republican consultant in Alabama, said voters were already questioning the veracity of the Washington Post story, given its timing. The only development that could sink Moore’s candidacy is a write-in campaign from a Republican backed by the party, he said.

Absent that, he said, all the analysis in the world will not change a simple fact: “Roy Moore wins December 12.”",Republican establishment bails on Alabama candidate after sex allegations,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-congress-moore-fundraising/republican-establishment-bails-on-alabama-candidate-after-sex-allegations-idINKBN1DA2MU

U.S. Republican senators said they wanted to slash the corporate tax rate in 2019, later than the House’s proposed schedule of 2018, complicating a push for the biggest overhaul of U.S. tax law since the 1980s.

The House was set to vote on its measure next week. But the Senate’s timetable was less clear.

“I would say a compromise will be reached,” said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities.

Na segunda-feira a coalizão disse que fecharia todos os portos aéreos, marítimos e terrestres iemenitas para deter o fluxo de armas que chegam aos rebeldes houthis vindo do Irã porque a Arábia Saudita interceptou um míssil disparado contra sua capital Riad.

A Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) disse que um bloqueio total do Iêmen poderia provocar uma fome com potencial para matar milhões. O porto de Áden, que fica no sul e é controlado pelo governo, foi reaberto na quarta-feira, mas os portos em áreas comandadas pelos houthis continuam fechados.

Meanwhile, Democrats and progressive groups, emboldened by Democratic election victories in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday, sought to capitalize on the accusations in support of the Democratic nominee, former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones.

Moore, a controversial former judge and a staunch Christian conservative, was accused by a woman of initiating a sexual encounter in 1979 when she was 14 years old and he was a 32-year-old prosecutor, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.

Three other women said he pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18, though none accused him of sexual contact.

The 70-year-old Moore again denied any wrongdoing on Friday during an appearance on conservative commentator Sean Hannity’s national radio show.

“These allegations are completely false and misleading,” Moore said of claims that he engaged in sexual misconduct.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which helps elect Republicans to the Senate, filed paperwork with federal election officials on Friday severing its fundraising relationship with Moore for the special election on Dec. 12.

Numerous Republican leaders either called on Moore to drop out immediately or said he should do so if the allegations prove true.

“Moore is unfit for office and should step aside,” former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said on Twitter.

But several Alabama Republican officials did not waver in their support of Moore.

The contrasting reactions echoed the rift exposed when Moore bested the incumbent, Luther Strange, in the Republican primary.

Strange was backed by Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies, while Moore’s candidacy earned the support of self-styled outsiders such as Steve Bannon, the former strategist for U.S. President Donald Trump.

Following the publication of the Washington Post story, several Democratic senators, including liberal Elizabeth Warren, sent email blasts to their donor lists, soliciting donations to Jones’ campaign.

The Democratic Party has been coordinating with the Jones campaign behind the scenes, offering logistical aid while wary of providing overt support such as television advertising in the deeply Republican state.

“The best thing that Democrats can do in the Alabama Senate race is make sure the Doug Jones campaign can run the strongest, most aggressive race that the campaign can,” said a Democratic operative, who requested anonymity.

Progressive groups MoveOn, Democracy for America and Indivisible expect the revelations to boost their grassroots efforts to engage voters in Alabama.

“We were planning to go bigger already,” Matt Blizek, who oversees election mobilization for MoveOn, said. “With the news and the fact that this is a close race, that’s only going to increase.”

A win for Jones could transform the political picture in Washington, where Senate Republicans hold a narrow 52-48 edge.

The race had been seen as a long shot for Democrats in Alabama, which has not elected a Democratic senator in a quarter century.

But a confluence of events even before Thursday had given some Democrats hope of an upset victory, despite Jones’ double-digit deficit in some opinion polls.

Moore was twice forced out of his position as the state’s chief justice, once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the courthouse and once for defying the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. Democrats have highlighted his penchant for incendiary statements about Muslims and homosexuality.

Zac McCrary, a veteran Democratic pollster based in Birmingham, Alabama, said he now sees Jones as the favorite.

“Roy Moore had much less margin for error than a Republican does traditionally in Alabama,” McCrary said. “Maybe for the first time in this campaign season, I would bet against Roy Moore representing Alabama in the U.S. Senate.”

But Jonathan Gray, a Republican consultant in Alabama, said voters were already questioning the veracity of the Washington Post story, given its timing. The only development that could sink Moore’s candidacy is a write-in campaign from a Republican backed by the party, he said.

Absent that, he said, all the analysis in the world will not change a simple fact: “Roy Moore wins December 12.”",Republican establishment bails on Alabama candidate after sex allegations,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-moore/republican-establishment-bails-on-alabama-candidate-after-sex-allegations-idUSKBN1DA2R9

Federal lawmakers have criticized Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc for not doing enough to identify and block Russian agents from buying ads on their services. U.S. authorities say the ads were intended to influence voters during the 2016 presidential election.

U.S. law permits foreign entities to advertise about certain issues if they disclose such spending, but it is unlawful for them to interfere in elections.

In September, the Federal Election Commission, which sets campaign finance rules, voted to consider ensuring that those disclosure rules apply to online activity. It opened a public comment period that is set to expire Monday.

In the letter, Google on Thursday offered its formal response to the FEC’s deliberation.

“Now more than ever, we must work together to improve transparency, enhance disclosures and reduce foreign abuse and influence in U.S. elections,” the company wrote.

The stance marks an about-face from 2010 when Google sought an affirmative exemption from a requirement that an ad should state who purchased it. The commission did not reach a consensus on the exemption at the time.

Google now is calling on the commission to extend disclosure rules that apply to TV and print ads to the Web.

“Google strongly supports the commission’s proposal to proceed with a rulemaking so that the commission can provide the clarity that campaigns and other political advertisers need to determine what disclaimers they are required to include.”

The company, which is the world’s top seller of online ads, also asked federal regulators and lawmakers to expand restrictions on foreign participation in elections to cover content distributed and advertised on the Internet.

Ratifying such provisions could give tech companies guidance on how to treat soft influence, or content from organizations such as RT, a Russian news outlet that has drawn concerns from lawmakers for peddling propaganda on Facebook and Google’s YouTube service.

In its letter, Google also reiterated plans to offer the public a database of election ads purchased through its service. In addition, the company has said information about buyers would be more accessible.

Secondo un analista, chiusa la porta, almeno per i prossimi mesi, a operazioni straordinarie, inclusa la separazione della rete, diversi investitori speculano al ribasso anche in vista dell‘ingresso di Iliad in Italia a inizio 2018.

La cessione di Tim Brasil è esclusa. “E’ un asset strategico, fa parte del nostro perimetro e può creare molto valore nei prossimi anni”, dice Genish durante la call con gli analisti sui risultati.

La separazione della rete, anche societaria, sembra piuttosto improbabile. “Stiamo trattando con il governo per realizzare l‘applicazione del Golden Power”, aggiunge Genish. “Ma nessuno ci ha chiesto la separazione”.

L‘AgCom, secondo alcune fonti, sta valutando se chiedere a Tim la separazione societaria.

Genish conferma le trattative con l‘autorità “per realizzare l‘equivalenza di accesso per tutti gli operatori”, ricordando però che la separazione societaria o l‘Ipo dell‘infrastruttura non sono mai stata realizzate in Europa.

E, in ogni caso, “anche nello scenario estremo, nessuno ha mai suggerito che il gruppo perdesse il controllo della rete”.

Apertura invece per attività di m&a sulla controllata delle torri Inwit, ma con tutti i limiti del caso. “Inwit è importante, ma non possiamo dire che sia strategica.

Siamo aperti a qualunque operazione sempre che sia conservata la nostra influenza strategica” sul gruppo.

Per quanto riguarda il mercato del mobile, rispondendo a una domanda sull‘arrivo di Iliad, Genish garantisce che non ci saranno scosse al ribasso sui prezzi e che l‘Arpu di Tim “continuerà a essere forte”.

Alle 16,50 Tim perde il 2,1% a 73 centesimi, dopo un ribasso fino all‘8% circa subito dopo i dati e un successivo recupero nel terreno positivo, con scambi per 222 milioni di pezzi da una media giornaliera di 94,1 milioni.

Tim tocca un livello intraday a 66,70 centesimi che non vedeva dal 21 novembre 2016.

TRIMESTRE IN LINEA, EBITDA DEBOLE PER STRAORDINARIE

Tim ha chiuso il trimestre con ricavi in linea con il consensus, Ebitda di poco inferiore e conferma le previsioni su 2017 e del piano industriale.

Una nota della società annuncia che, nel trimestre, il gruppo ha registrato ricavi a 4,907 da 4,843 miliardi dello stesso trimestre del 2016; Ebitda reported a 2,099 da 2,152 miliardi; debito netto finanziario adjusted a 26,228 miliardi.

L‘Ebitda organico è pari a circa 2,2 miliardi nel trimestre.

L‘Ebitda di 2,1 miliardi risente di 127 milioni di accantonamenti per ricorsi legali e procedure regolatorie e di esborsi legati a trattamenti di fine rapporto.

L‘Ebitda domestic reported è più debole delle previsioni e si attesta a 1,694 miliardi, in calo su anno del 6,5%, dopo il +11% del primo trimestre e il +1% del secondo.

Se si escludono le componenti straordinarie la variazione su anno è pari a -2,4%, nella definizione “like for like” si registra invece un aumento del 4,3%.

Il consenso pubblicato sul sito della società indica che gli analisti stimavano in media ricavi del trimestre a 4,909 miliardi, in rialzo dello 0,7% annuo; Ebitda reported a 2,206 miliardi, +2,5%; Ebitda domestic reported a 1,827 miliardi, +0,9%; debito netto adjusted a 26,184 miliardi.

Il gruppo conferma gli obiettivi sul 2017 e quelli del piano industriale per un aumento organico dell‘Ebitda “low single digit” e vede al 2018 un rapporto tra debito netto rettificato ed Ebitda reported sotto 2,7.

During 2016 and 2017, the U.N. monitors said a military campaign by government troops in the northwestern town of Wau and surrounding areas in Western Bahr el-Ghazal targeted civilians on ethnic grounds and displaced more than 100,000.

“The government has during much of 2017 deliberately prevented life-saving food assistance from reaching some citizens,” the monitors wrote. “These actions amount to using food as a weapon of war with the intent to inflict suffering on civilians the government views as opponents to its agenda.”

“The denial of aid had caused extreme food insecurity among large sections of the population, with malnutrition and death by starvation the documented outcome, in particular in the Greater Baggari area in Wau County,” they said in the report submitted to the U.N. Security Council’s South Sudan sanctions committee.

South Sudan’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. report.

South Sudan spiraled into civil war in late 2013, two years after gaining independence from Sudan, and a third of the 12 million population has fled their homes. The conflict was sparked by a feud between Kiir, a Dinka, and his former deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer, who is being held in South Africa.

The United Nations has warned that the violence in South Sudan was providing “fertile ground” for a genocide.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley visited the Juba late last month, where she told Kiir that the United States had lost trust in his government and risked losing Washington’s support if he did not pursue peace.

‘CATASTROPHIC’

The U.N. monitors reported that the government had regularly denied humanitarian aid access to certain parts of the population, in particular areas outside the town of Wau, which was visited by U.N. Security Council ambassadors in September last year.

“One of those areas, Greater Baggari, is noteworthy for the persistent and systematic nature of the government’s access denials, and the catastrophic humanitarian conditions that have resulted,” the independent U.N. monitors said.

In August, the government eased restrictions, allowing aid groups to distribute food and lifesaving assistance to more than 12,000 people in Greater Baggari. Villages had been looted and burned and crops destroyed, the U.N. monitors wrote.

One humanitarian assessment mission told the U.N. monitors that 164 young children and elderly had died from hunger and disease between January and September 2017.

The report by the U.N. monitors found that despite the catastrophic conditions across South Sudan, armed forces, groups and militias - particularly those affiliated with Kiir and Vice President Taban Deng Gai - continued to “actively impede both humanitarian and peacekeeping operations.”

U.N. peacekeepers have been deployed in South Sudan since 2011.

An East African bloc, IGAD, led two rounds of peace talks over two years, culminating in a brief power-sharing agreement signed by Kiir and Machar in 2015. But even as IGAD urges a new ceasefire, the warring parties are preparing for more fighting.

“The coming dry season in South Sudan will, absent a change in the current conflict dynamics, see further fighting and civilian suffering as the government continues to pursue military victory over political compromise,” the U.N. monitors wrote.",Exclusive: South Sudan's government using food as weapon of war - U.N. report,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-southsudan-security-un-exclusive/exclusive-south-sudans-government-using-food-as-weapon-of-war-u-n-report-idUKKBN1DA2QJ

France became the first Western country to indicate that Saudi Arabia was holding Hariri against his will, saying it wished for him to have “all his freedom of movement and be fully able to play the essential role that is his in Lebanon”.

Hariri’s resignation has plunged Lebanon into crisis, thrusting the small Arab country back to the forefront of regional rivalry between the Sunni Muslim monarchy Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite revolutionary Iran.

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, said Saudi Arabia’s detention of Hariri, a long-time Saudi ally who declared his resignation while in Riyadh last Saturday, was an insult to all Lebanese and he must return to Lebanon.

“Let us say things as they are: the man is detained in Saudi Arabia and forbidden until this moment from returning to Lebanon,” Nasrallah said in a televised speech.

“It is clear that Saudi Arabia and Saudi officials have declared war on Lebanon and on Hezbollah in Lebanon,” he said.

His comments mirror an accusation by Riyadh on Monday that Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war on the conservative Gulf Arab kingdom.

Riyadh says Hariri is a free man and he decided to resign because Hezbollah was calling the shots in his government. Saudi Arabia considers Hezbollah to be its enemy in conflicts across the Middle East, including Syria and Yemen.

Western countries have looked on with alarm at the rising regional tension.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned other countries and groups against using Lebanon as vehicle for a larger proxy fight in the Middle East, saying Washington strongly backed Lebanon’s independence and respected Hariri as a strong partner of the United States, still referring to him as prime minister.

“There is no legitimate place or role in Lebanon for any foreign forces, militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the Lebanese state,” Tillerson said in a statement released by the U.S. State Department.

Tillerson told reporters on Friday there was no indication that Hariri was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will but that the United States was monitoring the situation.

The French foreign minister said earlier on Friday that he also believed Hariri was a free man - a statement at odds with the later French foreign ministry comment that it wanted Hariri to have “all his freedom of movement”.

Hariri has made no public remarks since announcing his resignation in a speech televised from Saudi Arabia, saying he feared assassination and accusing Iran and Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world.

Two top Lebanese government officials, a senior politician close to Hariri and a fourth source told Reuters on Thursday that the Lebanese authorities believe Hariri is being held in Saudi Arabia.

Nasrallah said Saudi Arabia was encouraging Israel to attack Lebanon. While an Israeli attack could not be ruled out entirely, he said, it was unlikely partly because Israel knew it would pay a very high price. “I warn them against any miscalculation or any step to exploit the situation,” he said.

“Saudi will fail in Lebanon as it has failed on all fronts,” Nasrallah said.

Riyadh has advised Saudi citizens not to travel to Lebanon, or if already there to leave as soon as possible. Other Gulf states have also issued travel warnings. Those steps have raised concern that Riyadh could take measures against the tiny Arab state, which hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees.

Hariri’s resignation is being widely seen as part of a Saudi attempt to counter Iran as its influence deepens in Syria and Iraq and as Riyadh and its allies battle Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Hariri’s resignation unraveled a political deal among rival factions that made him prime minister and President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, head of state last year.

The coalition government included Hezbollah, a heavily armed military and political organization.

STUCK BETWEEN “ANTAGONISTIC INTERESTS”

Aoun told Saudi Arabia’s envoy on Friday that Hariri must return to Lebanon and the circumstances surrounding his resignation as prime minister while in Saudi Arabia were unacceptable, presidential sources said.

An “international support group” of countries concerned about Lebanon, which includes the United States, Russia and France, appealed for Lebanon “to continue to be shielded from tensions in the region”. In a statement, they also welcomed Aoun’s call for Hariri to return.

In comments to Reuters, top Lebanese Druze politician Jumblatt said Lebanon did not deserve to be accused of declaring war on Saudi Arabia. “For decades we’ve been friends,” he said.

“We are a country that is squeezed between two antagonistic interests, between Saudi Arabia and Iran,” he said. “The majority of Lebanese are just paying the price ... Lebanon can not afford to declare a war against anybody.”

The Saudi foreign minister accused Hezbollah of a role in the launching of a ballistic missile at Riyadh from Yemen on Saturday. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen was an act of “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

Nasrallah mocked the Saudi accusation that Iran and Hezbollah were behind the firing of the missile from Yemen, saying Yemenis were capable of building their own missiles.",Hezbollah says Saudi declares Lebanon war with Hariri detention,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-lebanon-politics-jumblatt/hezbollah-says-saudi-declares-lebanon-war-with-hariri-detention-idUKKBN1DA0P3?il=0

According to one of the sources, the 86-year-old executive chairman of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) offered to buy CNN in both conversations.

Another source said Murdoch had “zero interest” in owning CNN.

Representatives of Twenty-First Century Fox, AT&T and Time Warner, CNN’s parent, declined comment.

CNN has become a sticking point in antitrust approval of AT&T’s $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), hatched in October 2016.

Justice Department staff have recommended that AT&T sell either its DirecTV unit or Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting unit - which includes CNN - a government official told Reuters on Thursday, in order to gain antitrust approval.

On Thursday Stephenson said he had no interest in selling CNN and that he was ready to defend the deal in court if necessary.

According to one of the sources on Friday, Murdoch called Stephenson twice, unprompted, on May 16 and Aug. 8 and on both occasions asked if CNN was for sale. Stephenson replied both times that it was not, according to the source.

‘NO SENSE’

It would not be the first time Murdoch has attempted to take control of CNN.

His Twenty-First Century Fox made an $80 billion offer for Time Warner in 2014 but abandoned the plan in the face of Time Warner’s resistance. At that time, Fox had planned to divest CNN - which competes with Fox News - in order to avoid antitrust issues.

There is no law against a company owning two cable networks, but there is a Federal Communications Commission prohibition on owning two broadcast networks. A Fox deal with CNN could also raise antitrust concerns because of the market share that a combined company would have among cable news viewers.

“I have been called and asked if I would sell CNN by numerous people,” Stephenson told the New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday. But he added: “Selling CNN makes no sense.”

Fox has held talks in the last few weeks to sell most of its film and television assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), CNBC reported this week, which would leave the company with its Fox News, sports programming and broadcasting stations..

Twenty-First Century Fox would sell its stake in European satellite broadcaster Sky Plc (SKYB.L) in a deal with Disney, according to CNBC’s report. Fox is trying to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own but the bid is strongly opposed by some lawmakers and has been subject to lengthy regulatory scrutiny.

Bitcoin has been on a tear in recent months, with a vertiginous sevenfold increase in value since the start of the year that has led to many warnings the bitcoin market - now worth well over $100 billion - has become a bubble that is about to burst.

It reached a record high of $7,888 around 1800 GMT on Wednesday after a software upgrade planned for next week that could have split the cryptocurrency in a so-called “fork” was suspended.

But it has quickly retreated from that peak, falling to as low as $6,718 around 1330 GMT on Friday. It later recovered a touch to trade around $6,880 by 1645 GMT, but that was still down almost 4 percent on the day.

“Bitcoin is all ups and downs,” said Thomas Bertani, chief executive of Eidoo, a cryptocurrency wallet provider that recently became the first startup in the space to take out a full-page advert in the Wall Street Journal newspaper.

“The market realized that the price rise was an over-reaching, so people started selling... (and) there are many long and short positions that amplify price movements.”

As bitcoin tumbled, Bitcoin Cash, which was generated from another software split on Aug.1, surged, trading up as much as 35 percent on the day to around $850, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.

Bitcoin Cash’s transactions are processed in so-called “blocks” that are larger in capacity than bitcoin‘s, so can therefore in theory allow for more transactions to be processed at any given time, making transaction fees much cheaper.

The fork that had been planned for next week, known as “SegWit2x”, had also intended to increase the capacity of the blocks, and could thus have reduced fees for bitcoin transactions.

Any investors, therefore, that see bitcoin more as a currency than a store of value might be choosing to buy into Bitcoin Cash now that Segwit2x had been scrapped, Bertani said.

“People who had been supporting Segwit2x could as an alternative move to Bitcoin Cash,” he said.

Segóvia, que foi indicado ao cargo por escolha pessoal do presidente Michel Temer e com o apoio de políticos do PMDB implicados na Lava Jato, substitui o delegado Leandro Daiello, que permaneceu à frente da PF por mais tempo, 6 anos e 10 meses.

A reunião ocorreu no Ministério da Justiça. Segundo a assessoria de imprensa da pasta, o que ocorreu nesta sexta-feira foi uma “mera assinatura” do termo de posse. A cerimônia de transmissão do cargo, disse o órgão, ocorrerá no dia 20 de dezembro, quando haverá “discursos, entrevistas e demais ações protocolares”.

Não houve aviso da assessoria do ministério ou da PF para a imprensa de que haveria essa reunião. Contudo, uma equipe televisiva da Rede Globo esteve presente ao encontro.

Em rápida entrevista após a posse, segundo informações da assessoria do órgão publicada no site do Ministério da Justiça, Segóvia afirmou que pretende reforçar o combate à corrupção, com a ampliação e melhoria da Lava Jato e criação de mais operações.

“A Lava Jato na realidade é uma das operações de combate à corrupção no país. O que a PF pretende é aumentar, ampliar o combate à corrupção. Então não será só uma ampliação, uma melhoria na Lava Jato, será em todas as operações que a PF já vem empreendendo. Bem como ampliar, criar novas operações”, disse o novo diretor-geral.

Para Segóvia, uma única certeza é que a corrupção no Brasil é sistêmica, mas existe a PF, o Ministério Público Federal e outros órgãos que a combatem e pretendem continuar cada vez mais fortes nessa atuação.

Ao ser questionado sobre ingerência política na PF, o novo diretor-geral disse que “a política, na realidade, faz parte da vida do ser humano”.

“Então, como diretor-geral, eu tenho que realmente trabalhar politicamente com vários órgãos, várias instituições, o que não quer dizer que a gente não combata os crimes, que são cometidos por pessoas. As instituições não cometem crimes, as pessoas cometem crimes. Nas empresas, os funcionários cometem crimes, as empresas não cometem crimes”, disse.

Quanto a mudanças na cúpula da instituição, Segóvia informou que já teve reuniões com os diretores e superintendentes regionais e todos estão tranquilos.

”A gente está começando a trabalhar o processo de transição natural dentro da Polícia Federal. Pretendemos continuar o trabalho e é natural que, com o tempo, haja mudanças“, disse. “Com certeza sempre tem gente que está cansado e quer sair, e tem gente que está novo e quer entrar, isso é natural”, completou.

Segundo apuração da Reuters, o delegado Sandro Torres Avelar é apontado como principal nome para assumir o cargo de secretário-executivo da PF, na prática, o número dois da corporação.

Avelar foi filiado ao PMDB e ocupou o cargo de secretário de Segurança Pública em Brasília com o aval direto do ex-assessor especial do presidente Michel Temer, o ex-vice-governador do Distrito Federal e também presidente do partido na capital, Tadeu Fillipelli.

Die Asien-Pazifik-Staaten müssten weiter auf Mulitlateralismus setzen, forderte Staatschef Xi Jinping vor den Gipfelteilnehmern am Freitag im vietnamesischen Da Nang. Trump kündigte dagegen an, die USA würden keinen Missbrauch der Handelsregeln zu ihren Lasten mehr tolerieren und auf bilaterale Abkommen mit Staaten setzen, die “sich gewissenhaft an die Spielregeln” hielten. Trump und der russische Präsident Wladimir Putin wechselten bei dem Gipfel entgegen voriger Erwartungen nur wenige Wörter zur Begrüßung miteinander. Ein Treffen der Staatschefs der elf am Transpazifischen Partnerschaftsabkommen (TPP) beteiligten Länder fand auch nicht statt. Dabei sollte eigentlich über die Zukunft des Freihandelsabkommens nach dem US-Rückzug entschieden werden.

“Offenheit bringt Fortschritt, wer sich abschottet, bleibt zurück”, sagte Xi. Er versprach zudem, sein Land werde den Marktzugang für ausländische Unternehmen “signifikant erleichtern”. Alle in China registrierten Firmen würden gleich behandelt. In China tätige westliche Unternehmen beklagen neben dem Diebstahl von geistigem Eigentum auch eine systematische Benachteiligung gegenüber einheimischen Firmen.

Xi setzte damit seine Politik der vergangenen Monate fort, sich als Verfechter einer globalisierten Handelswirtschaft zu präsentieren und damit als Gegengewicht zu der von Trump verfolgten “America first”-Politik. Trump hatte als eine seiner ersten Amtshandlungen auch den Ausstieg aus dem regionalen Handelsabkommen TPP verkündet. In seiner Rede vor den Delegierten schlug der US-Präsident erneut scharfe Töne an. “Wenn die Vereinigten Staaten eine Handelsbeziehung mit anderen Staaten oder anderen Völkern eingehen, erwarten wir von jetzt an, dass unsere Partner sich gewissenhaft an die Regeln halten”, sagte er. “Wir erwarten, dass die Märkte auf beiden Seiten im gleichen Ausmaß offen sind und dass die Investitionen von den Investoren, nicht von Regierungen, bestimmt werden.” Trump sieht angesichts vielfach bestehender Handelsungleichgewichte die USA von seinen internationalen Partnern in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten ausgenutzt und verfolgt ein Jahr nach seiner Wahl eine strikte Politik zum Nutzen der eigenen Volkswirtschaft. Statt auf internationale Handelsabkommen setzt er auf bilaterale Verträge, in denen die US-Interessen angesichts der Wirtschaftsmacht der weltgrößten Volkswirtschaft besser durchgesetzt werden können.

ZUKUNFT VON TTP WEITER OFFEN

Die Zukunft des amerikanisch-asiatischen Freihandelsabkommens TPP nach dem US-Rückzug ist unterdessen weiter ungewiss. Ein am Rande des Apec-Gipfels geplantes Treffen der Staatschefs der elf beteiligten Länder kam nicht zustande. Die Regierungschefs wollten eigentlich darüber beraten, wie sie nach dem Ausstieg der USA weiter voranschreiten können. Delegationsmitgliedern zufolge erschien Kanadas Regierungschef Justin Trudeau nicht zu den Beratungen. “Das Treffen hat nicht stattgefunden. Es bleibt noch Arbeit zu tun und das passiert gerade”, sagte ein kanadischer Unterhändler. Zuvor hatte es widersprüchliche Angaben über eine Einigung auf ein Abkommen gegeben. Nachdem am Donnerstag der mexikanische Wirtschaftsminister Ildefonso Guajardo von einer Einigung berichtet hatte, betonte der japanische Finanzminister Taro Aso am Freitag, diese gebe es noch nicht.

An der Transpazifischen Partnerschaft (TPP) wollten sich Australien, Brunei, Chile, Japan, Kanada, Malaysia, Mexiko, Neuseeland, Peru, Singapur, Vietnam und bis zu ihrem Rückzug die USA beteiligen. Ziel ist die Abschaffung von Zöllen auf Industrie- und Landwirtschaftsgüter.

Auch um ein Treffen zwischen Putin und Trump am Rande des Gipfels gab es Irritationen. Der russischen Agentur RIA zufolge begrüßten sich die beiden Staatschefs per Handschlag beim gemeinsamen Abendessen der Gipfelteilnehmer. Während die US-Regierung betonte, es sei nie formell eine Begegnung vereinbart gewesen und diese finde aus Termingründen nicht statt, bemühte sich die russische Seite nach eigenen Angaben bis zuletzt um einen bilateralen Termin.",Xi setzt sich bei Apec-Gipfel deutlich von Trump-Kurs ab,https://www.reuters.com/article/apec-idDEKBN1DA217

The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the week lower for the first time in nine weeks.

U.S. Senate Republicans released a tax plan on Thursday that differed from a version put forth by the House of Representatives on several key fronts, including putting off corporate tax cuts for a year.

Expectations of lower taxes, one of President Donald Trump’s key campaign promises, have helped drive the S&P 500 up 20 percent since the 2016 presidential election.

Failure to cut corporate taxes would increase concerns about Trump’s ability to pass legislation and could shake markets that have been banking on lower tax rates to boost company earnings.

The S&P 500 on Friday stood at 18.1 times expected earnings, the highest since 2004, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.

Arrow Funds Director of Research John Serrapere put the chances of successfully passing meaningful tax cuts at 50 percent, and he warned that failing could trigger a correction of as much as 15 percent in stocks.

“There’s not a lot of confidence. I‘m not pessimistic, but there are a lot of pieces that need to be put together,” Serrapere said.

The Dow .DJI fell 0.17 percent to end at 23,422.21, while the S&P 500 .SPX slipped 0.09 percent to 2,582.3.

The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC edged up 0.01 percent to 6,750.94.

For the week, the Dow lost 0.5 percent and the S&P 500 slipped 0.21 percent. The Nasdaq gave up 0.2 percent for the week, snapping six weeks of weekly gains.

Intel (INTC.O) fell 1.55 percent and Apple (AAPL.O) lost 0.33 percent, both accounting more than any other companies for the S&P 500’s decline.

Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors fell, with the energy index’s .SPNY 0.81 percent dip leading the decliners as oil prices fell.

Nvidia (NVDA.O) jumped 5.27 percent and hit a record high after the chipmaker’s revenue forecast for the current quarter topped estimates.

A rise in media stocks also helped limit the slide.

Disney (DIS.N) rose 2.05 percent as the promise of a new “Star Wars” trilogy overshadowed its weak quarterly results.

Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) jumped 4.08 percent while News Corp (NWSA.O) climbed 5.15 percent.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.08-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The South Americans had been training in Auckland all week and delayed their arrival in Wellington until Friday, with kickoff for the first leg of the tie at Wellington Regional Stadium at 4:15 pm (0315 GMT) on Saturday.

Greeted by chants of “Pe-ru! Pe-ru!”, their welcome in Wellington mirrored that of when they touched down in New Zealand’s largest city earlier this week with national-strip clad fans dancing, banging drums and blowing whistles as the team ran the gauntlet to a waiting bus.

A small presence of police officers was needed to clear a path for the team and their management staff, who are under immense pressure to take the side to their first World Cup finals since 1982.

“We would like to tell the 30 million expectant Peruvians back home and the thousands who have welcomed us at the airports or who have come to watch the match, we are ready,” manager Ricardo Gareca told reporters through a translator on Friday.

“We will bring all their expectations to fruition.”

Peru’s fans, however, were not the only ones to invade Wellington, with New Zealand’s most passionate supporters making lightning visits home from as far afield as Britain.

New Zealand Football estimated that more than 40 percent of tickets for the expected 38,000 sellout had been purchased by fans from outside of the greater Wellington region.

Airlines put on extra flights for the weekend, with local authorities estimating a windfall of about NZ$8 million ($5.54 million) for the local economy.

Peru are without captain Paolo Guerrero, who tested positive for a banned stimulant after a match on Oct. 5 and given a preliminary 30-day suspension..

The world’s 10th-ranked side are expected to win the two-legged tie to advance to Russia, however, the All Whites, who reached their third successive intercontinental playoff, exuded confidence on Friday, with coach Anthony Hudson having arguably his strongest possible side available for the first time.

”I‘m quite calm,“ Hudson told reporters on Friday of the fact he is able to call on West Ham United’s Winston Reid to anchor the defence and Burnley’s Chris Wood to lead the attack. ”It has been a really good week of preparation.

“I think what gives me confidence is that we have a really good group of players, I believe in them, everyone understands what we need to do and it gives me confidence going into this game.”

Captain Reid, who has missed numerous All Whites games through injury over the last three years, has boosted the side with fellow defender Michael Boxall stating earlier this week he brings a calm confidence to the entire squad.

Reid, who scored against Slovakia in New Zealand’s 1-1 draw in the 2010 finals in South Africa, said his side were aware of the magnitude of the task in front of them.

“There is so much at stake for two games,” he said.

“Our World Cup cycle depends on these two games so I think come tomorrow you will see a team that is ready, well prepared and we will give them a good game.”

Shares of the chipmaker rose about 6 percent in morning trade on Friday - hitting a record of $217.18.

Nvidia’s gaming revenue in the latest quarter blew past Wall Street estimates but it was the data center business, the driver of future growth, that made analysts stand up and take notice as revenue in the unit more than doubled.

Revenue from the data center business, Nvidia’s second-biggest revenue contributor, rose to $501 million, beating analysts’ estimate of $474.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

“Datacenter results have been stronger than forecast and we underestimated the value the market would assign to this franchise,” Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah wrote in a client note.

Shah raised his rating on the stock to “neutral” from “reduce.”

The company, which gets the bulk of revenue from gaming where it supplies chips for gaming consoles, has seen explosive growth at its data centers operations.

Nvidia launched the Volta chips in May as part of its Tesla V100 data center graphic processing unit (GPU) that will power systems from artificial intelligence (AI) to driverless cars.

“Volta’s launch we suspect was a major catalyst for Intel to go back to the drawing board with its AI chip Nervana, the tactical need to use AMD GPU, and the hire of Raja Koduri to head Intel’s new Graphics effort,” said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann.

Early this week, chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) partnered with bitter rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) for a graphics chip that will help the chipmakers take on Nvidia.

Intel also named AMD’s ex-GPU head, Koduri, as chief architect of the newly-formed Core and Visual Computing Group​.

“Shipments of the Tesla V100 GPU began in Q2 and ramped significantly in Q3 driven primarily by demand from cloud service providers and high-performance computing,” Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call on Thursday.

Nvidia’s data centers business, which caters to clients such as Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) Azure, was a point of concern after a disappointing showing last quarter.

But the Volta chip changed all that.

“The ramp of Volta seems to be tracking well, and more importantly, has significant runway ahead, in our view, as a broader set of customers adopt the new architecture in the coming quarters,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a client note.

The company claims that Volta will fuel breakthroughs in every industry and humanity's moonshots like eradicating cancer, intelligent customer experiences and self-driving vehicles. bit.ly/2iJPeNN

At least 14 analysts raised their price target on the stock. SunTrust Robinson analysts were the most bullish with a price target of $253. Nomura raised its target to $190 from $110.

Out of 37 brokerages covering the stock, 20 have a “buy” or higher rating; 14 on “hold” and 3 on “sell” or lower.

Home favorite Andy Murray, who memorably won the 2016 title to end the year ranked number one, three-times London champion Novak Djokovic, who Murray beat, pugnacious Swiss Stan Wawrinka and Kei Nishikori, along with his Japanese fan club, are all absent after succumbing to injuries.

Even a mouthwatering battle for the world number one ranking between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer has been scotched with Spaniard Nadal having taken an unassailable points lead.

Nadal’s participation is also clouded by a knee injury which hardly augurs well for the 31-year-old claiming the only big prize to elude him. He practiced on Friday but was less than positive about his chances of being 100 percent fit.

Should Nadal pull out, and the organizers will be crossing their fingers that he doesn‘t, the path would seemingly be clear for Federer, although anyone assuming the Swiss will claim the title for a seventh time is discounting the dangers that lurk.

Germany’s Alexander Zverev, Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, Belgian David Goffin and American Jack Sock -- all first-time qualifiers -- are not second-rate stand-ins.

Zverev, the 20-year-old German, has won five titles in a stunning season and catapulted to third in the world rankings.

The huge 02 Arena is the perfect stage for the man expected to be challenging for grand slams next season.

Dimitrov, long-compared to Federer in style, is finally living up to his potential while Goffin, all effortless movement and silky strokes, is a purists’ dream.

Sock is the one real outrider. He was 24th in the Race to London entering the Paris Masters and even had a golf trip booked in at Augusta National during the ATP Finals.

His first Masters 1000 title meant a hasty change of plans as he grabbed the final spot to become the first American to qualify since Mardy Fish in 2011.

Croatia’s Marin Cilic, the only other grand slam champion in the draw apart from the Federer and Nadal, is back in London for the first time since his tearful Wimbledon final loss, while unsung Austrian Dominic Thiem makes up the cast.

But there is no doubt who has the lead roles.

A year ago Federer and Nadal were both missing from London and many thought they might never be back with rackets in hand.

Yet between them they have returned from injuries and defied Father Time by dominating the year -- Federer winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon to reach 19 majors, with Nadal taking a 10th French Open and the U.S. Open.

Uber immediately said it would appeal to higher courts against Friday’s decision by the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in central London.

The U.S. ride-hailing service has faced regulatory and legal setbacks around the world amid opposition from traditional taxi services and concern among some regulators. It has been forced to quit several countries, such as Denmark and Hungary.

Last year, two drivers successfully argued at a British employment tribunal that Uber exerted significant control over them to provide an on-demand taxi service and should grant them workers’ rights such as holiday entitlement and rest breaks.

That decision did not automatically apply to the app’s 50,000 drivers in Britain but was seen as likely to prompt more claims.

It could benefit workers at thousands of companies including firms in the “gig economy”, where individuals work for multiple employers without a fixed contract, such as courier Deliveroo.

The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which backed the two drivers, said these companies were “choosing to deprive workers of their rights”.

“Today’s victory is further proof, as if any more was needed, that the law is clear and these companies are simply choosing to deprive workers of their rights,” said Jason Moyer-Lee, the IWGB’s general secretary.

Uber says its drivers enjoy the flexibility of their work and are self-employed, entitling them in British law to only basic entitlements such as health and safety.

The firm argued in September that its drivers operate in the same way as minicabs, or private hire vehicles, which sprung up in Britain more than 50 years ago.

On Friday it confirmed it would appeal against the latest decision. A spokesman said the company had 14 days to submit its application and decide whether to apply to take the case to the Supreme Court, Britain’s top judicial body.

“Over the last year we have made a number of changes to our app to give drivers even more control,” said Uber UK’s Acting General Manager Tom Elvidge in a statement. “The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive.”

Yaseen Aslam, one of the drivers involved in the case, said they would continue their fight to ensure workers’ rights were respected.

“I am glad that the judge today confirmed what I and thousands of drivers have known all along: that Uber is not only exploiting drivers, but also acting unlawfully,” he said.

Uber, which is valued at around $70 billion with backers including Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, will be back in court on Dec. 11 to appeal a decision by London’s transport regulator to strip the app of its license.

Transport for London shocked Uber in September by deeming it unfit to run a taxi service and refusing to renew its license, citing the firm’s approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.",Uber loses UK appeal bid to overturn workers' rights decision,https://www.reuters.com/article/uber-britain/uber-loses-uk-appeal-bid-to-overturn-workers-rights-decision-idINKBN1DA18T

The layoffs at GE Digital, based in San Ramon, California, affect about 100 sales people in the Americas, including those who sell GE’s Predix industrial-internet software, according to two sources.

The software, central to GE’s strategy under former Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, has been beset with technical problems, prompting GE to shift strategy.

The 125-year-old conglomerate is considering job reductions across all of its diverse businesses, the sources said. Struggling units such as GE Power are facing significant staff cuts, while aviation and healthcare businesses could see lesser reductions, the sources said.

Reuters reported in August that Flannery intended to reduce corporate staff at its Boston headquarters significantly, a process that has begun, according to sources. The company has also slowed construction of its headquarters.

It is not clear how many more jobs Flannery now plans to cut, or how quickly. With 295,000 employees, even a 10 percent overall reduction would eliminate nearly 30,000 jobs.

At the digital business, which has about 13,000 people including legacy information technology staff, GE is not only cutting sales staff. It is also reducing the number of developers who create the software, according to the two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Digital sales staff were given notice in recent days and told they could apply for about 19 remaining jobs in the division or other jobs at GE, the sources said.

GE declined to comment on specific staff reductions, but highlighted its plan to cut $3 billion in costs by the end of 2018. “Those actions include but are not limited to, employee reductions which have been well underway for many months,” spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said.

GE shares closed up 2.5 percent at $20.49.

DIVIDEND CUT COMING?

Analysts have slashed estimates for GE’s 2018 earnings and expect a major restructuring plan on Monday as GE tries to pull out of a 16-year stock slump.

GE is likely to get much smaller and more focused, Jeff Sprague, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, wrote on Friday. “It is also conceivable that looking out a few years, GE ceases to exist as we know it,” he said, referring to a potential break-up.

“Staffing has to go down meaningfully,” said a large Boston-based fund manager who invests in GE. The company spent billions on restructuring the last few years but without growth in operating profit, he added.

Since becoming CEO on Aug. 1, Flannery has doubled the amount of cost cutting targeted for next year to $2 billion, and is cutting $1 billion this year. He said he has found more than $20 billion in GE assets to sell and is looking at further changes to the portfolio beyond that.

A 30-year GE veteran, Flannery is due to present the strategic changes and new financial targets at an investor meeting in New York on Monday. The plans also could include cutting GE’s dividend for only the third time in GE’s history. The other two were during the Great Depression and the financial crisis.

Flannery has come under increasing pressure to boost GE’s profit and share price after the company badly missed earnings expectations for the third quarter and lowered its financial outlook last month.

GE stock has fallen more than 36 percent this year, making it the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and posing the risk that the only remaining original company in the widely watched stock index could be kicked out.

Activist investor Ed Garden, a founding partner at Trian Fund Management, recently joined GE’s board. Trian invested $2.5 billion in GE in 2015 and pressed the company to cut costs and focus on sectors where it is a market leader, such as power plants, jet engines and medical devices. Trian declined to comment.

GE is considering divestment of its aircraft leasing, transportation and healthcare information technology businesses. The job reduction efforts in GE’s units appear to be independent of those divestitures, the sources said.

Flannery already has grounded GE’s corporate jets, cut car bonuses for executives and dismissed two vice chairmen to save money.

In another sign of austerity, he shrunk the size of GE’s annual leadership retreat in January and moved it from ritzy Boca Raton, Florida, to Boston.

Tullow Oil discovered commercially viable quantities of crude in the far northern county of Turkana in 2012. Full production of the oil, estimated at 750 million barrels, is expected in 2021.

The government had earlier said the revenue would be capped at 22 billion shillings ($213 million) for the local county government and 3 billion shillings for the community, citing concerns about absorption capacity of the funds.

The proposal had angered local officials and the governor of Turkana, Josphat Nanok, traded harsh words with President Uhuru Kenyatta over the issue when Kenyatta visited Turkana in March.

Nanok wanted the government to give 20 percent of the revenue to the local authority and 10 percent to the local community.

In an amended petroleum bill submitted to parliament on Thursday, the government adopted the revenue sharing formula proposed by Nanok, who was not immediately available for comment.

Nanok told Kenyatta he would not win local votes in the presidential election if he did review the agreement. Kenya held a presidential election in August, but the Supreme Court nullified it and ordered a rerun on Oct. 26.

Kenyatta won with 98 percent of the vote after his chief rival Raila Odinga boycotted the vote because he said it would not be fair.

“The changes have been made under political pressure,” said George Wachira, the managing director of Petroleum Focus, a Nairobi consultancy.

“Ideally the allocation should be indexed to a county‘s capacity to spend, which will obviously increase with time.”

Kenya is planning to construct a $2.1 billion pipeline to evacuate the crude through a proposed port in Lamu. It has signed an agreement with Tullow and its exploration partner Africa Oil and A.P. Moller-Maersk.

The discovery of the crude fuelled fears of corruption in a country where the government has been repeatedly rocked by financial scandals.

“Kenya should guard against leakage and wastage of oil revenues at all levels - national, county, and local communities,” Wachira said.

Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, which bled support to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the Sept. 24 election, are trying to forge a coalition government with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the environmentalist Greens.

The chiefs of the parties huddled on Friday evening to review progress in the talks thus far, but planned no statements.

They had initially hoped to agree on the outlines of a coalition deal by Friday after the two smaller parties dropped demands this week on tax and climate policy, but later decided to meet again on Sunday before a final push by full delegations for an outline deal next week.

Still, the overall tone was more upbeat than at the end of the previous week.

“We’re heading into the home stretch,” Horst Seehofer, head of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), told reporters.

Seehofer and FDP leader Christian Lindner said they were optimistic that the exploratory talks could be wrapped up next week, paving the way for weeks of detailed negotiations about the exact terms of a coalition contract.

But Michael Kellner, a top negotiator for the Greens, demanded more compromises from the other parties.

GIVING GROUND

The FDP this week gave ground by agreeing to accept more modest income tax cuts than a campaign pledge of 30-40 billion euros ($35-46 billion) of relief.

In an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel on Friday, Lindner also signaled a readiness to compromise on the euro zone’s European Stability Mechanism, moving away from a campaign pledge to shut down the rescue fund.

The Greens for their part dropped their insistence on fixed dates for shutting down coal-fired power stations and banning cars with internal combustion engines.

But the parties remain divided on whether or not to push for a euro zone budget, on Europe’s banking union and on the use of drones in military conflicts, as well as German participation in foreign military missions, according to draft papers seen by Reuters.

They must also agree how to meet key targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, how to deal with the pollution caused by diesel cars already on the road, and whether to introduce a law that would ease tax rates for venture capital projects.

If the parties fail to reach agreement, Germany could be forced into a new election that could unsettle investors at a time when many in the European Union are looking to Europe’s biggest economic power for leadership on issues ranging from euro zone governance to transatlantic relations.

Merkel, seeking a fourth term as chancellor, hopes to reach agreement in the exploratory talks by Nov. 16.

Recently, his job has gotten easier, he says, in part because of President Donald Trump.

“I get calls on a daily basis and it typically starts with, ‘I don’t want to deal with this labor headache any more’,” said Fried, sales manager for Lely North America, which makes robotic dairy milking and feeding systems.

Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration through stepped-up arrests and border enforcement has shaken the U.S. agricultural sector, where as many as 7 in 10 farm workers are undocumented, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.

In addition, Republican lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation that would require all employers to check social security numbers against federal databases to ensure their workers are in the country legally, something that is now voluntary in all but a handful of states.

The get-tough approach ""has created a great deal of anxiety,"" said Tom Vilsack, chief executive of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, who was U.S. Agriculture Secretary for eight years under President Barack Obama.

The shift comes as the industry was already struggling to cope with a shrinking, aging workforce. That is ratcheting up pressure on the sector to embrace new technology.

Farmers and food companies increasingly are moving to automate dairy operations, chicken processing, crop production and harvesting. Even delicate crops such as strawberries and peaches are being considered for mechanization.

“You’d be a fool to not have a plan that moves you that way,” said Duff Bevill, who owns a vineyard management company in Sonoma County, California.

Pilgrim’s Pride Corp, (PPC.O) the second largest U.S. chicken producer, this year cited a tightening migrant labor market as key to its decision to invest in robots and X-ray technology for its slaughterhouses. The goal: to swap human hands for machines that can debone the front half of chickens and perform other chores.

“We’re investing heavily in automating our processes, taking labor out and making jobs easier,” Pilgrim’s CEO William Lovette said in an earnings call. He said the company also decided to increases wages.

In Gilroy, California, Christopher Ranch is likewise embracing new machinery. The largest North American producer of fresh garlic, Christopher Ranch will spend about $1 million this year for a new Spanish-made robot in its packing plant that inserts garlic heads into sleeves, according to Ken Christopher, vice president of the family-owned business.

A 2014 report by WinterGreen Research forecast significant growth in the use of robotics in “every aspect of farming, milking, food production” and other agricultural enterprises. The report put the market for agricultural robots at $817 million in 2013 and projected that it would reach $16.3 billion by 2020.

Sensing opportunity, investors are stepping up to address agriculture’s labor squeeze with new automation, helped by falling electronics costs and advancements in software, robotics and artificial intelligence.

Google Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), this year spearheaded a $10 million investment in Abundant Robotics, which is working on an apple-picking robot. It also participated in a $20 million funding round for Bowery Farming, which uses robotics to grow leafy greens indoors.

Elsewhere, farm machinery maker Deere & Co (DE.N) announced that it spent $305 million to buy precision weed-killing robot maker Blue River Technology. INCENTIVES TO AUTOMATE

While little official data exists to illustrate the impact of Trump’s immigration policies on farm laborers, there is no question that illegal migration is down sharply since he took office in late January.

Slideshow (11 Images)

The number of people caught trying to enter the United States illegally from Mexico dropped almost 60 percent between February and May compared the same period last year, according to government figures. Between late January to early September, the number of individuals arrested in the interior of the country by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) rose almost 43 percent over the same period in 2016.

Gary Wishnatzki, a third-generation strawberry farmer in Florida, says scarce labor convinced him to raise $5 million so far to build a robotic strawberry picker that he hopes someday will reduce his industry’s need for field hands.

Bruce Taylor, CEO of Taylor Farms, a Salinas, California producer of salads and chopped vegetables for stores and restaurants, says his company has automated 20 percent of its packing plant.

The company has also teamed with an equipment maker to build a mechanized romaine harvester that is currently in use, and it is exploring automation for iceberg lettuce, broccoli and other field crops, Taylor said.

RISING PAY

In the meantime, farmers are raising wages. Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s most recent farm labor report shows average wages during the week of April 9 to 15 were $13.23 per hour, up 4 percent from the same week a year ago.

“The mantra in agriculture right now is automate what you can and pay well for the labor you absolutely have to have,” said Paul Pittman, CEO of Farmland Partners Inc, (FPI.N) a real estate investment trust that invests in North American farm land.

To win the loyalty of its full-time production workers, garlic grower Christopher Ranch decided to raise pay by 50 percent between 2016 and 2018, getting a four-year jump on California’s mandated $15 minimum wage that will take effect in 2022.

“Companies need to find ways of adapting and adjusting,” Christopher, the executive, said. “We’re going to take a small financial hit, but we’re going to be ready.”

Yucel, 44, a correspondent for the newspaper Die Welt, made the remarks in a lengthy interview with the German newspaper die tageszeitung to be published on Saturday.

Turkish authorities arrested Yucel, on Feb. 14 on charges of propaganda in support of a terrorist organization, during a wave of arrests prompted by a failed coup attempt in July 2016.

Germany is backing a complaint filed by Yucel with the European Court of Human Rights, and has repeatedly called for him and other Germans being held in Turkey to be released.

The detentions have contributed to a sharp deterioration in relations between the two NATO allies.

In total, Ankara has jailed more than 50,000 people pending trial and suspended or dismissed some 150,000 state workers including teachers, judges and soldiers since the coup, which Turkey blames on the movement of U.S-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulen has denied any role, and condemned the coup.

Yucel told the newspaper he remained in solitary confinement at Silivri prison, west of Istanbul. “Solitary confinement is torture,” he said.

Yucel also said that even his prison guards were afraid of making a wrong move: “A regime of fear is not directed solely at its critics, but also affects members of the oppressive apparatus.”

He said Erdogan himself had the most to fear: “He knows what to expect if he loses power, and that is why he is subjecting the whole society to his regime of fear.”

Yucel said he hoped the European Court would act quickly on his case after a Nov. 28 deadline for Turkey to submit its position, but that he was not sure what to expect.

He said that, like many of Erdogan’s critics, he was disappointed that the court had rejected cases brought by teachers and government workers affected by the crackdown, which Erdogan says is necessary to guarantee Turkey’s stability.

“But I also know the European Court of Human Rights was founded to deal with individual human rights violations, not to stop a whole country drifting into fascism,” he said.

L‘AD si è detto certo che, a breve, “ogni pagamento sarà digitale”.","MILANO, 10 novembre (Reuters) - Icbpi e CartaSì lasciano il posto a Nexi, nuova realtà che si pone l‘obiettivo di “costruire, in partnership con le banche, il futuro dei pagamenti digitali in Italia”.

Il nuovo brand del gruppo è stato presentato dal management nel corso di una conferenza stampa nell‘ambito della convention organizzata per presentare le strategie ai partner delle banche.

La storia recente di Icbpi-CartaSì è stata una corsa a perdifiato. Nel dicembre 2015 Mercury Italy -- veicolo partecipato dagli operatori di private equity Bain Capital, Advent International e Clessidra -- ha perfezionato l‘acquisto dell‘85,29% dell‘istituto bancario sulla base di una valutazione del 100% di 2,15 miliardi.

Nella primavera 2016 al gruppo si è aggiunta Setefi, ceduta da Intesa Sanpaolo per circa un miliardo.

A fine 2016 ha acquisito il 100% di Bassilichi per 230 milioni.

In febbraio è toccato alle attività legate al business merchant acquiring di Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena e di Deutsche Bank per 520 milioni.

Insomma, come ha sottolineato l‘AD Paolo Bertoluzzo, gli azionisti “hanno investito quasi 4 miliardi”. E il gruppo ha già annunciato investimenti in tecnologia per 1 miliardo nel quinquennio 2016-2021.

Ora il cambio di brand, con l‘abbandono di Icbpi (indolore, è stato detto più volte, dato il nome poco musicale...) e di CartaSì, marchio che generava nel pubblico “affettività, certo, ma legata al passato”, ha spiegato Bertoluzzo. Insomma, un gruppo focalizzato sul digitale non poteva continuare ad operare tramite un brand con il sostantivo “carta”. Da qui la scelta di varare Nexi, accompagnando il nuovo marchio con lo slogan “every day, every pay”.

La struttura societaria, conseguenza di buyout e successive acquisizioni, resta complessa: “Nel tempo la semplificheremo”, ha detto Bertoluzzo, “ma non è una priorità”.

Il gruppo attualmente gestisce 27 milioni di carte di pagamento, 2,7 miliardi di transazioni per 120 miliardi di euro (il mercato italiano ammonta a poco meno di 200 miliardi), 15.000 sportelli bancari automatici. Altri numeri: 733.000 punti vendita convenzionati, 150 banche partner e 122 miliardi di asset under management.

Ma lo spazio per crescere è enorme. “Per fortuna”, ha ironizzato Bertoluzzo, “il settore è in ritardo in Italia”. Qui, infatti, solo il 20% dei pagamenti è in forma digitale, contro il 40% della media europea, il 65% della Gran Bretagna e i picchi dell‘80% in Scandinavia. L‘AD si è detto certo che, a breve, “ogni pagamento sarà digitale”. Quando? “Un giorno... e questo giorno è oggi”, recita la campagna pubblicitaria di Nexi.

Bertoluzzo e due manager del gruppo (Roberto Catanzaro ed Erika Fattori) hanno spiegato nei dettagli i vantaggi delle transazioni digitali, i prodotti che verranno lanciati, l‘opera di informazione ed educazione nei confronti di commercianti e clienti, la campagna di comunicazione. Tra le novità, nella seconda parte del 2018 Nexi commercializzerà Poynt, un terminale per pagamenti che metterà a disposizione degli esercenti una sorta di app store, un menù completo di funzioni per semplificare le transazioni commerciali, con particolare focus sul contactless. L‘anno prossimo, del resto, è stato evidenziato, segnerà l‘avvento degli instant payments, le transazioni entro massimi dieci secondi, che “cambieranno radicalmente il sistema di pagamento”, ha concluso l‘AD.

The New Yorker said Weinstein had hired Black Cube, which markets itself as a group of ex-members of Israeli intelligence units specializing in business and litigation challenges, to help stop the publication of abuse allegations against him.

“Of course we apologize to whoever was hurt by this,” said Asher Tishler, who is listed as a member of Black Cube’s advisory board, during a TV interview on Israel’s The News. “In retrospect, it’s a shame we took the job.”

Tishler said he was not familiar with all the details of the work Black Cube carried out for Weinstein.

One account in The New Yorker article described two private investigators from Black Cube, using false identities, meeting with the actress Rose McGowan to extract information from her. McGowan has accused Weinstein of sexual assault.

“I think the job was taken in a justified manner. When it was discovered there was a problem, they stopped,” he said.

He added that any money the company made would be given to women’s groups.

More than 50 women have alleged that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them over the past three decades. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.","Israeli intelligence firm regrets working for Weinstein, official says",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1D92WY-OCAEN

The White House and Republican lawmakers have attacked the firm, Fusion GPS, over the dossier compiled by a former British spy that is central to investigations in Congress and by a special counsel into conclusions by U.S. spy agencies that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election and wanted to help Trump win.

The sources told Reuters that the negative information that Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya wanted to give to Republican Trump’s campaign at a June 2016 meeting in New York had been dug up by Fusion GPS in an unrelated investigation.

Trump’s congressional supporters have suggested that because Fusion also conducted research for lawyers representing a Russian firm in the unrelated matter, the dossier was part of a Russian campaign to help Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Trump backers call the 35-page report a “dodgy dossier” financed by Clinton supporters.

Russia has repeatedly denied allegations of meddling in the U.S. election and Trump denies any collusion between his campaign and Moscow officials.

In an interview with Bloomberg on Monday, Veselnitskaya said she went to the Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner, and top campaign adviser Paul Manafort to show them proof of tax evasion by major Democratic donors.

She said Donald Jr. asked her for written evidence that illegal funds went to Clinton’s campaign, Bloomberg reported.

Emails made public earlier this year by Trump Jr. showed that a publicist for the son of one of his father’s Russian business contacts helped introduce Veselnitskaya and advised him that she and her associates had “sensitive” information that could damage Clinton.

“I love it,” Trump Jr. responded, according to the emails.

In December, 2014, the sources said, Veselnitskaya, who then was involved in litigation pitting her Russian client against British-American financier William Browder, received a legal research memo reporting that the Ziff Brothers, two New York financiers allied with Browder, had made a large contribution to a Clinton charity.

The memo had been prepared by Fusion, which had been hired to conduct legal research on Browder by Baker and Hostetler law firm. The firm represented Russian businessman Denis Katsyv, who was engaged in disputes with Browder and U.S. prosecutors.

Glenn Simpson, one of Fusion GPS’ founders, met with Veselnitskaya about that litigation before and after her meeting with Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort, according to a source familiar with the matter.

However, a source familiar with 10 hours of testimony Simpson gave the Senate Judiciary committee in August said he told investigators he did not know of Veselnitskaya’s Trump Tower meeting until reports of it appeared in the media.

Representatives of the Judiciary Committee’s Republican majority did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Manafort declined to comment.

Representatives for Trump Jr. and Kushner could not immediately be reached for comment and neither could a U.S.-based lawyer for Veselnitskaya.

Two sources said the Fusion GPS work for Baker and Hostetler that produced the information Veselnitskaya offered Trump Jr. and his associates was unrelated to the firm’s work for Perkins Coie, a law firm that represented the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s campaign.

Yucel, 44, a correspondent for the newspaper Die Welt, made the remarks in a lengthy interview with the German newspaper die tageszeitung to be published on Saturday.

Turkish authorities arrested Yucel, on Feb. 14 on charges of propaganda in support of a terrorist organization, during a wave of arrests prompted by a failed coup attempt in July 2016.

Germany is backing a complaint filed by Yucel with the European Court of Human Rights, and has repeatedly called for him and other Germans being held in Turkey to be released.

The detentions have contributed to a sharp deterioration in relations between the two NATO allies.

In total, Ankara has jailed more than 50,000 people pending trial and suspended or dismissed some 150,000 state workers including teachers, judges and soldiers since the coup, which Turkey blames on the movement of U.S-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulen has denied any role, and condemned the coup.

Yucel told the newspaper he remained in solitary confinement at Silivri prison, west of Istanbul. “Solitary confinement is torture,” he said.

Yucel also said that even his prison guards were afraid of making a wrong move: “A regime of fear is not directed solely at its critics, but also affects members of the oppressive apparatus.”

He said Erdogan himself had the most to fear: “He knows what to expect if he loses power, and that is why he is subjecting the whole society to his regime of fear.”

Yucel said he hoped the European Court would act quickly on his case after a Nov. 28 deadline for Turkey to submit its position, but that he was not sure what to expect.

He said that, like many of Erdogan’s critics, he was disappointed that the court had rejected cases brought by teachers and government workers affected by the crackdown, which Erdogan says is necessary to guarantee Turkey’s stability.

“But I also know the European Court of Human Rights was founded to deal with individual human rights violations, not to stop a whole country drifting into fascism,” he said.

Home favorite Andy Murray, who memorably won the 2016 title to end the year ranked number one, three-times London champion Novak Djokovic, who Murray beat, pugnacious Swiss Stan Wawrinka and Kei Nishikori, along with his Japanese fan club, are all absent after succumbing to injuries.

Even a mouthwatering battle for the world number one ranking between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer has been scotched with Spaniard Nadal having taken an unassailable points lead.

Nadal’s participation is also clouded by a knee injury which hardly augurs well for the 31-year-old claiming the only big prize to elude him. He practiced on Friday but was less than positive about his chances of being 100 percent fit.

Should Nadal pull out, and the organizers will be crossing their fingers that he doesn‘t, the path would seemingly be clear for Federer, although anyone assuming the Swiss will claim the title for a seventh time is discounting the dangers that lurk.

Germany’s Alexander Zverev, Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, Belgian David Goffin and American Jack Sock -- all first-time qualifiers -- are not second-rate stand-ins.

Zverev, the 20-year-old German, has won five titles in a stunning season and catapulted to third in the world rankings.

The huge 02 Arena is the perfect stage for the man expected to be challenging for grand slams next season.

Dimitrov, long-compared to Federer in style, is finally living up to his potential while Goffin, all effortless movement and silky strokes, is a purists’ dream.

Sock is the one real outrider. He was 24th in the Race to London entering the Paris Masters and even had a golf trip booked in at Augusta National during the ATP Finals.

His first Masters 1000 title meant a hasty change of plans as he grabbed the final spot to become the first American to qualify since Mardy Fish in 2011.

Croatia’s Marin Cilic, the only other grand slam champion in the draw apart from the Federer and Nadal, is back in London for the first time since his tearful Wimbledon final loss, while unsung Austrian Dominic Thiem makes up the cast.

But there is no doubt who has the lead roles.

A year ago Federer and Nadal were both missing from London and many thought they might never be back with rackets in hand.

Yet between them they have returned from injuries and defied Father Time by dominating the year -- Federer winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon to reach 19 majors, with Nadal taking a 10th French Open and the U.S. Open.

Under the plan, Flynn, who was fired by Trump after just 24 days in the job, and his son, Michael Flynn Jr, were to receive up to $15 million for forcibly removing Fethullah Gulen from his U.S. home and delivering him to the Turkish government, people familiar with the investigation told the Journal.

Flynn is a central figure in Mueller’s investigation because of conversations he had with then-Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year and because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he did for a Turkish businessman.

The Journal reported that FBI agents asked at least four people about a December meeting in New York where Flynn and Turkish government representatives discussed removing Gulen, according to people with knowledge of the FBI’s inquiries.

The December meeting about Gulen was also reported Friday by NBC, which cited people familiar with the probe. The group also discussed how to set free a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, Reza Zarrab. Zarrab is in prison in the United States on federal charges that he helped Iran skirt U.S. sanctions, NBC said.

A Reuters report on Oct. 26 said one of Flynn’s business associates, former CIA Director James Woolsey, pitched a $10 million contract to two Turkish businessmen to help discredit Gulen while Woolsey was an adviser to Trump’s election campaign.

Woolsey was a member of Flynn’s firm, the Flynn Intel Group, according to a Justice Department filing by the firm and an archive of the company’s website.

Bank of America Corp analysts said in a note on Friday that volatility in high-yield has been “driven primarily by a confluence of several meaningful and yet only loosely related events,” including the collapse of the Sprint Corp and T-Mobile U.S. Inc merger, the U.S. Justice Department’s challenges to the AT&T Inc and Time Warner Inc merger, a credit downgrade for Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and other industry-specific news along with the potential for tax reform to be delayed.

“The impact on related (high yield) names has been significant enough to cause a market-wide reaction,” they wrote.

“Only a dozen names in the index have been responsible for half of HY index widening so far this week.”

The analysts also said the flatness of the yield curve has been hurting high yield, partly by hurting bank stocks, which benefit from a steeper yield curve that allows them to borrow cheaply, lend at higher rates and profit from the difference.

According to a draft of the final statement seen by Reuters and due to be released on Saturday in Vietnam, the 11 countries committed to “the core elements” of a deal while making clear more work remains.

Moving ahead with TPP would be a boost for the principle of multilateral trade agreements after U.S. President Donald Trump ditched it this year in favor of an “America First” policy that he reiterated at an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam.

Any kind of TPP deal looked in doubt earlier in the week after officials said Vietnam’s chief negotiator had walked out of one round of talks and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau then skipped a leaders’ meeting on the pact.

Negotiators returned to the table on Friday and agreed on some basics of what they called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).

Partly to counter China’s growing dominance in Asia, Japan had been lobbying hard for the TPP pact, which aims to eliminate tariffs on industrial and farm products across the 11-nation bloc whose trade totalled $356 billion last year.

The final statement said a “limited set of provisions” from the original deal would be suspended, adding further technical work was needed on four areas that still needed consensus “to prepare finalised text for signature”.

It did not say when that might happen.

“There is a lot of work left to be done but I think we have made good progress today,” Canadian Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told reporters in Vietnam late on Friday.

Canada, which has the second biggest economy among remaining TPP countries after Japan, had said it wanted to ensure an agreement that would protect jobs.

Champagne, who blamed “a misunderstanding about the schedule” for Trudeau’s absence, specifically mentioned the auto sector and cultural protection as areas needing more work.

Speaking separately, a Canadian official said the nations had “agreed to a framework towards the deal” with work programs to handle various outstanding issues.

As well as the cuts to tariffs, the TPP agreement has provisions for protecting the environment, workers’ rights and intellectual property - one of the major sticking points after the departure of the United States.

Canada’s position has been further complicated by the fact that it is simultaneously renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with the Trump administration.

At a speech in Danang, Trump set out a strong message making clear he was only interested in bilateral deals in Asia which would never put the United States at a disadvantage.

China’s President Xi Jinping, meanwhile, used the same forum to stress multilateralism and said globalization was an irreversible trend.

APEC, whose leaders hold their full summit on Saturday, has itself been buffeted by the changes under Trump.

South Africa was announced as the preferred candidate to stage the tournament ahead of France and Ireland after an evaluation by the Rugby World Cup Board that scored the bids on a range of criteria.

The 1995 hosts emerged as the clear winner, but the results were disputed by French federation president Bernard Laporte, who called them “nonsense”, and his Irish counterpart Philip Browne.

“It would be understandable if those sentiments were largely informed by disappointment,” Nxesi said in a statement. “It is our firm conviction that World Rugby has run a rigorous and professional process of unimpeachable integrity.”

The final decision will be made following a vote in London on Wednesday.

Nxesi said the criticism of the country’s ability as hosts was not unlike the scepticism ahead of the 2010 Soccer World Cup, which proved a success both commercially and for the country’s image.

“Even during the 2010 FIFA World Cup bidding process, our competitors and their fellow detractors had mounted a concerted smear campaign to besmirch and malign South Africa’s bid,” Nxesi said.

“They alleged that our country was grossly ill-prepared to host such a big event. They further declared our country to be the crime capital of the world. They prophesised impending doom and gloom that would befall the tournament, and to tourists and fans coming to our shores.

“All of the prophecies indeed came to nought. These latter day prophets and naysayers will again be proven wrong.”

Other than England, South Africa is the only country to host a soccer, cricket and rugby World Cup.

“We have a long history of major, incident-free mega events and we have developed expertise over many years in our security services to ensure that remains so,” Nxesi said.

“Our financial guarantee to World Rugby is irrevocable, the bid team’s ticketing plan will ensure minimum capacity of 91 percent over the tournament with some tickets provided free to communities and others costing as little as R55 (US$3.85) for some matches.”",South Africa hits back at 2023 World Cup doubters,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFKBN1DA1I0-OZASP

Meanwhile, Democrats and progressive groups, emboldened by Democratic election victories in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday, sought to capitalize on the accusations in support of the Democratic nominee, former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones.

Moore, a controversial former judge and a staunch Christian conservative, was accused by a woman of initiating a sexual encounter in 1979 when she was 14 years old and he was a 32-year-old prosecutor, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.

Three other women said he pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18, though none accused him of sexual contact.

The 70-year-old Moore again denied any wrongdoing on Friday during an appearance on conservative commentator Sean Hannity’s national radio show.

“These allegations are completely false and misleading,” Moore said of claims that he engaged in sexual misconduct.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which helps elect Republicans to the Senate, filed paperwork with federal election officials on Friday severing its fundraising relationship with Moore for the special election on Dec. 12.

Numerous Republican leaders either called on Moore to drop out immediately or said he should do so if the allegations prove true.

“Moore is unfit for office and should step aside,” former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said on Twitter.

But several Alabama Republican officials did not waver in their support of Moore.

The contrasting reactions echoed the rift exposed when Moore bested the incumbent, Luther Strange, in the Republican primary.

Strange was backed by Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies, while Moore’s candidacy earned the support of self-styled outsiders such as Steve Bannon, the former strategist for U.S. President Donald Trump.

Following the publication of the Washington Post story, several Democratic senators, including liberal Elizabeth Warren, sent email blasts to their donor lists, soliciting donations to Jones’ campaign.

The Democratic Party has been coordinating with the Jones campaign behind the scenes, offering logistical aid while wary of providing overt support such as television advertising in the deeply Republican state.

“The best thing that Democrats can do in the Alabama Senate race is make sure the Doug Jones campaign can run the strongest, most aggressive race that the campaign can,” said a Democratic operative, who requested anonymity.

Progressive groups MoveOn, Democracy for America and Indivisible expect the revelations to boost their grassroots efforts to engage voters in Alabama.

“We were planning to go bigger already,” Matt Blizek, who oversees election mobilization for MoveOn, said. “With the news and the fact that this is a close race, that’s only going to increase.”

A win for Jones could transform the political picture in Washington, where Senate Republicans hold a narrow 52-48 edge.

The race had been seen as a long shot for Democrats in Alabama, which has not elected a Democratic senator in a quarter century.

But a confluence of events even before Thursday had given some Democrats hope of an upset victory, despite Jones’ double-digit deficit in some opinion polls.

Moore was twice forced out of his position as the state’s chief justice, once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the courthouse and once for defying the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. Democrats have highlighted his penchant for incendiary statements about Muslims and homosexuality.

Zac McCrary, a veteran Democratic pollster based in Birmingham, Alabama, said he now sees Jones as the favorite.

“Roy Moore had much less margin for error than a Republican does traditionally in Alabama,” McCrary said. “Maybe for the first time in this campaign season, I would bet against Roy Moore representing Alabama in the U.S. Senate.”

But Jonathan Gray, a Republican consultant in Alabama, said voters were already questioning the veracity of the Washington Post story, given its timing. The only development that could sink Moore’s candidacy is a write-in campaign from a Republican backed by the party, he said.

Absent that, he said, all the analysis in the world will not change a simple fact: “Roy Moore wins December 12.”",Republican establishment bails on Alabama candidate after sex allegations,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-moore/republican-establishment-bails-on-alabama-candidate-after-sex-allegations-idUSKBN1DA2R9?il=0

The measures -- which freeze the assets of the officials and bar them from visiting Canada -- were enacted through a new law giving the government the right to penalize those it says are guilty of human rights violations, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Among those targeted are Alexander Bastrykin, Russia’s top investigator and a close aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The United States blacklisted him in January 2017, citing Magnitsky’s death.

“Today’s announcement sends a clear message that Canada will take action against individuals who have profited from acts of significant corruption or who have been involved in gross violations of human rights,” said Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland.

Moscow said last month it would retaliate if Canada banned individuals under the new law.

The Russian embassy in Ottawa later issued a statement denouncing the sanctions as “absolutely pointless and reprehensible”.

Canada has repeatedly condemned Moscow over Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and imposed sanctions along with other Western nations.

The United States adopted a law in 2012 freezing any U.S. assets of Russian investigators and prosecutors said to have been involved in the detention of Magnitsky. In retaliation, Moscow barred Americans from adopting Russian children.

Qualcomm said it would review the proposal but the San Diego-based company is inclined to reject the bid as too low and fraught with risk that regulators may reject it or take too long to approve it, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, who turned a small, chipmaker into a $100-billion company based in Singapore and the United States, told Reuters he would not rule out a proxy fight to convince shareholders to replace the board and accept the offer.

“We are well advised and know what our options are, and we have not eliminated any of those options,” said Tan, who has pulled off a string of deals over the past decade. “We have a very strong desire to work with Qualcomm to reach a mutually beneficial deal.”

A combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year. It would raise the stakes for Intel Corp, which has been diversifying from its stronghold in computers into smartphone technology by supplying modem chips to Apple Inc.

Qualcomm shareholders, who have watched their investment sour over the past year in the face of a patent dispute with Apple, would get $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom stock in a deal, according to Broadcom’s proposal. Including debt, the transaction is worth $130 billion.

“Now it’s a game of high-stakes poker for both sides,” said GBH Insight analyst Daniel Ives, who believes bullish investors were hoping for $75 to $80 per share. The offer represents a premium of 27.6 percent to Qualcomm’s closing price of $54.84 on Thursday.

Shares of Qualcomm, whose chips allow phones to connect to wireless data networks, traded above $70 as recently as December 2016 and topped $80 in 2014. They rose 1.1 percent to $62.52, suggesting skepticism a deal would happen.

Broadcom shares rose 1.4 percent to $277.52 after touching a record of $281.80.

REGULATORY SCRUTINY

Any deal struck between the two companies would face intense regulatory scrutiny, especially in China, which is home to expanding rivals. Chinese ambitions to buy U.S. chipmakers have been thwarted by U.S. regulators.

Qualcomm sells modem chips that allow phones to send data as well as communications chips for automobiles that handle “infotainment” systems and wireless electric vehicle charging.

Qualcomm provides chips to carrier networks to deliver broadband and mobile data and is also in the process of closing a $38 billion bid for automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV that it made last year.

Broadcom, Qualcomm and NXP together would have control over modems, Wi-Fi, GPS and near-field communications chips, a strong position that could concern customers such as Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd because of the bargaining power such a combined company could have to raise prices. However, a combined company would also likely have a lower cost base and the flexibility to cut prices.

Herbert Hovenkamp, who teaches antitrust at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, said that U.S. regulators would try to ensure the deal would not lead to higher chip prices.

”Based on what I’ve seen, it seems unlikely to me that there’s a basis for a challenge (to stop the deal),” he said.

Tan added that if Broadcom acquires Qualcomm which in turn has acquired NXP, the combined company’s net debt could be in the range of $90 billion.

Broadcom said BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have advised that they are confident that they will be able to arrange the necessary financing for the proposed transaction.

Broadcom also could spin out Qualcomm’s licensing arm, QTL, to get regulatory approval and funding for the deal, raising as much at $25 billion from a sale, Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah suggested.

Broadcom had $5.25 billion in cash and cash equivalent as of July 30. Qualcomm had $35.03 billion in cash as of Sept. 24. Broadcom also got a commitment letter for $5 billion in financing from private equity Silver Lake Partners, an existing Broadcom investor.

VULNERABLE QUALCOMM

Qualcomm stock has fallen this year because of a patent fight with Apple, which could quit using Qualcomm chips in its phones, and concerns that it may have to raise its bid for a NXP.

If Broadcom decides to make a hostile bid, Qualcomm’s governance rules would allow the rival to submit its own slate for the entire 10-member board by a Dec. 7 nomination deadline.

Two Qualcomm directors, Anthony Vinciquerra and Mark McLaughlin, have been aligned with activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC, which pushed for a shakeup of the company two years ago. Jeffrey Henderson, another Qualcomm board director, was added last year as a compromise candidate.

Apple, as a key customer, could play a key role. Analysts say that if Broadcom can salvage the Apple relationship, it would sharply increase potential returns from the takeover.

Tan also has a history of cutting costs at acquired companies, and Charter Equity analyst Ed Snyder predicted Tan would cut away waste at Qualcomm.

Broadcom plans to move its headquarters solely to the United States, which would allow it to avoid review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign ownership of U.S. assets.","Broadcom bids $103 billion for Qualcomm, open to going hostile",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-bids-103-billion-for-qualcomm-open-to-going-hostile-idUSKBN1D61EO

The coalition said on Monday it would close all air, land and sea ports in Yemen to stem the flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran, after Saudi Arabia intercepted a missile fired towards its capital Riyadh.

The al Wadea border crossing, linking Saudi Arabia with territory in eastern Yemen controlled by the Saudi-backed government, was reopened on Thursday, a Yemeni official and witnesses said, letting food and other supplies across.

The United Nations has said that a total blockade of Yemen could cause a famine that could kill millions. The government-held southern port of Aden was reopened on Wednesday, but ports in Houthi-held areas are still shut.

The Houthis, drawn mainly from Yemen’s Zaidi Shi‘ite minority and allied to long-serving former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, control much of the country including the capital San‘aa. Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies have been waging war against them on behalf of the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, based in Aden.

The Saudis and their allies say the Houthis get weapons from their arch-foe, Iran. Iran denies arming the Houthis and blames the conflict in Yemen on Riyadh.

FUEL AND VACCINES RUNNING OUT

Yemen’s stocks of fuel and vaccines will run out in a month unless the Saudi-led coalition allows aid into the blockaded port of Hodeidah and the airport at San‘aa, UNICEF’s representative in the country said on Friday.

Meritxell Relano, speaking by phone to reporters in Geneva, said fuel prices had risen 60 percent and there were urgent concerns about a diphtheria outbreak, as well as food shortages because of the port closure.

“The situation that was already catastrophic is just getting worse,” she said. “The impact of this is unimaginable in terms of health and diseases.”

After two years of civil war, Yemen has 7 million people on the brink of famine and has had 900,000 suspected cholera cases in the past six months.

United Nations aid chief Mark Lowcock said on Wednesday that if the coalition did not allow humanitarian aid access to Yemen, it would cause “the largest famine the world has seen for many decades, with millions of victims.”

The cholera epidemic had abated in recent weeks with the number of cases slowing amid a major push to fight the disease. But the World Health Organization said the progress could be reversed by the blockade.

“If the closure is not stopped in the coming days, we may see that the progress is stopped,” WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a briefing in Geneva. “We can see even more cases and more deaths as a result of not being able to get access to people.”

The closure of Hodeidah port prevented a ship setting sail from Djibouti with 250 tonnes of WHO medical supplies on Wednesday. Trauma kits in particular are running short.

“If the hostilities continue and the ports remain closed, we will not be able to perform life-saving surgeries or provide basic healthcare,” Chaib said.

Germany will double its aid to UNICEF for Yemen to 20 million euros this year to help deal with looming famine, bringing its total annual aid to Yemen to 70 million, a spokeswoman for the development ministry said on Friday.

“The suffering of the people in Yemen is inconceivable and it threatens to become much worse,” Development Minister Gerd Mueller told Passauer Neue Presse newspaper. “We must act now to prevent the death by starvation of millions of women, children and men.”",Saudi-led coalition opens Yemen border crossing; aid agencies warn of famine,https://in.reuters.com/article/yemen-security/saudi-led-coalition-opens-yemen-border-crossing-aid-agencies-warn-of-famine-idINKBN1DA2AH?il=0

The increasing use of the phrase “Indo-Pacific” by Trump and his team during their marathon Asian jaunt this week, instead of the “Asia-Pacific” term that has long been common in business and diplomacy, is being greeted with thinly-veiled sneers in Beijing.

“Trump choosing to use the term and actually making it happen are two totally different things,” Diao Daming, an American studies expert at Renmin University in Beijing, told a forum on Friday.

“The region is leading global development and Trump wants America to be first, so he could not ignore its existence. He had to say something to the region, so we have ‘Indo-Pacific’. But as yet it’s just a concept and we don’t know what it means.”

Beyond the wordplay lies both concern and scepticism in Beijing at U.S. attempts to complicate China’s strategic domain, particularly by encouraging rival power India to work more closely militarily with Japan. Tokyo recently backed New Delhi during India’s border stand-off with China.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying did not dignify “Indo-Pacific” by name in a statement this week, but noted that “this concept has been mentioned many times”.

“We hope that the Asia-Pacific region can become a stable, prosperous and orderly region....where we are capable of managing differences and have the wisdom to resolve the disputes,” she said.

“Indo-Pacific” has grown in usage across diplomatic and security circles in Australia, India and Japan in recent years, shorthand for a broader and democratic-led region in place of the “Asia-Pacific”, which to some places an authoritarian China too firmly at the center.

Trump and his team have given it fresh currency in recent days, starting in Seoul and Tokyo, building on the rhetoric of his secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who last month talked of the need to support a “free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific”.

Describing the Indian and Pacific Oceans as a “single strategic arena”, Tillerson went further as he described India and the United States as “bookends” within that region.

“In concrete terms, it will lead to great co-ordination between the Indian, Japanese and American militaries including maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, amphibious warfare, and humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and search and rescue,” he said.

STRATEGIC GOALS

Not all allies are convinced, however.

When Trump’s White House issued a statement after the U.S.-South Korea summit on Wednesday describing the alliance as a “linchpin for stability, security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific”, South Korea’s presidential Blue House issued a note of caution.

While the phrase “Indo-Pacific” matched some of South Korea’s policies aimed at diversification, “we felt there was more discussion necessary to see whether it is an appropriate term to be used in our efforts toward...joint strategic goals”, the Blue House statement said.

Welcoming the trend is Indian navy Captain Gurpreet Khurana, who was among the first to coin the Indo-Pacific concept in an academic paper back in 2007.

The rise of India as an economic power following its free market reforms and then its gradual military build-up was itself a key factor in the increasing significance of the Indian Ocean, he said.

“India could no longer be excluded from any over-arching reckoning in the Asia-Pacific, be it economic or security related,” said Khurana, of the military-funded National Maritime Foundation.

Chinese officials and experts have long bristled at any perceived attempt to contain a rising China.

But Trump’s Indo-Pacific policy should not be underestimated by China, because India, Japan and Australia are united by being on the wrong side of China’s development strategy for the region, according to Jia Wenshan, an expert on China’s foreign policy at the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization.

“China needs to as soon as possible deal with the Indo-Pacific alliance, as it is absolutely in conflict with Belt and Road,” Jia said, referring to the Chinese president’s signature initiative to re-establish trade and infrastructure ties between China and nations throughout Central and Southeast Asia.

The government and President Andrzej Duda have been negotiating since July, when Duda unexpectedly vetoed legislation backed by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party to overhaul the Polish court system.

“We’ve reached a preliminary agreement ... I hope that in late November we could discuss the project in parliament,” PiS parliamentary deputy and negotiator Stanislaw Piotrowicz said on Friday.

The proposals vetoed by Duda would have immediately removed all current Supreme Court judges unless they had the approval of the justice minister. Parliament would have gained the right to name most of the National Council of the Judiciary, which would nominate future candidates to preside over the Supreme Court.

By giving parliament effective control over appointing - and sacking - senior judges, the proposals raised alarms in the rest of the European Union, of which Poland is a member. The EU said they undermined the independence of the courts and threatened the rule of law.

The proposed compromise would still give parliament the right to name members of the National Council of the Judiciary, but that would require a three-fifths majority in the lower house of parliament, Piotrowicz said. Opposition parties would gain the right to propose judges, too.

If candidates failed to gain approval, they could be chosen by a simple majority, he said.

The PiS says the judicial system needs to be reformed because the courts are slow, inefficient and steeped in a communist-era mentality.

Duda’s veto of parts of the reforms and his proposed limits on its authority over the court system created a stalemate that could have stalled the party’s plans to reform not just the courts but the media and the electorate system as well.

According to a draft of the final statement seen by Reuters and due to be released on Saturday in Vietnam, the 11 countries committed to “the core elements” of a deal while making clear more work remains.

Moving ahead with TPP would be a boost for the principle of multilateral trade agreements after U.S. President Donald Trump ditched it this year in favor of an “America First” policy that he reiterated at an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam.

Any kind of TPP deal looked in doubt earlier in the week after officials said Vietnam’s chief negotiator had walked out of one round of talks and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau then skipped a leaders’ meeting on the pact.

Negotiators returned to the table on Friday and agreed on some basics of what they called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).

Partly to counter China’s growing dominance in Asia, Japan had been lobbying hard for the TPP pact, which aims to eliminate tariffs on industrial and farm products across the 11-nation bloc whose trade totalled $356 billion last year.

The final statement said a “limited set of provisions” from the original deal would be suspended, adding further technical work was needed on four areas that still needed consensus “to prepare finalised text for signature”.

It did not say when that might happen.

“There is a lot of work left to be done but I think we have made good progress today,” Canadian Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told reporters in Vietnam late on Friday.

Canada, which has the second biggest economy among remaining TPP countries after Japan, had said it wanted to ensure an agreement that would protect jobs.

Champagne, who blamed “a misunderstanding about the schedule” for Trudeau’s absence, specifically mentioned the auto sector and cultural protection as areas needing more work.

Speaking separately, a Canadian official said the nations had “agreed to a framework towards the deal” with work programs to handle various outstanding issues.

As well as the cuts to tariffs, the TPP agreement has provisions for protecting the environment, workers’ rights and intellectual property - one of the major sticking points after the departure of the United States.

Canada’s position has been further complicated by the fact that it is simultaneously renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with the Trump administration.

At a speech in Danang, Trump set out a strong message making clear he was only interested in bilateral deals in Asia which would never put the United States at a disadvantage.

China’s President Xi Jinping, meanwhile, used the same forum to stress multilateralism and said globalization was an irreversible trend.

APEC, whose leaders hold their full summit on Saturday, has itself been buffeted by the changes under Trump.

China’s Communist Party has decided to insert his view of the world – “Xi Jinping Thought for the New Era of Socialism With Chinese Special Characteristics” – into the constitution. He will be only the second leader after Mao Zedong to be so honored during his lifetime. Xi stands supreme. Yet that very accumulation of authority carries a large threat, both to his power and to his state.

Xi’s central goals are to strengthen China’s economy and military power and to lead a sometimes-ferocious campaign against corruption, bolstering these aims with a steady determination to bring the news media back under the tightest control. Inserting both his thoughts and his name in the constitution will further delegitimize critical commentary and unflattering revelations by making anything that contradicts Xi’s official line an attack on the constitution. Xi wants to render independent journalism impossible and choke off China’s liveliest medium of criticism – social media. Blocking these arteries could be his largest mistake yet.

Xi’s desire to curb the media is not new. In 2013, the then-new leader gave a speech to the National Propaganda and Ideology Work Conference in Beijing, in which he argued that workers in propaganda and ideology – broadly speaking, journalists and their minders – had become so undisciplined that some bordered on committing treason. His subsequent actions have been consistent with this belief.

In a book published earlier this year, I wrote, “one phrase in his speech was particularly telling. Xi said that ‘we must unwaveringly persist in the principle that the Party manages the media, persist in politicians running newspapers periodicals, TV stations and news websites.’”

The words “politicians running newspapers” were telling because they were a direct quotation from Mao, the founder of communist rule, still venerated in spite of his murderous policies that condemned millions. The phrase enshrined the dogma that politicians – the Party – is the final judge of what journalism can say. Journalism was far too important to be left to journalists.

In the past five years, those newspapers and TV programs which had enjoyed some autonomy – granted by Deng Xiaoping who was in charge of economic and social reform from the late 1970s to the late 1980s – have lost nearly all of their latitude. Journalists no longer can undertake any investigation not expressly permitted by the all-powerful Publicity (formerly Propaganda) Department. Usually that only allowed for investigating the affairs of one whom the Party wished to destroy.

The most adventurous newspapers – such as the Southern Metropolitan Daily and Southern Weekend of Guangzhou – were muzzled in 2013. Xiao Shu, a former editorialist on the Southern Weekend, wrote that the appointment of a new, severe head of Party propaganda in Guangdong, the region in which Guangzhou is the capital, meant that “the press in Guangdong retreated into its darkest period since the start of Deng Xiaoping’s 'reform and opening up' policies in the late 1970s.”

That was just the start. The monopoly broadcaster, CCTV, dropped or toned down all its investigative and analytical programs. Journalists, who had previously suffered only dismissal if they were deemed to have gone too far, were again imprisoned. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 38 journalists were in prison in China in 2016, putting it second behind Turkey for number of reporters jailed. Writers for foreign news media find it harder to get visas and harder to do investigative reporting.

Yet for Xi and his senior colleagues, the largest threat is the social media – which have become more popular as approved journalism becomes again controlled. The online postings are often critical; an anonymous author wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this month that “even a cursory glance at China’s new social media revealed that officials were seen as skinning the people, not serving them.” These public comments could not be allowed in China. This autumn, the authorities began investigating the most popular messaging services – Weibo, Wechat and Baidu - and found that the services were exchanging “terror-related content… rumors… and pornography.”

Yet as this repression continued and deepened, the pushback from society grows, and determined journalists and film makers continue to catalogue the darker sides of China. In 2012, a film called “High Tech, Low Life” followed bloggers on bicycles examining government censorship and the harsh and yawning divisions in Chinese society.

Suppression of forbidden information and commentary is much harder now. The sinologist Perry Link said in 2014, “internally it’s getting more hard to handle, because complaints and demands from below are increasing and are better organized than before.” The middle class now numbers in the hundreds of millions: in five more years – within Xi’s presidential term - McKinsey reckons that 75 percent of China’s urban middle class will enjoy a standard of living approaching that of Italy.

This more independent, and often independent-minded, youngish cohort is rapidly growing, as is their use of social media. The meeting of these two forces is unlikely to favor an attitude of resigned obedience, the more so since many will have been abroad, and many more will read foreign material online.

The result is likely to foster a more inquiring and critical citizenry, tending to question why a political monopoly that once caused the deaths of millions and now chooses for its population what they should read, see and text to each other should rule unchallenged.

The gamble Xi is making, by hugging all power to him, is that he and the forces he controls can limit any such developments. But that will not last. Corruption, pollution, inequality, interfering bureaucracy and controlled media will become prompts for protest. Xi’s choice to strengthen authoritarian rule rather than loosen it will prove to be a large error, for himself, his country and beyond these, the world in which China is such a crucial actor.",Commentary: China's media crackdown won't work,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-china/commentary-chinas-media-crackdown-wont-work-idUSKBN1CW2JW

WADA said it was confident the file acquired by its Investigations and Intelligence department is the Moscow anti-doping laboratory’s testing data from January 2012-August 2015.

Despite repeated calls for Russia to cooperate with international bodies to stamp out doping, Russian authorities have always denied the state’s role in the scandal.

WADA said it was finalizing the forensic analysis of the enormous backup file and expected to provide more information at its executive committee and foundation board meetings in Seoul on Nov. 15-16.

The doping agency said it had briefed the International Olympic Committee’s Schmid and Oswald Commissions, which are conducting investigations into Russian doping.

The new information could be a damaging blow to Russia’s chances of competing at February’s Pyeongchang Winter Games.

The IOC has said it will decide at its executive board meeting from Dec. 5-7 on the participation of Russian competitors in Pyeongchang.

Last year, a WADA commissioned report by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren found that more than 1,000 Russian competitors in more than 30 sports were involved in a conspiracy to conceal positive drug tests over a period of five years.

Investigations also uncovered sample tampering at the Sochi Olympics, including the switching of samples through a hole in the laboratory wall.

Russia escaped a blanket ban at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro although it was, and remains, barred from competing in international athletics events.

The country’s Paralympic Committee and anti-doping agency RUSADA are also still suspended over the doping scandals.

NEW INTELLIGENCE

WADA said its independent Compliance Review Committee on Friday was considering the new intelligence, which will shape the recommendation it intends to make to the foundation board on whether to declare RUSADA compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code.

”WADA continues to stand firmly behind the outcomes of the Agency’s independent McLaren Investigation,” WADA president Craig Reedie said in a statement.

“This new intelligence serves to reinforce our requirement of Russian authorities that they too publicly accept the outcomes; so that, we can all move forward in rebuilding public trust and confidence in Russian sport.”

One of the conditions placed on Russia before it could be rule compliant was that authorities responsible for the country’s anti-doping program, including the Ministry of Sport and the National Olympic Committee, publicly accept the outcomes of the McLaren Investigation, which uncovered widespread state-sponsored doping at the Sochi Olympics.

But in recent days Russian officials have pushed back on doping allegations, arguing that they have been politically motivated.

Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested on Thursday that allegations of a state-sponsored doping program in Russia were an attempt to sow discontent ahead of the country’s presidential elections and retaliation for alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election.",WADA says has database proving widespread Russian doping,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-sport-doping-wada-russia/wada-says-has-database-proving-widespread-russian-doping-idUKKBN1DA2P4

The exhibit drew protests by far-right activists when it was shown in the east German city of Dresden last February. Demonstrators said it belittled the memory of the city’s own devastating bombing during World War Two.

Halbouni said the exhibit, which evoked a scene from 2015 when Syrian rebels sought to protect Aleppo from government snipers, was meant to send a message of unity.

It was installed a day after the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

“The Brandenburg Gate is a symbol of destruction and of the end of war. It was also a symbol of division, but then came to represent unity,” Halbouni told Reuters TV.

Thousands of jubilant Germans climbed on top of the Berlin Wall near the 18th-century gate after the wall fell in November 1989, reclaiming what was a no-man’s land during the years of division between the former Communist east and West Germany.

Entitled “Monument,” the red and white buses stand just one block from the Holocaust memorial, a somber reminder of the millions killed during the Nazi regime of World War Two.

“This is an installation against war and against all that is going wrong in this world,” the artist said.

It is part of the Berliner Herbstsalon, or “Autumn Salon,” which includes 100 cultural events organized by the Maxim Gorki Theatre across the German capital.

Passersby stopped to eye the 12-metre-high buses.

“It’s a little bizarre, but ... that’s art,” said Dieter Krapp, a tourist from the Eifel region in western Germany.

Florian Breitenwieser, a Berliner, said the exhibit was a reminder of the peace and well-being Germany now enjoys.

U.S. energy companies added nine oil drilling rigs this week, the second increase in three weeks, bringing the total count up to 738, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report. [RIG/U]

Brent futures fell 41 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $63.52 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled down 43 cents at $56.74 per barrel.

Earlier in the week, Brent rose to $64.65, its highest since June 2015, and WTI hit $57.92, its highest since July 2015.

Both contracts were rose more than 2 percent this week, which was the fifth consecutive increase.

Traders said higher prices in recent weeks were the result of efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to tighten the market by cutting output, as well as strong demand and rising political tensions.

There are also expectations in the market that OPEC’s next meeting on Nov. 30 will agree to extend cuts beyond the current expiry date in March 2018.

“Market participants expect OPEC to extend the production cuts beyond March 2018 and stocks to decline further,” analysts at Commerzbank said, noting, however, that “the higher price level should lead to a further rise in U.S. shale oil production.”

U.S. production was forecast to rise to 9.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 and a record 10.0 million bpd in 2018 from 8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to federal energy projections this week. Output peaked at 9.6 million bpd in 1970. [EIA/M]

Goldman Sachs also warned of greater price volatility ahead, citing rising tensions in the Middle East, especially between OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iran, along with soaring U.S. oil production.

Hezbollah’s leader said Saudi Arabia had declared war on Lebanon and his Iran-backed group, accusing Riyadh of detaining Saad al-Hariri and forcing him to resign as Lebanon’s prime minister to destabilize the country.

“The political situation in Saudi Arabia remains sufficiently volatile to spike crude values by at least 50 cents at any given time as was the case (Thursday),” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Chicago-based energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a report, noting he did not expect Friday’s oil rig count to exert much price impact.

Another factor supporting prices was strong demand in southeast Asia, where the number of tankers holding oil in storage around Singapore and Malaysia has halved since June.

Sandra, who was already well practised in a circus trick involving a shaving brush, was given a paintbrush and she quickly adapted her skills to the canvas.

Richter said that unlike many elephants in Thailand that are thought to be forced to paint, Sandra does it by herself when she is in the mood.

Alvo da operação Lava Jato, Fillipelli chegou a ser preso em maio pela própria PF durante as investigações de outra operação, a Panatenaico, que apurou desvio de recursos no estádio Mané Garrincha, o mais caro da Copa do Mundo de 2014, que custou 1,5 bilhão de reais.

The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation across the Group of 20 Economies (G20),

is expected to announce in coming weeks a switch in focus from insurers’ size to their activities when deciding whether to subject them to increased regulatory scrutiny, said the source, who requested anonymity because the matter has not been made public.

Companies singled out for such scrutiny are required to hold extra capital to cover potential losses, increasing overall business costs and potentially reducing shareholder returns.

The insurance industry has been lobbying for years for regulators to move to the activities-based approach, arguing that their huge size should not automatically qualify them as systemically risky and on the hook for onerous bank-like capital rules.

The shift in the FSB’s approach to designating globally systemically important insurers, or GSIIs, follows pressure from the U.S. Treasury Department, which has been pushing the FSB to ease up on insurers and asset managers, the source said.

A spokesman for the FSB declined to comment.

The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged to overhaul regulations introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and put U.S. interests first when engaging in international bodies such as the FSB and the Basel Committee of banking supervisors.

In September, a group of U.S. regulators - known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council - removed AIG from its domestic list of systemically important insurers, raising questions over whether the FSB would keep AIG on its global list and continue to add new firms.

In a policy report published last month, the U.S. Treasury rejected the idea of singling out specific asset management and insurance firms as systemically risky and criticized the FSB for mission-creep and a lack of transparency.

The U.S. Treasury is shortly due to release a policy report on the FSOC designation process and powers, which critics including regulatory experts and insurers have said are too opaque and unaccountable.

AIG BAILOUT

AIG helped spark the global financial crisis, and the labeling of major financial institutions as systemically important stems largely from its $182 billion U.S. government-led rescue in September 2008. The bailout came just before the company would have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection amid mounting losses on its derivatives book.

Worried the insurance giant was “too big to fail,” the government stepped in to prevent further chaos to the financial system. The company ultimately repaid taxpayers in full by the end of 2012, with a profit of $22.7 billion, according to AIG.

Since then, regulators have primarily focused on the size of a company’s overall assets when assessing the risk they pose to the global financial system.

Moving to an activities-based approach could see firms on the list that largely engage in traditional insurance activities removed, but other non-designated insurers that use their cash to invest in risky assets, or which deploy high levels of leverage, added.

The suspension of the 2017 review means the 2016 list of nine GSIIs - which also includes MetLife Inc (MET.N), Allianz SE (ALVG.DE) and Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (601318.SS) - will continue to stand for at least the next 12 months until the FSB has completed an assessment based on the new methodology, the source said.",Exclusive: Global regulators to ditch 'too big to fail' gauge for insurers - source,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-financial-insurers-exclusive/exclusive-global-regulators-to-ditch-too-big-to-fail-gauge-for-insurers-source-idUKKBN1DA2J7

Museveni slowly drove past the crowd, a mix of schoolchildren and farmers, in a top-of-the-range pick-up truck, giving them a wide smile and a thumbs-up, the ruling party symbol. He was met with blank stares. The apathy - on a continent where strongman rulers are traditionally feted in their home areas - reveals the slow leaching away of political support from one of Africa’s longest-serving rulers.

Now, as his party plans to extend his rule, the president is increasingly reliant on a military unit from his home area, the Special Forces Command, to quell dissent over collapsing public services, corruption, growing poverty and brutality by security services. “We’ve had enough of him,” said butcher Steven Ruturukirira bluntly. In a lengthy speech, the 73-year-old Museveni studiously ignored the day’s hot topic: a legislative plan to remove the 75-year age limit for the presidency, clearing the way to extend his leadership of the oil-rich nation. “The pursuit of social and economic transformation of Africa is not a simple matter. It calls for visionary leadership,” Museveni told the crowd.

Relieved to see Uganda freed from the yoke of brutal dictators, the West has given Museveni an easy ride over the last three decades, glad of his support against radical Islam and his role as power broker in the volatile Great Lakes Region.

Uganda has also welcomed foreign investors like France’s Total, China’s CNOOC and Britain’s Tullow, who hope to start pumping 6.5 billion barrels worth of crude reserves through a planned $3.55 billion pipeline.

But as the opposition makes inroads in urban areas, Museveni relies on support in rural heartlands, as well as his special forces, exacerbating ethnic tensions and potentially sowing the seeds for conflagration when he eventually leaves power.

MILITARY SUPPORT

Currently, the age cap bars Museveni from standing in Uganda’s next elections, scheduled for 2021. But last month a ruling party lawmaker introduced a bill to scrap the rule.

The government gave each MP $8,000 to help them consult voters on the bill, provoking fury among ordinary citizens like quarry worker Ronald Malongo, 27, who is among a growing number of Ugandans who make less than a dollar a day.

“Museveni works only for his stomach and those around him,” Malongo panted as he lifted a load of granite. “We’re trash to him.”

An opinion survey of 1,200 Ugandans by pollster Afrobarometer a year ago found three quarters opposed the bill. Some legislators trying to promote it were met with jeers or violence in their home constituencies, media reported. Protests have been crushed by riot police, killing two. Opposition lawmakers tried to filibuster the bill in September, but said they were forcibly ejected from parliament by the Special Forces Command (SFC), a loyalist military unit heavily staffed with soldiers from Museveni’s Hima ethnic group. Several MPs sustained serious injuries, like Ibrahim Ssemujju Nganda, who said SFC forces dragged him from the debating chamber and choked him in a nearby room. Uganda is “gradually moving into some sort of a military regime,” he said. “I don’t see Museveni turning back, he has a group around him that can’t allow a change (because they are profiting from this).” At the time, the police chief told television reporters he had invited “sister” security agencies into parliament, a euphemism usually used for the military.

But military spokesman Richard Karemire denied soldiers had ejected legislators or strangled Nganda, telling Reuters: “Uganda is not a military state ... it’s a democracy.”

PRIVILEGED UNIT

Estimated at about 10,000, SFC has evolved from a small presidential guard to a fully fledged branch of the military that enjoys better welfare and training and controls superior equipment.

Soldiers in the SFC get an $80 per month “food basket allowance” that ordinary soldiers don’t get. That’s a powerful incentive when the number of Ugandans who spend less than a dollar a day has surged to 27 percent of the population, up from 20 percent five years ago, according to the statistics office.

The starting wage for an ordinary soldiers is $105.

The unit also gets better housing, training, and weapons than regular soldiers, two military officers told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“It’s an army within an army,” one the officers said. It was formerly commanded by Museveni’s son, Major General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, now a presidential adviser. Many believe he is being prepared to succeed his father after a military general, David Sejusa, wrote a widely published letter to the head of internal security in 2013.

Sejusa, an old comrade of Museveni‘s, asked for an investigation into an alleged plot to assassinate top government officials opposed to the Museveni “family project of holding onto power in perpetuity”.

Sejusa fled to the United Kingdom but returned to Uganda in 2014. He remains in the military, which bars him from politics, but has been sidelined from power.

Kainerugaba’s successor at the head of the SFC is also from the Hima ethnic group. Other prominent members include military chief David Muhoozi, and Museveni’s wife, Janet, the education minister.

“SFC is ethnic, it’s an army built on ethnic lines,” said Nganda, a former member of a parliamentary committee that oversees the military. The danger with rewarding ethnic loyalists with favors and privileges is that beneficiaries “will not sit back and watch power slide out of their hands,” Uganda political analyst Nicholas Sengoba said.

“These people will try by hook or crook to maintain the status quo,” he said. “That is where you have potential for violence.”",Uganda's president boosts military unit as rural support slips away,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1DA0OO-OZATP

FTSE 100 was down 0.7 percent, sliding for the second day alongside broad weakness in European trading. It ended the week with its heaviest loss in two months.

Industrials and construction stocks piled pressure on the index, tracking a slide in these sectors across Europe. They have been among the strongest drivers of stock market gains in the past months.

Bunzl dropped 6.3 percent, the weakest-performing large-cap stock, after a note from Morgan Stanley said the retail distributor’s shares were not yet reflecting potential disruption from Amazon Business, the online giant’s business-to-business distribution venture.

“Amazon’s intention to target B2B distribution has resulted in a significant derating for Rexel, whilst Bunzl has been unaffected. However, the Bunzl offer appears more vulnerable to us,” MS analysts said, recommending investors switch into the French distributor’s shares.

Retailers weighed on the index for a second day after a week of downbeat results from Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury’s confirmed investors’ widespread pessimism on the sector.

A survey showed British shops suffered their worst October for sales in a decade, sending M&S and Primark owner ABF down 1.5 to 1.8 percent.

“The leading data suggests to us that demand will be weaker over the next 6 to 12 months,” said Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald.

“We have already seen this in Q3 earnings for domestically focussed companies and CEO guidance for future quarters has been less optimistic.”

Burberry sank for a second day, extending Thursday’s sharp results-driven losses, after no fewer than five brokers cut their price target on the stock.

Belgian billionaire Albert Frere’s decision to hike his stake in the trench coat maker from 4 to 6 percent wasn’t enough to provide relief for the stock.

Energy providers Centrica and SSE, which have been under pressure due to the government’s plan to cap prices on energy, fell 1.6 to 2.4 percent.

Among mid-caps Ultra Electronics shares sank 11.1 percent after the defence contractor said it expected a delayed decision from the U.S. Department of Justice on its $234 million purchase of Sparton Corp.

Rival defence contractors Babcock and Cobham also sank 0.9 to 2.1 percent, while outsourcers Capita and Serco dropped 2.6 percent each.

Morgan Stanley said the outperformance of FTSE small-caps - up 35 percent since the Brexit vote - could fade, as analysts grow more pessimistic, with earnings revisions for the index recently hitting an 18-month low.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan budget watchdog in Washington, on Friday called a Senate Republican tax plan a “fatally flawed budget buster,” likening it to Republican legislation in the House of Representatives that the House tax committee has approved.

Both measures would add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the annual budget deficit and the $20 trillion national debt, according to congressional tax analysts.

The watchdog group estimated that $900 billion of the projected $1.5 trillion deficit increase would come from business tax cuts. The remainder would come from individual tax cuts, including a cut in the estate tax on inheritance that would help only the richest Americans, it said.

Republicans hold a tenuous 52-48 majority in the Senate. For that reason, if they lose the support of only three senators from their ranks, they cannot pass a tax bill as long as Democrats stay united in their opposition.

Nearly 10 months into his presidency, with his party in control of the House and the Senate, Trump is still without a major legislative victory. Failing to get a tax bill through the Senate could cost Republicans in November 2018’s midterm elections.

The Tax Foundation, another nonpartisan group, said the Senate plan would add $1.78 trillion to the deficit over a decade. It estimated that over the same time frame lower taxes would expand the U.S. economy by 3.7 percent, add 925,000 full-time jobs, raise wages by 2.9 percent and generate enough new tax revenue to erase all but $516 billion of the deficit effect.

DEFICIT REVERSAL

For decades, Republicans positioned themselves as deficit hawks, refusing to raise the debt limit, opposing Democratic spending programs and warning of crushing federal debts being passed on to future generations of Americans.

The tax plans now being debated represent a stark reversal, with congressional Republican leadership and tax law writers urging passage of deficit-expanding tax changes. Only a handful of Republican senators already have publicly voiced misgivings.

After the Senate plan was released on Thursday, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in a statement, “I remain concerned over how the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt by opting for short-term fixes, while ignoring long-term problems for taxpayers and the economy.”

Senator James Lankford said in a statement, “As we work on tax relief, we must also not lose sight of our responsibilities to protect the nation, provide basic government services and confront our federal debt.”

Senator Bob Corker, another Republican and a critic of Trump, did not comment after the Senate bill’s release but signaled fiscal concerns after the House issued its plan, saying he did not want tax cut legislation that added to the deficit.

“The current tax reform debate shows Congress just can’t seem to shake its addiction to debt,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

“If tax cuts paid for by debt are signed into law, Congress will have sent a massive, budget-busting tax bill to our children to pay, and it will result only in a short-term sugar high with little to no economic improvement over the long term,” she said.

The House is due to vote on passage of its tax bill next week. The Senate Finance Committee is due to begin formal consideration of the Senate’s version on Monday.

The Senate panel’s chairman, Republican Orrin Hatch, said he hopes to have the bill approved and sent to the full Senate by the end of next week. The House and Senate would need to agree on a single piece of legislation, pass it and send it to Trump for his signature.",Deficit worries complicate path for Republican tax cuts,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/deficit-worries-complicate-path-for-republican-tax-cuts-idUKKBN1DA2V2

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

May, who formally notified the European Union of Britain’s intention to leave the EU by triggering Article 50 of the treaty on March 29, said she would not tolerate any attempt in parliament to block Brexit.

By triggering Article 50, May set the clock ticking on a two-year exit process that has so far failed to yield a divorce deal and which was interrupted by her gamble on a snap election in June which cost her party its majority in parliament.

“While the divorce talks proceed, the parties are still married. Reconciliation is still possible,” John Kerr, British ambassador to the EU from 1990 to 1995, said in a speech in London.

“We can change our minds at any stage during the process,” said Kerr, who added that the legalities of Article 50 had been misrepresented in Britain. “The British people have the right to know this: they shouldn’t be misled.”

The day May triggered Article 50, she told the British parliament that there was “no turning back” and on Friday insisted that the United Kingdom would be leaving the EU at 2300 GMT on March 29 2019.

In a June 2016 referendum, 51.9 percent of voters backed leaving the EU while 48.1 percent wanted to remain.

Brexit supporters argue any attempt to halt the exit process would be anti-democratic, while opponents say the country should have a right to pass final judgment on any exit deal negotiated.

May, an initial opponent of Brexit who won the top job in the political turmoil that followed the vote, said last month that Britain would not revoke Article 50.

“NO TURNING BACK”

But ever since the referendum, opponents of Britain’s exit - from French President Emmanuel Macron and former British prime minister Tony Blair to billionaire investor George Soros - have suggested Britain could change its mind and avoid what they say will be disastrous consequences for the British economy.

Thus far, there are few signs of a change of heart on Brexit in opinion polls. Both May’s Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party now explicitly support leaving the EU, which Britain joined in 1973.

Supporters of Brexit have repeatedly said that any attempt to have another referendum, or to undermine Brexit, would catapult the world’s fifth largest economy into crisis.

“A second referendum would lead the United Kingdom into totally uncharted territory with very serious potential consequences for our democracy,” said Richard Tice, who helped found one of the two Leave campaign groups in the referendum.

But the Brexit process has been challenged in a number of cases in British courts, many focusing on the as-yet unanswered question: Can Article 50 be reversed?

The 256-word clause does not say whether it can be revoked once it is invoked. This means that, if lawyers ask for clarification, the question would have to go to the European Court of Justice, the EU’s highest court.

Kerr, who in 2002-2003 acted as secretary-general of the European Constitutional Convention that drafted Article 50, said the debate had been misrepresented inside Britain: it was clear, he said, that May’s Article 50 letter could be revoked.

Such is the interest in the legalities of Brexit that one prominent lawyer, Jessica Simor, has formally asked for May’s unpublished legal advice on the matter.

“Britain can basically change its mind at any time right up to the 29th of March 2019,” Simor told Reuters last month.

“If you can revoke Article 50, then parliament has the power to rescue the country if that becomes necessary – if the government fails to secure a deal, or the deal is terrible, or the people do not want it.”","Brexit never?

The statement was in response to a letter sent last month to Attorney General Jeff Sessions by 84 U.S. representatives asking whether domestic terrorism law covers activists who shut oil pipelines in October 2016.
“In a sane world, the DOJ would be using its discretion to prosecute pipeline and fossil fuel companies for causing irreparable harm to the planet,” he said.

The DOJ said it was committed to vigorously prosecuting those who damage “critical energy infrastructure in violation of federal law.”

Attempts to “damage or shut down” pipelines deprive communities of services and can put lives at risk, cost taxpayers millions of dollars, and threaten the environment, a department official said in a statement sent to Reuters.

The statement was in response to a letter sent last month to Attorney General Jeff Sessions by 84 U.S. representatives asking whether domestic terrorism law covers activists who shut oil pipelines in October 2016. The DOJ said it was reviewing the letter.

The DOJ did not say whether it would investigate or prosecute the protesters who broke fences in four states last year and twisted shut valves on several pipelines importing crude oil from Canada that carry the equivalent of as much as 15 percent of U.S. daily oil consumption.

The group Climate Direct Action said at the time the action was in support of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which has protested Energy Transfer Partners LP’s Dakota Access Pipeline.

Last month’s letter to Sessions, spearheaded by Representative Ken Buck, a Republican, and signed by at least two Democrats, said that when a protester burns a hole in an operating pipeline it risks igniting the contents and “killing not only the perpetrator but other innocent victims.” The letter had no details on any protesters who had ever actually taken a blowtorch to a live pipeline.

Five of the protesters, who say they only turned off valves on the pipelines, responded to Buck this week in a letter saying that their actions were nonviolent and were the “last resort in a desperate and necessary effort to avert catastrophic climate change.”

States brought charges against the protesters. Ken Ward, who closed an emergency valve on a Kinder Morgan pipeline in Washington state that transports oil sands crude from Canada, was sentenced to 32 days with most of it to be spent in community service.

The DOJ’s statement on the protesters is an escalation of the department’s stance from the days of the administration of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat. In 2016, the DOJ along with the Army Corps of Engineers gave a temporary victory to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe by refusing to approve an easement for Dakota Access. Trump moved to open Dakota Access early in his presidency.

Ward said the Justice Department was going after the wrong parties. “In a sane world, the DOJ would be using its discretion to prosecute pipeline and fossil fuel companies for causing irreparable harm to the planet,” he said.

Les divergences entre les deux chambres du Congrès risquent de compliquer l‘adoption d‘une réforme que l‘administration Trump présente comme la plus ambitieuse depuis celle lancée par Ronald Reagan dans les années 1980 et que les républicains ont annoncée pour la fin de l‘année.

The figures published on Friday suggested manufacturing may help to counteract a consumer-led slowdown and offered some vindication to the Bank of England which last week raised interest rates for the first time in more than 10 years.

“Stronger global growth and the effect of the weaker pound seems to be finally showing through in the UK manufacturing numbers,” said ING economist James Smith.

The Office for National Statistics also announced a 1.6 percent monthly drop in construction, while separate figures published on Friday showed British shops suffered their worst October for sales in a decade.

“Given that manufacturing represents a relatively small share of the UK economy, the persistent weakness in consumer spending is a bigger consideration for the Bank of England,” Smith said.

Most economists polled by Reuters think Britain’s economy will slow next year, in large part due to uncertainty created by a lack of progress in talks on the terms of Britain’s divorce from the European Union.

But next week’s data on wage growth, inflation and retail sales will offer a more complete picture of an uneven economy around which finance minister Philip Hammond must engineer an annual budget, due on Nov. 22.

NO CHANGE TO GDP VIEW

The ONS said Friday’s data backed up its preliminary estimate of growth of 0.4 percent in the third quarter, picking up a bit from earlier in 2017 but still slower than the rate in the euro zone.

Construction cranes are seen by St Paul's cathedral at dawn in London, Britain, January 13, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville

Industrial and manufacturing output shot up by a monthly 0.7 percent in September, the fastest growth for each sector since December last year and above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists, which pointed to a reading of 0.3 percent for both.

Industrial output, which includes manufacturing, accounts for 14 percent of Britain’s economic output.

Figures for the much bigger services sector are due on Nov. 23.

For the third quarter as a whole, there was little change to estimates for industrial, manufacturing and construction output that appeared in the ONS’ preliminary economic growth estimate.

Until now, the official readings of manufacturing have tended to show a weaker picture for the sector than upbeat surveys over 2017.

Separately, the ONS said Britain’s goods trade deficit narrowed by much more than expected to 11.253 billion pounds in September from 12.350 billion, helped by a rise in exports. Economists polled by Reuters had expected 12.8 billion.

That was not enough to prevent a deterioration in Britain’s trade performance in the third quarter, however, which looks likely to be a sizeable drag on economic growth.

Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the narrowing of the deficit in September almost entirely reflected an improvement in trade in erratic items.

Until now, there has been little sign of any big boost to British exports from the sharp fall in the value of the pound that followed last year’s Brexit vote.",Industry shines in otherwise hazy vista for UK economy,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy/industry-shines-in-otherwise-hazy-vista-for-uk-economy-idUKKBN1DA12C

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

Sculpted after artist Duane Hanson’s son, the lifelike artwork, titled “Baby in a Carriage, 1983,” is valued at about $80,000 to $120,000, according to director of American art at Heritage Auctions in Manhattan.

“It’s the greatest. If you could watch our footage of this baby in the window, it would crack you up because truly all day, people, women, children, mothers, grandfathers, cops will stop and look at it and wonder truly for a second, or more than a second, is that really a baby?”, Director of American art at Heritage Auctions, Aviva Lehmann, told Reuters, adding that this “is exactly what Hanson wanted you to think.”

The polyvinyl piece of a sleeping toddler wearing a lightlue sweatshirt and matching sweatpants, is topped off with a head of blonde human hair, furthering its authenticity.

“That’s art?” a stunned Rachel Leeds said with a laugh. “I thought that was a real baby.”

The baby’s shirt carries the bible verse, ”He that is without sin among you, let him first cast the first stone,” from the Gospel of John 8:7.

Hanson, a Minnesota native, is often depicted as a “hyper realist” artist.

“He’s been grouped with the pop artists, but he’s just all about capturing middle America, whether it’s a cop or a security guard or a tourist sitting on a bench in the sun,” Lehmann said.

As the afternoon wound down, the scuplture continued to confuse midtown Manhattan.

“I passed by it a few minutes ago on my way to a store and then on my way back I took a better look at it,” said onlooker Sarah Conforti as she snapped a photo of the sculpture. “The baby doesn’t look very happy.”

Passerby Rahmel Dantzler expressed having a similar reaction to the sculpture.

“Kinda creepy,” Dantzler said. “I’d run.”

Le gouvernement a mis sur pied quatre groupes de travail pour établir un diagnostic sur le fonctionnement de l‘apprentissage, un secteur qui coûte 8,2 milliards d‘euros aux entreprises aux régions et à l‘Etat, et proposer des pistes de réforme d‘ici fin janvier 2018.

Chapeautés par Sylvie Brunet, membre du Conseil économique social et environnemental, ils tableront sur le parcours et le statut de l‘apprenti, l‘organisation des centres de formation, l‘organisation des diplômes et le mode de financement.

Pour Muriel Pénicaud, la transformation de l‘apprentissage est “une mission d‘intérêt général”.

“Il y a 1,3 millions de jeunes dans notre pays qui sont sans emploi, sans qualification, qui ne sont plus à l‘école (...) C‘est évidemment un gâchis humain énorme”, a-t-elle dit à l‘issue de la concertation.

Elle était accompagnée par la ministre de l‘Enseignement supérieur, Frédérique Vidal, et le ministre de l‘Education nationale, Jean-Michel Blanquer.

“L‘objectif commun c‘est de lutter contre chômage et pour l‘insertion professionnelle des jeunes au moment même où nous observons que la reprise économique fait qu‘il y a des opportunités”, a dit Jean-Michel Blanquer, qui dit réaliser qu‘il existe en ce moment une inadéquation entre les formations dispensées et les besoins des entreprises.

Conscient qu‘un des freins principaux à l‘apprentissage est la mauvaise image dont cette voie de formation pâtit dans les collèges et les lycées, il a lancé mercredi une mission pour améliorer son attractivité au sein de l‘Education nationale.

“UNE RÉGRESSION CONSIDÉRABLE”

Si l‘ensemble des acteurs s‘entendent sur la nécessité de faciliter le recours à l‘apprentissage, ils se disputent la gouvernance et le financement du système.

Les régions, notamment, pourraient voir l‘intégralité de la portion de la taxe d‘apprentissage qu‘elles touchaient pour financer la formation initiale (51% de la taxe d‘apprentissage) reversé aux branches professionnelles, selon des informations publiées dans le journal Les Echos jeudi dernier.

Muriel Pénicaud n‘a pas souhaité commenter cette proposition. Mais elle précise que “tous les pays qui ont réussi une grande filière d‘apprentissage du CAP à l‘ingénieur, sont tous des pays qui ont mis l‘entreprise (...) au coeur du système”.

Pour les régions, il s’agirait là “d’une régression considérable”.

Elles ont fait savoir dans un communiqué que l‘apprentissage devait s‘inscrire dans la politique globale de “formation” et de “développement économique” des territoires. Elles estiment également qu‘elles apportent une gestion “égalitaire” et “équitable” pour les apprentis.

Pour la ministre, il ne faut pas “rentrer dans des débats purement défensifs et institutionnels”.

“La réussite de la concertation reposera sur cette ouverture des uns et des autres à tenir compte de l‘ensemble du potentiel de réussite de l‘ensemble des organismes”, a-t-elle dit.

Un avis que partagent les organisations patronales. “Il s‘agit de faire fonctionner l‘apprentissage”, a dit François Asselin, le président de la CPME (Confédération des PME).

Pour le Medef, il ne s‘agit pas d‘écarter les régions. La responsable de la formation au sein l‘organisation patronale, Florence Poivey, estime qu‘entreprises et branches doivent se retrouver au coeur du système mais “dans une co-construction” avec les autres acteurs.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

That’s a blow for ECB supervisory tsar Daniele Nuoy. The strict new guidelines for bad debt she unveiled on Oct. 4 could now become bogged down in a legal fight. The proposals, the legal opinion says, amounted to a new set of binding pan-European rules for lenders – the domain of EU lawmakers, not the ECB. The central bank can only issue recommendations to individual banks.

Resurgent economic growth in countries such as Italy, whose banks hold 175 billion euros of EU NPLs, presents an opportunity to take bolder steps to address the problem while times are good. The ECB has suggested that new rickety loans should be completely written off within a maximum of seven years, and not sit on the banks’ books indefinitely. Italy, for one, fears its lenders will not be able to do it with comfort that quickly.

In fairness, the ECB move looked a tad cheeky. For a start, it was hidden in an addendum to existing guidelines. And its “comply or explain” approach would make it difficult for banks to deviate from the standard line without being perceived as financially weak. With an eye on the central bank’s proposals, investors have already picked out lenders that look vulnerable like Italy’s Banco BPM and UBI Banca, whose shares dropped sharply in the days after the ECB proposal was unveiled.

If the European Parliament, where Italian politicians hold key positions, prevails the ECB’s overall drive to repair bank balance sheets could suffer.

In an interview, Chief Executive Mark Machin said the fund had experienced a “solid” quarter, generating C$9 billion in net income before taking into account a C$6.7 billion impact from adverse currency movements.
The strength of the Canadian dollar, which hit its highest level in over two years in September, means that overseas earnings are not worth as much when they are converted back to the domestic currency.
Machin said CPPIB was concerned by the status of talks to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement.

The CPPIB, which manages Canada’s national pension fund and invests on behalf of 20 million Canadians, said it ended the quarter to Sept. 30 with net assets of C$328.2 billion ($259.1 billion), compared with C$326.5 billion at the end of the previous quarter.

In an interview, Chief Executive Mark Machin said the fund had experienced a “solid” quarter, generating C$9 billion in net income before taking into account a C$6.7 billion impact from adverse currency movements.

“Our underlying investment performance was really robust. We’re not worried about the currency in the long-term,” he said.

The fund has diversified internationally, becoming one of the world’s biggest investors in infrastructure and real estate.

It is also a major global investor in equities and bonds, and derives the majority of its earnings from overseas.

The strength of the Canadian dollar, which hit its highest level in over two years in September, means that overseas earnings are not worth as much when they are converted back to the domestic currency.

The fund does not hedge against currency movements, saying that while they may impact its results in the short-term, it does not expect them to have a significant impact on its long-term performance.

Having warned in May that CPPIB was regularly loosing out in bidding wars for infrastructure assets because of intensifying competition, Machin said he was cheered by the fund reaching two major infrastructure deals during the quarter, investing in a U.S. power generator and a gas distribution business in Spain.

“For once we were not outbid. Both of those were satisfying to get done,” he said.

Machin said CPPIB was concerned by the status of talks to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement.

“It’s not a negligible risk that things don’t work out the way that we and Canada would like,” he said. “We want open capital markets, we want open trade and we think trade leads to better growth for everybody.”

MSCI’s global stock index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, declined 0.15 percent, slipping further from a record level. On Thursday, the global index fell 0.4 percent following 10 straight days of gains. The dollar index .DXY, too, fell 0.06 percent.

The MSCI world index surged more than 20 percent so far this year, and some investors believe a pullback is due.

“The pause that the market is currently in is directly related to what’s going on from a tax standpoint,” said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist for Northern Trust Corp.

Adding insult to injury, the pullback in stocks as well as softness in high-yield “junk” bonds this week did little to support traditional safe havens.

Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR fell 21/32 in price to yield 2.4037 percent. The 30-year bond US30YT=RR fell 50/32 in price to yield 2.8845 percent. [US/]

Meanwhile, German government bond yields climbed to their highest in over a week as euro zone bonds were sold across the board for a second consecutive day. The yield on Germany’s benchmark 10-year government bond DE10YT=TWEB hit 0.40 percent for the first time since Oct. 27.

Spot gold XAU= dropped 0.7 percent to $1,275.61 an ounce. Gold pays no interest, so demand for it wanes when bonds offer higher yields. [GOL/]

Citigroup Inc equity trading strategist Alex Altmann said it is rare for government bonds and equities to be hit at the same time.

“It’s a classic hallmark of momentum strategies unwinding,” he said, referring to a investment strategy that favors buying recent winners and selling losers.

”We may not get that calm ride into the end of the year.”

Coal producer Canyon Consolidated Resources became the second junk-rated company to pull a bond sale this week, on Friday, capping a bout of volatility in credit markets.

TAX OVERHAUL

U.S. Republican senators said they wanted to slash the corporate tax rate in 2019, later than the House’s proposed schedule of 2018, complicating a push for the biggest overhaul of U.S. tax law since the 1980s.

The House was set to vote on its measure next week. But the Senate’s timetable was less clear.

“I would say a compromise will be reached,” said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities.

Singles’ Day has quickly outgrown its U.S. equivalents, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This year more than 140,000 brands on Alibaba’s sites will offer online shoppers discounts on everything from Prada bags to Mexican avocados. Analysts reckon transactions will surpass the staggering $18 billion Alibaba handled last year – although different pricing and return policies this year mean the numbers will not be directly comparable to last year’s, and in any case they say little about the group’s financial performance.

There will be gimmicks aplenty, too. Last year, a Pokemon-style AR game let smartphone users catch virtual cats in stores to win coupons. Alibaba also live-streamed a fashion show, with real-time ordering of clothes worn on the catwalk.

This year, Ma is keen to showcase his marriage of online and offline commerce. So nearly a million physical retailers and convenience stores will participate in promotions and use Alibaba’s cloud computing, payments, and delivery services. For example, store owners can borrow from his financial technology group, Ant Financial, while shoppers can “smile to pay” with an Ant app or try on clothes on an AR-powered mirror.

With Alibaba shares more than doubling this year, investors seem to have bought into the company’s move away from its “asset-light” origins to target a larger slice of China’s overall retail market.

When a resident organized a beach clean-up that collected 33 tons of rubbish in a single summer, British-Ethiopian safari organizer Ben Morrison decided he couldn’t stand by while his beloved island was ruined.

So the tall, bearded 42-year-old decided to try to design a traditional dhow, or sailing boat, from recycled plastic, offering a market to recyclers and persuading locals to conserve shrinking woodland.

“It is getting harder and harder for boat builders to find wood. I hope that this project will allow the ancient skills of boat building to live on, by shifting from ever-scarce wood to plastic,” Morrison told Reuters.

Plastic pollution is a growing global problem, with patches of sea larger than some countries covered in plastic soup that strangles or poisons wildlife. The U.N. says by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish unless drastic action is taken.

In August, Kenya introduced one of the world’s toughest bans on plastic bags mandating four years in prison or a fine of $40,000 for even using one.

The East African country is now contemplating measures to control plastic bottles, said John Konchellah, chairman of the National Environment Management Authority.

“We want to see plastic bottles out of circulation,” he told Reuters. “We want to borrow some technology from the region like PETCO in South Africa, where major manufacturers came together with a body that recycles plastic bottles.”

Petco is a company formed by the South African plastics industry to recycle some types of plastic.

Morrison, working with eight expert Kenyan boat builders, is using plastic planks from the fledgling local recycling industry to build his boat, which he hopes to sail to Cape Town in South Africa.

“We struggle to produce a consistent material out of the recycled plastic,” he said. “It’s not easy. Sometimes we receive plastic planks from the factory that are full of air bubbles. We can’t build with them and so we have to start from the beginning again.”

Ali Skanda, a 44-year-old master boat builder, said in his childhood there was no litter on Lamu’s sandy golden beaches - just fishermen, dhows and donkeys. Now many donkeys are dying from eating plastic, he said - and so are turtles, cows and other animals.

“At the beginning I thought it was a crazy idea. How could I build a boat out of plastic?” he asked. “Some people have been asking what we can do about this problem. There is so much plastic scattered. This is something we can do.”",Kenya craftsmen to build boat out of plastic waste,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-environment/kenya-craftsmen-to-build-boat-out-of-plastic-waste-idUKKBN1DA237

The fate of AT&T Inc’s (T.N) $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), hatched in October 2016, looks set to end up in court as the two sides have so far failed to agree on what conditions AT&T needs to meet in order to gain antitrust approval.

Justice Department staff have recommended that AT&T sell either its DirecTV unit or Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) Turner Broadcasting unit, which includes news company CNN, a government official told Reuters on Thursday, on the grounds that a combined company would raise costs for rival entertainment distributors and stifle innovation.

AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson said on Thursday he would not sell CNN to win antitrust approval and would fight the government in court if the two sides could not reach an agreement.

“If we feel like litigation is a better outcome then we will litigate,” Stephenson told the New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday. He said the company had been ready to go to court the day the deal was announced in October 2016.

TRAVEL BAN COULD BE PRECEDENT

The deal took on broader political significance soon after it was announced when Trump attacked it on the campaign trail last year, vowing that as president his Justice Department would block it. He has not commented on the transaction since taking office in January.

Trump’s aggressive campaign comments have harmed legal arguments of his administration before.

Earlier this year, an appeals court refused to reinstate a ban on travelers from a group of Muslim-majority nations on the grounds that it illegally targeted people of one religion.

Explaining the decision, the chief judge cited a statement on Trump’s campaign website calling for a ”total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” The U.S. Supreme Court later partially reinstated the travel ban.

OVER BY APRIL

Stephenson has rejected the Justice Department’s arguments against the deal, saying it was a classic “vertical” merger that removed no competitors from any market and denied the company would be too powerful.

He said a combined AT&T and Time Warner would create a data and advertising company competing against the newest and most disruptive entrants into the media sector: Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, not other wireless phone companies.

Stephenson told the conference he has no reason to think Trump would be a factor in the deal’s approval and said he hoped the matter would be settled well before the April 22, 2018 deadline when parties can walk away from a deal.

The head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, said in a statement late on Thursday that he has “never been instructed by the White House” on the AT&T deal.

AT&T told the Justice Department on Monday that it believed it had complied with all legal requirements for the deal to be cleared, a person briefed on the matter said. That sets a deadline for the government to sue if it wants to block the merger. Officials said that detail could be as early Nov. 27.

SBI, the nation’s top lender with a share of more than fifth of the banking assets, reported on Friday a lower-than-expected profit, but its bad loan additions during the three months to end-September slowed sharply and pushed the overall bad-loan ratio down.

Its stock surged more than 6 percent after the results.

Helped by a stake sale in its life insurance arm, SBI said its second-quarter net profit was 15.82 billion rupees ($243.3 million), compared with a restated net loss of 5.57 billion rupees a year earlier. The profit was lower than analysts’ estimates of 26.96 billion rupees, marred by a rise in provisions.

Newly appointed SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar, who took over last month, said they used the cushion from the insurance stake sale to bolster provisions and improve the coverage ratio by 431 basis points in a quarter to 65.1 percent.

“The idea is that we enhance our loss absorption capacity,” he told reporters on a conference call, adding they aimed to further improve the provision coverage ratio as the banking sector moves towards international accounting standards.

Given the grim situation, the Indian government last month announced a $32 billion recapitalisation of state lenders to help resolve bad loans and kick-start lending growth.

SBI, which has the biggest share of the soured loans, merged its five subsidiary banks with itself earlier this year, driving a jump in its non-performing loans as of June to almost 10 percent. That ratio eased to 9.83 percent at end-September, while the additions to bad loans during the quarter was nearly a third of the rise in the previous three months.

“The results were comforting to see and is probably the best set of numbers from SBI that we’ve seen in the recent past especially when there is still uncertainty over non performing loans issue,” said Aalok Shah, a banking sector analyst at Mumbai’s Centrum Broking.

Bank of India, the market’s sixth-biggest lender by assets which also reported on Friday, posted a better-than-expected 41 percent rise in second-quarter profit and a narrower bad-loan ratio.

The banking sector faces a rise in provisions for loan losses after a central bank order to cover at least 50 percent of the loans to companies being sent to bankruptcy court. A dozen of the biggest loan defaulters are already at the bankruptcy court, while nearly 30 more could be headed there after December.

SBI said it has more than 50 percent provision coverage for the bankruptcy cases.

SBI shares closed 6.3 percent higher in a Mumbai market that ended up 0.12 percent on Friday. The stock has gained about 30 percent in the past one month to be the second-best performer among the constituents in the main market index.

“Wir biegen auf die Zielgerade ein”, sagte CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer am Freitag. Die Fachexperten von CDU, CSU, FDP und Grünen legten ihre Vorschläge in den Bereichen Europa, Bildung, Digitales, Arbeit und Inneres vor. Am Sonntag sollen die Parteichefs und Verhandlungsführer die noch offenen Streitfragen klären und eine Prioritätenliste anlegen.

Lindner machte bei der Forderung nach einem Aus für den Soli-Zuschlag weitere Zugeständnisse.

Die Generalsekretäre der Parteien zogen nach stundenlangen Beratungen am Freitagnachmittag eine positive Zwischenbilanz. “Es zeichnet sich schon jetzt ab, dass es einen gemeinsamen Rahmen (...) geben kann”, sagte FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer. CSU-Generalsekretär Andreas Scheuer sprach vom Übergang in die “dritte Phase”. Grünen-Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner forderte aber mehr Kompromissbereitschaft. Zuvor waren erneut Differenzen zwischen der CSU und den Grünen sichtbar geworden. Scheuer hatte den grünen “Bösartigkeit” vorgeworfen, weil sie sich über eine Blockadehaltung der CSU beklagt hatten. Kellner betonte dagegen, dass es bei den Fachthemen wechselnde Allianzen gebe - darunter sogar manchmal eine “Süd-Jamaika-Koalition” aus CSU, Grünen und FDP.

Am Freitagnachmittag wurde die große Runde der Jamaika-Sondierer über den Stand der Beratungen informiert. Danach sollte sich eine kleinere Runde aus den engeren Parteiführungen über den Sondierungsstand bei den Themen Wirtschaft, Verkehr, Landwirtschaft, Familie, Außen, Klima und Umwelt unterhalten. Gerade bei Klima und Verkehr gibt es noch erheblichen Dissens. Ein Abschluss der Sondierungsgespräche ist für Donnerstag geplant. Dann holen die Parteichefs die Zustimmung für den Beginn von Koalitionsgesprächen ein. Kanzlerin Angela Merkel will nach der CDU-Klausurtagung Mitte November die Mandats- und Amtsträger ihrer Partei in fünf Konferenzen in Stuttgart, Düsseldorf, Hannover, Leipzig und Darmstadt informieren. Die CDU bestätigte einen entsprechenden Bericht des “Tagesspiegel”.

SPIELRAUM VON 30 MILLIARDEN EURO

Beim Thema Europa gab es keine Einigung in der Frage, wie in der EU Investitionen gefördert und angeschlagenen Euro-Staaten geholfen werden kann. In anderen Bereichen wie der Bildung gab es dagegen Vorfestlegungen, die auch mit Ausgaben versehen waren. Bei der Digitalisierung wird in dem Sondierungspapier etwa ein Kostenrahmen für den angestrebten Ausbau der Internet-Übertragungsgeschwindigkeit in den Gigabit-Bereich bis 2025 von 20 Milliarden Euro genannt. Einig waren sich die Experten auch über eine verpflichtende Rentenversicherung für Selbstständige und den Ausbau der privaten Rentenversicherung.

Den Expertenvorschlägen müssen die Chefs der vier Parteien allerdings noch zustimmen. Möglicherweise müssen Vorhaben zudem wieder abgespeckt oder sogar gestrichen werden, weil es auch andere milliardenteure Wünsche wie den Abbau des Soli, eine Steuerreform oder Mehrausgaben für Europa, Verteidigung und Entwicklungshilfe gibt. Eine Jamaika-Koalition kann dem Bundesfinanzministerium zufolge in den kommenden vier Jahren aber nur mit einem zusätzlichen finanziellen Spielraum von maximal 30 Milliarden Euro rechnen.

SONDIERUNG IN UNTERSCHIEDLICHEN RUNDEN

Im Politikfeld Arbeit, Pflege und Gesundheit hatten sich die Unterhändler auf eine Ausdehnung der Riester-Rente auf Selbstständige geeinigt. Die Unterhändler von Union, Grünen und FDP wollen laut einem Arbeitsgruppenpapier mit Stand Donnerstagabend gerade für Gründer neben der Riester-Option noch eine Pflicht-Rente. Mehr tun wollen die Sondierer auch gegen Altersarmut von Geringverdienern: “Uns eint der Wille, dass jemand, der länger gearbeitet hat, im Alter mehr haben soll als die Grundsicherung.” Geplant sei zudem eine Verbesserung der Erwerbsminderungsrente. In der Alten- und Krankenpflege ist ein Sofortprogramm geplant. In dem Reuters vorliegenden Papier der Fachgruppe heißt es: “Es werden Sofortmaßnahmen für eine bessere Personalausstattung in der Altenpflege und im Krankenhausbereich ergriffen und dafür zusätzliche Stellen zielgerichtet gefördert.”

Seehofer hatte vor Beginn der Gespräche am Freitag nochmals an die gemeinsame Verantwortung der Unterhändler gemahnt. “Wir wissen um unsere Verantwortung gegenüber der Bevölkerung.

Em todo o processo de discussão e aprovação da norma, apoiadores e críticos da nova legislação discordaram praticamente de todos os aspectos da mudança. De maneira geral, os entusiastas da medida apostam no potencial dela em modernizar a economia brasileira, enquanto os queixosos alegam que a alteração vai precarizar, ainda mais, as relações trabalhistas no Brasil.

De todo modo, uma avaliação corrente é que o setor privado não deverá começar a celebrar logo no início da vigência da Lei 13.467 uma enxurrada de novas contratações de empregados que prevejam, por exemplo, alterações e flexibilizações nas jornadas de trabalho.

A estimativa é que as mudanças não devem ter impacto imediato, sendo necessário um tempo para que as principais dúvidas passem pelo crivo do Judiciário, para que então a norma comece a ser incorporada mais amplamente em negociações entre empregadores e empregados.

Uma das principais mudanças é que a nova legislação garante força de lei à negociação de acordos coletivos para alguns pontos. Antes não havia essa previsão em lei, embora a Constituição e o entendimento dos tribunais reconhecessem esse tipo de acordo.

Empresários receiam que o chamado ativismo da Justiça do Trabalho possa inibir inicialmente contratações com base na nova lei. Ao todo, a nova norma mexeu em quatro leis, inserindo e alterando mais de 110 dispositivos legais.

O presidente do Conselho de Relações do Trabalho da Confederação Nacional da Indústria (CNI), Alexandre Furlan, prevê que as mudanças vão demorar três anos para terem eficácia plena.

Ainda assim, a aposta de defensores da norma é que ela vai ajudar a impulsionar a recriação de postos de trabalho por melhorar o que consideram ser “distorções” da atual famosa CLT, a lei trabalhista ainda da era Vargas, criada 70 anos atrás, apesar de várias atualizações ao longo do tempo. Atualmente, o país tem 13 milhões de desempregados, segundo dados do IBGE, parte deles resultado da profunda recessão enfrentada pelo país nos últimos anos.

Na avaliação de apoiadores, a adoção de novos tipos de contrato de trabalho, como o intermitente e o teletrabalho (home office), e a prevalência das negociações coletivas e até acordos individuais, em casos, por exemplo, de horas extras e banco de horas de trabalho, são apontados como fatores que podem dinamizar a economia e também dar maior segurança jurídica para as empresas.

Iniciativas previstas na nova lei, como o fatiamento das férias e a adoção de banco de horas, já deverão ser colocadas em prática imediatamente. Mas outras questões deverão ter impacto somente no médio prazo, com o término das atuais convenções coletivas de trabalho, novos acordos e o “teste” da Justiça do Trabalho.

“Se conseguirmos corrigir esses problemas, o mercado de trabalho melhora, o ambiente de negócios também e indiretamente favorece a criação dos empregos”, disse Hélio Zylberstajn, professor da Universidade de São Paulo (USP), ao ressalvar que não há, em sua opinião, projeções estatísticas confiáveis de quanto poderia ser o impacto das mudanças para o acréscimo de postos de trabalho no Brasil.

Para o estudioso, o problema do país é a incerteza do empregador de ser surpreendido com passivos trabalhistas e imprevisibilidade quanto ao passado. “Nossa Justiça do Trabalho é arbitrária e enviesada”, criticou Zylberstajn, também coordenador do projeto Salariômetro da Fundação Instituto de Pesquisas Econômicas (Fipe).

ABUSO

Os críticos da nova lei, contudo, afirmam que não há provas de que as mudanças vão gerar novos postos de trabalho. Ao contrário, dizem que a tendência é que as relações trabalhistas fiquem cada vez mais precarizadas. Sustentam ainda que os salários, em geral, serão achatados, assim como ocorreu em países que fizeram reformas, como a Espanha e o México.

“A reforma apenas retira direitos”, afirmou o procurador-geral do Trabalho, Ronaldo Curado Fleury, que chegou a sugerir a Temer o veto integral a lei aprovada pelo Congresso. “Entendo que não há nenhuma relação entre a retirada de direitos e a geração de empregos”, reforçou ele, ao argumentar que estudos internacionais não mostram essa correlação.

O chefe do Ministério Público do Trabalho criou três grupos para passar um pente fino em todos os aspectos da norma. O primeiro é para avaliar a inconstitucionalidade --o trabalho desse grupo, por exemplo, já gerou uma ação do ex-procurador-geral da República Rodrigo Janot no Supremo Tribunal Federal contestando um eventual fim da gratuidade do acesso à Justiça.

Ainda há grupos para analisar a adequação da lei às convenções e tratados internacionais e outro para interpretar a lei em relação a todo o conjunto de normas brasileiras. Curado Fleury contesta a alegação de que atualmente há abusos da Justiça Trabalhista. Segundo ele, com base em dados do Conselho Nacional de Justiça, mais de 50 por cento das ações nesse ramo da Justiça referem-se a pedidos de verbas rescisórias não pagas, como aviso prévio e 13º salário e outras indenizações.

O presidente da Associação Brasileira de Advogados Trabalhistas, Denis Einloft, faz coro às críticas e considera uma falácia dizer que a mudança da lei vai gerar mais empregos. Ele se vale da experiência brasileira, afirmando que num passado recente o país chegou a crescer a elevadas taxas e viver com alto emprego mesmo com a legislação anterior.

“A partir da segunda-feira, primeiro dia útil, vai ser uma incógnita para os dois lados da relação, o trabalhador e o empregado”, disse Denis Einloft, ao prever que o próximo presidente terá de fazer uma nova reforma para aperfeiçoar a legislação.

Furlan, da CNI, avalia que se “criou um temor tanto do lado de quem emprega quanto do lado do trabalhador”.

Apesar das dúvidas, para ele, a nova legislação, vai garantir uma relação profissional mais próxima da atual conjuntura do país. “Antes se precisava do sindicato para tudo, agora não”, completou.

CONTESTAÇÕES

Apesar das intensas críticas ao texto, somente dois pontos estão formalmente contestados no STF: a ação movida pelo ex-procurador da República Rodrigo Janot sobre a gratuidade e outro, por uma confederação de trabalhadores, que questiona o fim da obrigatoriedade na cobrança do imposto sindical.

A avaliação dos profissionais ouvidos pela Reuters é que a eficácia da reforma será testada no dia a dia, a partir da avaliação dos casos que poderão gerar demandas na Justiça do Trabalho e que poderão até chegar ao Supremo.

Entidades patronais e a Advocacia-Geral da União, segundo uma fonte, preparam-se para tentar barrar uma eventual enxurrada de ações na Justiça do Trabalho. Se isso ocorrer, estão dispostos a levar demandas diretamente ao Supremo --usando um novo tipo de recurso, a Ação Declaratória de Constitucionalidade-- para que a corte decida logo se determinado trecho da nova lei está de acordo com a legislação vigente e a Constituição.

A intenção com isso é evitar que os casos se arrastem por anos, até décadas, em cortes inferiores até chegar ao STF e, dessa forma, garantir segurança jurídica para ambos os lados.","ENFOQUE-Polêmica, reforma trabalhista entra em vigor com cautela do empresariado",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1DA2NJ-OBRBS

A Myanmar military operation has driven out more than 600,000 Rohingya since late August and the latest refugees to find sanctuary in predominantly Muslim Bangladesh say many thousands more are still trying to leave.

Ariful Islam, of Bangladesh’s Border Guard, said about 200 people arrived on Thursday morning on the stretch of coast he commands at Teknaf, on the southern tip of Cox’s Bazar district.

Abdus Sabir was among a group that came ashore at Shamlapur after a six-hour boat journey, the final leg of an escape begun weeks ago.

“We fled because the military is still burning our houses,” Abdus, who had abandoned his home in the Rathedaung region of Myanmar’s Rakhine State, told Reuters.

Nearby, Husain Shorif, from the Buthidaung region, said he had rowed for four hours to help bring across 56 people on a raft cobbled together from bamboo and plastic jerrycans.

“Some boatmen were asking for huge money we didn’t have. So we made our own boat and came,” Shorif said, adding that thousands more Rohingya were still stranded at Pa Nyaung Pin Gyi at the mouth of the Naf river.

Reuters were unable to verify that claim as Myanmar’s military has restricted access to northern parts of Rakhine, where it launched a clearance operation it says was aimed at Rohingya militants behind attacks on 30 security posts on Aug. 25, but which UN officials described as “ethnic cleansing”.

The storm of opprobrium over the humanitarian crisis will expose Myanmar to more diplomatic pressure, at least from leaders of Muslim-majority countries and the United States, during three summits hosted by Vietnam and the Philippines.

Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of Myanmar’s less than two-year-old civilian administration, left on Thursday to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the Vietnam’s central seaside resort of Danang.

Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for standing up to the generals who had ruled the country for nearly half a century, Suu Kyi now effectively shares power with them, under a constitution drawn up in 2008 when junta was still in control, and has little control over what they do.

After Friday’s APEC summit, Suu Kyi will attend a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) grouping in Manila on Sunday, followed by an East Asia Summit in Angeles, just north of the Philippine capital.

Setting up a regional trade block, and concerns over North Korea’s ambitions to become a nuclear-armed state are summit priorities, but New York-based Human Rights Watch beseeched them to ensure stronger action by Myanmar to end the crisis.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will meet Suu Kyi on Nov. 15 for talks on the Rohingya crisis, and they are expected to hold a joint news conference.

OUTCRY

“World leaders shouldn’t return home from these summits without agreeing to targeted sanctions to pressure Burma to end its abuses and allow in independent observers and aid groups,” Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement that referred to Myanmar by its old name.

Adams said the leaders should discuss how to investigate alleged rights abuses and atrocities in Rakhine, and refer them to the International Criminal Court in the Hague.

The rights group also urged the Security Council to impose an arms embargo, economic sanctions and travel bans targeting Myanmar military officials.

U.S. senators seek to adopt measures for the United States to impose such sanctions.

The Security Council this week opted for a strongly worded statement scolding Myanmar, as diplomats said China and Russia would have vetoed any resolution.

China has publicly supported the Myanmar government’s efforts to “maintain stability” in Rakhine. The stance taken by China and other Southeast Asian governments fighting insurgencies by Muslim militants should spare Myanmar from any harsh spotlight in the summits’ final communiques.

“On the Rohingya, the leaders will agree that there is no quick fix to the long-standing inter-communal problem with deep historical roots that needs to be carefully managed,” an ASEAN diplomat told Reuters, adding that the group aimed to deliver $500,000 of relief supplies to Myanmar.",Rohingya row to Bangladesh as Myanmar's Suu Kyi runs summit gauntlet,https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya/rohingya-row-to-bangladesh-as-myanmars-suu-kyi-runs-summit-gauntlet-idINKBN1D9186

France became the first Western country to indicate that Saudi Arabia was holding Hariri against his will, saying it wished for him to have “all his freedom of movement and be fully able to play the essential role that is his in Lebanon”.

Hariri’s resignation has plunged Lebanon into crisis, thrusting the small Arab country back to the forefront of regional rivalry between the Sunni Muslim monarchy Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite revolutionary Iran.

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, said Saudi Arabia’s detention of Hariri, a long-time Saudi ally who declared his resignation while in Riyadh last Saturday, was an insult to all Lebanese and he must return to Lebanon.

“Let us say things as they are: the man is detained in Saudi Arabia and forbidden until this moment from returning to Lebanon,” Nasrallah said in a televised speech.

“It is clear that Saudi Arabia and Saudi officials have declared war on Lebanon and on Hezbollah in Lebanon,” he said.

His comments mirror an accusation by Riyadh on Monday that Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war on the conservative Gulf Arab kingdom.

Riyadh says Hariri is a free man and he decided to resign because Hezbollah was calling the shots in his government. Saudi Arabia considers Hezbollah to be its enemy in conflicts across the Middle East, including Syria and Yemen.

Western countries have looked on with alarm at the rising regional tension.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned other countries and groups against using Lebanon as vehicle for a larger proxy fight in the Middle East, saying Washington strongly backed Lebanon’s independence and respected Hariri as a strong partner of the United States, still referring to him as prime minister.

“There is no legitimate place or role in Lebanon for any foreign forces, militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the Lebanese state,” Tillerson said in a statement released by the U.S. State Department.

Tillerson told reporters on Friday there was no indication that Hariri was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will but that the United States was monitoring the situation.

The French foreign minister said earlier on Friday that he also believed Hariri was a free man - a statement at odds with the later French foreign ministry comment that it wanted Hariri to have “all his freedom of movement”.

Hariri has made no public remarks since announcing his resignation in a speech televised from Saudi Arabia, saying he feared assassination and accusing Iran and Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world.

Two top Lebanese government officials, a senior politician close to Hariri and a fourth source told Reuters on Thursday that the Lebanese authorities believe Hariri is being held in Saudi Arabia.

Nasrallah said Saudi Arabia was encouraging Israel to attack Lebanon. While an Israeli attack could not be ruled out entirely, he said, it was unlikely partly because Israel knew it would pay a very high price. “I warn them against any miscalculation or any step to exploit the situation,” he said.

“Saudi will fail in Lebanon as it has failed on all fronts,” Nasrallah said.

Riyadh has advised Saudi citizens not to travel to Lebanon, or if already there to leave as soon as possible. Other Gulf states have also issued travel warnings. Those steps have raised concern that Riyadh could take measures against the tiny Arab state, which hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees.

Hariri’s resignation is being widely seen as part of a Saudi attempt to counter Iran as its influence deepens in Syria and Iraq and as Riyadh and its allies battle Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Hariri’s resignation unraveled a political deal among rival factions that made him prime minister and President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, head of state last year.

The coalition government included Hezbollah, a heavily armed military and political organization.

STUCK BETWEEN “ANTAGONISTIC INTERESTS”

Aoun told Saudi Arabia’s envoy on Friday that Hariri must return to Lebanon and the circumstances surrounding his resignation as prime minister while in Saudi Arabia were unacceptable, presidential sources said.

An “international support group” of countries concerned about Lebanon, which includes the United States, Russia and France, appealed for Lebanon “to continue to be shielded from tensions in the region”. In a statement, they also welcomed Aoun’s call for Hariri to return.

In comments to Reuters, top Lebanese Druze politician Jumblatt said Lebanon did not deserve to be accused of declaring war on Saudi Arabia. “For decades we’ve been friends,” he said.

“We are a country that is squeezed between two antagonistic interests, between Saudi Arabia and Iran,” he said. “The majority of Lebanese are just paying the price ... Lebanon can not afford to declare a war against anybody.”

The Saudi foreign minister accused Hezbollah of a role in the launching of a ballistic missile at Riyadh from Yemen on Saturday. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen was an act of “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

Nasrallah mocked the Saudi accusation that Iran and Hezbollah were behind the firing of the missile from Yemen, saying Yemenis were capable of building their own missiles.",Hezbollah says Saudi declares Lebanon war with Hariri detention,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1DA0P3

Naomi, 27, was one of more than 200 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram from their school in Chibok, northeast Nigeria, in April 2014, and among the 82 girls freed by the jihadists in May, adding to 24 others who were released or found last year.

After months of counseling and medical care in the capital, Abuja, as part of a state rehabilitation program, the government sponsored the girls to start a special catch-up course in September at the American University of Nigeria (AUN) in Yola.

Naomi and five of her Chibok classmates enrolled at the AUN are suffering due to injuries inflicted during their time in captivity - from shrapnel in their bodies to fractured bones - said Yakubu Nkeki of the Chibok parents’ association.

Yet the government and the university are passing the buck on paying for their healthcare, according to the girls’ parents - mostly farmers - who say they are unable to cover the costs.

“The school said that they are not responsible, that the government is supposed to take care of everything,” Naomi’s mother Adamu told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.

“At first, the hospital gave her drip and medicine, but for the past four days they haven’t given her any because they said the medicine is finished,” added Adamu, who said she feels helpless and cries every time her daughter screams in pain.

“The doctor has not shown up. I am confused.”

A spokeswoman for the ministry of women’s affairs said the school fees paid by the government include medical bills.

“The federal government has handed over the girls to their parents after paying their school fees and everything,” said Suleiman Dantsoho. “The school should take care of her (Naomi).”

The AUN could not immediately be reached for comment.

“This is not the reality we arranged with President Buhari,” said Nkeki, chairman of the Chibok parents’ association.

“They said they will take care of our daughters ... make sure that they don’t suffer again,” he added.

“BURDEN”

The pain in Naomi’s abdomen began in captivity, but a doctor kidnapped by Boko Haram treated her with medicine, she said.

Naomi was referred to a government hospital in Yola last month after a scan at the AUN’s clinic revealed that she had a kidney condition, and the school’s doctor recommended surgery.

“The pain is too much. Anything I eat, I vomit,” Naomi said over the phone, her voice weak and barely audible.

Their three weeks together in hospital is the longest period Naomi and her mother have spent together since the abduction, which sparked an international outcry and a viral campaign on social media with the hashtag #bringbackourgirls.

But each day has been fraught with pain and tears.

Sometimes, the pain in her abdomen is so intense that Naomi rolls about on the floor or soaks herself in cold water.

“She told me that if she knew her health would be such a burden on me, she would have stayed back in the forest,” said Adamu, who had to rely on donations to pay for the five-hour journey from Chibok to Yola. “That statement pained me so much.”

Naomi worries about her mother, and tries to console her.

“If they will not pay my medical bill then they should allow me back in school, so that she can go back to Chibok,” she said.",Nigeria's sick Chibok girls struggle with school in dispute over medical bills,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1DA1T4-OZATP

Showing no sign of letting up despite clinching his fourth world title in Mexico at the end of October, Hamilton lapped the anti-clockwise track with a best time of one minute 09.202 seconds.

“There are two races to go. It is a better time than ever to apply even more pressure, just because you can,” the Briton had told reporters on Thursday.

Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas, who is bidding to end the season as runner-up to the Briton, was second fastest in 1:09.329.

The previous track record of 1:09.822 was set by Brazilian Rubens Barrichello in 2004 qualifying for Ferrari.

Hamilton, who also accused Renault’s Nico Hulkenberg over the radio of dangerous driving in forcing him wide onto the runoff, was half a second faster than Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen.

The Finn was the best of the non-Mercedes rest, with Red Bull’s Dutch 20-year-old Max Verstappen fourth on the timesheets on a sunny morning in Sao Paulo.

Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, who had an early spin, was sixth.

Mercedes have clinched the constructors’ championship for a fourth successive year and have said they will use practice at the last two races to experiment with processes and parts for 2018.

With none of the top four teams able to improve their placings or in any danger of dropping down the order, others were also turning their thoughts to next year.

“Obviously, both cars have got bits that they (the engineers) are having a look at for future events,” said Red Bull boss Christian Horner, whose team have won two of the last four races with Verstappen.

“These sessions are so valuable now. They are the last opportunities this year to try a few things out for future car development.”

Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo, who was fifth fastest, will have a drop of at least 10 grid places due to power unit changes while Toro Rosso’s Brendon Hartley and Pierre Gasly will also pick up engine penalties.

New Zealander Hartley, who won the world endurance championship for the second time last weekend, failed to set a time on the morning of his 28th birthday thanks to an engine blowup while French rookie Gasly also stopped early on.

“I don’t know the track so for me it was really important to get some running,” said Gasly. “But there is nothing we can do, we just need to wait.”

European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Bank of England head Mark Carney will form an all-star panel on Tuesday at an ECB-hosted conference in Frankfurt.

The subject? “Challenges and opportunities of central bank communication.”

Curve-flattening on both sides of the Atlantic, but more markedly in the United States, suggests investors have doubts over the future path of inflation and may be starting to price in a downturn just as the global economy picks up speed.

Since the Fed began raising rates in 2015, the difference between long- and short-term U.S. yields has shrunk to levels not seen since before the 2008 financial crisis, reaching 67 basis points US2US10=RR -- its flattest in a decade -- in the past week.

That partly reflects uncertainty about the passage of a Republican-sponsored bill to cut U.S. taxes, which has hauled down longer-term projections of inflation while expectations for upcoming rate increases push short-term yields higher.

With curve-flattening typically signaling a muted outlook for both growth and inflation, the trend suggests investors see a risk that the Fed’s current monetary tightening cycle will start to slow the world’s biggest economy.

A flatter curve, which makes lending less profitable, also poses a risk to the banking sector, nursed back to fragile health by central banks after it nearly collapsed a decade ago. But with crisis-era policies still largely in place, how would central banks cushion the impact of a downturn?

RECESSION RISK

S&P Global Ratings said in the past week that it sees a 15-20 percent risk of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months based on economic conditions, government policy uncertainty and continued gradual tightening by the Fed.

Citing economic indicators that show the expansion is either in or approaching a late cycle -- though not overheating -- it forecast robust GDP growth in the second half of 2017.

“Still, monetary policy risk remains in the coming months that is not captured in our quantitative assessment,” S&P said.

”The economy has now more or less closed the output gap ...That means monetary policy is more likely to transition away from the current accommodative stance.

Arrangement of various world currencies including Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, US Dollar, Euro, British Pound, pictured in Warsaw, January 26, 2011. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel

“Furthermore, if a sizeable fiscal stimulus from the U.S. government is to indeed go through in the coming months, it increases the chance of the Fed tightening policy more aggressively.”

Market expectations that the Fed will continue to tighten gradually have generally been preserved by U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to appoint Jerome Powell as Fed Chair when Yellen’s term expires in February.

But with a number of Fed vacancies to be filled, analysts at ING say the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee could yet take on a hawkish hue.

“The combination of upside risks to growth and mounting inflationary pressures, as well as a hawkish rotation in the make-up of Fed voters, suggests that markets are too cautious in only pricing in one (rate) hike next year,” they wrote.

“We’re expecting a December rate hike, and these various factors mean there is upside risk to our call for two further rate rises next year. What’s more, the long end of the (yield) curve will also have to deal with additional supply from the Fed’s balance sheet reduction programme.”

Powell, a 64-year-old Fed board governor and former investment banker, will take over an economy that has been expanding for more than eight years and where unemployment has fallen to its lowest since the early 2000s.

Under his leadership the Fed is widely expected to continue to raise borrowing costs gradually, as Yellen began to do in late 2015, and to shrink the central bank’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet.

It has raised rates twice this year and is widely expected to do so again -- to a target range of 1.25 to 1.5 percent -- next month.

Investors in Europe are also focused on potential future price growth, although the European Central Bank’s more accommodative stance means a different dynamic for bond markets.

The hunt for returns drove the German yield curve, Europe’s benchmark, to its flattest in about two months in the past week, though that trend was reversed on Thursday and Friday.

Market measures of long-term inflation expectations in the bloc have risen in recent months but remain well below the ECB’s near-2-percent target, giving funds confidence that the value of those investments will not be materially eroded. EUIL5YF5Y=R

The ECB’s decision last month to extend its asset purchase program until at least September and pledge to keep rates at record lows until well after that scheme ends have helped push bond yields across the bloc to multi-month lows.

The European Commission said on Thursday that it expected the euro zone economy to grow at its fastest pace in a decade this year before slowing somewhat. A flash estimate of third-quarter GDP in the euro area will be released on Tuesday and October’s inflation reading on Thursday.

Telkom, in which the government holds a direct stake of nearly 40 percent, is grappling with an economy that is barely growing amidst political uncertainty and sovereign credit rating downgrades. This has hit spending by corporate clients, the company said.

Headline earnings per share, the primary measure of profit in South Africa, fell 7.4 percent to 303.9 cents in the six months ended September. The company cut the dividend payout by 9.9 percent to 118.1 cents per share.

Shares in Telkom, which also runs a small wireless business, were down 6 percent at 50.71 rand at 1120 GMT, having hit a low of 49 rand earlier in the session and putting it on course for the biggest one-day decline since June last year.

The slide in the share price, which touched its lowest level since November 2014, could complicate the National Treasury’s plan to raise money from the sale of a portion of its $1.2 billion stake in Telkom to fund a bailout for state-owned airline SAA Ltd.

The Treasury needs about $700 million to inject into the national airline whose reliance on the government purse to keep it solvent has been repeatedly cited by major credit agencies as a threat to South Africa’s sovereign credit rating status.

“There’s still plenty of buyers, there will probably even be more buyers around now but the government will get less money for its portion of the stake,” said Wayne McCurrie, a portfolio manager at Ashburton Investments.

Telkom has been trying to reduce its dependence on fixed voice services, where revenue fell 6.1 percent, by building its own mobile phone business and buying an IT infrastructure firm BCX to improve its offering to corporate clients.

“The first half of the year was characterised by a tough economic environment and increased competition,” Group Chief Executive Sipho Maseko said in a statement.

“We saw corporate businesses defer their spend on information, communication and technology (ICT) as a result of an uncertain political, economic and policy environment,” Maseko said, adding that lower spend from government placed a further dampener on ICT spend in the public sector.

Wilson Ferreira Jr. concede entrevista à Reuters no Rio de Janeiro 10/11/2017 REUTERS/Pilar Olivares

A operação deve arrecadar 12 bilhões de reais para o Tesouro em 2018, além de gerar recursos para a Eletrobras e para abater encargos nas contas de luz ao longo dos próximos 30 anos, disse o executivo, que garantiu que a desestatização não irá elevar custos para os consumidores.

O governo revelou em agosto os planos de privatizar a Eletrobras, que serão efetivados por meio de uma oferta de novas ações que diluirá a União para uma fatia minoritária na companhia, de menos de 40 por cento.

“Eu acredito na execução desse projeto... ele é bom para o consumidor, porque vai baixar a tarifa. E não é só baixar, você vai criar condições de mantê-la baixa”, afirmou Ferreira, em entrevista à Reuters no Rio de Janeiro.

As ações preferenciais da Eletrobras acumulam alta de cerca de 20 por cento desde que o executivo deixou a privada CPFL Energia e assumiu a companhia, em julho de 2016.

Para atrair ainda mais interesse do mercado na oferta de ações, a Eletrobras definirá um plano de negócios para os próximos anos que irá prever a retomada dos investimentos da companhia em novos projetos de geração e transmissão já em 2018 ou no início de 2019.

“Não tenho dúvidas que, se tiver um plano de negócios criador de valor, entra quem não está e aumenta a aposta quem já está. Dúvida zero nisso”, afirmou.

O grupo atual de acionistas minoritários da Eletrobras inclui nomes como Banco Clássico, Citibank, fundos da gestora 3GRadar e o Banco Central da Noruega (Norges Bank), e outros fundos também são vistos por Ferreira como possíveis compradores de papéis da companhia.

“Todos os fundos que são atrelados ao setor elétrico globalmente, todos os fundos de infraestrutura, os fundos de países emergentes, fundos de pensão. É o investidor institucional”, apontou.

RISCO NO RADAR

Mas o presidente da Eletrobras alertou que é fundamental que o governo federal solucione rapidamente um impasse sobre o tratamento do risco hidrológico no setor elétrico, iniciado após anos consecutivos de chuvas abaixo da média na região das hidrelétricas do país.

Com pouca água nos reservatórios, as hidrelétricas não têm conseguido produzir toda a energia que venderam em contratos, o que impactou o faturamento das empresas do segmento e gerou uma guerra judicial no mercado de eletricidade que se arrasta desde meados de 2015.

Na privatização da Eletrobras, está previsto que a companhia utilizará valores arrecadados com a oferta de ações para pagar ao governo federal um bônus em troca de novos e mais vantajosos contratos para suas hidrelétricas mais antigas, mas o risco hídrico pode reduzir a projeção de retorno desses ativos.

”É muito importante... certamente o GSF (jargão técnico do risco hidrológico) é um ‘issue’ na precificação e é bom que seja resolvido antes da operação... Se a gente achava que isso era (um risco) marginal no passado, hoje a gente vê que não é”, afirmou.

O Ministério de Minas e Energia decidiu nesta semana dar um tratamento urgente ao tema, com o envio de uma medida provisória (MP) à Casa Civil que propõe um acordo entre governo e empresas para resolver o impasse.

ATIVOS À VENDA

O presidente da Eletrobras também avaliou que há muito apetite de possíveis compradores por um conjunto de 77 participações minoritárias em linhas de transmissão e usinas eólicas e por distribuidoras de energia da companhia que serão colocadas à venda até o final do primeiro quadrimestre de 2018.

O executivo disse que provavelmente todas fatias em ativos de geração e transmissão serão vendidas rapidamente e que muitas podem ficar com os sócios atuais da Eletrobras nos empreendimentos.

“Acho que pode vender as 77, antes das distribuidoras. Pelo interesse que a gente vê dos sócios, talvez se consiga vender para os sócios diretamente”, explicou Ferreira.

Ele disse ainda, sem citar nomes, que tem recebido muitas manifestações de potenciais compradores para as distribuidoras.

“O interesse existe e não é pequeno. É a ultima oportunidade de entrar em empresas com esse potencial... há uma demanda reprimida... o potencial de crescimento em cima da base que está lá é certamente muito maior (que em outras empresas)”, afirmou.

O Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (BNDES) divulgou nesta semana condições para a venda das distribuidoras, que incluirão a assunção pela Eletrobras de dívidas das empresas, que somam 20,8 bilhões de reais, contra um valor de 10,8 bilhões atribuído às concessionárias.

Segundo Ferreira, a Eletrobras irá provar que possui créditos e recebimentos que podem cobrir todo ou boa parte desse rombo.

A maior parte dos débitos é da distribuidora do Amazonas junto à Petrobras, e a Eletrobras negocia com a petroleira a troca de um grupo de termelétricas da empresa pelo abatimento das dívidas.

A elétrica pretende apresentar a seus acionistas em uma assembleia até o final do ano um plano para equacionar o rombo, incluindo a proposta de negociação das térmicas com a Petrobras.

“O que temos que fazer é que essas dívidas tenham correspondentes em créditos. É o que estamos trabalhando. Tem coisas líquidas e certas. Isso tem que ser submetido a uma assembleia para mostrar que essas dívidas têm créditos firmes... Os débitos com a Petrobras também deverão ser objeto nessa assembleia”, disse.",ENTREVISTA-Eletrobras vê forte apetite de investidores por privatização e ativos à venda,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1DA2QV-OBRBS

The federal government said it wants an excise tax on all cannabis products of C$1 (79 cents) per gram (0.04 ounce), or 10 percent of the retail price, whichever is higher. Excise taxes are paid by manufacturers.

Consumers would be levied federal and provincial sales taxes, which could boost the final price of marijuana by up to 15 percent, depending on the province.

“The federal proposal to share revenue 50-50 is not reasonable or sufficient,” said Jessica Martin, spokeswoman for Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa. “The transition to a legalized and regulated system will come with significant incremental costs to the province.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government wants to allow recreational marijuana across the entire country by July 2018, making it the first Group of Seven country to do so. But it has left many of the details, including how it will be sold, up to the provinces.

Federal and provincial authorities want the total cost of a cannabis product to be low enough to discourage people from the illegal market.

Marijuana producers’ shares rose as the plan was similar to one Trudeau outlined last month. Canopy Growth Co rose 2.7 percent to C$19.88, while Aphria Inc was up 3.7 percent at C$8.49.

Some provinces have expressed concern about how much it will cost to implement and supervise the new market, laying the groundwork for a potential conflict between the two levels of government.

Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, said each province needs to have the flexibility to support its own distribution system.

Canada’s federal and provincial finance ministers are set to discuss legalization of pot at a meeting next month in Ottawa.

Member of Parliament Bill Blair, the government’s point person on marijuana legalization, said total tax revenue could be as much as around C$1 billion, though he said that was a very high estimate and will depend on how big the market is.

Trudeau promised in his 2015 election campaign to legalize marijuana, saying it would keep the drug out of the hands of underage users and reduce related crime.

However, opposition has been brewing among some in the Canadian Senate, which could put quick passage of the law in jeopardy.","Canada proposes splitting pot tax, draws ire from Ontario",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1DA29N-OCABS

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Nigeria had already secured qualification last month and without the injured Victor Moses, and John Obi Mikel on the bench, they used the outing to give other players an opportunity to stake their claim for a place at the finals in Russia.

Obi Mikel’s midfield replacement John Ogu hammered home a left footed strike in the 63rd minute, taking advantage of a poor defensive clearance, to give Nigeria the lead, before Algeria were handed a soft penalty which Yacine Brahimi converted with two minutes to go.

Brahimi might have been sent off ten minutes earlier after appearing to head butt an opponent, but was only booked by Gabonese referee Eric Otogo.

Bitcoin has been on a tear in recent months, with a vertiginous sevenfold increase in value since the start of the year that has led to many warnings the bitcoin market - now worth well over $100 billion - has become a bubble that is about to burst.

It reached a record high of $7,888 around 1800 GMT on Wednesday after a software upgrade planned for next week that could have split the cryptocurrency in a so-called “fork” was suspended.

But it has quickly retreated from that peak, falling to as low as $6,718 around 1330 GMT on Friday. It later recovered a touch to trade around $6,880 by 1645 GMT, but that was still down almost 4 percent on the day.

“Bitcoin is all ups and downs,” said Thomas Bertani, chief executive of Eidoo, a cryptocurrency wallet provider that recently became the first startup in the space to take out a full-page advert in the Wall Street Journal newspaper.

“The market realized that the price rise was an over-reaching, so people started selling... (and) there are many long and short positions that amplify price movements.”

As bitcoin tumbled, Bitcoin Cash, which was generated from another software split on Aug.1, surged, trading up as much as 35 percent on the day to around $850, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.

Bitcoin Cash’s transactions are processed in so-called “blocks” that are larger in capacity than bitcoin‘s, so can therefore in theory allow for more transactions to be processed at any given time, making transaction fees much cheaper.

The fork that had been planned for next week, known as “SegWit2x”, had also intended to increase the capacity of the blocks, and could thus have reduced fees for bitcoin transactions.

Any investors, therefore, that see bitcoin more as a currency than a store of value might be choosing to buy into Bitcoin Cash now that Segwit2x had been scrapped, Bertani said.

“People who had been supporting Segwit2x could as an alternative move to Bitcoin Cash,” he said.

Tel Aviv-based Corephotonics Ltd filed its patent infringement case against Apple in federal court in San Jose, California, on Monday.

Corephotonics, which has raised $50 million from several high-profile venture capital firms and other investors, said its patented dual camera technology for mobile devices was incorporated by Apple in the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus without its authorization.

According to the lawsuit, Corephotonics Chief Executive David Mendlovic approached Apple about a partnership. Apple praised the start-up’s technology but refused to license it, Corephotonics said, even suggesting it could infringe the latter’s patents with little consequence.

According to the complaint, “Apple’s lead negotiator expressed contempt for Corephotonics’ patents, telling Dr. Mendlovic and others that even if Apple infringed, it would take years and millions of dollars in litigation before Apple might have to pay something.”

An Apple spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment.

Many high-end smartphones include dual camera systems that can zoom in without losing image quality. Apple has its own patents on dual camera technology.

Through its latest funding round in January, Corephotonics raised $15 million from investors that included Samsung Ventures, electronics manufacturer Foxconn and chipmaker MediaTek Inc.

Foxconn is one of Apple’s contract manufacturers. Apple is considering MediaTek as a chip supplier, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Corephotonics’ other investors include Magma VC, Amiti Ventures, Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and Solina Chau’s Horizon Ventures, as well as flash storage maker SanDisk and Chinese telephone services provider CK Telecom.

Corephotonics is represented by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, the law firm that advised Samsung Electronics Co on its patent litigation with Apple.

Meanwhile, Democrats and progressive groups, emboldened by Democratic election victories in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday, sought to capitalize on the accusations in support of the Democratic nominee, former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones.

Moore, a controversial former judge and a staunch Christian conservative, was accused by a woman of initiating a sexual encounter in 1979 when she was 14 years old and he was a 32-year-old prosecutor, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.

Three other women said he pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18, though none accused him of sexual contact.

The 70-year-old Moore again denied any wrongdoing on Friday during an appearance on conservative commentator Sean Hannity’s national radio show.

“These allegations are completely false and misleading,” Moore said of claims that he engaged in sexual misconduct.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which helps elect Republicans to the Senate, filed paperwork with federal election officials on Friday severing its fundraising relationship with Moore for the special election on Dec. 12.

Numerous Republican leaders either called on Moore to drop out immediately or said he should do so if the allegations prove true.

“Moore is unfit for office and should step aside,” former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said on Twitter.

But several Alabama Republican officials did not waver in their support of Moore.

The contrasting reactions echoed the rift exposed when Moore bested the incumbent, Luther Strange, in the Republican primary.

Strange was backed by Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies, while Moore’s candidacy earned the support of self-styled outsiders such as Steve Bannon, the former strategist for U.S. President Donald Trump.

Following the publication of the Washington Post story, several Democratic senators, including liberal Elizabeth Warren, sent email blasts to their donor lists, soliciting donations to Jones’ campaign.

The Democratic Party has been coordinating with the Jones campaign behind the scenes, offering logistical aid while wary of providing overt support such as television advertising in the deeply Republican state.

“The best thing that Democrats can do in the Alabama Senate race is make sure the Doug Jones campaign can run the strongest, most aggressive race that the campaign can,” said a Democratic operative, who requested anonymity.

Progressive groups MoveOn, Democracy for America and Indivisible expect the revelations to boost their grassroots efforts to engage voters in Alabama.

“We were planning to go bigger already,” Matt Blizek, who oversees election mobilization for MoveOn, said. “With the news and the fact that this is a close race, that’s only going to increase.”

A win for Jones could transform the political picture in Washington, where Senate Republicans hold a narrow 52-48 edge.

The race had been seen as a long shot for Democrats in Alabama, which has not elected a Democratic senator in a quarter century.

But a confluence of events even before Thursday had given some Democrats hope of an upset victory, despite Jones’ double-digit deficit in some opinion polls.

Moore was twice forced out of his position as the state’s chief justice, once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the courthouse and once for defying the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. Democrats have highlighted his penchant for incendiary statements about Muslims and homosexuality.

Zac McCrary, a veteran Democratic pollster based in Birmingham, Alabama, said he now sees Jones as the favorite.

“Roy Moore had much less margin for error than a Republican does traditionally in Alabama,” McCrary said. “Maybe for the first time in this campaign season, I would bet against Roy Moore representing Alabama in the U.S. Senate.”

But Jonathan Gray, a Republican consultant in Alabama, said voters were already questioning the veracity of the Washington Post story, given its timing. The only development that could sink Moore’s candidacy is a write-in campaign from a Republican backed by the party, he said.

Absent that, he said, all the analysis in the world will not change a simple fact: “Roy Moore wins December 12.”",Republican establishment bails on Alabama candidate after sex allegations,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-moore/republican-establishment-bails-on-alabama-candidate-after-sex-allegations-idUSKBN1DA2R9?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

With a host of established players missing, England’s callow defence was routinely sliced open in the first period and they needed debutant goalkeeper Jordan Pickford to keep the Germans at bay.

But England also had some bright moments, with midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek making an assured debut and having great chances at the start and end of the match.

England manager Gareth Southgate, shorn of more than half his likely first-choice side, was pleased with much that he saw, despite the result leaving England still searching for their first home win over their old rivals since 1975.

“In the first half we needed a couple of really good saves from Jordan Pickford - we caused our own problems with a couple of those. But we posed our own questions and I thought we used the ball well,” Southgate told ITV.

“Ruben Loftus-Cheek did everything I know he can do. It took him 10 minutes to realise he is OK at this level. He is capable of anything. He has the physical attributes and can handle the ball. He will gain huge confidence from it. There will be harder tests as the likes of Germany will have another gear to go to.”

Germany were also in somewhat experimental mode and their coach Joachim Loew will have been delighted in particular with an impressive display by Leroy Sane as his team stretched their unbeaten run to 20 games since losing to France in the Euro 2016 semi-finals.

England’s young starting team boasted 101 caps between them and one of the debutants, Tammy Abraham, was a centimetre away from scoring with his first touch in international football after 90 seconds.

Germany too were without some heavyweight players and gave a debut to defender Marcel Halstenberg and had goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen making his second appearance.

GERMANY DOMINATE

They soon took control as Sane clipped a 20-metre curler against the bar after 20 minutes, Pickford saved well from Timo Werner and Phil Jones headed Sane’s follow-up off the line.

Jones, the team’s most experienced player, then limped off and another debutant, Liverpool’s 20-year-old Joe Gomez, took his place to trim England’s cap count to less than Germany midfielder Mesut Ozil’s personal tally of 86.

The lack of experience and familiarity was exposed again soon afterwards when Pickford went full length to again deny Werner as Sane was seemingly given the freedom of Wembley.

Ter Stegen made an excellent reflex save to get low and palm clear striker Jamie Vardy’s header early in the second half but the steam then gradually left the game.

Midfielder Jack Cork came on as a late substitute to make it five England debuts on the night and another replacement, Jesse Lingard, should really have won it with the last kick of the match but his close-range shot flew over the bar.

England captain Eric Dier said: “I think we did well. Obviously against a well-oiled machine they will have periods in the game where they control possession but I didn’t think they hurt us. And we had our periods, broke well at times and are actually disappointed we haven’t scored.”

Between scandals over sex, secret meetings, political donors and the royal family, the government is melting down.

British Prime Minister Theresa May and her deputy, Damian Green, in the House of Commons, Nov. 1, 2017. Green is fighting allegations of harassment and having “extreme pornography"" on his parliamentary computer. Parliament TV handout via REUTERS

The country’s own newspapers say so. On Thursday, The Times carried the front page headline “Brussels braced for fall of Theresa May’s government” – this before it has served half a year.

Where British journalism fails to convey the dimensions of the mess, foreign journalists oblige. Steven Erlanger of the New York Times told his Sunday readers in early November that the country is “heading to nowhere, while on deck, fire has broken out and the captain — poor Theresa May — is lashed to the mast, without the authority to decide whether to turn to port or to starboard.” The Irish writer Fintan O’Toole writes in the New York Review of Books that “Brexit is fueled by fantasies of “Empire 2.0,” a reconstructed global trading empire in which the old colonies will be reconnected to the mother country.”

The first of these, if finely phrased, is overblown; the second is absurd. No-one but a real fantasist believes the empire can be reconstituted, or wishes it to be. But schadenfreude is too attractive an emotion to pass up, an occasion to pay the U.K. back for its haughtiness to other countries it deems less well governed than itself.

The real question here is whether the May government can survive. And what happens if it can’t?

The current mess is the result of the workings of democracy, which decreed opening the gates to the barbarians. Barbarians are the forces which mainstream politicians try to keep outside the walls; now, they have forced an entry. In the United States, the invasion is led by Donald Trump: his barbarians are those who take seriously his calls to “drain the swamp” (of Washington) and “put America first” (by de-linking it from much of what is understood by globalization).

Britain’s barbarians have breached the walls of both major parties. Labour is now led by a group of far leftists, gathered round the figure of Jeremy Corbyn, a man who believes in the socialization of much of the economy, has supported and praised the IRA, Hamas and Hezbollah and favors a call for the former Labour leader, Tony Blair, to be tried for war crimes. Corbyn and his fellow radical members of parliament were barely tolerated by the rest of their parliamentary colleagues, yet when he ran for Labour’s leadership in 2015, a sudden swell of support from mainly young party members propelled him, astonished, to the leadership. The barbarians had flooded in; the party’s unexpectedly good showing in the general election this summer confirmed they were inside the walls to stay.

The Conservative barbarians are those who hate Britain’s membership of the European Union. The parliamentary barbarian group – a minority – plagued the leadership: John Major, prime minister from 1991-1997, called them, unaware of an open microphone, “bastards”. Their strength forced David Cameron, prime minister from 2010-2016, into the fateful decision to put the issue of EU membership to a referendum. He lost, and so the victorious barbarians inherited the party.

It was not, however, one of their number who became prime minister. That was “poor Theresa May”, an unenthusiastic European Union remainer, who won the party leadership over two Brexiteer challengers, but who fully accepted that the people had spoken and Britain’s exit from the EU would be pursued.

In that pursuit, a sea of troubles has washed about her, and about the country. Many in her cabinet are not Brexiteers; they believe that exit is folly, and seek to extend the period of leaving the Union in order to give British business and finance more time to prepare for the new conditions. The three cabinet members most concerned with Brexit include Boris Johnson, the unpredictable Foreign Secretary, who differed sharply with the cautious chancellor, Philip Hammond, a Remainer, on the timetable for leaving. David Davis, the main negotiator with the EU on the terms of Brexit, was called stupid, lazy and “vain as Narcissus” by the former campaign director of the Vote Leave campaign, a supposed ally. The upper reaches of the governing party are murderous.

Negotiations are, in any case, going badly. The EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, has insisted on a rigid timetable which doesn’t suit the UK, while issues like the amount the U.K. must pay before leaving remains a block on progress.

The sea has been made much rougher by a growing sexual harassment scandal that led to the resignation of defense minister Michael Fallon. Damian Green, effectively the deputy prime minister, is fighting allegations of harassment and “extreme pornography” said to have been found on his parliamentary computer.

The scandals multiply, usually displayed at the top of TV bulletins and on front pages. A careless remark by Foreign Secretary Johnson may have prolonged the prison sentence of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British citizen jailed in Iran on spying charges by wrongly claiming she had been training journalists there. Lord Ashcroft, a major Conservative donor, was revealed in the “Paradise Papers” leak to have sheltered a large part of his wealth offshore.

He was not alone: both the Queen and her son, Prince Charles, were revealed by the leak as having benefitted from tax-free shelters.

In the same week, International Development Secretary Priti Patel was forced to resign when she was found to have concealed a series of meetings with Israeli ministers without the knowledge of either the Foreign Office or the prime minister. Patel’s replacement – Penny Mordaunt – had to be, like her, a keen Brexiteer; May does not have the freedom to choose on the basis of competence, only on the basis of alignment.

The prime minister is clearly weak, and has been since nearly losing the election to Labour. The enormity of the task – of unpicking hundreds of regulations, laws and agreements while forging new trading links, staunching a retreat of the finance sector from the City of London, attracting new and keeping established investment and combating the Scots nationalists who continue to threaten another referendum on independence – calls for strength and confidence.

Neither is much in evidence. The assumption of weakness is such that speculation on who could follow May as prime minister is a daily game. Most bets are on Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary and former journalist – clever, agile and a keen Brexiteer, but inheriting the same gnawing problems with which May has been forced to grapple. Were the Conservatives to lose their thin majority in the Commons on a confidence vote, a new election would be ordered – with the far-left-led Labour Party, on present poll figures, favorite. The country would then be even more deeply divided than before.

This is barbarian rule, otherwise known as democracy. Tens of millions in the democratic world experience insecurity, stagnant incomes or fear of mass immigration – sometimes all of these. They have chosen to vote for barbarians because the civilized people were not, they thought, caring, or at least not responding. Deeply uncomfortable, even dangerous, as the effects are, the rules by which states which offer political choice live must respect these votes. And hope for civilization to win, even among the barbarians.",Commentary: Britain’s mess extends beyond Brexit,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-brexit-commentary/commentary-britains-mess-extends-beyond-brexit-idUSKBN1DA2ON

Shares of the chipmaker rose about 6 percent in morning trade on Friday - hitting a record of $217.18.

Nvidia’s gaming revenue in the latest quarter blew past Wall Street estimates but it was the data center business, the driver of future growth, that made analysts stand up and take notice as revenue in the unit more than doubled.

Revenue from the data center business, Nvidia’s second-biggest revenue contributor, rose to $501 million, beating analysts’ estimate of $474.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

“Datacenter results have been stronger than forecast and we underestimated the value the market would assign to this franchise,” Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah wrote in a client note.

Shah raised his rating on the stock to “neutral” from “reduce.”

The company, which gets the bulk of revenue from gaming where it supplies chips for gaming consoles, has seen explosive growth at its data centers operations.

Nvidia launched the Volta chips in May as part of its Tesla V100 data center graphic processing unit (GPU) that will power systems from artificial intelligence (AI) to driverless cars.

“Volta’s launch we suspect was a major catalyst for Intel to go back to the drawing board with its AI chip Nervana, the tactical need to use AMD GPU, and the hire of Raja Koduri to head Intel’s new Graphics effort,” said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann.

Early this week, chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) partnered with bitter rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) for a graphics chip that will help the chipmakers take on Nvidia.

Intel also named AMD’s ex-GPU head, Koduri, as chief architect of the newly-formed Core and Visual Computing Group​.

“Shipments of the Tesla V100 GPU began in Q2 and ramped significantly in Q3 driven primarily by demand from cloud service providers and high-performance computing,” Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call on Thursday.

Nvidia’s data centers business, which caters to clients such as Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) Azure, was a point of concern after a disappointing showing last quarter.

But the Volta chip changed all that.

“The ramp of Volta seems to be tracking well, and more importantly, has significant runway ahead, in our view, as a broader set of customers adopt the new architecture in the coming quarters,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a client note.

The company claims that Volta will fuel breakthroughs in every industry and humanity's moonshots like eradicating cancer, intelligent customer experiences and self-driving vehicles. bit.ly/2iJPeNN

At least 14 analysts raised their price target on the stock. SunTrust Robinson analysts were the most bullish with a price target of $253. Nomura raised its target to $190 from $110.

Out of 37 brokerages covering the stock, 20 have a “buy” or higher rating; 14 on “hold” and 3 on “sell” or lower.

An elite club of managers rode bull markets and increased dispersion between securities to score profits of at least 20 percent through the end of October, a dramatic improvement from last year for investors such as Larry Robbins, Philippe Laffont and Chase Coleman, people familiar with individual funds’ performance said.

One of the largest returns came from Charlottesville-based investor Jaffray Woodriff, who used short-term stock bets to score a 68.3 percent gain in a key fund of his $4 billion Quantitative Investment Management.

By comparison, the S&P 500 Index was up 15 percent, more than double the benchmark HFRI hedge fund index, which was up 7.23 percent through October, its best annual return since at least 2013.

""We've been seeing significantly improved performance,"" Darren Wolf, head of hedge fund solutions for the Americas at Aberdeen Asset Management, said.

The last few years have been littered with hedge fund managers who charged steep fees and often promised heady returns only to lose money for investors or close shop entirely. A roaring stock market and the rise of low-cost investment tools, such as index funds, have also hit the industry.

Still, the mega winners this year offer some hope for investors and managers who believe the industry can produce “alpha,” or returns above the market’s “beta.”

The main fund managed by Robbins’ $11.7 billion Glenview Capital Management LLC is up 21 percent so far this year, thanks to positions in healthcare technology provider IQVIA Holdings Inc, health insurer Anthem Inc and chemical manufacturer FMC Corp, according to a public disclosure of top stock holdings and a person familiar with the returns. Like others, the person requested anonymity to discuss private information about the fund.

Robbins, a New York-based billionaire, lost money for investors in both 2015 and 2016, according to a report by HSBC Alternative Investment Group.

Coleman and Laffont relied on technology companies to drive outsized gains.

The main fund managed by Coleman’s $20 billion Tiger Global Management LLC gained 34.5 percent through October, due partly to investments in Chinese internet companies Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and JD.com Inc, a second person familiar with his performance said.

The main fund in Laffont’s $12 billion Coatue Management LLC rose 29.3 percent, helped by positions in Facebook Inc and Shopify Inc, a third person said.

Coleman’s main hedge fund lost money in 2016, while Laffont’s produced a small positive return, according to media reports.

Other funds benefited from investments in emerging markets, people familiar with them said.

An Argentina-focused fund managed by $1.5 billion Bienville Capital Management gained 40.6 percent through October, while the oldest fund within $3.4 billion Toscafund Asset Management LLP gained 28.8 percent, helped by bets on financial companies in Portugal, Spain and Russia.

UNDER PRESSURE

The outperformers are still few though, and it is likely too early to tell if their successes signal a broad return to the bumper profits that made hedge funds famous, especially since the pressures facing the $3 trillion hedge fund industry remain.

A small but high-profile group of institutional investors have pulled out in recent years, and remaining clients continue to grouse about high fees and a lack of transparency into complicated bets.

Hedge funds usually charge 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of investment gains, though fees have fallen. Index funds cost just a fraction of a percent of assets.

Managers often justify tepid returns by saying they create a diversified portfolio that will hold up in a crash, making comparisons to generic stock and bond indices unfair.

If economic conditions sour and the bull market dissipates, as some are predicting, there could be a broader hedge fund comeback, said Arvin Soh, who helps pensions and other institutional clients invest in hedge funds for GAM Alternative Solutions.

Disney’s sharper focus on streaming comes amid subscriber losses at its legacy cable networks that include ESPN and ABC, which many viewers are deserting for cheaper, on-demand streaming options.

On Thursday, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger talked up his commitment to streaming, calling it the company’s “highest priority this year.”

In a step that will further cement Disney’s strong position as a content powerhouse, Iger also unveiled a deal to develop a new “Star Wars” trilogy.

Perhaps more importantly, Iger said Disney’s planned streaming service would be “substantially” cheaper than Netflix.

Analysts said the lower price likely reflected Disney’s relatively smaller content slate but that the move could help the service gain subscribers quickly.

“We think Disney wants strong uptake early on and that this move recognizes that the equity market rewards strong (streaming) subscriber growth,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Steven Cahall said.

To compete better with Netflix and other streaming services, Disney has also said it will keep new Disney releases out of Netflix, starting from 2019.

Disney was making all the right strategic decisions as it builds out the streaming business, Evercore ISI’s Vijay Jayant said.

The company is developing family-friendly streaming services that will sell directly to consumers. It will launch a sports-focused service called ESPN Plus in early 2018.

According to news reports, Disney has held talks in recent weeks about a potential acquisition of most of Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA.O) media assets including FX, National Geographic and its movie studio.

While Iger declined to comment on the speculation on Thursday, analysts said a deal could help Disney expand its content library as it prepares to launch the streaming service.

Bankers and policymakers fear India could be throwing good money after bad with the capital injection announced last month, unless it tightens lending rules and institutes governance reforms to insulate banks from political pressure.

“After bailing out the banks with taxpayer money, the government wants to ensure that such a problem doesn’t happen again,” said a senior finance ministry official with direct knowledge of the matter, who declined to share details.

Arun Jaitley, India’s finance minister, has vowed the recapitalization will be accompanied by not only bank reform, but also mergers of weak banks with stronger rivals.

But the government has not commented on the issue of tackling political interference in lending, which bankers say is still one of the biggest problems.

India’s near $147 billion pile of soured loans is replete with examples of powerful and politically connected businesses who are accused of undermining rules to secure credit and then defaulting on loans.

In one of the most high-profile cases, Vijay Mallya, owner of the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines (KING.NS) and former member of parliament, and several former officials of IDBI Bank (IDBI.NS), have been charged with suspected conspiracy and fraud in relation to a loan of 9 billion rupees ($138 million).

Mallya, who is the head of the Force India Formula One team, has dismissed the charges and fled to Britain.

“There’s a risk of a rise in stressed assets unless bank corporate governance improves,” said N. Bhanumurthy, an economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a think-tank funded by the finance ministry.

“CORRUPTION AND KICKBACKS”

A dozen of the country’s largest defaulters, with nearly a quarter of the total bad loans, have already been pushed into insolvency at the command of India’s central bank, but none of these cases are likely to be resolved in the next six months.

A new bankruptcy law allows for an additional three months to reach a resolution, but insolvency professionals say it could take even longer in some cases as the process is untested and could face legal hurdles if the companies do not agree with the proposal.

Steelmaker Bhushan Steel (BSSL.NS) which defaulted on a loan of nearly $7 billion, was given repeated extensions by a consortium of banks, even after its vice chairman was arrested on alleged corruption charges in 2014 before the bankruptcy law came in.

“Corruption and kick-backs are a big issue at public sector banks,” said a Mumbai-based banker at a global lender, adding that the government needed to overhaul credit rules, including those for consortium lending.

Typically consortium lending in India is led by a large bank with as many as 30 others participating, but smaller banks, who are less able to absorb losses, have been faulted for tagging along and not having done their own due diligence in such cases.

India must also tackle due diligence undertaken by banks to avoid repeat defaulters getting access to new loans, said the banker, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Earlier this week, the government approved amendments to the bankruptcy law, barring “wilful” defaulters - defined by the central bank as debtors who are able but unwilling to pay - from bidding for companies.

ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM

Bankers say despite the high-profile blow-ups, pressure from politicians continues to influence lending decisions.

P. Mohan, manager of a local branch of State Bank of India (SBI.NS), the country’s top lender, said lending committees that include government-appointed nominees should be made accountable for all the sanctioned loans.

“That will also curb politicians from putting undue influence on bankers,” said Mohan.

A spokesman for the finance ministry declined to comment.

Corporate defaults make up the bulk of banks’ total bad loans, and adding to that is growing stress in loans worth 4 trillion rupees given to more than 70 million small enterprises over the last three years under Modi’s flagship program to create jobs.

“We are scared about these risky loans, 50 percent of which may become stressed assets soon,” said D. Franco, a manager at State Bank of India’s branch in Chennai and general secretary of the All India Bank Officers’ Confederation.

Guidelines by India’s central bank also mandate 40 percent of all loans must be to priority sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing and small businesses - many of which are turning sour.

“Public sector banks keep renewing these facilities whereas in normal business banking they would have been written off long ago,” said the banker with the global bank. “That’s the elephant in the room.”

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

But they’re not typical Chinese deliverymen.

Bright red, gray and black, they are the robot postmen of the future, and are controlled from a command center 40 kms (25 miles) away by e-commerce giant JD.com.

The robots are among technologies revolutionizing China’s vast delivery industry, which is struggling to keep pace with 50 percent annual growth in parcel volumes amid staff shortages, tight competition and declining margins.

China’s top delivery firms such as S.F. Express, BEST Inc and ZTO Express have begun testing robots and automated sorting lines ahead of China’s Singles Day on Saturday - an annual online discount shopping extravaganza which could see 1.5 billion packages shipped around the country.

“Wages are going up and the technology cost is actually going down,” said Bao Yan, director of strategy at JD Logistics, which manages parent JD.com’s logistics network. “We own the full process... we want to have automation throughout, from the fulfillment center to transportation and for last-mile delivery.”

To be sure, the robot revolution isn’t unique to China. U.S. online retailer Amazon has staffed warehouses with thousands of robots since 2014, helping cut operating costs and delivery times.

However, Chinese industry executives say they are leapfrogging Amazon as they make use of and develop these technologies at a faster pace, with many investing proceeds from stock market listings last year.

“The adoption rate among Chinese firms is extremely fast. The economy develops so fast so everyone’s rushing to compete, to keep up,” said Johnny Chou, chairman and founder of BEST.

ROBOTS GALORE

The experiments taking place across China are wide-ranging.

BEST, and Kaola, an e-commerce unit of video games publisher NetEase Inc, are using robots that can shift goods weighing up to 1,000 kgs (1 tonne) across warehouse floors to help human packers.

Online retailers Alibaba, JD.com and S.F. Express are investing in drone programs they hope will one day perform so-called last-mile deliveries, especially in hard to reach rural areas.

Others, like ZTO Express, have rolled out automated sorting lines that can self-scan and tip parcels into bags earmarked for different destinations lined up on either side of the belt.

ZTO‘S Chief Financial Officer James Guo said automated lines, which cost about 4 million yuan ($602,419) apiece, can sort up to 25,000 parcels an hour with 40 workers, versus a manually-operated line that can sort 4,000 parcels with 120 workers. ZTO has 44 of these automated lines.

“By saving the annual salaries of 70-80 workers, I can easily get back my investment in one line,” Guo said.

Other executives said wages in the industry, which has about 3 million workers, were rising by double-digit percentages annually, outpacing China’s economic growth.

RIPPLE EFFECT

The shift is rippling down through the broader industry, logistics suppliers say, driving orders for and research into new technologies and placing new demands on warehouse landlords.

At one end of the chain are robotics and technology firms such as Qingdao Kengic Automation Equipment Co Ltd and Hikvision, which say they are partnering with logistics companies to develop new systems.

“We achieved 100 percent (revenue) growth last year,” said Xu Ke, deputy general manager of Kengic, a unit of rubber machinery maker Mesnac Co Ltd, which says its automated sorting belts are used by JD.com and online discount retailer Vipshop Holdings.

That kind of growth, he says, is attracting over a hundred new competitors into a sector that only five years ago had just a few dozen firms. “The price competition is becoming extremely harsh as everyone tries to grab market share.”

Warehouse owner Global Logistics Properties said customers who want to install robotics were asking for larger floorplates, reliable power supply and higher ceilings.

GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

China’s government has been both boon and bane to the speed of the shift, other executives said.

Beijing has encouraged the fragmented logistics industry to modernize and become more efficient. The “Made in China 2025” initiative to upgrade the country’s manufacturing base has also spurred growth in robots.

But the government maintains tight control of its airspace, holding back the widespread introduction of drones, which many firms see as a potential last-mile delivery solution. Few firms have been granted drone licenses by the aviation regulator.

Still, industry executives confidently predict more parts of the supply chain will see machines replace human workers.

“We may not even need 10 years to achieve completely unmanned warehouses and unmanned distribution,” said BEST’s Chou. “Developments are happening just too quickly.”

Europe’s largest automaker is already the subject of a probe by the BaFin watchdog over suspected insider trading related to its “Dieselgate” scandal, and an investigation by Braunschweig prosecutors over suspected market manipulation.

Earlier this week, a German court also ruled an independent auditor should be appointed to investigate Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) cheating of U.S. diesel engine tests, boosting investors’ hopes for compensation.

On Friday, German magazine Der Spiegel reported that Volkswagen’s (VW) CEO at the time, Martin Winterkorn, informed then-Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt and the head of Germany’s KBA motor vehicle watchdog on Sept. 21, 2015, about the extent of the carmaker’s cheating.

But VW did not make public until Sept. 22, 2015, that about 11 million cars worldwide were fitted with emissions-cheating software and that it would set aside billions of euros to cover the potential cost of the scandal.

“We are looking at this process with a view to a potentially unauthorized disclosure of inside information,” a spokesman for BaFin said, confirming the Der Spiegel report.

VW declined to comment on the latest BaFin investigation, but reiterated its view that its management board “duly fulfilled” its obligations regarding capital market disclosure rules.

Jones, who also is the team’s general manager, said he is “disappointed” the Cowboys likely will be without Elliott for the next six games but the possible lawsuit against the league and other owners has nothing to do with how he believes Elliott has been treated in the league’s investigation into domestic violence.

Jones emphasized to 105.3 The Fan in Dallas that his threatening a lawsuit only has to do with the handling of Goodell’s new contract.

”This is such an important matter in light of a lot of the things that are going on in the NFL right now,“ Jones said Friday. ”I basically feel this extension of Roger should go and be reviewed and approved by all the owners, not just a few of the owners.

”This is simply about making sure that all clubs have input into not only the commissioner’s (contract) extension, but also in future years his decisions. We all see how impactful a commissioner’s decision can be in many areas. We’ve given him a lot of power and I think we need the checks and balances of ownership having to actually be in a position to not just suggest but approve of his decisions. That’s what this is about.

“The committee that basically negotiates the salary with our commissioner is taking the view, especially the chairman (Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank), that they in a limited group can complete this agreement,” Jones said. “I disagree. I think we should, with all of the interest and commitment that you have throughout the ownership.”

Jones said the issues go beyond the decision to suspend Elliott, who had his latest legal motion denied by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on Thursday, meaning his six-game NFL suspension is back in effect.

Goodell suspended Elliott for six games on Aug. 11 after a 13-month investigation concluded he was in violation of the league’s personal-conduct policy for an incident in the summer of 2016.

Elliott, who was not arrested or charged in the case, maintains his innocence after being accused of assaulting former girlfriend Tiffany Thompson in Columbus, Ohio.

His next court date is set for Dec. 1, after the NFL Players Association requested an expedited appeal of Thursday’s decision.

“The facts are, the issues that involve the commissioner are far more reaching,” Jones said. “I’ve been dealing with this commissioner for almost 28 years, as an employee of the NFL. Zeke’s been involved here a year, a year and a half. Those are really separate issues as to Zeke. The policy that we have that has impacted Zeke is more of my issue with the commissioner.”",Cowboys owner says Elliott case not cause of Goodell rift,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1DA2QP-OCASP

His remarks, at the start of a disarmament conference that brought 11 Nobel Peace Prize winners to the Vatican, appeared to go further than previous popes. They have said that while nuclear weapons should never be used, holding arsenals solely to deter other countries from using them could be morally acceptable as a step toward achieving a nuclear-free world.

Addressing the group in the 16th century frescoed Clementine Hall of the Vatican’s Apostolic Palace, Francis spoke of “the catastrophic humanitarian and environmental effects of any employment of nuclear devices”.

He added: “If we also take into account the risk of an accidental detonation as a result of error of any kind, the threat of their use, as well as their very possession, is to be firmly condemned.”

As tensions between the United States and North Korea have increased, the pope has often warned that a nuclear conflict would destroy a good part of humanity and called for a third country to mediate the dispute.

In his address, Francis did not directly mention the North Korea tension, but spoke in general of a “climate of instability and conflict” and a “mentality of fear” in the world today.

“International relations cannot be held captive to military force, mutual intimidation, and the parading of stockpiles of arms,” he said.

He also said international laws against proliferation of nuclear weapons had not kept new states from acquiring them. Money used to develop or modernize weapons should instead be spent on helping the poor and protecting the environment.

Douglas Roche, Canada’s former Ambassador for Disarmament and a former senator, told the conference the pope’s remarks against possession of nuclear weapons were “historic” and asked national conferences of Catholic bishops to work to make it known.

Another participant suggested the pope should write an encyclical letter addressed to all Catholics on the moral imperative to ban nuclear weapons.

Among those who met the pope were Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) and Mohamed El Baradei, director general emeritus of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Fihn, whose group won the Nobel this year, told Reuters she asked the pope to lead all 1.2 billion Catholics around the world in prayer for an end to the threat of nuclear weapons on Sunday, December 10, when her group is due to collect the prize.

“Tensions are really high and the risks for nuclear weapons’ use is higher than at the height of the Cold War, the Cuban missile crisis. I think that’s really serious and we need to urgently do something about this,” she said.

El Baradei, who won the peace prize in 2015, was asked how he would respond to U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to use unprecedented “fire and fury” against North Korea if it threatened the United States.

A divestment of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, which Carlyle acquired from Johnson & Johnson in 2014 for $4 billion, would show how buyout firms can turn unloved businesses of major corporations into lucrative investments within a few years.

Carlyle has hired investment banks to run a sale process for Ortho-Clinical, the sources said this week. Carlyle may also pursue an IPO of the company if the offers it receives do not meet valuation expectations, the sources added.

The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.

Carlyle declined to comment. Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics did not respond to a request for comment.

Headquartered in Raritan, New Jersey, Ortho-Clinical produces in-vitro diagnostics equipment and associated assays and reagents. It generates about $1.7 billion in annual revenue and employs about 4,300 people worldwide, according to its website.

Ortho-Clinical has incurred significant expenses in the last three years to find its footing as a standalone company. These implementation and restructuring costs are expected to taper off by the end of the year, as it severs most of its ties with Johnson & Johnson, according to credit ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service Inc.

The company sells its products in more than 125 countries, but has potential to grow in emerging markets, according to Moody‘s.

Any deal for Ortho-Clinical would likely come in the first half of 2018, making it one of the first major Carlyle portfolio companies to be divested under the leadership of Glenn Youngkin and Kewsong Lee, who are set to become co-chief executive officers of Carlyle in January, taking over the reins from founders David Rubenstein, William Conway and Daniel D‘Aniello.

Carlyle has a long track record of investing in healthcare companies and has been seeking to cash out on some of them this year.

Nach allem, was man wisse, stehe Hariri nicht unter Hausarrest, unterliege keinen besonderen Beschränkungen und sei in seiner Bewegungsfreiheit nicht eingeschränkt, sagte der französische Außenminister Jean-Yves Le Drian am Freitag im Rundfunksender Europe 1. Dem schlossen sich das Auswärtige Amt in Berlin und US-Außenminister Rex Tillerson an. Tillerson rief die Länder der Region auf, den Libanon nicht länger als Instrument für einen Stellvertreter-Krieg zu missbrauchen. Er stärkte Hariri demonstrativ den Rücken und nannte ihn einen “starken Partner der USA”. Der libanesische Präsident Michel Aoun forderte die Rückkehr Hariris in seine Heimat, die dieser aus Furcht vor einem Mordanschlag verlassen hatte.

Das Rücktrittsgesuch Hariris erfülle die Bundesregierung mit großer Sorge, sagte die Sprecherin des Bundesaußenministeriums. Entscheidend sei, dass die Stabilität des Libanon und Fortschritte der vergangenen Monate, die unter Hariris Führung erreicht worden seien, nicht in Gefahr gerieten. Dies habe Außenminister Sigmar Gabriel am Donnerstag gegenüber seinem saudi-arabischen Kollegen in einem Telefonat deutlich gemacht.

Regierungssprecher Steffen Seibert betonte die Verantwortung des Iran in dem Konflikt, der über die Hisbollah-Miliz Einfluss auf die libanesische Regierung ausübe und am Bürgerkrieg in Syrien beteiligt sei. “Die Politik der iranischen Regierung, ihre Unterstützung des syrischen Regimes und der Hisbollah werden von uns mit großer Sorge gesehen.” Die Bundesregierung appelliere sowohl an Saudi-Arabien als auch an den Iran, die politische Stabilität des Libanon nicht zu schwächen.

HISBOLLAH - SAUDI-ARABIEN HAT LIBANON KRIEG ERKLÄRT

Hisbollah-Chef Hassan Nasrallah wirft Saudi-Arabien eine Kriegserklärung gegen den Libanon vor. Der Rückzug Hariris stelle eine “beispiellose saudische Einmischung” in die libanesische Politik dar, sagte Nasrallah am Freitag in einer Fernsehbotschaft. Er bekräftigte seine Einschätzung, dass Hariri in Saudi-Arabien festgehalten werde. Die Hisbollah ist an der libanesischen Regierung beteiligt.

Das sunnitisch geprägte Saudi-Arabien und der von Schiiten dominierte Iran gelten als Erzfeinde in der Region und tragen bereits im Jemen einen Stellvertreterkrieg aus. Auch Frankreichs Präsident Emmanuel Macron äußerte sich zuletzt besorgt über die Stabilität des Libanon. Die politische Krise dort müsse rasch gelöst werden. Macron hatte Saudi-Arabien am Donnerstagabend überraschend besucht. Ob er dabei auch mit Hariri zusammentraf, blieb unbekannt. Zuvor hatte sich der französische Botschafter in Saudi-Arabien mit dem libanesischen Politiker getroffen.

Auch UN-Generalsekretär Antonio Guterres bemüht sich in Gesprächen mit Politikern der Region um eine Deeskalation. Er sei sehr besorgt, dass die Spannungen weiter zunehmen könnten, sagte er: “Dies könnte verheerende Folgen haben.”

Hariri war in der vergangenen Woche zurückgetreten und hatte dies mit Sorge um sein Leben begründet.

Amazon Protect, which provides extensions to manufacturers’ warranties for items like mobile phones or washing machines bought on Amazon’s website, launched last year in Europe.

It is Amazon’s only insurance business globally.

Recent job advertisements for the EU product insurance division described “launching a new business” and “creating a new palette of services”.

“This is a sure sign disruption is on the way for the UK insurance market,” said Patricia Davies, financial services analyst at data and analytics firm GlobalData.

An Amazon UK spokesman declined to comment.

Specialist insurers are concerned that Amazon and other online players will encroach on their territory, and are looking to partner with them.

Investment in insurtech firms in Europe has risen sharply in the first half of 2017, often with the backing of big insurers. [nL5N1LW28W]

Amazon Protect launched in Britain in April 2016, quickly expanding to the firm’s main European markets of France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

Its policies give customers an extension on manufacturers’ two-year warranties for up to five years, insuring against accidental damage, breakdown and theft.

The Warranty Group, which underwrites Amazon Protect policies, did not respond to a request for comment.

Amazon posted the jobs on LinkedIn and “Where Women Work” in recent weeks.

“Along with internal and external partners, we are re-defining the warranties and product insurance experience, disrupting the way traditional product insurance services are acquired and delivered and creating a new palette of services,” one job ad, which is no longer accepting applications, said.

Another asked: “Would you like to take part in launching a new business?”

Insurers have been looking at ways of tapping into the so-called connected home, for instance by offering home insurance cover which will alert you if your pipes have sprung a leak.

Amazon’s launch of voice-activated home personal assistant Alexa could give an opportunity for it to expand into this area of home insurance, Davies said.

The first small island state to preside at U.N. climate negotiations since they began in the 1990s, Fiji has enlivened a conference centre with canoes, dancers, huge photographs of palm-fringed islands, virtual reality shows and flowers.

Some delegates at the 200-nation, Nov. 6-17 meeting dub the riverside venue “Fiji-on-the-Rhine”, a contrast to the grey November skies outside in Bonn, Germany. Fiji says “we are all in the same canoe” in confronting climate change.

Small island states have often felt overlooked by big powers even though they are on the frontlines of a rise in sea levels that is causing more storm surges, washes salt onto cropland and could swamp some low-lying coral islands.

Fiji’s chief negotiator Nazhat Shameem Khan told Reuters others should not underestimate small states.

“If you think you’re too small to make an impact, try going to bed with a mosquito,” she said, attributing the quote to Anita Roddick, the founder of the cosmetics firm The Body Shop.

Average sea levels have risen 26 cm (10 inches) since the late 19th century, driven partly by melting ice, according to the U.N. weather agency, and could rise by up to a metre this century as temperatures rise.

At the indoor Fijian pavilion in Bonn, delegates can also sample virtual reality glasses with 360 degree views showing young people re-building homes devastated by mudslides.

“We wanted to think ‘how do we bring Fiji to Germany?'” co-director Kvaku Aning said. “Short of being able to smell it, or feel the rain or the sun on you, this is the best thing.”

Many delegates say the Fijian approach makes an often abstract debate about greenhouse gas emissions more real. “It delivers a really stark message,” said Elina Bardram, head of the European Commission delegation.

The negotiations in Bonn, to write a rule book for the 2015 Paris climate agreement, have been overshadowed by what to do after President Donald Trump decided in June to withdraw the United States from the pact, instead preferring to promote coal and oil.

Khan said Fiji wanted to embed the hard-to-translate Fijian concept of ‘Bula’ into the negotiations. “It’s friendship, it’s inclusiveness, it’s happiness ...

The thick blanket of grey air and pollutants has enveloped the eastern Pakistani city and several other urban areas for nearly two weeks, bringing visibility to zero most of the day.

The Pakistani crisis is part of a wider smog emergency that has hit neighboring India, forcing authorities in New Delhi on Friday to plan to spray water over the city.

Meteorologists say the pollution surge was triggered by vehicle exhaust fumes, dust and illegal burning of crops.

Limited visibility has caused over 250 road accidents, killing 14 people and injuring more than 400, said Jam Sajjad Hussain, a government rescue service official.

Canada’s new three-year immigration plan, unveiled on Wednesday, will see it increase its immigration intake by 13 percent over three years to help meet the needs of an aging population.

But the increase is below that recommended by a government advisory council in 2016, which had wanted the figure to rise by 50 percent over five years.

“It’s easy to bring somebody in, it’s another thing to make sure they succeed in Canada,” Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen said by telephone from Ottawa.

Canada’s immigration system focuses on bringing in skilled workers, but has struggled to connect them with job opportunities in keeping with their skills and credentials.

The immigration minister, himself a former refugee from Somalia, said bringing newcomers to Canada was only “half of the job,” and that supports were needed to ensure they integrated well into society.

Canada has resettled more than 40,000 Syrian refugees since 2015 and seen more than 15,000 asylum seekers walk across its border with the United States this year, with many saying they fear a U.S. immigration crackdown.

Many of the latter group have gone to Quebec, sparking an anti-immigrant backlash in the French-speaking province. The military set up a tent encampment to house asylum seekers while they are processed.

“I think in Canada we’re lucky that, broadly speaking, we have support (but) it’s not consensus, there are people who oppose immigration,” Hussen said.

Canada isn’t “some magical place that doesn’t have worries about immigration, worries about security, worries about division and intolerant minds,” Trudeau said at a Toronto conference on Thursday.

Trudeau made international headlines in January with tweets touting Canada’s welcome of refugees, coinciding with U.S. President Donald Trump’s first travel ban.

But two years after mobilizing the country to bring in Syrians, the Canadian government is dialing down its involvement. About 30 percent of resettled refugees in the next three years will be government-sponsored, compared with 46 percent in the previous three years.

“Look, we can’t take every refugee from the world,” Hussen said. “What we can do is we can play our part.”

Hussen said Canada offered to resettle some of the more than 600,000 Rohingya refugees who have fled their homes in Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh, but was told by the United Nations High Commission on Refugees that was not necessary.

Jean-Nicolas Beuze, the UNHCR’s Canadian representative, said the agency is focused on providing for the immediate needs of Rohingya refugees, with an eventual return to their homes in Myanmar as the “best solution.”

Canada’s three-year immigration plan would see immigration rise by 40,000 to 340,000 people annually in 2020. That is below an increase to 450,000 by 2021 recommended by the advisory council, to offset an aging population and strains on the social safety net.",Canada to take in migrants at 'gradual' pace amid integration concerns,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1D22N3-OCADN

His Twenty-First Century Fox made an $80 billion offer for Time Warner in 2014 but abandoned the plan in the face of Time Warner’s resistance. At that time, Fox had planned to divest CNN - which competes with Fox News - in order to avoid antitrust issues.

There is no law against a company owning two cable networks, but there is a Federal Communications Commission prohibition on owning two broadcast networks. A Fox deal with CNN could also raise antitrust concerns because of the market share that a combined company would have among cable news viewers.

“I have been called and asked if I would sell CNN by numerous people,” Stephenson told the New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday. But he added: “Selling CNN makes no sense.”

Fox has held talks in the last few weeks to sell most of its film and television assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), CNBC reported this week, which would leave the company with its Fox News, sports programming and broadcasting stations..

Twenty-First Century Fox would sell its stake in European satellite broadcaster Sky Plc (SKYB.L) in a deal with Disney, according to CNBC’s report. Fox is trying to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own but the bid is strongly opposed by some lawmakers and has been subject to lengthy regulatory scrutiny.

With a host of established players missing, England’s callow defence was routinely sliced open in the first period and they needed debutant goalkeeper Jordan Pickford to keep the Germans at bay.

But England also had some bright moments, with midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek making an assured debut and having great chances at the start and end of the match.

England manager Gareth Southgate, shorn of more than half his likely first-choice side, was pleased with much that he saw, despite the result leaving England still searching for their first home win over their old rivals since 1975.

“In the first half we needed a couple of really good saves from Jordan Pickford - we caused our own problems with a couple of those. But we posed our own questions and I thought we used the ball well,” Southgate told ITV.

“Ruben Loftus-Cheek did everything I know he can do. It took him 10 minutes to realise he is OK at this level. He is capable of anything. He has the physical attributes and can handle the ball. He will gain huge confidence from it. There will be harder tests as the likes of Germany will have another gear to go to.”

Germany were also in somewhat experimental mode and their coach Joachim Loew will have been delighted in particular with an impressive display by Leroy Sane as his team stretched their unbeaten run to 20 games since losing to France in the Euro 2016 semi-finals.

England’s young starting team boasted 101 caps between them and one of the debutants, Tammy Abraham, was a centimetre away from scoring with his first touch in international football after 90 seconds.

Germany too were without some heavyweight players and gave a debut to defender Marcel Halstenberg and had goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen making his second appearance.

GERMANY DOMINATE

They soon took control as Sane clipped a 20-metre curler against the bar after 20 minutes, Pickford saved well from Timo Werner and Phil Jones headed Sane’s follow-up off the line.

Jones, the team’s most experienced player, then limped off and another debutant, Liverpool’s 20-year-old Joe Gomez, took his place to trim England’s cap count to less than Germany midfielder Mesut Ozil’s personal tally of 86.

The lack of experience and familiarity was exposed again soon afterwards when Pickford went full length to again deny Werner as Sane was seemingly given the freedom of Wembley.

Ter Stegen made an excellent reflex save to get low and palm clear striker Jamie Vardy’s header early in the second half but the steam then gradually left the game.

Midfielder Jack Cork came on as a late substitute to make it five England debuts on the night and another replacement, Jesse Lingard, should really have won it with the last kick of the match but his close-range shot flew over the bar.

England captain Eric Dier said: “I think we did well. Obviously against a well-oiled machine they will have periods in the game where they control possession but I didn’t think they hurt us. And we had our periods, broke well at times and are actually disappointed we haven’t scored.”

England will face a similarly stiff test when they host Brazil on Tuesday while Germany take on France as the teams start preparing for the World Cup finals in Russia next year.",Young England side earn goalless draw with Germany,https://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-friendly-eng-ger/young-england-side-earn-goalless-draw-with-germany-idINKBN1DA2XZ?il=0

Em uma estratégia para tentar reverter a repercussão negativa causada pela primeira versão do texto da reforma e angariar mais votos, a nova proposta deve ser mais enxuta, mas sem abrir mão da definição de uma idade mínima para aposentadoria --65 anos para os homens e 62 para as mulheres-- e das regras de transição para o novo regime.

E em outra frente, em linha com a mudança de discurso do governo e de seus aliados para melhorar a receptividade da reforma, o texto deve trazer o que governistas passaram a chamar de corte de “privilégios”, referindo-se à equiparação das regras de servidores públicos aos trabalhadores privados, à proteção dos trabalhadores rurais e aos beneficiários do BPC (Benefício de Prestação Continuada).

“Agora o tempo vai nos dizer como estão as bancadas, acho que os líderes sabem que essa é uma pauta que é uma prioridade minha como presidente da Câmara”, disse Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ) a jornalistas nesta sexta-feira, um dia após ser o anfitrião de encontro de líderes de bancada com o presidente Michel Temer, o ministro da Fazenda, Henrique Meirelles e outros membros da equipe econômica justamente para discutir o tema.

Da reunião, ficou definida uma proposta quase fechada, a ser levada às bancadas para uma sondagem. Segundo o vice-líder do governo, Darcísio Perondi (PMDB-RS), os pontos principais estavam acertados, embora ainda falte a “construção política, que é mais delicada”.

Nesta sexta, o presidente da Câmara afirmou que “certamente” o relator da proposta, Arthur Oliveria Maia (PPS-BA), “vai apresentar um texto novo e esse texto é o que vai gerar as condições ou não para a gente votar a Emenda Constitucional ainda neste ano”.

“Acho que é importante ter o texto, e tendo o texto cada deputado possa avaliar se tem condição de votar.”

Por se tratar de uma Proposta de Emenda à Constituição, a reforma precisa dos votos de 308 dos 513 deputados, em dois turnos de votação, para ser aprovada.

O relator da reforma deixou o encontro de quinta-feira defendendo a manutenção da atual exigência de tempo de contribuição de 15 anos, menor do que os 25 anos que constam no texto aprovado pela comissão especial. Reconheceu, no entanto, que esse ponto ainda não estava definido, assim como a extinção do acúmulo de pensões e aposentadorias.

O recado passado pela equipe econômica a aliados é que a intenção é preservar ao menos 50 por cento da economia que se imaginava no começo da reforma. Mas na avaliação de um participante da reunião que atua ativamente nas discussões, mais do que as “contas” da Fazenda, o importante é o “impacto político” de votar uma reforma nos termos possíveis para dar uma sinalização positiva ao mercado.

Ainda assim, aliados evitam falar em números favoráveis à reforma, forte indício que ainda terão muito trabalho pela frente para tocar a proposta.","Após mobilização com líderes, governo aguarda reação de aliados à nova ideia de reforma da Previdência",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1DA2HS-OBRTP

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

But unlike 2015’s “Piku”, this trip doesn’t seem to be as much fun.

Handout photo

Khan plays Yogi, a middle-aged man with lots of time and money who signs up with a dating website. He meets Jaya (Parvathy), a widow whose friends egg her on to “get some action.” She lives alone and faces the same problems that any woman above 30 in India faces while looking for companionship – the stigma attached to being a widow and the lack of suitors.

She and Yogi seem diametrically opposite – she is a South Indian, a working professional, and one who has strong ideas of right and wrong. He is a drifter with a disregard for rules and a ready repartee that often puts her off-guard. A love story between these two would have been interesting enough without inserting the travel bit into it, but director Tanuja Chandra and co-writer Gazal Dhaliwal are determined to take these two on what turns out to be a wild goose chase.

An off-hand remark about Yogi’s ex-lovers turns into a plan for a road trip to go and meet all of them, and Jaya finds herself tagging along. As they meet the women who made up Yogi’s romantic past, Jaya finds herself inexplicably drawn to this strange, whimsical man. But Chandra loads her narrative with too many things - Jaya’s unresolved issues with her friends, Yogi’s half-baked romances - and all of them do nothing to enhance the story. For what it’s worth, the beginning of a relationship between two people in their late 30s in India is a film waiting to be made, but Chandra lost focus.

Luckily for Chandra, her lead performers are powerhouses who can make even middling screenplays look good. Irrfan Khan seems to be having the most fun – he gets the best lines and takes great relish in serving them out. Parvathy as the woman struggling to give love a second chance is the star of the film – she’s expressive, vulnerable at all the right moments, and just the perfect amount of ditzy.

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has issued guidance on “delegation”, or an asset manager in one country running a fund based in another, after the UK leaves the EU in 2019.

Asset managers in Britain run many funds listed in EU states like Ireland and Luxembourg, but managers say the ESMA guidance could make delegation unworkable by forcing them to relocate from Britain to the bloc.

Richard Stobo, investment management leader at ESMA, said there were still different views among European regulators over how delegation structures should be treated.

There was merit, however, in seeking supervisory convergence over this sensitive issue, he said.

“Having said that, we fully recognize the importance of the delegation model in the current market set up,” Stobo told the Irish Funds Industry Association’s annual London meeting.

Delegation is accepted within the bloc’s mutual and alternative funds industry rules.

“The idea is not to change that model,” Stobo said.

The guidance has been painted by critics as a backdoor attempt by France to wrest more funds business not only from London after Brexit, but also from Luxembourg and Ireland.

Over 480 asset managers run 6,000 funds listed in Dublin that have 2.25 trillion euros of assets under management.

Between 160 and 170 of the managers are based in Britain, with another large chunk in the United States, and U.S. based managers worry the Brexit guidance will impinge on transatlantic delegation.

Pat Lardner, chief executive of Irish Funds, said the current system was a well-functioning market and savings patterns must not be disrupted.

“We have a number of reasonable questions about what is the problem that one is trying to fix here. That is not apparent,” Lardner said.

“There are a lot of questions,” added Martina Kelly, a senior official at the Central Bank of Ireland.

Nick Miller, head of investment management supervision at Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, said delegation as a global model works well and there is no need to disrupt it.

“We want to see good cooperation between regulators. We want to see delegation that works well,” Miller said.",EU watchdog defends Brexit guidance for asset managers,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-funds/eu-watchdog-defends-brexit-guidance-for-asset-managers-idUKKBN1DA1MN

“The priest says ‘lift up your hearts’. He does not say, ‘lift up your cell phones to take pictures,'” Francis told tens of thousands of people at his weekly audience in St. Peter’s Square, referring to a communion prayer in the Roman Catholic Mass.

In his improvised remarks, he called using cell phones during Mass “a very ugly thing,” adding:

”It makes me very sad when I celebrate (Mass) here in the piazza or in the basilica and I see so many cell phones held up. Not only by the faithful, but also by some priests and even bishops!

“The Mass is not a show ... so remember, no cell phones!” he said, prompting laughter and applause from the crowd.

Francis, the leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, has regularly urged the faithful to be more spiritual and his priests and bishops to be more humble.

Shortly after his election in 2013, he said it pained him to see priests driving flashy cars and eager to use the latest smartphone.

Disney’s sharper focus on streaming comes amid subscriber losses at its legacy cable networks that include ESPN and ABC, which many viewers are deserting for cheaper, on-demand streaming options.

On Thursday, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger talked up his commitment to streaming, calling it the company’s “highest priority this year.”

In a step that will further cement Disney’s strong position as a content powerhouse, Iger also unveiled a deal to develop a new “Star Wars” trilogy.

Perhaps more importantly, Iger said Disney’s planned streaming service would be “substantially” cheaper than Netflix.

Analysts said the lower price likely reflected Disney’s relatively smaller content slate but that the move could help the service gain subscribers quickly.

“We think Disney wants strong uptake early on and that this move recognizes that the equity market rewards strong (streaming) subscriber growth,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Steven Cahall said.

To compete better with Netflix and other streaming services, Disney has also said it will keep new Disney releases out of Netflix, starting from 2019.

Disney was making all the right strategic decisions as it builds out the streaming business, Evercore ISI’s Vijay Jayant said.

The company is developing family-friendly streaming services that will sell directly to consumers. It will launch a sports-focused service called ESPN Plus in early 2018.

According to news reports, Disney has held talks in recent weeks about a potential acquisition of most of Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA.O) media assets including FX, National Geographic and its movie studio.

While Iger declined to comment on the speculation on Thursday, analysts said a deal could help Disney expand its content library as it prepares to launch the streaming service.

Disney's shares have been a laggard on the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, having fallen about 1.5 percent this year through Thursday, compared to the 18.7 percent gain the index has seen.

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

The poll found 32 percent of Americans think the wealthy will benefit most, compared to 14 percent who think all Americans will benefit and 14 percent who think large U.S. corporations will benefit most.

Congress is working to try to enact the most sweeping overhaul of the tax code since the 1980s that would lower taxes for millions of individual tax payers and slash the rate paid by corporations. The proposal would also eliminate most individual tax deductions, a move that could result in some taxpayers seeing an increase in their total bill to the government while others see a decrease.

Despite an insistence by Republicans that their goal is help the middle class, only 8 percent of Americans think that demographic will benefit the most, the poll, which was conducted Nov. 3-8, found.

Republicans and Democrats are divided on who they think tax reform would help the most. Among Republicans, 26 percent think all Americans will benefit, followed by 16 percent who think the wealthy will benefit most, the poll found.

But among Democrats, 46 percent think that wealthy will benefit most, with only 7 percent thinking all Americans will benefit and 17 percent who think corporations will benefit.

And while those polled did not think that the middle class will benefit most, an overwhelming majority thought that they should.

The poll found 79 percent think its more important to cut taxes for the middle class than for corporations, and 76 percent think its more important to cut taxes for the poor than for corporations.

However, 76 percent said it was more important to cut taxes for corporations than it was to cut taxes for the wealthy.

When it comes to specific changes, the poll found that 46 percent of Americans oppose limiting the mortgage interest deduction, compared to 35 percent who support the change.

The strongest opposition came to the Republican proposal to eliminate deductions for medical expenses, with 54 percent saying they are against the change and 32 percent saying they support it.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted in early November online in English throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,608 adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.","More Americans think wealthy, not middle class, will benefit from tax reform: Reuters/Ipsos",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-poll/more-americans-think-wealthy-not-middle-class-will-benefit-from-tax-reform-reuters-ipsos-idUSKBN1D93BQ

Marbles, chocolates and powder detergents are among 178 everyday items that will be taxed at the lower 18 percent rate under the changes. Other items that were already taxed below the top rate, such as condensed milk, sugar and pasta, will be shifted to even lower bands.

From Nov. 15, only 50 items will still be subject to the highest rate, mainly white goods such as washing machines and refridgerators, and “sin” items such as tobacco and fizzy drinks.

The move could cost the exchequer around 200 billion rupees ($3 billion) this fiscal year, Sushil Kumar Modi, the deputy chief minister of the eastern state of Bihar, and a member of the council, said earlier on Friday.

The launch of a new nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July transformed India’s 29 states into a single customs union. But traders and small businesses complain it has increased their administrative and financial burden.

All goods and services are taxed at one of five rates: 28 percent, 18 percent, 12 percent, 5 percent or zero.

“The (GST) council has been reviewing and rationalising tax rates from time to time, especially those in the tax bracket of 28 percent. Today, the council has decided to move 178 items from the tax bracket of 28 percent to 18 percent,” Jaitley said.The government faces criticism for the economic disruption caused by the tax roll-out and last year’s shock removal of higher-value currency bills from circulation.

As a result, India’s economy is expected to grow at its slowest pace in four years in the fiscal year that ends on March 31, a Reuters poll found.

The layoffs at GE Digital, based in San Ramon, California, affect about 100 sales people in the Americas, including those who sell GE’s Predix industrial-internet software, according to two sources.

The software, central to GE’s strategy under former Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, has been beset with technical problems, prompting GE to shift strategy.

The 125-year-old conglomerate is considering job reductions across all of its diverse businesses, the sources said. Struggling units such as GE Power are facing significant staff cuts, while aviation and healthcare businesses could see lesser reductions, the sources said.

Reuters reported in August that Flannery intended to reduce corporate staff at its Boston headquarters significantly, reductions that also have begun, according to sources. The company has also slowed construction of its headquarters.

It is not clear how many more jobs Flannery now plans to cut, or how quickly. With 295,000 employees, even a 10 percent overall reduction would eliminate nearly 30,000 jobs.

At the digital business, which has about 13,000 people including legacy information technology staff, GE is not only cutting sales staff. It is also reducing the number of developers who create the software, according to the two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.

GE declined to comment on specific staff reductions, but highlighted its plan to cut $3 billion in costs by the end of 2018. “Those actions include but are not limited to, employee reductions which have been well underway for many months,” spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said.

DIVIDEND CUT COMING?

Since becoming CEO on Aug. 1, Flannery has doubled the amount of cost cutting targeted for next year to $2 billion, and is cutting $1 billion this year. He said he has found more than $20 billion in GE assets to sell and is looking at further changes to the portfolio beyond that.

A 30-year GE veteran, Flannery is due to present the strategic changes and new financial targets at an investor meeting in New York on Monday. The plans also could include cutting GE’s dividend for only the third time since the Great Depression.

Flannery has come under increasing pressure to boost GE’s profit and share price after the company badly missed earnings expectations for the third quarter and lowered its financial outlook last month.

GE stock has fallen more than 36 percent this year, making it the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and posing the risk that the only remaining original company in the widely watched stock index could be kicked out.

Activist investor Ed Garden, a founding partner at Trian Fund Management, recently joined GE’s board. Trian invested $2.5 billion in GE in 2015 and pressed the company to cut costs and focus on sectors where it is a market leader, such as power plants, jet engines and medical devices. Trian declined to comment.

GE is considering divestment of its aircraft leasing, transportation and healthcare information technology businesses. The job reduction efforts in GE’s units appear to be independent of those divestitures, the sources said.

Flannery already has grounded GE’s corporate jets, cut car bonuses for executives and dismissed two vice chairmen to save money.

Two security sources in al-Arish, the area capital, said armed men attacked the convoy, which was carrying coal to a cement factory.

The bodies of the truck drivers, all shot to death, were taken to the morgue of Suez public hospital, four medical sources said.

A military spokesman said there was no official statement. An interior ministry official did not respond to a request for information.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.

“They have threatened us repeatedly, asking that we don’t work for the army’s companies. We informed the factory management of the threats and asked them for more protection,” one local truck driver, Ismail Abdel-Raouf, told Reuters.

Hundreds of police and soldiers have been killed since the insurgency quickened pace in northern Sinai after the 2013 ouster by the military of then-president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood during massive protests against his rule.

A home-grown jihadist group, Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, declared allegiance to Islamic State in 2014 and has since tried to spread outside the peninsula by targeting Christians with attacks on churches on the mainland.

President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, who presents himself as a bulwark against militants in the Middle East, has said Islamic State fighters might try to enter Libya and Egypt after their defeats in Iraq and Syria.

U.S. Senate Republicans released a tax plan on Thursday that differed from a version put forth by the House of Representatives on several key fronts, including putting off corporate tax cuts for a year.

Expectations of lower taxes, one of President Donald Trump’s key campaign promises, have helped drive the S&P 500 up 20 percent since the 2016 presidential election.

Failure to cut corporate taxes would increase concerns about Trump’s ability to pass legislation and could shake markets that have been banking on lower tax rates to boost company earnings.

The S&P 500 on Friday stood at 18.1 times expected earnings, the highest since 2004, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.

Arrow Funds Director of Research John Serrapere put the chances of successfully passing meaningful tax cuts at 50 percent, and he warned that failing could trigger a correction of as much as 15 percent in stocks.

Harltey has been cleared to lead his country in the matches against Argentina, Australia and Samoa, after his citing for striking an opponent in Northampton’s 24-7 defeat to Clermont Auvergne was dismissed by an independent disciplinary hearing last month.

England will be looking to continue their winning momentum against the Pumas at Twickenham on Saturday after a 2-0 series win in Argentina in June, which came after their Six Nations grand slam dream was wrecked by Ireland.

That loss ended a run of 18 wins in a row for England, but that is all in the past now according to Hartley, with the goal to embark on another similarly impressive sequence of victories.

”This is sport, we are competitors, we want to win everything,“ Hartley told reporters. ”Maybe in the past we have been too polite but this is sport, it’s a challenge, we want to win every game.

”The (winning) run is irrelevant because it’s a clean slate. If we were away from home, I’d want to win every game as well. It’s a mindset shift.

“I think it’s important for us to go and play well as a team. If that means making a statement by winning, first and foremost, we win. We want to be a better team than who Argentina faced in the summer.”

Saturday’s meeting against the Pumas is England’s first match since their 35-25 victory in Sante Fe in June, and Hartley believes Eddie Jones and his players have utilised the time well, while warning that Argentina will be improved also.

”I think we have prepared well,“ Hartley added. ”All our focus has been geared towards it.

”We’ve had Lensbury, Oxford and Portugal (training camps). And when you prepare well, and with your team-mates you know they have prepared well, you can be confident in yourself and those around you, and when you’re confident you can just go play.

“In the summer they (Argentina) play together as a Super Rugby team so they have been together a long time and they are a tight-knit team.

The European commissioner for competition took the stage on Monday in front of a crowd of thousands. “Society is about people, and not about technology,” she said to raucous applause at Web Summit in Lisbon, an annual gathering that has become the closest thing to the technology industry’s version of the Rebel Alliance from Star Wars.

The increasingly dominant enterprises of Facebook, Alphabet, Alibaba, Amazon and Apple play the role of the Death Star for the more than 50,000 people attending the event in the Portuguese capital. In the Star Wars analogy, they are the insurgents. The rousing welcome Vestager received suggests some see her as their Princess Leia, a heroine set on overthrowing the empire. Many delegates, though, simply came to share their ideas for coping with the oligarchy of the internet.

If Vestager succeeds in weakening the tech giants’ grip by challenging the heft of Alphabet and Apple, to name a couple, she will “set the standard for the rest of the world and will usher in a fundamental change in how the largest and most profitable companies in the history of the world are treated,” Paddy Cosgrave, who co-founded the summit as a small gathering in Dublin, told Reuters. “This changes the playing field for all other companies.”

That might sound like marketing hyperbole, but this year’s event comes as Silicon Valley’s top executives face increased scrutiny from policymakers, even in their home U.S. market, over their companies’ ability to influence not just commerce and social interactions but politics and society, too. It may be a stretch to think the long tail of the technology business can amass enough power to threaten goliaths like Apple, now tipping the market capitalization scales at over $900 billion. But the enthusiasm with which the crowd greeted Vestager’s remarks reflects a pent-up desire for the powers-that-be to rein in Big Tech – and not just in Brussels.

“We’re having a similar discussion about the appropriate response to the enormous power the so-called tech titans have to shape our lives, markets, and even our democracy,” outgoing U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner Terrell McSweeny told me. “The conference is teeing up provocative conversations about a range of issues regarding the impact of technology on society. I‘m glad that antitrust is a part of that conversation.”

All that said, it was hard to find anyone in Lisbon with a business model predicated on the idea that regulators will save the day. Perhaps that’s just the nature of entrepreneurs: they tend to get on with things.

Take the co-founders of GoPuff, a U.S. startup with a simple yet brash idea: effectively, to put the corner shop out of business. “A convenience store is not convenient anymore,” says Rafael Ilishayev, who co-founded GoPuff with his roommate Yakir Gola a few years ago while they were students at Drexel University in Philadelphia. GoPuff today operates in two dozen markets, bringing essentials like beer, condoms, ice cream and chips to largely, but not exclusively, Millennial customers.

As they expand their business – adding another 20-something locations next year – the co-founders think not of taking on Amazon, but of venturing where the Seattle giant has yet to tread. For instance, the bulk of GoPuff’s business comes between 9pm and 2am, hours when the e-commerce giant’s delivery machine is largely dormant. The GoPuff bros even invented an acronym for this strategy: BAP, for Becoming Amazon Proof. “If you are in e-commerce today, and not thinking about Amazon, you’re absolutely nuts,” says Gola.

GoPuff spends much of its effort on creating brand loyalty with its customers. That’s why content creation, such as dreaming up clever Snapchat stories and the like, is now the biggest department in the company. “If we establish an emotional connection, customers will think of us as a best friend,” Ilishayev says.

Marie Ekeland, a leading French venture capitalist, concedes that while the Silicon Valley giants have won the first round, there are still many opportunities for upstarts from other lands to take their place in the pantheon of tech successes. “Look at everything that the blockchain can empower and we are only at the beginning,” she told me during a panel discussion on digital trade. “We are in a second generation of startups where what we see are sectors that need more than just a digital skill – think industry or health.”

History suggests Ekeland may be right, says VMware Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger, who points out that it was only a few decades ago that IBM’s computing dominance was seen as a monopoly worthy of government intervention. “It’s a bit silly” for anyone to pin their hopes on antitrust regulators coming to the rescue, says Gelsinger, because “tech keeps disrupting itself”.

In her keynote address on the second day of the conference, Vestager laid out the basis for the $2.7 billion fine the European Union levied against Google for abusing its dominant role in online search and the commission’s ongoing case against Apple for receiving unfair state aid from the Irish government. “We don’t think success should depend on a company’s size, or its connections with government. It should depend, quite simply, on the merits of its products,” she said.

Again, hearty applause from the thousands gathered in the arena greeted her comments. But the smartest of the bunch may well have missed Vestager’s speech. Like the GoPuff founders, the most active insurgents were running around the rest of the sprawling event, pitching their businesses to potential partners, investors and even journalists – really, anyone who can help them make their own dent in the Death Star.",Breakingviews - Cox: Lisbon turns Tatooine for tech Rebel Alliance,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-technology-breakingviews/breakingviews-cox-lisbon-turns-tatooine-for-tech-rebel-alliance-idUSKBN1D921E

France became the first Western country to indicate that Saudi Arabia was holding Hariri against his will, saying it wished for him to have “all his freedom of movement and be fully able to play the essential role that is his in Lebanon”.

Hariri’s resignation has plunged Lebanon into crisis, thrusting the small Arab country back to the forefront of regional rivalry between the Sunni Muslim monarchy Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite revolutionary Iran.

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, said Saudi Arabia’s detention of Hariri, a long-time Saudi ally who declared his resignation while in Riyadh last Saturday, was an insult to all Lebanese and he must return to Lebanon.

“Let us say things as they are: the man is detained in Saudi Arabia and forbidden until this moment from returning to Lebanon,” Nasrallah said in a televised speech.

“It is clear that Saudi Arabia and Saudi officials have declared war on Lebanon and on Hezbollah in Lebanon,” he said.

His comments mirror an accusation by Riyadh on Monday that Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war on the conservative Gulf Arab kingdom.

Riyadh says Hariri is a free man and he decided to resign because Hezbollah was calling the shots in his government. Saudi Arabia considers Hezbollah to be its enemy in conflicts across the Middle East, including Syria and Yemen.

Western countries have looked on with alarm at the rising regional tension.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned other countries and groups against using Lebanon as vehicle for a larger proxy fight in the Middle East, saying Washington strongly backed Lebanon’s independence and respected Hariri as a strong partner of the United States, still referring to him as prime minister.

“There is no legitimate place or role in Lebanon for any foreign forces, militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the Lebanese state,” Tillerson said in a statement released by the U.S. State Department.

Tillerson told reporters on Friday there was no indication that Hariri was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will but that the United States was monitoring the situation.

The French foreign minister said earlier on Friday that he also believed Hariri was a free man - a statement at odds with the later French foreign ministry comment that it wanted Hariri to have “all his freedom of movement”.

Hariri has made no public remarks since announcing his resignation in a speech televised from Saudi Arabia, saying he feared assassination and accusing Iran and Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world.

Two top Lebanese government officials, a senior politician close to Hariri and a fourth source told Reuters on Thursday that the Lebanese authorities believe Hariri is being held in Saudi Arabia.

Nasrallah said Saudi Arabia was encouraging Israel to attack Lebanon. While an Israeli attack could not be ruled out entirely, he said, it was unlikely partly because Israel knew it would pay a very high price. “I warn them against any miscalculation or any step to exploit the situation,” he said.

“Saudi will fail in Lebanon as it has failed on all fronts,” Nasrallah said.

Riyadh has advised Saudi citizens not to travel to Lebanon, or if already there to leave as soon as possible. Other Gulf states have also issued travel warnings. Those steps have raised concern that Riyadh could take measures against the tiny Arab state, which hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees.

Hariri’s resignation is being widely seen as part of a Saudi attempt to counter Iran as its influence deepens in Syria and Iraq and as Riyadh and its allies battle Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Hariri’s resignation unraveled a political deal among rival factions that made him prime minister and President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, head of state last year.

The coalition government included Hezbollah, a heavily armed military and political organization.

STUCK BETWEEN “ANTAGONISTIC INTERESTS”

Aoun told Saudi Arabia’s envoy on Friday that Hariri must return to Lebanon and the circumstances surrounding his resignation as prime minister while in Saudi Arabia were unacceptable, presidential sources said.

An “international support group” of countries concerned about Lebanon, which includes the United States, Russia and France, appealed for Lebanon “to continue to be shielded from tensions in the region”. In a statement, they also welcomed Aoun’s call for Hariri to return.

In comments to Reuters, top Lebanese Druze politician Jumblatt said Lebanon did not deserve to be accused of declaring war on Saudi Arabia. “For decades we’ve been friends,” he said.

“We are a country that is squeezed between two antagonistic interests, between Saudi Arabia and Iran,” he said. “The majority of Lebanese are just paying the price ... Lebanon can not afford to declare a war against anybody.”

The Saudi foreign minister accused Hezbollah of a role in the launching of a ballistic missile at Riyadh from Yemen on Saturday. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen was an act of “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

Nasrallah mocked the Saudi accusation that Iran and Hezbollah were behind the firing of the missile from Yemen, saying Yemenis were capable of building their own missiles.",Hezbollah says Saudi declares Lebanon war with Hariri detention,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-politics/hezbollah-says-saudi-declares-lebanon-war-with-hariri-detention-idUSKBN1DA1J2?il=0

Uber immediately said it would appeal to higher courts against Friday’s decision by the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in central London.

The U.S. ride-hailing service has faced regulatory and legal setbacks around the world amid opposition from traditional taxi services and concern among some regulators. It has been forced to quit several countries, such as Denmark and Hungary.

Last year, two drivers successfully argued at a British employment tribunal that Uber exerted significant control over them to provide an on-demand taxi service and should grant them workers’ rights such as holiday entitlement and rest breaks.

That decision did not automatically apply to the app’s 50,000 drivers in Britain but was seen as likely to prompt more claims.

It could benefit workers at thousands of companies including firms in the “gig economy”, where individuals work for multiple employers without a fixed contract, such as courier Deliveroo.

The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which backed the two drivers, said these companies were “choosing to deprive workers of their rights”.

“Today’s victory is further proof, as if any more was needed, that the law is clear and these companies are simply choosing to deprive workers of their rights,” said Jason Moyer-Lee, the IWGB’s general secretary.

Uber says its drivers enjoy the flexibility of their work and are self-employed, entitling them in British law to only basic entitlements such as health and safety.

The firm argued in September that its drivers operate in the same way as minicabs, or private hire vehicles, which sprung up in Britain more than 50 years ago.

On Friday it confirmed it would appeal against the latest decision. A spokesman said the company had 14 days to submit its application and decide whether to apply to take the case to the Supreme Court, Britain’s top judicial body.

“Over the last year we have made a number of changes to our app to give drivers even more control,” said Uber UK’s Acting General Manager Tom Elvidge in a statement. “The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive.”

Yaseen Aslam, one of the drivers involved in the case, said they would continue their fight to ensure workers’ rights were respected.

“I am glad that the judge today confirmed what I and thousands of drivers have known all along: that Uber is not only exploiting drivers, but also acting unlawfully,” he said.

Uber, which is valued at around $70 billion with backers including Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, will be back in court on Dec. 11 to appeal a decision by London’s transport regulator to strip the app of its license.

Transport for London shocked Uber in September by deeming it unfit to run a taxi service and refusing to renew its license, citing the firm’s approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.",Uber loses UK appeal bid to overturn workers' rights decision,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-britain/uber-loses-uk-appeal-bid-to-overturn-workers-rights-decision-idUSKBN1DA18U

FILE PHOTO: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman looks on as he meets with French President Emmanuel Macron in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, November 9, 2017. Picture taken November 9, 2017. Saudi Press Agency/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo

On Saturday Nov. 4, guests at Riyadh’s Ritz Carlton were notified by the opulent hotel that: “Due to unforeseen booking by local authorities which requires an elevated level of security, we are unable to accommodate guests ... until normal operations are restored.”

The purge was already under way. Within hours security forces had rounded up dozens of members of Saudi Arabia’s political and business elite, mostly in the capital and the coastal city of Jeddah. Among them were 11 princes as well as ministers and wealthy tycoons.

Some were invited to meetings where they were detained. Others were arrested at their homes and flown to Riyadh or driven to the Ritz Carlton, which has been turned into a temporary prison.

The detainees were allowed a single, brief phone call home, a person familiar with the arrests told Reuters.

“They don’t receive calls and are kept under tight security. No one can go in or out,” the insider said. “It is obvious that there was a lot of preparation for it.”

The purge was ordered by 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Officially next in line to the throne to his father, King Salman, he is now in effect running the country which he has said he will transform into a modern state.

To do that - and in an attempt to shore up his own power - he has decided to go after the Saudi elite, including some members of the royal family, on accusations such as taking bribes and inflating the cost of business projects. Those arrested could not be reached for comment.

At stake is political stability in the world’s largest oil producer. The Crown Prince’s ability to rule unchallenged depends on whether the purge is successful.

The Crown Prince believes that unless the country changes, the economy will sink into a crisis that could fan unrest. That could threaten the royal family and weaken the country in its regional rivalry with Iran.

THE “CORRUPTION STICK”

Prince Mohammed decided to move on his family, the person familiar with events said, when he realised more relatives opposed him becoming king than he had thought.

“The signal was that anyone wavering in their support should watch out,” said the person familiar with the events. “The whole idea of the anti-corruption campaign was targeted towards the family. The rest is window dressing.”

King Salman said the purge was in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money”. Insiders said the accusations were based on evidence gathered by the intelligence service.

Government backers have rejected suggestions that the campaign is really about eliminating political enemies. There was no immediate comment from the royal court on this story.

Among those now holed up at the Ritz Carlton hotel is Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who is head of the powerful National Guard and Prince Mohammed’s cousin.

Miteb was in his farm house in Riyadh when he was called to a meeting with the Crown Prince. Such an invitation, even at night, would not be unusual for a senior official and would not have aroused suspicion.

“He went to the meeting and never came back,” said a second insider who has connections to some of those who were detained.

Others held include Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who is chairman of international investment firm Kingdom Holding and a cousin of Prince Mohammed, and Prince Turki bin Abdullah, former governor of Riyadh province and a son of the late King Abdullah.

Some royal watchers said tensions were laid bare during family meetings over the summer. One insider said it was widely known to Prince Mohammed that some of the powerful royals, including Miteb, were resentful about his elevation.

Prince Mohammed, who is widely known in Saudi Arabia by his initials MbS, had said openly in interviews that he would investigate the kingdom’s endemic corruption and would not hesitate to go after top officials.

The vehicle was an anti-corruption committee created by King Salman, and announced on Nov. 4. The king put the Crown Prince in charge, adding another power to the many he has been given in the past three years.

Saudi authorities have questioned 208 people in the anti-corruption investigation and estimate at least $100 billion has been stolen through graft, the attorney-general said on Thursday. The head of the committee said investigators had been collecting evidence for three years.

By launching a war on corruption, the prince has combined a popular cause with the elimination of an obstacle to acceding to the throne.

“MbS used the corruption stick which can reach any one of them,” said Jamal Khashoggi, a former adviser to Prince Turki al-Faisal, intelligence chief from 1979 to 2001. “For the first time we Saudis see princes being tried for their corruption.”

But Khashoggi, who lives in the United States, said Prince Mohammed was being selective in his purge.

“I believe MbS is a nationalist who loves his country and wants it to be the strongest but his problem is that he wants to rule alone,” he said.

DE FACTO RULER

Prince Mohammed was appointed defence minister in 2015 when King Salman became monarch. In June, the King named him heir to the throne, pushing aside his older cousin Mohammed bin Nayef, a veteran head of the security apparatus. The royal family acquiesced and by September the Crown Prince had rounded up and jailed religious and intellectual opponents.

The latest detentions are intended to help him push through reforms that promise the greatest change since the reign of King Abdulaziz, founder of the current Saudi state in the 1930s.

That state has rested on an enduring accommodation between the royal family and the Wahhabist clerics who control the hardline version of Islam that originated in Saudi Arabia.

The ruling family promised to give Saudis comfortable lives and a share of the country’s oil wealth. In return, their subjects have offered political submission and promised to follow the country’s strict religious and social codes.

King Abdulaziz, who was also known as Ibn Saud, died in 1953. Since then, Saudi Arabia has been run by the king and below him there has been a group of princes, none of them strong enough to impose his will against the wishes of the others.

Decisions have mostly come through consensus. That arrangement has meant social and political change has been glacial although it has also kept the kingdom stable.

But in moves that position Prince Mohammed as the new Ibn Saud, the Crown Prince is tearing down pillars of rule that had been eroding under the weight of population growth and low oil prices.

Consensus has been replaced by what critics say is one-man rule, opposed by some princes although they would not risk saying so in public.

In the past few decades, every Saudi king had one or two of his brothers, sons or nephews by his side advising and sharing in governance. But Prince Mohammed has not appointed any of his brothers or other close family to top positions, instead relying on a team of advisers -- mainly Saudis though some are U.S.- or British-trained.

King Salman, 82, still has the last word on everything. But he has delegated the running of the kingdom’s military, security, economic, foreign and social affairs to Prince Mohammed. There has been speculation for months, denied by court officials, that the king will soon abdicate the throne to MbS.

Even the Crown Prince’s age is remarkable. The last three kings have reached the throne aged 61, 80 and 79. Prince Mohammed is effectively in charge at 32.

NO GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS

Prince Mohammed says he offers a new social contract: A state that functions better than the rigid bureaucracy of the past, opportunities to have fun and an economy that will create jobs that can last, whatever happens in oil markets.

In September he announced that Saudi women will be given the right to drive. Just three weeks ago, during a conference for investors at the same Ritz Carlton that now houses the targets of his purge, he unveiled a plan for a $500-billion futuristic city where sexes could mingle and robots outnumber humans.

The prince has also drawn up a blueprint to wean Saudi Arabia off its dependence on oil and its subjects off state subsidies and government jobs. The public listing of national oil company Saudi Aramco, planned next year, is its centrepiece.

There are no guarantees the prince’s ambitions will succeed.

Even some admirers ask whether his reach exceeds his grasp. His top-down approach, brooking no opposition, could scare off investors wanting assurances about rule of law and security. Without huge investor support, he will struggle to meet the aspirations of Saudi youth.

War in Yemen, a dispute with the Gulf emirate of Qatar and growing tension with Iran is a concern to investors too.

It should help that Prince Mohammed, following the example of Ibn Saud, sees the importance of forging a special bond with the United States.

During a visit to Saudi Arabia in May, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Riyadh to lead an alliance against Iran and its attempt to cut a Shi‘ite axis through Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.

Soon afterwards, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates blockaded Qatar, accusing its ruling Al Thani dynasty of supporting Iran and Islamist terrorism. Trump gave his backing. After the arrests of the past week, Trump tweeted support, saying those arrested had been “milking their country for years”.

One insider close to the royal family said the National Guard was unlikely to react strongly to Miteb’s removal. He said there had been no resistance to the ousting of Mohammed bin Nayef at the interior ministry and the National Guard would be no different.",Insight: A house divided - How Saudi Crown Prince purged royal family rivals,https://in.reuters.com/article/saudi-arrests-crownprince/insight-a-house-divided-how-saudi-crown-prince-purged-royal-family-rivals-idINKBN1DA23P?il=0

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was down 0.08 percent at 94.37. For the week, the index was down 0.6 percent, on pace for its worst performance since the week ending Oct. 13.

The greenback has also lost 0.5 percent against the Japanese yen this week.

U.S. Senate Republicans unveiled a tax plan on Thursday that differed from the House of Representatives’ version on several fronts, including deductions for state and local taxes, and the estate tax.

Complicating a Republican push for the tax revamp, senators said that, like the House, they wanted to slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, but in 2019 rather than right away.

“It just highlights the challenge in reconciling the two (plans),” said currency strategist Erik Nelson of Wells Fargo Securities in New York.

The House was set to vote on its measure next week after its tax-writing Ways and Means Committee approved the legislation on Thursday along party lines, with Democrats united in opposition.

The Senate’s timetable was less clear, with a formal bill yet to be drafted in that chamber, where Republicans have a much smaller majority and a narrower path to winning approval for any legislation, let alone one as contentious as a tax package.

“I think the markets are becoming concerned that this is not a serious piece of legislation and that there really is no political support necessary to pass it,” said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York.

The dollar index gained about 3 percent from mid-September through the end of last week, boosted by hopes of tax cuts.

“This week was a bit of a reality check for currency markets,” Wells Fargo’s Nelson said.

Sterling closed the week on firmer ground, climbing around half a percent against the dollar on Friday as better-than-expected data on British industry and rising confidence in the progress of Brexit talks supported the currency.

Meanwhile, Democrats and progressive groups, emboldened by Democratic election victories in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday, sought to capitalize on the accusations in support of the Democratic nominee, former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones.

Moore, a controversial former judge and a staunch Christian conservative, was accused by a woman of initiating a sexual encounter in 1979 when she was 14 years old and he was a 32-year-old prosecutor, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.

Three other women said he pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18, though none accused him of sexual contact.

The 70-year-old Moore again denied any wrongdoing on Friday during an appearance on conservative commentator Sean Hannity’s national radio show.

“These allegations are completely false and misleading,” Moore said of claims that he engaged in sexual misconduct.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which helps elect Republicans to the Senate, filed paperwork with federal election officials on Friday severing its fundraising relationship with Moore for the special election on Dec. 12.

Numerous Republican leaders either called on Moore to drop out immediately or said he should do so if the allegations prove true.

“Moore is unfit for office and should step aside,” former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said on Twitter.

But several Alabama Republican officials did not waver in their support of Moore.

The contrasting reactions echoed the rift exposed when Moore bested the incumbent, Luther Strange, in the Republican primary.

Strange was backed by Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies, while Moore’s candidacy earned the support of self-styled outsiders such as Steve Bannon, the former strategist for U.S. President Donald Trump.

Following the publication of the Washington Post story, several Democratic senators, including liberal Elizabeth Warren, sent email blasts to their donor lists, soliciting donations to Jones’ campaign.

The Democratic Party has been coordinating with the Jones campaign behind the scenes, offering logistical aid while wary of providing overt support such as television advertising in the deeply Republican state.

“The best thing that Democrats can do in the Alabama Senate race is make sure the Doug Jones campaign can run the strongest, most aggressive race that the campaign can,” said a Democratic operative, who requested anonymity.

Progressive groups MoveOn, Democracy for America and Indivisible expect the revelations to boost their grassroots efforts to engage voters in Alabama.

“We were planning to go bigger already,” Matt Blizek, who oversees election mobilization for MoveOn, said. “With the news and the fact that this is a close race, that’s only going to increase.”

A win for Jones could transform the political picture in Washington, where Senate Republicans hold a narrow 52-48 edge.

The race had been seen as a long shot for Democrats in Alabama, which has not elected a Democratic senator in a quarter century.

But a confluence of events even before Thursday had given some Democrats hope of an upset victory, despite Jones’ double-digit deficit in some opinion polls.

Moore was twice forced out of his position as the state’s chief justice, once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the courthouse and once for defying the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. Democrats have highlighted his penchant for incendiary statements about Muslims and homosexuality.

Zac McCrary, a veteran Democratic pollster based in Birmingham, Alabama, said he now sees Jones as the favorite.

“Roy Moore had much less margin for error than a Republican does traditionally in Alabama,” McCrary said. “Maybe for the first time in this campaign season, I would bet against Roy Moore representing Alabama in the U.S. Senate.”

But Jonathan Gray, a Republican consultant in Alabama, said voters were already questioning the veracity of the Washington Post story, given its timing. The only development that could sink Moore’s candidacy is a write-in campaign from a Republican backed by the party, he said.

Absent that, he said, all the analysis in the world will not change a simple fact: “Roy Moore wins December 12.”",Republican establishment bails on Alabama candidate after sex allegations,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-congress-moore-fundraising/republican-establishment-bails-on-alabama-candidate-after-sex-allegations-idINKBN1DA2MU?il=0

The layoffs at GE Digital, based in San Ramon, California, affect about 100 sales people in the Americas, including those who sell GE’s Predix industrial-internet software, according to two sources.

The software, central to GE’s strategy under former Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, has been beset with technical problems, prompting GE to shift strategy.

The 125-year-old conglomerate is considering job reductions across all of its diverse businesses, the sources said. Struggling units such as GE Power are facing significant staff cuts, while aviation and healthcare businesses could see lesser reductions, the sources said.

Reuters reported in August that Flannery intended to reduce corporate staff at its Boston headquarters significantly, a process that has begun, according to sources. The company has also slowed construction of its headquarters.

It is not clear how many more jobs Flannery now plans to cut, or how quickly. With 295,000 employees, even a 10 percent overall reduction would eliminate nearly 30,000 jobs.

At the digital business, which has about 13,000 people including legacy information technology staff, GE is not only cutting sales staff. It is also reducing the number of developers who create the software, according to the two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Digital sales staff were given notice in recent days and told they could apply for about 19 remaining jobs in the division or other jobs at GE, the sources said.

GE declined to comment on specific staff reductions, but highlighted its plan to cut $3 billion in costs by the end of 2018. “Those actions include but are not limited to, employee reductions which have been well underway for many months,” spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said.

GE shares closed up 2.5 percent at $20.49.

DIVIDEND CUT COMING?

Analysts have slashed estimates for GE’s 2018 earnings and expect a major restructuring plan on Monday as GE tries to pull out of a 16-year stock slump.

GE is likely to get much smaller and more focused, Jeff Sprague, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, wrote on Friday. “It is also conceivable that looking out a few years, GE ceases to exist as we know it,” he said, referring to a potential break-up.

“Staffing has to go down meaningfully,” said a large Boston-based fund manager who invests in GE. The company spent billions on restructuring the last few years but without growth in operating profit, he added.

Since becoming CEO on Aug. 1, Flannery has doubled the amount of cost cutting targeted for next year to $2 billion, and is cutting $1 billion this year. He said he has found more than $20 billion in GE assets to sell and is looking at further changes to the portfolio beyond that.

A 30-year GE veteran, Flannery is due to present the strategic changes and new financial targets at an investor meeting in New York on Monday. The plans also could include cutting GE’s dividend for only the third time in GE’s history. The other two were during the Great Depression and the financial crisis.

Flannery has come under increasing pressure to boost GE’s profit and share price after the company badly missed earnings expectations for the third quarter and lowered its financial outlook last month.

GE stock has fallen more than 36 percent this year, making it the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and posing the risk that the only remaining original company in the widely watched stock index could be kicked out.

Activist investor Ed Garden, a founding partner at Trian Fund Management, recently joined GE’s board. Trian invested $2.5 billion in GE in 2015 and pressed the company to cut costs and focus on sectors where it is a market leader, such as power plants, jet engines and medical devices. Trian declined to comment.

GE is considering divestment of its aircraft leasing, transportation and healthcare information technology businesses. The job reduction efforts in GE’s units appear to be independent of those divestitures, the sources said.

Flannery already has grounded GE’s corporate jets, cut car bonuses for executives and dismissed two vice chairmen to save money.

In another sign of austerity, he shrunk the size of GE’s annual leadership retreat in January and moved it from ritzy Boca Raton, Florida, to Boston.

With the yield curve at its steepest level in over a week a day after it touched its flattest level in a decade, those junk bond ETFs recovered.

The U.S.-listed, $19 billion iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF rose 0.22 percent at $87.11, while the $13.1 billion SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF, gained 0.47 percent at $36.68.

Both funds shed about 1.0 percent on the week, for their steepest drop in three months.

Investors pulled $621.9 million from U.S. junk portfolios in the latest reporting week, following outflows of $1.2 billion the previous week, according to Lipper data.

Bank of America Corp analysts said in a note on Friday that volatility in high-yield has been “driven primarily by a confluence of several meaningful and yet only loosely related events,” including the collapse of the Sprint Corp and T-Mobile U.S. Inc merger, the U.S. Justice Department’s challenges to the AT&T Inc and Time Warner Inc merger, a credit downgrade for Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and other industry-specific news along with the potential for tax reform to be delayed.

“The impact on related (high yield) names has been significant enough to cause a market-wide reaction,” they wrote.

“Only a dozen names in the index have been responsible for half of HY index widening so far this week.”

The analysts also said the flatness of the yield curve has been hurting high yield, partly by hurting bank stocks, which benefit from a steeper yield curve that allows them to borrow cheaply, lend at higher rates and profit from the difference.

The junk bond ETF sell-off was “meaningful,” the Bank of America analysts said, “but not extreme moves by the standards of this asset class.” “Overall, we find a modest correction to be both natural and welcome in the context of the relentless tightening in (high yield) spreads we have seen so far this year, and over the past two months in particular.”",U.S. junk bond sector ends rough week on calmer note,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-investment-bonds-highyield-etf/u-s-junk-bond-sector-ends-rough-week-on-calmer-note-idINKBN1D92UH?il=0

On his Senate campaign website, Moore said he was suspended “for upholding the sanctity of marriage as between one man and one woman.”","(Reuters) - A woman has accused Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama, of initiating a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 years old and he was 32, the Washington Post reported on Thursday, prompting top Republicans to say he should step aside if the allegations prove true.

Moore, 70, the state’s former chief judge, vehemently denied the allegations, calling them “completely false and a desperate political attack.”

U.S. President Donald Trump would want Moore to step aside if the allegations against him are true, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Friday.

“Like most Americans, the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a person’s life,” Sanders said.

“However, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside,” she said, as Trump arrived in Vietnam on his 12-day Asia tour.

In a series of Twitter posts later in the day, Moore cast the published allegations against him part of a bid to “silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me,” adding “I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!”

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, working with a slim 52-48 majority, called on Moore to drop out of the race “if these allegations are true.” Several other Republicans, including Texas Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, and Utah Senator Mike Lee, all of whom endorsed Moore, echoed that sentiment.

At least two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and John Thune of South Dakota, said Moore should step aside immediately, with McCain calling the accusations “deeply disturbing and disqualifying.”

Leigh Corfman, now 53, told the Post she met Moore at a courthouse in 1979 when Moore offered to keep her company on a bench outside of a hearing room while her mother was inside for child custody proceeding.

Moore, at the time an assistant district attorney, asked for the girl’s phone number and days later took her to his house, where they engaged in sexual activity before she asked to be taken home, Corfman said.

The story also quoted three other women who said Moore dated them when they were between 16 and 18 years of age and he was in his early 30s, though none said they had sexual contact with Moore.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm the allegations.

The Moore campaign accused the Post of colluding with Democrats to tarnish his reputation with false accusations.

The Post said none of the women had donated to or worked for Moore’s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, or for his Republican primary rivals, and that Corfman said she had voted for Republicans in the past three presidential elections, including for Donald Trump in 2016.

POPULAR WITH ALABAMA REPUBLICANS

Moore has consistently led in polls over Jones. He was considered a heavy favorite in deeply Republican Alabama in the Dec. 12 special election to fill the seat of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

It remains to be see whether Thursday’s allegations can buoy Jones’ long-shot bid, which would represent a major upset for Democrats and narrow Republicans’ current edge in the Senate.

Jones’ campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Post story.

No matter what happens, Moore will remain on the ballot on Dec. 12 since a candidate’s name cannot be removed within 76 days of the election, according to the office of Alabama’s secretary of state.

If, however, the state party tells election officials that it wants to withdraw its nominee, or if Moore himself decided to do so, election officials would not certify any votes cast for Moore. Write-in candidates are also allowed under state law.

Alabama political strategist David Mowery, who has worked for candidates of both parties, said the chance of Moore bowing out of the race was “less than zero,” and that it was almost as improbable for state party officials to abandon him in favor of a last-minute write-in candidate.

Mowery cited Moore’s overwhelming popularity with Alabama’s Republican voters, who he said would tend to distrust allegations published in the Post. Nevertheless, he said Democrats would seize on the scandal to boost fund-raising.

Moore, who has made his moral and religious beliefs the heart of his pitch to voters, prevailed over several Republican opponents in a closely contested primary that saw Trump, McConnell and most Senate Republicans support the incumbent who had been appointed to Sessions’ seat, Luther Strange.

The race exposed rifts between the Republican Party’s conservative base and its Washington-based establishment. Moore’s candidacy was heavily promoted by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, who has vowed to support grassroots challengers next year to take on Republican incumbents.

On several occasions, Moore has made controversial statements and taken positions that have cost him his job. He has condemned homosexuality and said he believes some U.S. communities are living under Islamic religious law.

He first became a national figure in the early 2000s, when he lost his position as Alabama chief justice after refusing a court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from outside the courthouse.

After winning his position back in 2012, he was again forced out after defying the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage by ordering probate judges not to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

On his Senate campaign website, Moore said he was suspended “for upholding the sanctity of marriage as between one man and one woman.”",Republican Senate candidate Moore hit by sexual misconduct allegations,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-moore/republican-senate-candidate-moore-hit-by-sexual-misconduct-allegations-idUSKBN1D9320

MSCI’s global stock index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, declined 0.15 percent, slipping further from a record level. On Thursday, the global index fell 0.4 percent following 10 straight days of gains. The dollar index .DXY, too, fell 0.06 percent.

The MSCI world index surged more than 20 percent so far this year, and some investors believe a pullback is due.

“The pause that the market is currently in is directly related to what’s going on from a tax standpoint,” said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist for Northern Trust Corp.

Adding insult to injury, the pullback in stocks as well as softness in high-yield “junk” bonds this week did little to support traditional safe havens.

Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR fell 21/32 in price to yield 2.4037 percent. The 30-year bond US30YT=RR fell 50/32 in price to yield 2.8845 percent. [US/]

Meanwhile, German government bond yields climbed to their highest in over a week as euro zone bonds were sold across the board for a second consecutive day. The yield on Germany’s benchmark 10-year government bond DE10YT=TWEB hit 0.40 percent for the first time since Oct. 27.

Citigroup Inc equity trading strategist Alex Altmann said it is rare for government bonds and equities to be hit at the same time.

“It’s a classic hallmark of momentum strategies unwinding,” he said, referring to a investment strategy that favors buying recent winners and selling losers.

”We may not get that calm ride into the end of the year.”

TAX OVERHAUL

U.S. Republican senators said they wanted to slash the corporate tax rate in 2019, later than the House’s proposed schedule of 2018, complicating a push for the biggest overhaul of U.S. tax law since the 1980s.

The House was set to vote on its measure next week. But the Senate’s timetable was less clear.

“I would say a compromise will be reached,” said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities.

L‘action de la holding basée à Amsterdam a perdu un tiers de sa valeur depuis l‘annonce voici une semaine de résultats trimestriels jugés décevants.

Vendredi, le titre cédait de nouveau 2,81% à 10,36 euros juste avant la clôture de la Bourse de Paris.

Ancien d‘Alcatel, France Télécom et Vodafone, Michel Combes, 55 ans, avait été recruté il y a deux ans pour redresser l‘opérateur français SFR en difficultés.

Sous sa houlette, l‘opérateur s‘est engagé dans une boulimie d‘achats dans les contenus, acquérant à prix d‘or des droits sportifs prestigieux, des séries et des médias alors que ses clients fuyaient en masse un réseau à la qualité dégradée et un service client jugé insatisfaisant, soulignent plusieurs banquiers et analystes.

“Il y a cette impression générale qu‘il a mis la charrue avant les boeufs”, estime un banquier proche d‘Altice.

Selon plusieurs sources, Michel Combes a également pâti de sa difficulté à trouver sa place dans l‘organisation d‘Altice et de ses difficultés à s‘entendre avec plusieurs hauts gradés du groupe, pour certains compagnons d‘aventure de longue date de Patrick Drahi.

Le fondateur et actionnaire de contrôle d‘Altice, qui n‘occupait plus de rôle de premier plan dans l‘organigramme de sa holding, prend la présidence du conseil avec l‘objectif de superviser la stratégie et son exécution, en particulier en France où se concentrent les difficultés.

Michel Combes est par ailleurs remplacé par le bras droit de Patrick Drahi, Dexter Goei, qui dirigeait jusque-là les activités d‘Altice aux Etats-Unis tandis que d‘autres fidèles comme Armando Pereira et Jérémie Bonnin sont désignés à des postes-clefs.

Le nouvel organigramme, censé clarifier la répartition des rôles au sein du groupe, suscite cependant des interrogations.

“Les changements organisationnels sont censés aligner les intérêts des actionnaires avec ceux des dirigeants du groupe et tenter de restaurer la confiance des investisseurs mais nous ne sommes pas convaincus que cela soit le cas car nous estimons que la nouvelle gouvernance apporte plus de questions que de réponses”, estiment les analystes de Bryan Garnier.

“LA FIN DU RÊVE”

“La concentration de la nouvelle gouvernance autour de gradés historiques d‘Altice pourraient laisser penser que le groupe éprouve des difficultés à faire venir et à retenir de hauts dirigeants du secteur”, ajoutent-ils dans une note.

Pour un connaisseur du groupe, la réaction du titre vendredi montre que la défiance des marchés s‘étend au-delà du cas particulier de Michel Combes.

Les difficultés d‘Altice en Europe ont ravivé les interrogations sur une stratégie basée sur des acquisitions à marche forcée financée par de la dette et les réductions de coûts à coups de serpe dans un contexte de remontée inéluctable des taux d‘intérêt.

La chute du titre en Bourse a automatiquement fait remonter le ratio du groupe de dette nette/equity, de 2,2 à la fin du premier semestre à 4,2 selon les calculs de Bryan Garnier, ce qui pourrait durcir les conditions de financement du M&A et de refinancement de la dette.

Altice, dont 85% de la dette est à taux fixe, n‘a toutefois pas d‘échéance majeure avant 2022.

The airline in September canceled 20,000 flights, saying rostering problems had left it without enough standby pilots to operate without significant delays. The resulting wave of passenger outrage threatened to undo the success of its ‘Always Getting Better’ customer service drive.

Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers has responded by promising pilots improved pay and conditions, which it says exceed those offered by rivals.

In the memo, Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said almost 20 of Ryanair’s 86 bases had voted for the pay deal as of Friday. However, a number of bases, including its largest hub at London Stansted, have rejected the offer.

Some pilots have been using September’s rostering issue to press for better conditions and the creation of a pan-European representative body; Ryanair has long opposed recognizing unions.

Ryanair said in the memo sent on Friday that it would “dramatically increase” the number of pilots employed directly rather than by outside agencies; over 180 first officers would be offered Ryanair contracts in November, and 300 more offers would be made by December.

It also said it had hired 1,040 new pilots this year, with the newest entrants receiving the better pay terms, and that it expected another 400 to join by March, bringing its crewing ratio to 11.0 pilots per aircraft from 10.5 by the time the busy European summer schedule begins.

A new crew control mobile phone app has also been introduced to speed up the logging of absences, and the memo says Ryanair will double the number of base managers to eight in the weeks ahead to “respond even faster to even more pilot queries”.

“We have launched an Always Flying Better (AFB) program to fill the infrastructure gaps in pilot communications, admin support and effective structures for resolving pilot queries,” Wilson said.

Wilson also said a problem with allocated leave for December had caused inconvenience to a small number of pilots.

Some pilots have said that a significant number of their colleagues have reported being assigned annual leave days without consultation.

A decisão de Aécio agravou ainda mais a cizânia entre os tucanos, com aliados de Tasso, que lançou-se candidato ao comando da sigla nesta semana, criticando o senador mineiro, abatido por acusações de irregularidades no âmbito da delação premiada de executivos da J&F, holding que controla a JBS.

O ex-governador Alberto Goldman foi indicado por Aécio para comandar o PSDB interinamente até a convenção nacional do partido, marcada para 9 de dezembro, quando Tasso deverá disputar o comando partidário com o governador de Goiás, Marconi Perillo.

“Acredito que o restabelecimento da coesão, com tolerância à variabilidade das opiniões internas, mas também com firmeza de propósitos, requer que o presidente designado do PSDB, Alberto Goldman, crie condições para que líderes experientes e respeitados, como o governador de São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, assumam posição central no partido”, escreveu Fernando Henrique, em uma rede social.

“Se porventura tal convergência não se concretizar, o que porá em risco as chances do PSDB, já disse que apoiarei a candidatura do senador Tasso Jereissati à presidência do partido. Com isso, não faço ressalvas ao direito do governador de Goiás, Marconi Perillo, a quem respeito por sua fidelidade ao PSDB e pelo bom governo que faz”, disse FHC. “A vitória de um ou de outro não corresponde à vitória do bem contra o mal: precisamos permanecer juntos.”

Na mensagem, Fernando Henrique diz ainda fazer um “apelo ao bom senso e às responsabilidades nacionais dos líderes do partido para que busquem restabelecer a unidade”, diante do que chamou de “acirramento” causado pela destituição de Tasso da presidência interina do PSDB.

Para o ex-presidente, a coesão interna entre os tucanos é “requisito para enfrentarmos a próxima campanha eleitoral propondo as transformações pelas quais o país clama”.

Fernando Henrique também defendeu o apoio do PSDB às reformas que tramitam no Congresso Nacional, afirmando que elas fazem “parte do que acreditamos e do que pregamos”. Defendeu, ainda, mudanças estatutárias para criar “canais mais amplos para participação dos filiados na escolha dos candidatos”.

Alckmin tem sido apontado como nome mais provável do PSDB para disputar a Presidência da República na eleição do ano que vem e já disse publicamente ter a intenção de novamente concorrer ao Planalto, depois de perder para o ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva em 2006.

O prefeito de Manaus, Arthur Virgílio, também já manifestou vontade de disputar a candidatura tucana e o prefeito de São Paulo, João Doria, embora não tenha admitido publicamente a vontade de concorrer, tem se movimentado nacionalmente com uma série de viagens pelo país e pelo exterior.

A disputa entre os tucanos têm como principal fator divergências internas em torno do apoio da sigla ao governo do presidente Michel Temer, em que o PSDB tem quatro ministros --Antonio Imbassahy (Secretaria de Governo), Bruno Araújo (Cidades), Aloysio Nunes (Relações Exteriores) e Luislinda Valois (Direitos Humanos).

According to a draft of the final statement seen by Reuters and due to be released on Saturday in Vietnam, the 11 countries committed to “the core elements” of a deal while making clear more work remains.

Moving ahead with TPP would be a boost for the principle of multilateral trade agreements after U.S. President Donald Trump ditched it this year in favor of an “America First” policy that he reiterated at an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam.

Any kind of TPP deal looked in doubt earlier in the week after officials said Vietnam’s chief negotiator had walked out of one round of talks and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau then skipped a leaders’ meeting on the pact.

Negotiators returned to the table on Friday and agreed on some basics of what they called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).

Partly to counter China’s growing dominance in Asia, Japan had been lobbying hard for the TPP pact, which aims to eliminate tariffs on industrial and farm products across the 11-nation bloc whose trade totalled $356 billion last year.

The final statement said a “limited set of provisions” from the original deal would be suspended, adding further technical work was needed on four areas that still needed consensus “to prepare finalised text for signature”.

It did not say when that might happen.

“There is a lot of work left to be done but I think we have made good progress today,” Canadian Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told reporters in Vietnam late on Friday.

Canada, which has the second biggest economy among remaining TPP countries after Japan, had said it wanted to ensure an agreement that would protect jobs.

Champagne, who blamed “a misunderstanding about the schedule” for Trudeau’s absence, specifically mentioned the auto sector and cultural protection as areas needing more work.

Speaking separately, a Canadian official said the nations had “agreed to a framework towards the deal” with work programs to handle various outstanding issues.

As well as the cuts to tariffs, the TPP agreement has provisions for protecting the environment, workers’ rights and intellectual property - one of the major sticking points after the departure of the United States.

Canada’s position has been further complicated by the fact that it is simultaneously renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with the Trump administration.

At a speech in Danang, Trump set out a strong message making clear he was only interested in bilateral deals in Asia which would never put the United States at a disadvantage.

China’s President Xi Jinping, meanwhile, used the same forum to stress multilateralism and said globalization was an irreversible trend.

APEC, whose leaders hold their full summit on Saturday, has itself been buffeted by the changes under Trump.

Talks between trade and foreign ministers from the group failed to reach agreement on their usual joint statement in the face of U.S. demands to remove language about supporting free trade and fighting protectionism.","TPP countries agree to keep trade deal alive, much work remains",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1DA2MW-OCATP

Bitcoin has been on a tear in recent months, with a vertiginous sevenfold increase in value since the start of the year that has led to many warnings the bitcoin market - now worth well over $100 billion - has become a bubble that is about to burst.

It reached a record high of $7,888 around 1800 GMT on Wednesday after a software upgrade planned for next week that could have split the cryptocurrency in a so-called “fork” was suspended.

But it has quickly retreated from that peak, falling to as low as $6,718 around 1330 GMT on Friday. It later recovered a touch to trade around $6,880 by 1645 GMT, but that was still down almost 4 percent on the day.

“Bitcoin is all ups and downs,” said Thomas Bertani, chief executive of Eidoo, a cryptocurrency wallet provider that recently became the first startup in the space to take out a full-page advert in the Wall Street Journal newspaper.

“The market realized that the price rise was an over-reaching, so people started selling... (and) there are many long and short positions that amplify price movements.”

As bitcoin tumbled, Bitcoin Cash, which was generated from another software split on Aug.1, surged, trading up as much as 35 percent on the day to around $850, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.

Bitcoin Cash’s transactions are processed in so-called “blocks” that are larger in capacity than bitcoin‘s, so can therefore in theory allow for more transactions to be processed at any given time, making transaction fees much cheaper.

The fork that had been planned for next week, known as “SegWit2x”, had also intended to increase the capacity of the blocks, and could thus have reduced fees for bitcoin transactions.

Any investors, therefore, that see bitcoin more as a currency than a store of value might be choosing to buy into Bitcoin Cash now that Segwit2x had been scrapped, Bertani said.

“People who had been supporting Segwit2x could as an alternative move to Bitcoin Cash,” he said.

Globalization is an irreversible trend, but the world must work to make it more balanced and inclusive, Xi told leaders gathered in the Vietnamese resort city of Danang for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting.

His comments came moments after Trump told the same audience the United States would not tolerate chronic trade abuses from partners.

“Should we steer economic globalization, or should we dither and stall in the face of challenge? Should we jointly advance regional cooperation or should we go our separate ways?” Xi asked.

“Openness brings progress, while self-seclusion leaves one behind,” he said.

During the past year, Xi has positioned China as a defender of globalization in speeches around the world, contrasting himself with Trump, who has pursued his “America First” agenda, and pulled the United States out of the regional Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal.

Trump’s predecessor saw the deal as a way for the United States, and not China, to write Asia’s trade rules.

Having just concluded a state visit to China, Trump said the United States was ready to make a bilateral deal with any country in the Indo-Pacific region, but only on the basis of “mutual respect and mutual benefit”.

He blasted the World Trade Organization and multilateral trade deals, and some analysts expect tougher action may be imminent from the White House to fight bilateral trade imbalances with China exacerbated by Beijing’s state-led economic model.

But Xi’s efforts to seize the mantle of free trade have rung hollow to critics of China, who argue it erects more market barriers to foreign companies, using state-driven industrial plans, than any major economy.

In Danang, Xi said China would “significantly ease market access” for foreign firms, and all businesses registered in China would be treated as equals.

Soon after Trump left Beijing, China said it would raise foreign ownership limits in financial firms, a move cautiously welcomed by business groups as an important step in opening up a tantalizing multi-trillion-dollar financial services market.

The 11 countries still party to the TPP have been looking for a way forward for the deal on the sidelines of the APEC meeting. Japan had lobbied hard to proceed with the pact that could also help to contain China’s growing regional dominance, as it is not involved.

Xi has been selling an alternate vision for regional trade by promoting the Beijing-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which includes Australia, India and more than a dozen other countries, but not the United States.

The RCEP is seen as an alternate to the TPP for a path to the broader Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) that APEC aspires to.

“We should support the multilateral trading system and practice open regionalism, to allow developing members to benefit more from international trade and investment,” Xi said.

China will speed up negotiations with partners on free trade pacts, and work for the speedy conclusion of RCEP talks, he added.","Countering Trump, China's Xi touts cooperation in Asia-Pacific",https://www.reuters.com/article/apec-summit-china/countering-trump-chinas-xi-touts-cooperation-in-asia-pacific-idINKBN1DA0U2

A heavy metal rendition of the Catalonian national anthem ""Els Segadors,"" or ""The Reapers"" has turned a virtually unknown Virginia-based band, A Sound of Thunder, into celebrities in the politically sensitive region in northeastern Spain. Within days of its release, the song racked up more than a million hits on YouTube, making it the band's most popular single since they started in 2008. Thousands of Catalonians voted for independence from Spain during a banned referendum in October that ended in violence and spurred a constitutional crisis in the euro zone's fourth-biggest economy. Back in Manassas, Virginia, Nina Osegueda, the band's lead singer, made a quick decision to release a video of the band's version of ""Els Segadors"" on Youtube. Osegueda, whose mother is Catalan, has strong ties to the region and originally recorded the anthem as a tribute to her mother. The song was never intended to be released as a single, but instead was part of the band's new full-length album, ""It Was Metal,"" to be released in March 2018. The violence that surrounded the referendum vote changed all that. ""We have a couple other singles that we were planning on releasing in advance to show people what the new album is going to sound like,"" she said. ""But then the vote happened and 800 people were injured by the police trying to vote. So I said we should try and just put the song out to show our support against police brutality."" ""Suddenly it was spreading all over the place... And then I noticed that someone shared us on Twitter and it wound up actually being a Catalan politician,"" Osegueda said. Music stations in Catalonia picked up the song and Osegueda was interviewed on several radio shows. The attention she has received has spread to her relatives as her Catalonian uncle was interviewed on local radio. On the band's YouTube page, fans have left messages saying they prefer the metal version to the original and many have said the song has struck an emotional chord. Osegueda recorded some parts of the song in Catalan. She doesn't speak the language and singing with proper pronunciation was intimidating, but she says the enthusiasm and support from her new found fans has been humbling. ""You know, we're not on a label. We do everything ourselves. So when we see this many people responding, it's like it's overwhelming,"" Osegueda said. The band, whose albums have been crowdfunded through various Kickstarter campaigns, will tour Catalonia for the first time in December, just days before regional elections on Dec. 21. They have shows planned in Barcelona, Tarragona and other Catalonian cities. For Osegueda, who has traveled to Catalonia a number of times, the upcoming visit feels different. ""I've always enjoyed going there on vacation. But now it's a lot deeper because there's so many people out there who saw our song as inspiration. So I feel like I definitely have a deeper connection now,"" she said.",Virginia heavy metal band strikes chord with Catalonia anthem,https://www.reuters.com/video/2017/11/09/virginia-heavy-metal-band-strikes-chord?videoId=372941926&videoChannel=118169

Rockwell, 49, who recently played a Klansman and a brutish Texas colonel, currently co-stars as a racist, angry police officer in the movie “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.”

“I think he’s very lonely. I think he was probably abused. His father hit him when he was a kid, and he’s got a weird relationship with his mom,” Rockwell told Reuters of his character, Dixon.

“All this adds to a lot of complexity,” he added.

“Three Billboards,” out in U.S. theaters on Friday, stars Frances McDormand as Mildred, a woman on a mission to get the local police in her small Missouri hometown to properly investigate the murder of her daughter.

The film, produced by Fox Searchlight, has already attracted awards buzz and strong critical praise for both McDormand and Rockwell.

McDormand’s hardened, foul-mouthed Mildred places questions on three large billboards about the town’s police efforts that cause her to clash with law enforcement, particularly Dixon.

“None of these characters live in the black and white. They live in the gray,” Rockwell said.

“Three Billboards” writer and director Martin McDonagh said Dixon isn’t a “representation of a thing or an idea or a group.” Furthermore, Dixon’s character in “Three Billboards” is forced to face humility and he ends the film in an unexpected place.

“If I was just writing a strictly racist brute, then you wouldn’t have found the hope or the change or the humanity in him,” McDonagh said.

While “Three Billboards” was first written about eight years ago, its exploration of a small, isolated town and a racist police officer has some resonance with present day racial tensions in America. McDonagh and Rockwell said they hoped the film sparked conversations around the issue.

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

FILE PHOTO: An overall view of the assembly line where the BMW X4 is made at the BMW manufacturing plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina March 28, 2014. REUTERS/Chris Keane/File Photo

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

A operação deve arrecadar 12 bilhões de reais para o Tesouro em 2018, além de gerar recursos para a Eletrobras e para abater encargos nas contas de luz ao longo dos próximos 30 anos, disse o executivo, que garantiu que a desestatização não irá elevar custos para os consumidores.

O governo revelou em agosto os planos de privatizar a Eletrobras, que serão efetivados por meio de uma oferta de novas ações que diluirá a União para uma fatia minoritária na companhia, de menos de 40 por cento.

“Eu acredito na execução desse projeto... ele é bom para o consumidor, porque vai baixar a tarifa. E não é só baixar, você vai criar condições de mantê-la baixa”, afirmou Ferreira, em entrevista à Reuters no Rio de Janeiro.

As ações preferenciais da Eletrobras acumulam alta de cerca de 20 por cento desde que o executivo deixou a privada CPFL Energia e assumiu a companhia, em julho de 2016.

Para atrair ainda mais interesse do mercado na oferta de ações, a Eletrobras definirá um plano de negócios para os próximos anos que irá prever a retomada dos investimentos da companhia em novos projetos de geração e transmissão já em 2018 ou no início de 2019.

“Não tenho dúvidas que, se tiver um plano de negócios criador de valor, entra quem não está e aumenta a aposta quem já está. Dúvida zero nisso”, afirmou.

O grupo atual de acionistas minoritários da Eletrobras inclui nomes como Banco Clássico, Citibank, fundos da gestora 3GRadar e o Banco Central da Noruega (Norges Bank), e outros fundos também são vistos por Ferreira como possíveis compradores de papéis da companhia.

“Todos os fundos que são atrelados ao setor elétrico globalmente, todos os fundos de infraestrutura, os fundos de países emergentes, fundos de pensão. É o investidor institucional”, apontou.

RISCO NO RADAR

Mas o presidente da Eletrobras alertou que é fundamental que o governo federal solucione rapidamente um impasse sobre o tratamento do risco hidrológico no setor elétrico, iniciado após anos consecutivos de chuvas abaixo da média na região das hidrelétricas do país.

Com pouca água nos reservatórios, as hidrelétricas não têm conseguido produzir toda a energia que venderam em contratos, o que impactou o faturamento das empresas do segmento e gerou uma guerra judicial no mercado de eletricidade que se arrasta desde meados de 2015.

Na privatização da Eletrobras, está previsto que a companhia utilizará valores arrecadados com a oferta de ações para pagar ao governo federal um bônus em troca de novos e mais vantajosos contratos para suas hidrelétricas mais antigas, mas o risco hídrico pode reduzir a projeção de retorno desses ativos.

”É muito importante... certamente o GSF (jargão técnico do risco hidrológico) é um ‘issue’ na precificação e é bom que seja resolvido antes da operação... Se a gente achava que isso era (um risco) marginal no passado, hoje a gente vê que não é”, afirmou.

O Ministério de Minas e Energia decidiu nesta semana dar um tratamento urgente ao tema, com o envio de uma medida provisória (MP) à Casa Civil que propõe um acordo entre governo e empresas para resolver o impasse.

ATIVOS À VENDA

O presidente da Eletrobras também avaliou que há muito apetite de possíveis compradores por um conjunto de 77 participações minoritárias em linhas de transmissão e usinas eólicas e por distribuidoras de energia da companhia que serão colocadas à venda até o final do primeiro quadrimestre de 2018.

O executivo disse que provavelmente todas fatias em ativos de geração e transmissão serão vendidas rapidamente e que muitas podem ficar com os sócios atuais da Eletrobras nos empreendimentos.

“Acho que pode vender as 77, antes das distribuidoras. Pelo interesse que a gente vê dos sócios, talvez se consiga vender para os sócios diretamente”, explicou Ferreira.

Ele disse ainda, sem citar nomes, que tem recebido muitas manifestações de potenciais compradores para as distribuidoras.

“O interesse existe e não é pequeno. É a ultima oportunidade de entrar em empresas com esse potencial... há uma demanda reprimida... o potencial de crescimento em cima da base que está lá é certamente muito maior (que em outras empresas)”, afirmou.

O Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (BNDES) divulgou nesta semana condições para a venda das distribuidoras, que incluirão a assunção pela Eletrobras de dívidas das empresas, que somam 20,8 bilhões de reais, contra um valor de 10,8 bilhões atribuído às concessionárias.

Segundo Ferreira, a Eletrobras irá provar que possui créditos e recebimentos que podem cobrir todo ou boa parte desse rombo.

A maior parte dos débitos é da distribuidora do Amazonas junto à Petrobras, e a Eletrobras negocia com a petroleira a troca de um grupo de termelétricas da empresa pelo abatimento das dívidas.

A elétrica pretende apresentar a seus acionistas em uma assembleia até o final do ano um plano para equacionar o rombo, incluindo a proposta de negociação das térmicas com a Petrobras.

“O que temos que fazer é que essas dívidas tenham correspondentes em créditos. É o que estamos trabalhando. Tem coisas líquidas e certas. Isso tem que ser submetido a uma assembleia para mostrar que essas dívidas têm créditos firmes... Os débitos com a Petrobras também deverão ser objeto nessa assembleia”, disse.",ENTREVISTA-Eletrobras vê forte apetite de investidores por privatização e ativos à venda,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1DA2QV-OBRTP

On Saturday Nov. 4, guests at Riyadh’s Ritz Carlton were notified by the opulent hotel that: “Due to unforeseen booking by local authorities which requires an elevated level of security, we are unable to accommodate guests ... until normal operations are restored.”

The purge was already under way. Within hours security forces had rounded up dozens of members of Saudi Arabia’s political and business elite, mostly in the capital and the coastal city of Jeddah. Among them were 11 princes as well as ministers and wealthy tycoons.

Some were invited to meetings where they were detained. Others were arrested at their homes and flown to Riyadh or driven to the Ritz Carlton, which has been turned into a temporary prison.

The detainees were allowed a single, brief phone call home, a person familiar with the arrests told Reuters.

“They don’t receive calls and are kept under tight security. No one can go in or out,” the insider said. “It is obvious that there was a lot of preparation for it.”

The purge was ordered by 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Officially next in line to the throne to his father, King Salman, he is now in effect running the country which he has said he will transform into a modern state.

To do that - and in an attempt to shore up his own power - he has decided to go after the Saudi elite, including some members of the royal family, on accusations such as taking bribes and inflating the cost of business projects. Those arrested could not be reached for comment.

At stake is political stability in the world’s largest oil producer. The Crown Prince’s ability to rule unchallenged depends on whether the purge is successful.

The Crown Prince believes that unless the country changes, the economy will sink into a crisis that could fan unrest. That could threaten the royal family and weaken the country in its regional rivalry with Iran.

THE “CORRUPTION STICK”

Prince Mohammed decided to move on his family, the person familiar with events said, when he realized more relatives opposed him becoming king than he had thought.

“The signal was that anyone wavering in their support should watch out,” said the person familiar with the events. “The whole idea of the anti-corruption campaign was targeted toward the family. The rest is window dressing.”

King Salman said the purge was in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money”. Insiders said the accusations were based on evidence gathered by the intelligence service.

Government backers have rejected suggestions that the campaign is really about eliminating political enemies. There was no immediate comment from the royal court on this story.

Among those now holed up at the Ritz Carlton hotel is Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who is head of the powerful National Guard and Prince Mohammed’s cousin.

Miteb was in his farm house in Riyadh when he was called to a meeting with the Crown Prince. Such an invitation, even at night, would not be unusual for a senior official and would not have aroused suspicion.

“He went to the meeting and never came back,” said a second insider who has connections to some of those who were detained.

Others held include Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who is chairman of international investment firm Kingdom Holding and a cousin of Prince Mohammed, and Prince Turki bin Abdullah, former governor of Riyadh province and a son of the late King Abdullah.

Some royal watchers said tensions were laid bare during family meetings over the summer. One insider said it was widely known to Prince Mohammed that some of the powerful royals, including Miteb, were resentful about his elevation.

Prince Mohammed, who is widely known in Saudi Arabia by his initials MbS, had said openly in interviews that he would investigate the kingdom’s endemic corruption and would not hesitate to go after top officials.

The vehicle was an anti-corruption committee created by King Salman, and announced on Nov. 4. The king put the Crown Prince in charge, adding another power to the many he has been given in the past three years.

Saudi authorities have questioned 208 people in the anti-corruption investigation and estimate at least $100 billion has been stolen through graft, the attorney-general said on Thursday. The head of the committee said investigators had been collecting evidence for three years.

By launching a war on corruption, the prince has combined a popular cause with the elimination of an obstacle to acceding to the throne.

“MbS used the corruption stick which can reach any one of them,” said Jamal Khashoggi, a former adviser to Prince Turki al-Faisal, intelligence chief from 1979 to 2001. “For the first time we Saudis see princes being tried for their corruption.”

But Khashoggi, who lives in the United States, said Prince Mohammed was being selective in his purge.

“I believe MbS is a nationalist who loves his country and wants it to be the strongest but his problem is that he wants to rule alone,” he said.

DE FACTO RULER

Prince Mohammed was appointed defense minister in 2015 when King Salman became monarch. In June, the King named him heir to the throne, pushing aside his older cousin Mohammed bin Nayef, a veteran head of the security apparatus. The royal family acquiesced and by September the Crown Prince had rounded up and jailed religious and intellectual opponents.

The latest detentions are intended to help him push through reforms that promise the greatest change since the reign of King Abdulaziz, founder of the current Saudi state in the 1930s.

That state has rested on an enduring accommodation between the royal family and the Wahhabist clerics who control the hardline version of Islam that originated in Saudi Arabia.

The ruling family promised to give Saudis comfortable lives and a share of the country’s oil wealth. In return, their subjects have offered political submission and promised to follow the country’s strict religious and social codes.

King Abdulaziz, who was also known as Ibn Saud, died in 1953. Since then, Saudi Arabia has been run by the king and below him there has been a group of princes, none of them strong enough to impose his will against the wishes of the others.

Decisions have mostly come through consensus. That arrangement has meant social and political change has been glacial although it has also kept the kingdom stable.

But in moves that position Prince Mohammed as the new Ibn Saud, the Crown Prince is tearing down pillars of rule that had been eroding under the weight of population growth and low oil prices.

Consensus has been replaced by what critics say is one-man rule, opposed by some princes although they would not risk saying so in public.

In the past few decades, every Saudi king had one or two of his brothers, sons or nephews by his side advising and sharing in governance. But Prince Mohammed has not appointed any of his brothers or other close family to top positions, instead relying on a team of advisers -- mainly Saudis though some are U.S.- or British-trained.

King Salman, 82, still has the last word on everything. But he has delegated the running of the kingdom’s military, security, economic, foreign and social affairs to Prince Mohammed. There has been speculation for months, denied by court officials, that the king will soon abdicate the throne to MbS.

Even the Crown Prince’s age is remarkable. The last three kings have reached the throne aged 61, 80 and 79. Prince Mohammed is effectively in charge at 32.

NO GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS

Prince Mohammed says he offers a new social contract: A state that functions better than the rigid bureaucracy of the past, opportunities to have fun and an economy that will create jobs that can last, whatever happens in oil markets.

In September he announced that Saudi women will be given the right to drive. Just three weeks ago, during a conference for investors at the same Ritz Carlton that now houses the targets of his purge, he unveiled a plan for a $500-billion futuristic city where sexes could mingle and robots outnumber humans.

The prince has also drawn up a blueprint to wean Saudi Arabia off its dependence on oil and its subjects off state subsidies and government jobs. The public listing of national oil company Saudi Aramco, planned next year, is its centerpiece.

There are no guarantees the prince’s ambitions will succeed.

Even some admirers ask whether his reach exceeds his grasp. His top-down approach, brooking no opposition, could scare off investors wanting assurances about rule of law and security. Without huge investor support, he will struggle to meet the aspirations of Saudi youth.

War in Yemen, a dispute with the Gulf emirate of Qatar and growing tension with Iran is a concern to investors too.

It should help that Prince Mohammed, following the example of Ibn Saud, sees the importance of forging a special bond with the United States.

During a visit to Saudi Arabia in May, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Riyadh to lead an alliance against Iran and its attempt to cut a Shi‘ite axis through Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.

Soon afterwards, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates blockaded Qatar, accusing its ruling Al Thani dynasty of supporting Iran and Islamist terrorism. Trump gave his backing. After the arrests of the past week, Trump tweeted support, saying those arrested had been “milking their country for years”.

One insider close to the royal family said the National Guard was unlikely to react strongly to Miteb’s removal. He said there had been no resistance to the ousting of Mohammed bin Nayef at the interior ministry and the National Guard would be no different.",A house divided: How Saudi Crown Prince purged royal family rivals,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1DA23M-OCATP

The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation across the Group of 20 Economies (G20),

is expected to announce in coming weeks a switch in focus from insurers’ size to their activities when deciding whether to subject them to increased regulatory scrutiny, said the source, who requested anonymity because the matter has not been made public.

Companies singled out for such scrutiny are required to hold extra capital to cover potential losses, increasing overall business costs and potentially reducing shareholder returns.

The insurance industry has been lobbying for years for regulators to move to the activities-based approach, arguing that their huge size should not automatically qualify them as systemically risky and on the hook for onerous bank-like capital rules.

The shift in the FSB’s approach to designating globally systemically important insurers, or GSIIs, follows pressure from the U.S. Treasury Department, which has been pushing the FSB to ease up on insurers and asset managers, the source said.

A spokesman for the FSB declined to comment.

The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged to overhaul regulations introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and put U.S. interests first when engaging in international bodies such as the FSB and the Basel Committee of banking supervisors.

In September, a group of U.S. regulators - known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council - removed AIG from its domestic list of systemically important insurers, raising questions over whether the FSB would keep AIG on its global list and continue to add new firms.

In a policy report published last month, the U.S. Treasury rejected the idea of singling out specific asset management and insurance firms as systemically risky and criticized the FSB for mission-creep and a lack of transparency.

The U.S. Treasury is shortly due to release a policy report on the FSOC designation process and powers, which critics including regulatory experts and insurers have said are too opaque and unaccountable.

AIG BAILOUT

AIG helped spark the global financial crisis, and the labeling of major financial institutions as systemically important stems largely from its $182 billion U.S. government-led rescue in September 2008. The bailout came just before the company would have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection amid mounting losses on its derivatives book.

Worried the insurance giant was “too big to fail,” the government stepped in to prevent further chaos to the financial system. The company ultimately repaid taxpayers in full by the end of 2012, with a profit of $22.7 billion, according to AIG.

Since then, regulators have primarily focused on the size of a company’s overall assets when assessing the risk they pose to the global financial system.

Moving to an activities-based approach could see firms on the list that largely engage in traditional insurance activities removed, but other non-designated insurers that use their cash to invest in risky assets, or which deploy high levels of leverage, added.

The suspension of the 2017 review means the 2016 list of nine GSIIs - which also includes MetLife Inc (MET.N), Allianz SE (ALVG.DE) and Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (601318.SS) - will continue to stand for at least the next 12 months until the FSB has completed an assessment based on the new methodology, the source said.",Exclusive: Global regulators to ditch 'too big to fail' gauge for insurers - source,https://www.reuters.com/article/global-financial-insurers-exclusive/exclusive-global-regulators-to-ditch-too-big-to-fail-gauge-for-insurers-source-idINKBN1DA2YI?il=0

In a specially equipped pen, sheep were shown pictures of people on two computer screens, on one side would be an unknown person and on the other would be one of four celebrities.

The animal would receive a reward of food for choosing the photograph of the celebrity by breaking an infrared beam near the screen displaying it. If they chose the wrong photograph, a buzzer would sound and they would receive no reward.

The sheep eventually managed to identify the familiar face eight times out of every 10.

The group of celebrities the sheep were trained to recognize included actors Emma Watson and Jake Gyllenhaal, BBC newsreader Fiona Bruce and Obama.

“We’ve shown that sheep have advanced face-recognition abilities, comparable with those of humans and monkeys,” Professor Jenny Morton, who led the study, said in a statement.

In addition to being shown images of the celebrities facing forward, scientists also tested the animals’ ability to recognize the faces in photographs taken from other angles.

The animals’ success rate fell by around 15 percent when presented with the faces at a new angle, an amount researchers said was comparable to that seen when humans perform the task.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

According to one of the sources, the 86-year-old executive chairman of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) offered to buy CNN in both conversations.

Another source said Murdoch had “zero interest” in owning CNN.

Representatives of Twenty-First Century Fox, AT&T and Time Warner, CNN’s parent, declined comment.

CNN has become a sticking point in antitrust approval of AT&T’s $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), hatched in October 2016.

Justice Department staff have recommended that AT&T sell either its DirecTV unit or Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting unit - which includes CNN - a government official told Reuters on Thursday, in order to gain antitrust approval.

On Thursday Stephenson said he had no interest in selling CNN and that he was ready to defend the deal in court if necessary.

According to one of the sources on Friday, Murdoch called Stephenson twice, unprompted, on May 16 and Aug. 8 and on both occasions asked if CNN was for sale. Stephenson replied both times that it was not, according to the source.

‘NO SENSE’

It would not be the first time Murdoch has attempted to take control of CNN.

His Twenty-First Century Fox made an $80 billion offer for Time Warner in 2014 but abandoned the plan in the face of Time Warner’s resistance. At that time, Fox had planned to divest CNN - which competes with Fox News - in order to avoid antitrust issues.

There is no law against a company owning two cable networks, but there is a Federal Communications Commission prohibition on owning two broadcast networks. A Fox deal with CNN could also raise antitrust concerns because of the market share that a combined company would have among cable news viewers.

“I have been called and asked if I would sell CNN by numerous people,” Stephenson told the New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday. But he added: “Selling CNN makes no sense.”

Fox has held talks in the last few weeks to sell most of its film and television assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), CNBC reported this week, which would leave the company with its Fox News, sports programming and broadcasting stations..

Twenty-First Century Fox would sell its stake in European satellite broadcaster Sky Plc (SKYB.L) in a deal with Disney, according to CNBC’s report. Fox is trying to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own but the bid is strongly opposed by some lawmakers and has been subject to lengthy regulatory scrutiny.

Amazon Protect, which provides extensions to manufacturers’ warranties for items like mobile phones or washing machines bought on Amazon’s website, launched last year in Europe.

It is Amazon’s only insurance business globally.

Recent job advertisements for the EU product insurance division described “launching a new business” and “creating a new palette of services”.

“This is a sure sign disruption is on the way for the UK insurance market,” said Patricia Davies, financial services analyst at data and analytics firm GlobalData.

An Amazon UK spokesman declined to comment.

Specialist insurers are concerned that Amazon and other online players will encroach on their territory, and are looking to partner with them.

Investment in insurtech firms in Europe has risen sharply in the first half of 2017, often with the backing of big insurers. [nL5N1LW28W]

Amazon Protect launched in Britain in April 2016, quickly expanding to the firm’s main European markets of France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

Its policies give customers an extension on manufacturers’ two-year warranties for up to five years, insuring against accidental damage, breakdown and theft.

The Warranty Group, which underwrites Amazon Protect policies, did not respond to a request for comment.

Amazon posted the jobs on LinkedIn and “Where Women Work” in recent weeks.

“Along with internal and external partners, we are re-defining the warranties and product insurance experience, disrupting the way traditional product insurance services are acquired and delivered and creating a new palette of services,” one job ad, which is no longer accepting applications, said.

Another asked: “Would you like to take part in launching a new business?”

Insurers have been looking at ways of tapping into the so-called connected home, for instance by offering home insurance cover which will alert you if your pipes have sprung a leak.

Amazon’s launch of voice-activated home personal assistant Alexa could give an opportunity for it to expand into this area of home insurance, Davies said.

Bitcoin has been on a tear in recent months, with a vertiginous sevenfold increase in value since the start of the year that has led to many warnings the bitcoin market - now worth well over $100 billion - has become a bubble that is about to burst.

It reached a record high of $7,888 around 1800 GMT on Wednesday after a software upgrade planned for next week that could have split the cryptocurrency in a so-called “fork” was suspended.

But it has quickly retreated from that peak, falling to as low as $6,718 around 1330 GMT on Friday. It later recovered a touch to trade around $6,880 by 1645 GMT, but that was still down almost 4 percent on the day.

“Bitcoin is all ups and downs,” said Thomas Bertani, chief executive of Eidoo, a cryptocurrency wallet provider that recently became the first startup in the space to take out a full-page advert in the Wall Street Journal newspaper.

“The market realized that the price rise was an over-reaching, so people started selling... (and) there are many long and short positions that amplify price movements.”

As bitcoin tumbled, Bitcoin Cash, which was generated from another software split on Aug.1, surged, trading up as much as 35 percent on the day to around $850, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.

Bitcoin Cash’s transactions are processed in so-called “blocks” that are larger in capacity than bitcoin‘s, so can therefore in theory allow for more transactions to be processed at any given time, making transaction fees much cheaper.

The fork that had been planned for next week, known as “SegWit2x”, had also intended to increase the capacity of the blocks, and could thus have reduced fees for bitcoin transactions.

Any investors, therefore, that see bitcoin more as a currency than a store of value might be choosing to buy into Bitcoin Cash now that Segwit2x had been scrapped, Bertani said.

During 2016 and 2017, the U.N. monitors said a military campaign by government troops in the northwestern town of Wau and surrounding areas in Western Bahr el-Ghazal targeted civilians on ethnic grounds and displaced more than 100,000.

“The government has during much of 2017 deliberately prevented life-saving food assistance from reaching some citizens,” the monitors wrote. “These actions amount to using food as a weapon of war with the intent to inflict suffering on civilians the government views as opponents to its agenda.”

“The denial of aid had caused extreme food insecurity among large sections of the population, with malnutrition and death by starvation the documented outcome, in particular in the Greater Baggari area in Wau County,” they said in the report submitted to the U.N. Security Council’s South Sudan sanctions committee.

South Sudan’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. report.

South Sudan spiraled into civil war in late 2013, two years after gaining independence from Sudan, and a third of the 12 million population has fled their homes. The conflict was sparked by a feud between Kiir, a Dinka, and his former deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer, who is being held in South Africa.

The United Nations has warned that the violence in South Sudan was providing “fertile ground” for a genocide.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley visited the Juba late last month, where she told Kiir that the United States had lost trust in his government and risked losing Washington’s support if he did not pursue peace.

‘CATASTROPHIC’

The U.N. monitors reported that the government had regularly denied humanitarian aid access to certain parts of the population, in particular areas outside the town of Wau, which was visited by U.N. Security Council ambassadors in September last year.

“One of those areas, Greater Baggari, is noteworthy for the persistent and systematic nature of the government’s access denials, and the catastrophic humanitarian conditions that have resulted,” the independent U.N. monitors said.

In August, the government eased restrictions, allowing aid groups to distribute food and lifesaving assistance to more than 12,000 people in Greater Baggari. Villages had been looted and burned and crops destroyed, the U.N. monitors wrote.

One humanitarian assessment mission told the U.N. monitors that 164 young children and elderly had died from hunger and disease between January and September 2017.

The report by the U.N. monitors found that despite the catastrophic conditions across South Sudan, armed forces, groups and militias - particularly those affiliated with Kiir and Vice President Taban Deng Gai - continued to “actively impede both humanitarian and peacekeeping operations.”

U.N. peacekeepers have been deployed in South Sudan since 2011.

An East African bloc, IGAD, led two rounds of peace talks over two years, culminating in a brief power-sharing agreement signed by Kiir and Machar in 2015. But even as IGAD urges a new ceasefire, the warring parties are preparing for more fighting.

“The coming dry season in South Sudan will, absent a change in the current conflict dynamics, see further fighting and civilian suffering as the government continues to pursue military victory over political compromise,” the U.N. monitors wrote.",Exclusive: South Sudan's government using food as weapon of war - U.N. report,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1DA2QJ

The ruling Pakistani Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) unexpectedly set off a firestorm last month after voting through the alteration of the oath, among seemingly small changes to the nation’s electoral law.

The changes prompted accusations of blasphemy from religious parties and the government retreated, apologizing in parliament for what it called a “clerical” mistake.

But the apology did not satisfy Tehreek-e-Labaik, triggering the sit-in, as the culmination of a march of nearly 400 km (249 miles) from the eastern city of Lahore.

The party rose to prominence in September, after placing third in a by-election in Lahore, edging out a major opposition party to pick up 6 percent of the vote.

Last month, it gained nearly 8 percent in a by-election in the northwestern city of Peshawar.

While Tehrik-e-Labaik is unlikely to break out of single digits in coming votes, its rapid rise could present a challenge for the PML-N.

On a bridge overlooking the highway demonstration site, drivers of trucks halted by blockades erected by city authorities complained about cargo delivery delays.

Disappointed investors who lopped almost 1 billion pounds off Burberry’s market value on Thursday will now be unforgiving. Only flawless results and the right new designer will prevent a further slide in the share price.

British luxury goods maker Burberry says its Hong Kong comparable store sales fell by a double-digit percentage in the quarter ending June 30, becoming the latest brand to show business is hurting.

Gobbetti, the former boss of LVMH-owned brand Celine, outlined some of the costs of polishing Burberry’s image. Capital expenditure will grow to 150 million to 160 million pounds annually, up about 50 percent from last year. As a result, Burberry’s operating margin, which is already a quarter or more below the level of its peers, will stagnate. That’s a huge disappointment for investors. The company’s shares were as recently as Wednesday valued almost as richly as Gucci-parent Kering, which is trading at 23 times expected earnings for the coming year. That record high valuation for Burberry was 25 percent above the average of the past five years.

The new CEO could have opted for a more crowd-pleasing sales recovery by competing with cheaper U.S. labels Coach and Michael Kors. A volume-led rebound in revenue would have quickly secured margins of 20 percent or more and boosted Burberry’s share price by 80 percent over three years, according to Bernstein estimates. Going upmarket is the tougher and riskier proposition. Even in the best-case scenario, Burberry’s share price will increase by just 13 percent, Bernstein reckons.

But it’s probably the right choice. If Gobbetti can pull it off, Burberry’s profitability should finally catch up with peers Kering and LVMH. And while he is testing investors’ patience, Gucci’s turnaround suggests his timeline is realistic. Kering’s marquee brand took about 20 months to show convincing results after hiring a new CEO in late 2014.

Kganyago said in a speech at an investor conference in New York that weak business confidence had shaved an estimated one percentage point off South Africa’s economic growth last year.

He said that the central bank would like to see inflation expectations anchored at around 4.5 percent, compared with 5.1 percent now. The volatile rand currency is the biggest risk to inflation forecasts, Kganyago said.

“Inflation today in South Africa is within the target. The highest it should be in terms of our forecast is 5.2 percent,” he said in a subsequent interview with Reuters.

“That gives us room within the inflation target band...Inflation could rise but would remain within our inflation target,” Kganyago said.

The Governor of the South African Reserve Bank deflected questions on where he thought interest rates would move, saying there is no target.

The central bank kept its benchmark repo rate at 6.75 percent on Sept. 21, defying expectations at the time of a cut based upon easing inflation pressures and a sluggish recovery from a recession in the first half of the year.

“Everybody talks about are you close to neutral or off neutral? When the world over, nobody knows what neutral is because the world as we know it is different from the world we knew before the global financial crisis. Everybody is trying to find neutral,” he said.

The central banker, in his position since 2014, said that inflation would remain in the 3 to 6 percent target zone for the next two years.

“We are currently at 4.8 percent and the outlook is that inflation will average 5 percent this year. But we still expect to reach the bottom of 4.6 percent in the first quarter of next year. Over the policy horizon of 2018 and 2019, the highest inflation will be is 5.2 percent for the year,” he said.

With inflation remaining subdued, Kganyago also highlighted the improvements in the narrowing current account deficit. He said indications are that for the third quarter it should remain, at worst in the 2 percent area.

France became the first Western country to indicate that Saudi Arabia was holding Hariri against his will, saying it wished for him to have “all his freedom of movement and be fully able to play the essential role that is his in Lebanon”.

Hariri’s resignation has plunged Lebanon into crisis, thrusting the small Arab country back to the forefront of regional rivalry between the Sunni Muslim monarchy Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite revolutionary Iran.

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, said Saudi Arabia’s detention of Hariri, a long-time Saudi ally who declared his resignation while in Riyadh last Saturday, was an insult to all Lebanese and he must return to Lebanon.

“Let us say things as they are: the man is detained in Saudi Arabia and forbidden until this moment from returning to Lebanon,” Nasrallah said in a televised speech.

“It is clear that Saudi Arabia and Saudi officials have declared war on Lebanon and on Hezbollah in Lebanon,” he said.

His comments mirror an accusation by Riyadh on Monday that Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war on the conservative Gulf Arab kingdom.

Riyadh says Hariri is a free man and he decided to resign because Hezbollah was calling the shots in his government. Saudi Arabia considers Hezbollah to be its enemy in conflicts across the Middle East, including Syria and Yemen.

Western countries have looked on with alarm at the rising regional tension.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned other countries and groups against using Lebanon as vehicle for a larger proxy fight in the Middle East, saying Washington strongly backed Lebanon’s independence and respected Hariri as a strong partner of the United States, still referring to him as prime minister.

“There is no legitimate place or role in Lebanon for any foreign forces, militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the Lebanese state,” Tillerson said in a statement released by the U.S. State Department.

Tillerson told reporters on Friday there was no indication that Hariri was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will but that the United States was monitoring the situation.

The French foreign minister said earlier on Friday that he also believed Hariri was a free man - a statement at odds with the later French foreign ministry comment that it wanted Hariri to have “all his freedom of movement”.

Hariri has made no public remarks since announcing his resignation in a speech televised from Saudi Arabia, saying he feared assassination and accusing Iran and Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world.

Two top Lebanese government officials, a senior politician close to Hariri and a fourth source told Reuters on Thursday that the Lebanese authorities believe Hariri is being held in Saudi Arabia.

Nasrallah said Saudi Arabia was encouraging Israel to attack Lebanon. While an Israeli attack could not be ruled out entirely, he said, it was unlikely partly because Israel knew it would pay a very high price. “I warn them against any miscalculation or any step to exploit the situation,” he said.

“Saudi will fail in Lebanon as it has failed on all fronts,” Nasrallah said.

Riyadh has advised Saudi citizens not to travel to Lebanon, or if already there to leave as soon as possible. Other Gulf states have also issued travel warnings. Those steps have raised concern that Riyadh could take measures against the tiny Arab state, which hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees.

Hariri’s resignation is being widely seen as part of a Saudi attempt to counter Iran as its influence deepens in Syria and Iraq and as Riyadh and its allies battle Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Hariri’s resignation unraveled a political deal among rival factions that made him prime minister and President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, head of state last year.

The coalition government included Hezbollah, a heavily armed military and political organization.

STUCK BETWEEN “ANTAGONISTIC INTERESTS”

Aoun told Saudi Arabia’s envoy on Friday that Hariri must return to Lebanon and the circumstances surrounding his resignation as prime minister while in Saudi Arabia were unacceptable, presidential sources said.

An “international support group” of countries concerned about Lebanon, which includes the United States, Russia and France, appealed for Lebanon “to continue to be shielded from tensions in the region”. In a statement, they also welcomed Aoun’s call for Hariri to return.

In comments to Reuters, top Lebanese Druze politician Jumblatt said Lebanon did not deserve to be accused of declaring war on Saudi Arabia. “For decades we’ve been friends,” he said.

“We are a country that is squeezed between two antagonistic interests, between Saudi Arabia and Iran,” he said. “The majority of Lebanese are just paying the price ... Lebanon can not afford to declare a war against anybody.”

The Saudi foreign minister accused Hezbollah of a role in the launching of a ballistic missile at Riyadh from Yemen on Saturday. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen was an act of “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

Hamilton, Ontario-based Stelco, owned by U.S. private equity group Bedrock Industries, will use part of its C$230 million ($181 million) IPO proceeds on projects that boost capacity at its two steel-processing facilities in southern Ontario.

The listing also allows quick access to capital markets if a suitable M&A deal emerges among “numerous” potential targets, Kestenbaum said.

Stelco, which emerged in June from its second bankruptcy protection in 13 years, produces flat-rolled, value-added steels for the construction, automotive and energy industries.

“Many companies and owners today have broken balance sheets, are forced asset sellers and have operational issues. We talk to everybody,” Kestenbaum said in an interview with Reuters.

“We could look at buying another steel mill, we also could look at buying other finishing operations, or things like that, that help us penetrate markets.”

Declining to identify targets or timing, Kestenbaum said “attractively priced” North American assets, with synergy benefits, are ideal.

Stelco shares began trading last week on a “when-issued” basis and quickly jumped above the C$17 pricing to C$19. On Friday, the stock was unchanged at C$19.45.

Stelco emerged from nearly three years of bankruptcy protection with C$3 billion in debt and C$1.4 billion in pension and retirement obligations extinguished.

That coincides with mostly weak North American auto sales this year, after a record 2016, though global steel prices SRBcv1 have gained 157 percent since end-2015 as China, the world’s top steel producer and consumer, shut capacity in an environmental crackdown.

Stelco, under bankruptcy protection between 2004 and 2006, was acquired in 2007 by U.S. Steel Corp.

Kestenbaum said Stelco will now operate under a “tactical flexibility” strategy, adjusting the products and industries it pursues based on margins.

While its shipments to automakers fell to 3 percent last year, from 37 percent in 2006, Stelco plans to boost production of lightweight, higher-strength steels increasingly sought by the industry.

Auto industry gains are not critical to Stelco’s growth, but offer an opportunity to boost margins, Kestenbaum said.

Founder Bikram Choudhury, who built a worldwide following with classes of 26 yoga postures in rooms heated to 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40.6°C), has been accused of sexual assault by his yoga practitioners, students, instructors and teacher trainees.

The Simi Valley, California-based company said in a bankruptcy court filing on Thursday in the Central District of California that its liabilities were worth up to $50 million. It listed assets of up to $1 million, suggesting that its largest creditors - women who are owed money for court judgments awarded against Choudhury - will not be paid in full.

They include Miki Jaffa Bodden, former head of legal and international affairs at Choudhury’s yoga school who has an $8 million claim stemming from a wrongful dismissal case that included sexual harassment claims.

Bodden alleged that Choudhury repeatedly subjected her to vulgar sexual gestures and offensive comments about women and minority groups.

“Birkram Choudhury created a hyper-sexualized, offensive and degrading environment for women by, among other things, demanding that female staffers brush his hair and give him massages,” Bodden said in her 2013 lawsuit.

She also accused him of pressuring her to cover up sexual harassment of women, and in a separate lawsuit filed this year, of fraudulently transferring assets such as luxury cars including a Ferrari and a Bentley to avoid paying judgments against him.

A warrant for Choudhury’s arrest was issued in May.

Petra Starke, who moved from her job as lawyer in the Obama White House to chief executive of the Bikram Yoga College of India in 2013, complained of wrongful dismissal, sexually inappropriate conduct and “racist tirades.” She has a $5.1 million claim.

Sharon Clerkin, who sued claiming she was fired for becoming pregnant, is owed $3.6 million.

Human Rights Committee on Thursday gave Democratic Republic of Congo a year to report on actions it has taken to hold free and fair elections and clean up its rights record.

The United Nations watchdog, whose 18 independent experts monitor countries’ compliance with a global human rights treaty, said Congo should come back with an explanation by Nov. 10, 2018, rather than after the regular four years between reviews.

Congo should “cooperate with all stakeholders to establish an agreed electoral calendar for the holding of free, peaceful and honest elections as soon as possible”, the committee said in its report on the central African country.

Congo’s electoral commission said on Sunday the election to replace President Joseph Kabila, originally scheduled for late 2016 and repeatedly delayed, would be held on Dec. 23, 2018.

The main opposition parties have rejected the date, saying it broke the law and an agreement to go to the polls this year.

The African Union has said the new electoral timetable must be “scrupulously respected” and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has said citizens are “hungry for democracy and new leadership”.

“Further delays and attempts to hold onto power will only serve to isolate the DRC’s leaders and government,” she said on Monday.

The U.N. committee’s report also said Kabila’s government should put an end to intimidation and human rights violations against opposition candidates, and ensure they were protected.

The government should take steps to make judges, officials and the public aware of the rights guaranteed by the U.N. treaty, it said, listing shortcomings such as the treatment of women and indigenous minorities, torture, extrajudicial killings, child labor and arbitrary detention.

Sexual violence was persistent both in peaceful areas and in conflict zones, where it was used as a weapon of war by armed groups and by Congolese soldiers alike, the committee said.

It was particularly concerned about the situation in the Kasai region, where the United Nations has said a rebel militia largely composed of children has been confronted by a militia suspected of a campaign of ethnic massacres and rapes.

The United Nations has set up a fact-finding mission to investigate the Kasai atrocities, although the government has insisted Congo’s justice system is in charge.

It has acknowledged isolated human rights violations in the Kasai conflict and other conflict zones but denies its troops systematically use disproportionate force.

But the U.N. committee said Congo’s National Human Rights Commission was unable to operate outside Kinshasa, had received no funds since March 2017, and was not regarded as independent.","U.N. watchdog tells Congo to hold election, clean up human rights",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D91WK-OZATP

Uber immediately said it would appeal to higher courts against Friday’s decision by the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in central London.

Uber immediately said it would appeal to higher courts against Friday’s decision by the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in central London.

The U.S. ride-hailing service has faced regulatory and legal setbacks around the world amid opposition from traditional taxi services and concern among some regulators. It has been forced to quit several countries, such as Denmark and Hungary.

Last year, two drivers successfully argued at a British employment tribunal that Uber exerted significant control over them to provide an on-demand taxi service and should grant them workers’ rights such as holiday entitlement and rest breaks.

That decision did not automatically apply to the app’s 50,000 drivers in Britain but was seen as likely to prompt more claims.

It could benefit workers at thousands of companies including firms in the “gig economy”, where individuals work for multiple employers without a fixed contract, such as courier Deliveroo.

The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which backed the two drivers, said these companies were “choosing to deprive workers of their rights”.

“Today’s victory is further proof, as if any more was needed, that the law is clear and these companies are simply choosing to deprive workers of their rights,” said Jason Moyer-Lee, the IWGB’s general secretary.

Uber says its drivers enjoy the flexibility of their work and are self-employed, entitling them in British law to only basic entitlements such as health and safety.

The firm argued in September that its drivers operate in the same way as minicabs, or private hire vehicles, which sprung up in Britain more than 50 years ago.

On Friday it confirmed it would appeal against the latest decision. A spokesman said the company had 14 days to submit its application and decide whether to apply to take the case to the Supreme Court, Britain’s top judicial body.

“Over the last year we have made a number of changes to our app to give drivers even more control,” said Uber UK’s Acting General Manager Tom Elvidge in a statement. “The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive.”

Yaseen Aslam, one of the drivers involved in the case, said they would continue their fight to ensure workers’ rights were respected.

“I am glad that the judge today confirmed what I and thousands of drivers have known all along: that Uber is not only exploiting drivers, but also acting unlawfully,” he said.

Uber, which is valued at around $70 billion with backers including Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, will be back in court on Dec. 11 to appeal a decision by London’s transport regulator to strip the app of its license.

Handout photo from the movie 'Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana'

Ratnaa Sinha’s film starts off well enough, with an arranged marriage proposal between Satyendar (Rajkummar Rao) and Aarti (Kriti Kharbanda). He is about to start a job as a clerk, an enviable position in small town India where a government jobs holds the promise of security, respect and the potential to earn beyond your means through graft.

To Aarti, a college topper who is being forced into marriage, Satyendar is an escape from her restrictive, domineering father. He loves her, gives her equal footing in the partnership and is even willing to let her work after marriage. Sinha gets the milieu, the regressive attitude towards women and their role as second-class citizens spot on.

But on the day of the marriage, it all comes undone. The groom’s mother declares that she will not let Aarti work, which also happens to be the same day that the latter discovers she might be on the cusp of a great career. Pushed by her elder sister (Nayani Dixit), she runs away from her wedding and leaves Satyendar a broken, bitter man.

Up until here, the film appears to be on its course, if a little rough around the edges. But post interval, we are subjected to a convoluted revenge saga that does no service to the story or characters.

Handout photo from the movie 'Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana'

Five years later, Satyendar has transformed from a lowly clerk to a top government official who takes it upon himself to investigate graft allegations against his former fiancé. Aarti, reeling under the double shock of seeing the man she was to marry and the danger of losing her coveted government job, crumbles into a weeping mess.

Satyendar acts sadomasochistic, while Aarti oscillates from simpering at him to accusing him of ruining her life. Sinhaa chooses to punctuate all this with deafening background music and pithy songs about heartbreak. It all seems too ludicrous.

Rajkummar Rao tries his best to salvage the situation, humanising Satyendar for the most part; but even he cannot pull off the truly farcical parts of this film.

Kharbanda falls short, but Govind Namdeo, Nayani Dixit and Manoj Pahwa put in strong supporting performances.

Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, which bled support to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the Sept. 24 election, are trying to forge a coalition government with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the environmentalist Greens.

The chiefs of the parties huddled on Friday evening to review progress in the talks thus far, but planned no statements.

They had initially hoped to agree on the outlines of a coalition deal by Friday after the two smaller parties dropped demands this week on tax and climate policy, but later decided to meet again on Sunday before a final push by full delegations for an outline deal next week.

Still, the overall tone was more upbeat than at the end of the previous week.

“We’re heading into the home stretch,” Horst Seehofer, head of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), told reporters.

Seehofer and FDP leader Christian Lindner said they were optimistic that the exploratory talks could be wrapped up next week, paving the way for weeks of detailed negotiations about the exact terms of a coalition contract.

But Michael Kellner, a top negotiator for the Greens, demanded more compromises from the other parties.

GIVING GROUND

The FDP this week gave ground by agreeing to accept more modest income tax cuts than a campaign pledge of 30-40 billion euros ($35-46 billion) of relief.

In an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel on Friday, Lindner also signaled a readiness to compromise on the euro zone’s European Stability Mechanism, moving away from a campaign pledge to shut down the rescue fund.

The Greens for their part dropped their insistence on fixed dates for shutting down coal-fired power stations and banning cars with internal combustion engines.

But the parties remain divided on whether or not to push for a euro zone budget, on Europe’s banking union and on the use of drones in military conflicts, as well as German participation in foreign military missions, according to draft papers seen by Reuters.

They must also agree how to meet key targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, how to deal with the pollution caused by diesel cars already on the road, and whether to introduce a law that would ease tax rates for venture capital projects.

If the parties fail to reach agreement, Germany could be forced into a new election that could unsettle investors at a time when many in the European Union are looking to Europe’s biggest economic power for leadership on issues ranging from euro zone governance to transatlantic relations.

Merkel, seeking a fourth term as chancellor, hopes to reach agreement in the exploratory talks by Nov. 16.

She plans to take the broad outlines of what is agreed to key conservative party leaders in five meetings the following weekend, the CDU said.",German parties see momentum in coalition talks despite lingering divisions,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1DA2Q3

O Ibovespa fechou em queda de 1,05 por cento, a 72.165 pontos, acumulando perda de 2,37 por cento na semana, a segunda consecutiva com perdas acumuladas acima da marca de 2 por cento. O giro financeiro era de 8,99 bilhões de reais.

Embora a possibilidade de votar um texto da reforma da Previdência ainda este ano tenha voltado à tona, ainda há receios sobre a habilidade do governo em articular a maioria necessária para aprovar a medida e sobre o teor da versão que conseguiria passar no Congresso.

“O comportamento de hoje é o de inércia do sentimento que predominou ao longo da semana, que foi muito pautada pela reforma da Previdência e pelo mercado internacional”, disse o sócio analista da Eleven Financial Raphael Figueredo.

Segundo o analista, o Ibovespa pode ver novas perdas no curto prazo, diante da ausência de noticiário mais favorável, podendo chegar mais perto dos 70 mil pontos antes de reiniciar o processo de recuperação.

Ajudou o tom de cautela com a cena política no pregão a retirada do comando interino do PSDB do senador Tasso Jereissati (CE) pelo presidente licenciado do partido, senador Aécio Neves (MG). Parte dos tucanos, entre eles Tasso, é favorável ao desembarque do partido do governo federal, enquanto outra parcela, incluindo Aécio, defende a permanência.

No exterior, o tom de cautela veio com o andamento da reforma tributária nos Estados Unidos. Na véspera, os republicanos do Senado apresentaram um plano tributário diferente da versão dos deputados em vários tópicos importantes, incluindo a maneira como tratam a tributação corporativa e dedução para impostos estaduais e locais.

DESTAQUES

- BRF ON caiu 4,6 por cento, anulando os ganhos iniciais, quando chegou a subir 1,74 por cento na máxima, tendo como pano de fundo o resultado do terceiro trimestre que mostrou lucro abaixo do esperado. A empresa de alimentos reportou lucro líquido de 138 milhões de reais no terceiro trimestre, abaixo da estimativa de analistas.

- CEMIG PN teve queda de 3,43 por cento. Como pano de fundo esteve o anúncio da empresa de programa para quitação de débitos de ICMS, que impactará negativamente o Ebitda e o lucro do terceiro trimestre em aproximadamente 588 milhões e 388 milhões de reais, respectivamente.

- KROTON ON perdeu 2,94 por cento, após reportar resultado para o terceiro trimestre com lucro líquido de 450,8 milhões de reais no terceiro trimestre, alta de 22,4 por cento em relação ao mesmo período do ano passado. Segundo analistas do Morgan Stanley, os resultados não foram empolgantes, com margens “apenas estáveis”, pressionadas por uma comparação mais difícil na base anual.

- ELETROBRAS ON caiu 2,15 por cento e ELETROBRAS PNB recuou 3,4 por cento, ampliando as perdas da véspera após o BNDES divulgar as regras básicas para o leilão de privatização de seis distribuidoras de eletricidade da estatal, prevendo ajustes financeiros para acomodar uma dívida de quase 21 bilhões de reais.

- CYRELA ON subiu 1 por cento, após avançar 2,84 por cento na máxima do dia e cair 1,25 por cento na mínima. A empresa divulgou na noite da véspera resultado do terceiro trimestre com prejuízo de 6,8 milhões de reais. Segundo analistas do Itaú BBA, o resultado da última linha do balanço veio em linha com o esperado, sendo que o destaque positivo ficou por conta da geração de fluxo de caixa.

- PETROBRAS PN fechou estável e PETROBRAS ON subiu 0,17 por cento, em sessão de perdas para os preços do petróleo no mercado internacional.

- MAGAZINE LUIZA ON, que não faz parte do Ibovespa, caiu 5,14 por cento, ampliando as fortes perdas da véspera. O movimento deste pregão veio apesar do início de cobertura do JP Morgan, com recomendação “overweight” e preço-alvo de 72 reais ao final de 2018. Segundo os analistas do banco, a varejista traz uma boa combinação de execução e cultura corporativa para reinventar o negócio e passar por processos de transformação de lojas físicas para um canal mais amplo e plataforma digital.

The layoffs at GE Digital, based in San Ramon, California, affect about 100 sales people in the Americas, including those who sell GE’s Predix industrial-internet software, according to two sources.

The software, central to GE’s strategy under former Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, has been beset with technical problems, prompting GE to shift strategy.

The 125-year-old conglomerate is considering job reductions across all of its diverse businesses, the sources said. Struggling units such as GE Power are facing significant staff cuts, while aviation and healthcare businesses could see lesser reductions, the sources said.

Reuters reported in August that Flannery intended to reduce corporate staff at its Boston headquarters significantly, a process that has begun, according to sources. The company has also slowed construction of its headquarters.

It is not clear how many more jobs Flannery now plans to cut, or how quickly. With 295,000 employees, even a 10 percent overall reduction would eliminate nearly 30,000 jobs.

At the digital business, which has about 13,000 people including legacy information technology staff, GE is not only cutting sales staff. It is also reducing the number of developers who create the software, according to the two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Digital sales staff were given notice in recent days and told they could apply for about 19 remaining jobs in the division or other jobs at GE, the sources said.

GE declined to comment on specific staff reductions, but highlighted its plan to cut $3 billion in costs by the end of 2018. “Those actions include but are not limited to, employee reductions which have been well underway for many months,” spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said.

GE shares closed up 2.5 percent at $20.49.

DIVIDEND CUT COMING?

Analysts have slashed estimates for GE’s 2018 earnings and expect a major restructuring plan on Monday as GE tries to pull out of a 16-year stock slump.

GE is likely to get much smaller and more focused, Jeff Sprague, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, wrote on Friday. “It is also conceivable that looking out a few years, GE ceases to exist as we know it,” he said, referring to a potential break-up.

“Staffing has to go down meaningfully,” said a large Boston-based fund manager who invests in GE. The company spent billions on restructuring the last few years but without growth in operating profit, he added.

Since becoming CEO on Aug. 1, Flannery has doubled the amount of cost cutting targeted for next year to $2 billion, and is cutting $1 billion this year. He said he has found more than $20 billion in GE assets to sell and is looking at further changes to the portfolio beyond that.

A 30-year GE veteran, Flannery is due to present the strategic changes and new financial targets at an investor meeting in New York on Monday. The plans also could include cutting GE’s dividend for only the third time in GE’s history. The other two were during the Great Depression and the financial crisis.

Flannery has come under increasing pressure to boost GE’s profit and share price after the company badly missed earnings expectations for the third quarter and lowered its financial outlook last month.

GE stock has fallen more than 36 percent this year, making it the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and posing the risk that the only remaining original company in the widely watched stock index could be kicked out.

Activist investor Ed Garden, a founding partner at Trian Fund Management, recently joined GE’s board. Trian invested $2.5 billion in GE in 2015 and pressed the company to cut costs and focus on sectors where it is a market leader, such as power plants, jet engines and medical devices. Trian declined to comment.

GE is considering divestment of its aircraft leasing, transportation and healthcare information technology businesses. The job reduction efforts in GE’s units appear to be independent of those divestitures, the sources said.

Flannery already has grounded GE’s corporate jets, cut car bonuses for executives and dismissed two vice chairmen to save money.

In another sign of austerity, he shrunk the size of GE’s annual leadership retreat in January and moved it from ritzy Boca Raton, Florida, to Boston.

Harare International Airport will from Thursday be known as Robert Mugabe International Airport and is expected to undergo an upgrade so that it can handle 6.5 million passengers a year, more than double its current capacity.

State-owned Herald newspaper reported that China Export and Import Bank will provide a $153 million loan that will, among other things, be used to expand the runway to allow multiple planes to land at the same time.

Her priority was to transfer wealth from the white minority to the black majority, who are generally much poorer. Those who opposed the policy were mainly white people or members of the black elite who want to preserve the status quo, she said.

“If we have to choose between our people having a better life and investment, that’s not a choice,” she said, when asked about whether her policies could scare away businesses.

“From where I sit, it’s looking good. The campaign is going well,” said Dlamini-Zuma, who was married to the president.

The winner of the party vote will be favorite to become the next president of South Africa, either at an election in 2019, or before if Zuma stands down or is forced out by the new ANC leadership next year.

Apartheid in South Africa ended in 1994 but much of the country’s wealth resides with the white minority. Successive ANC governments have said they want to empower the majority, though many black people have seen only modest economic gains.

Dlamini-Zuma, who has held several cabinet posts and was most recently chair of the African Union, has pledged to tackle poverty and close the gaping racial inequality gap.

Some investors are concerned about Dlamini-Zuma’s proposed plan of “radical economic transformation”, which critics have said is a populist term that isn’t backed up by solid policies.",South Africa's Dlamini-Zuma says business endorsement not a priority in ANC race,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1DA0NM-OZATP

The deal will be Blackstone’s first private equity investment in China since 2014, Thomson Reuters data showed.

The U.S.-based investment house has signed the deal agreement but is still lining up loan financing of about $600 million to fund the transaction, said two of the people, who declined to be identified as the information was confidential.

Blackstone declined to comment. ShyaHsin could not be reached for comment.

The Senate’s approval is needed to pass laws though it does not often block bills passed by the elected House of Commons. Some senators say police need more time to prepare and also oppose setting the federal age of legal use at 18.

Legalizing marijuana for recreational use was part of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s 2015 election campaign and the government has set a relatively quick deadline to put it in place. Canada would be the first Group of Seven country to allow the drug nationally.

The legislation is not expected to reach the upper house until December and some senators have said they will take as long as they need to review it.

That could put Trudeau and the upper house of parliament at loggerheads again. Senators, who are not elected, recently delayed the government’s budget bill before ultimately passing it.

Conservative Senator Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu said he expects implementation will need to be delayed until December 2018 or early 2019 to give police forces enough time to prepare for widespread use of the drug.

“I think it’s too early,” Boisvenu said on Friday by phone. “What they’ve (the police) told us until today is they will not be prepared next July.”

Boisvenu said Conservative senators will meet to discuss strategy about delaying the bill if necessary.

Member of Parliament Bill Blair, a former police chief and the government’s point person on the legislation, said added delays in regulation will put more underage users at risk.

“By all means, take the time to do it right, but unnecessary delay is unacceptable,” Blair said by phone.

The potential clash highlights a hurdle Trudeau has partly set up for himself after he expelled all Liberal senators from the party’s caucus in 2014 amid an expenses scandal and to curb partisanship.

Although Trudeau has appointed independent senators since then, he has no formal leverage to get the government’s legislation passed.

“The government, if it had a clear majority in the Senate, could at one point impose party discipline and have its bill voted on. It’s not in that situation now,” said Senator Andre Pratte, an independent who was appointed by Trudeau in 2016.",Canada government facing resistance from Senate over pot law,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1D32IK-OCADN

The Reuters Tankan, which tracks the Bank of Japan’s closely-watched tankan quarterly survey, also found service-sector firms’ sentiment edging up, a further sign of broadening recovery.

“The Reuters Tankan indicated that sentiment in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing remained elevated and that the outlook was also firm, reflecting strong domestic and overseas demand,” said Yuichiro Nagai, economist at Barclays Securities.

“We expect the BOJ tankan sentiment index in December to exceed company projections at the time of the September survey.”

The latest survey results bolster the argument that Japan’s economy, the world’s third largest, is gathering momentum from its brisk export performance and firmer domestic demand.

“The economy is in a moderate recovery trend, but capital spending lacks some strength due to uncertainty over the outlook on the global economy,” a manager of a machinery maker wrote in the survey, in which companies respond anonymously.

The poll of 547 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 255 firms responded, was conducted Oct. 26 to Nov. 7.

The sentiment index for manufacturers fell to 27 from a decade-high of 31 in October. Sentiment deteriorated sharply among producers of industrial materials such as refined oils and chemicals, likely reflecting worsening terms of trade due to a weakening yen and rising oil prices.

Service-sector sentiment rose one point to 31, led by real estate/construction firms that benefit from the BOJ’s easy money.

Retailers were more muted, a concern for the health of private consumption that constitutes some 60 percent of the economy.

“The operating rate of buildings is performing well. Marked increase in activity is seen among the wealthy who seek residences worth 300 million yen to 1 billion yen ($8.75 million). Demand for real estate among ordinary people is slow,” a real estate firm said.

FILE PHOTO: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman looks on as he meets with French President Emmanuel Macron in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, November 9, 2017. Picture taken November 9, 2017. Saudi Press Agency/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo

On Saturday Nov. 4, guests at Riyadh’s Ritz Carlton were notified by the opulent hotel that: “Due to unforeseen booking by local authorities which requires an elevated level of security, we are unable to accommodate guests ... until normal operations are restored.”

The purge was already under way. Within hours security forces had rounded up dozens of members of Saudi Arabia’s political and business elite, mostly in the capital and the coastal city of Jeddah. Among them were 11 princes as well as ministers and wealthy tycoons.

Some were invited to meetings where they were detained. Others were arrested at their homes and flown to Riyadh or driven to the Ritz Carlton, which has been turned into a temporary prison.

The detainees were allowed a single, brief phone call home, a person familiar with the arrests told Reuters.

“They don’t receive calls and are kept under tight security. No one can go in or out,” the insider said. “It is obvious that there was a lot of preparation for it.”

The purge was ordered by 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Officially next in line to the throne to his father, King Salman, he is now in effect running the country which he has said he will transform into a modern state.

To do that - and in an attempt to shore up his own power - he has decided to go after the Saudi elite, including some members of the royal family, on accusations such as taking bribes and inflating the cost of business projects. Those arrested could not be reached for comment.

At stake is political stability in the world’s largest oil producer. The Crown Prince’s ability to rule unchallenged depends on whether the purge is successful.

The Crown Prince believes that unless the country changes, the economy will sink into a crisis that could fan unrest. That could threaten the royal family and weaken the country in its regional rivalry with Iran.

THE “CORRUPTION STICK”

Prince Mohammed decided to move on his family, the person familiar with events said, when he realised more relatives opposed him becoming king than he had thought.

“The signal was that anyone wavering in their support should watch out,” said the person familiar with the events. “The whole idea of the anti-corruption campaign was targeted towards the family. The rest is window dressing.”

King Salman said the purge was in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money”. Insiders said the accusations were based on evidence gathered by the intelligence service.

Government backers have rejected suggestions that the campaign is really about eliminating political enemies. There was no immediate comment from the royal court on this story.

Among those now holed up at the Ritz Carlton hotel is Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who is head of the powerful National Guard and Prince Mohammed’s cousin.

Miteb was in his farm house in Riyadh when he was called to a meeting with the Crown Prince. Such an invitation, even at night, would not be unusual for a senior official and would not have aroused suspicion.

“He went to the meeting and never came back,” said a second insider who has connections to some of those who were detained.

Others held include Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who is chairman of international investment firm Kingdom Holding and a cousin of Prince Mohammed, and Prince Turki bin Abdullah, former governor of Riyadh province and a son of the late King Abdullah.

Some royal watchers said tensions were laid bare during family meetings over the summer. One insider said it was widely known to Prince Mohammed that some of the powerful royals, including Miteb, were resentful about his elevation.

Prince Mohammed, who is widely known in Saudi Arabia by his initials MbS, had said openly in interviews that he would investigate the kingdom’s endemic corruption and would not hesitate to go after top officials.

The vehicle was an anti-corruption committee created by King Salman, and announced on Nov. 4. The king put the Crown Prince in charge, adding another power to the many he has been given in the past three years.

Saudi authorities have questioned 208 people in the anti-corruption investigation and estimate at least $100 billion has been stolen through graft, the attorney-general said on Thursday. The head of the committee said investigators had been collecting evidence for three years.

By launching a war on corruption, the prince has combined a popular cause with the elimination of an obstacle to acceding to the throne.

“MbS used the corruption stick which can reach any one of them,” said Jamal Khashoggi, a former adviser to Prince Turki al-Faisal, intelligence chief from 1979 to 2001. “For the first time we Saudis see princes being tried for their corruption.”

But Khashoggi, who lives in the United States, said Prince Mohammed was being selective in his purge.

“I believe MbS is a nationalist who loves his country and wants it to be the strongest but his problem is that he wants to rule alone,” he said.

DE FACTO RULER

Prince Mohammed was appointed defence minister in 2015 when King Salman became monarch. In June, the King named him heir to the throne, pushing aside his older cousin Mohammed bin Nayef, a veteran head of the security apparatus. The royal family acquiesced and by September the Crown Prince had rounded up and jailed religious and intellectual opponents.

The latest detentions are intended to help him push through reforms that promise the greatest change since the reign of King Abdulaziz, founder of the current Saudi state in the 1930s.

That state has rested on an enduring accommodation between the royal family and the Wahhabist clerics who control the hardline version of Islam that originated in Saudi Arabia.

The ruling family promised to give Saudis comfortable lives and a share of the country’s oil wealth. In return, their subjects have offered political submission and promised to follow the country’s strict religious and social codes.

King Abdulaziz, who was also known as Ibn Saud, died in 1953. Since then, Saudi Arabia has been run by the king and below him there has been a group of princes, none of them strong enough to impose his will against the wishes of the others.

Decisions have mostly come through consensus. That arrangement has meant social and political change has been glacial although it has also kept the kingdom stable.

But in moves that position Prince Mohammed as the new Ibn Saud, the Crown Prince is tearing down pillars of rule that had been eroding under the weight of population growth and low oil prices.

Consensus has been replaced by what critics say is one-man rule, opposed by some princes although they would not risk saying so in public.

In the past few decades, every Saudi king had one or two of his brothers, sons or nephews by his side advising and sharing in governance. But Prince Mohammed has not appointed any of his brothers or other close family to top positions, instead relying on a team of advisers -- mainly Saudis though some are U.S.- or British-trained.

King Salman, 82, still has the last word on everything. But he has delegated the running of the kingdom’s military, security, economic, foreign and social affairs to Prince Mohammed. There has been speculation for months, denied by court officials, that the king will soon abdicate the throne to MbS.

Even the Crown Prince’s age is remarkable. The last three kings have reached the throne aged 61, 80 and 79. Prince Mohammed is effectively in charge at 32.

NO GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS

Prince Mohammed says he offers a new social contract: A state that functions better than the rigid bureaucracy of the past, opportunities to have fun and an economy that will create jobs that can last, whatever happens in oil markets.

In September he announced that Saudi women will be given the right to drive. Just three weeks ago, during a conference for investors at the same Ritz Carlton that now houses the targets of his purge, he unveiled a plan for a $500-billion futuristic city where sexes could mingle and robots outnumber humans.

The prince has also drawn up a blueprint to wean Saudi Arabia off its dependence on oil and its subjects off state subsidies and government jobs. The public listing of national oil company Saudi Aramco, planned next year, is its centrepiece.

There are no guarantees the prince’s ambitions will succeed.

Even some admirers ask whether his reach exceeds his grasp. His top-down approach, brooking no opposition, could scare off investors wanting assurances about rule of law and security. Without huge investor support, he will struggle to meet the aspirations of Saudi youth.

War in Yemen, a dispute with the Gulf emirate of Qatar and growing tension with Iran is a concern to investors too.

It should help that Prince Mohammed, following the example of Ibn Saud, sees the importance of forging a special bond with the United States.

During a visit to Saudi Arabia in May, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Riyadh to lead an alliance against Iran and its attempt to cut a Shi‘ite axis through Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.

Soon afterwards, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates blockaded Qatar, accusing its ruling Al Thani dynasty of supporting Iran and Islamist terrorism. Trump gave his backing. After the arrests of the past week, Trump tweeted support, saying those arrested had been “milking their country for years”.

One insider close to the royal family said the National Guard was unlikely to react strongly to Miteb’s removal. He said there had been no resistance to the ousting of Mohammed bin Nayef at the interior ministry and the National Guard would be no different.

Princes, business tycoons and politicians were arrested at the weekend in a purge that cements the power of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Many of them being held here, at the luxurious Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh's diplomatic quarter. Their assets now being targeted by the newly formed anti-corruption committee which was created by royal decree and is chaired by Prince Mohammed. It has the power to use ""whatever measures are deemed necessary"" to seize companies, funds and other assets. And the scrutiny of offshore funds has already begun - banks in the United Arab Emirates are being asked to give up details about Saudi citizens detained in the investigation. The UAE, and Dubai in particular, are popular destinations for Saudi money. Commercial bankers told Reuters that UAE regulators had asked for details on the accounts of 19 Saudis. Almost all of those 19 - including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal - have been detained in the inquiry. Commercial bankers said UAE authorities had not explained why they wanted the information, but believed it was at the behest of the Saudi government. Central bank officials in the UAE were not available to comment. The move is seen as a possible precursor to those accounts being frozen, and huge amounts of money could be at stake. An official at the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce estimated that if all the revenue lost to corruption was retrieved, it would total $800 billion. Much of that sum is believed to held offshore in bank accounts, portfolio investments, corporate shareholdings and real estate.

The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the week lower for the first time in nine weeks.

U.S. Senate Republicans released a tax plan on Thursday that differed from a version put forth by the House of Representatives on several key fronts, including putting off corporate tax cuts for a year.

Expectations of lower taxes, one of President Donald Trump’s key campaign promises, have helped drive the S&P 500 up 20 percent since the 2016 presidential election.

Failure to cut corporate taxes would increase concerns about Trump’s ability to pass legislation and could shake markets that have been banking on lower tax rates to boost company earnings.

The S&P 500 on Friday stood at 18.1 times expected earnings, the highest since 2004, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.

Arrow Funds Director of Research John Serrapere put the chances of successfully passing meaningful tax cuts at 50 percent, and he warned that failing could trigger a correction of as much as 15 percent in stocks.

“There’s not a lot of confidence. I‘m not pessimistic, but there are a lot of pieces that need to be put together,” Serrapere said.

The Dow .DJI fell 0.17 percent to end at 23,422.21, while the S&P 500 .SPX slipped 0.09 percent to 2,582.3.

The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC edged up 0.01 percent to 6,750.94.

For the week, the Dow lost 0.5 percent and the S&P 500 slipped 0.21 percent. The Nasdaq gave up 0.2 percent for the week, snapping six weeks of weekly gains.

Intel (INTC.O) fell 1.55 percent and Apple (AAPL.O) lost 0.33 percent, both accounting more than any other companies for the S&P 500’s decline.

Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors fell, with the energy index’s .SPNY 0.81 percent dip leading the decliners as oil prices fell.

Nvidia (NVDA.O) jumped 5.27 percent and hit a record high after the chipmaker’s revenue forecast for the current quarter topped estimates.

A rise in media stocks also helped limit the slide.

Disney (DIS.N) rose 2.05 percent as the promise of a new “Star Wars” trilogy overshadowed its weak quarterly results.

Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) jumped 4.08 percent while News Corp (NWSA.O) climbed 5.15 percent.

The thick blanket of grey air and pollutants has enveloped the eastern Pakistani city and several other urban areas for nearly two weeks, bringing visibility to zero most of the day.

The Pakistani crisis is part of a wider smog emergency that has hit neighbouring India, forcing authorities in New Delhi on Friday to plan to spray water over the city.

Meteorologists say the pollution surge was triggered by vehicle exhaust fumes, dust and illegal burning of crops.

Limited visibility has caused over 250 road accidents, killing 14 people and injuring more than 400, said Jam Sajjad Hussain, a government rescue service official.

A spokesman for Pakistan’s Civil Aviation Authority, Kamran Malik, said dozens of flights were delayed, cancelled or diverted over the last week or so.

And more than 15,000 smog-affected patients were admitted to hospitals with acute respiratory infections, allergies and other pollution-related ailments in the Lahore area, said Faisal Zahoor, director general of health for Punjab province.

Levels of Particulate Matter (PM 2.5) have been touching 500mg per cubic meter in the last several days in parts of Pakistan where the normal upper limit is 150mg, said environment ministry spokesman Naseem-ur-Rehman Shah.

The particles, if inhaled deep into the lungs, can cause heart attacks, strokes, lung cancer, severe allergies and respiratory diseases.
