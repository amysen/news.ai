Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

For every Puerto Rico, St. John, St. Martin, Dominica and other islands ravaged by hurricanes this year, operators said, there’s an Aruba, St. Lucia, Jamaica and other Caribbean spots ready and open for business.

But many loyal visitors, especially those with relatives, friends and property in the affected areas, say they are still planning to travel to their getaways, eager to somehow help out, if only by injecting tourist dollars into battered economies.

That would be me.

I have lived in several states for more than 40 years but was born and raised in San Juan and visit every New Year’s Eve with my husband, Jim. In the agonizing first weeks after Hurricane Maria swept through Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, I learned about the fate of my sister and extended family, including a cousin with Alzheimer’s living in a home for the elderly, at an excruciatingly slow pace and only through sporadic emails, texts, Facebook postings and snippets of phone conversations before the calls dropped. It was hard to sleep at night.

Through a cousin in Texas I found out about another cousin who lives near El Yunque National Forest in the northeast of Puerto Rico. Through another cousin in San Juan I learned about other relatives scattered in both urban and rural areas around the island. All my loved ones were safe, though in survival mode.

My attention turned then to the touchstones and places that give Puerto Rico its beauty and culture and that I now realize I have taken for granted all my life.

What was left of “El Yunque,” known for its waterfalls and endangered parrots, I wondered? I later learned that the 28,000-acre treasure, El Yunque, the only tropical rain forest in the United States forest system and a major driver of the island’s tourism, was obliterated.

What about the restaurants and kiosks nearby along Luquillo Beach — Jibaro’s, Terruño, La Parrilla — always good for fritters like alcapurrias, home cooking and music after a day in the sun? Was Old San Juan still recognizable? Did the ice cream place with the long lines for the freshly made waffle cones, Mantecaditos Los Chicos, survive in Culebra, the Puerto Rican island municipality to the east? What was the damage to the delicate bioluminescent bay in Vieques, another island municipality?

What did Hurricane Maria not annihilate? How long would it take for it all to come back?

Ms. Westerman, who eventually confirmed the well-being of both her neighbors and condo and who has been mailing checks to some friends to help them cope, said she planned to see for herself.

She and her husband were planning to go back this year for their usual December to mid-April stay in Boquerón, a beach village in the town of Cabo Rojo on the southwestern tip of the island, with one condition — they will not fly down until the electricity is back on.

Photo

“If worst comes to worst we go a month later,” she said.

Restored power was a big “if,” though. By early November, more than a month after the hurricane hit, the power company was generating less than 40 percent of electricity, government figures showed. Close to 20 percent of the island was without running water and about a third without telecommunication services.

The Army Corps of Engineers, charged by the White House to rebuild the power system, has warned that total power restoration could take nearly a year, partly because of the challenge of getting supplies like utility poles quickly to an island.

Neighboring St. Thomas and St. John in the United States Virgin Islands had not fared much better.

“Power lines are strewn across our roads; utility poles snapped in half like matchsticks; boats lie sunken in the harbors; many thousands of our homes stand heavily damaged or destroyed and some of our major road systems are impassable,” Gov. Kenneth E. Mapp of the United States Virgin Islands wrote in an Oct. 12 letter to Congress, estimating that rebuilding would cost $5.5 billion.

Both governors in the American Caribbean — Puerto Rico with a population of 3.4 million, and the United States Virgin Islands, with about 110,000 residents — have optimistically said that nearly all power should be back by Christmas because of a ramp-up in restoration work.

In the meantime, tourism officials, hoteliers and others in the service industry were scrambling to get hotels, beaches and tourist attractions back on their feet to salvage at least part of their peak tourist season, a crucial economic engine that runs from mid-November to April 1.

Photo

But while cruise ship traffic has been rebounding, top hotels in Puerto Rico like El San Juan Hotel and Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, shut down because of damages and many of those that remained open with the help of generators were housing workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other relief agencies.

The Environmental Protection Agency and local government officials have warned against bathing in beaches, rivers and streams because of possible raw sewage discharges as a result of hurricane damage to treatment plants.

In St. Thomas and St. John, major hotels have closed for 6 to 18 months and officials expected a significant decline in overnight visitors.

“We lost the last quarter of the year,” said Beverly Nicholson Doty, commissioner of tourism for the United States Virgin Islands.

It is true that tourism-dependent islands have been able to recover quickly after hurricanes, even if visitors have to look at topless palm trees. When I reported from St. Thomas, St. Martin (divided into French St. Martin and Dutch St. Maarten) and Antigua less than two months after Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn in 1995, I found varying degrees of progress, but much of the tourist industry was ready for visitors and some tourists were trickling back.

Photo

But tourism officials in the American Caribbean acknowledged that Irma, which made landfall in the Virgin Islands on Sept. 6 as a Category 5 hurricane, and Maria, which hit Puerto Rico barely short of that magnitude as a Category 4, were like no other hurricanes in recent history because of their power and overwhelming reach. In Puerto Rico, hardly a corner of the island was spared its destruction, officials said.

José Izquierdo, executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company, said that such impact has led the agency to appeal to new types of travelers. One local tour operator that the agency has partnered up with, Local Guest, planned to take volunteers to mountainous regions where brigades of about 15 people each could plant crops of coffee and root vegetables, rebuild bridges and homes and help in other recovery efforts.

Some travel companies, like Global Works Travel, are signing up high school students to visit in 2018 and combine community service with a vacation.

Mr. Izquierdo said that he also expected more Puerto Ricans to visit from the mainland, perhaps those who had not visited in several years and were anxious to reunite with relatives on the island after the disaster. The local newspapers have noted the influx and I personally know friends who headed for the island as soon as flights became available to bring supplies and money and to check up on relatives. (By the same token, others were hosting Puerto Rican friends and relatives escaping the hardships of the island temporarily in New York and New Jersey.)

“A hurricane like this changes the profile of tourists,” Mr. Izquierdo said. “The diaspora now takes a greater prominence.”

Within days of the hurricanes, volunteers started showing up in St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands, where the organization All Hands Volunteers set up operations in the gym at the Kingdom Life International Christian Center in the capital city of Charlotte Amalie.

The disaster relief group, based in Massachusetts, had received more than 1,600 applications by the end of October but can accommodate only about 70 volunteers at any given time in spartan quarters. People can come for as long as they want to work in cleanup, mold remediation, building temporary classrooms and permanent reconstruction, among other efforts.

Erik Dyson, All Hands executive director and chief executive, said the organization planned to extend its work to Puerto Rico by early 2018.

“Anyone can help,” he said. “There’s a need for people to carry things. There’s a lot of not highly skilled jobs.”

One volunteer who arrived in early November, Sid Sharma, 48, of Allen, Tex., spent his honeymoon 26 years ago in St. Thomas, which he remembered as “lush, green and beautiful.” A general contractor who does residential remodeling, he committed to three weeks of volunteer work.

“Seeing the devastation on the news, I just had a little time on my hands and a push from my heart,” said Mr. Sharma, who is still married and the father of two children. “This is something that I should be doing.”

Regular visitors to the Virgin Islands like Joanne Barker, a resident of Washington who last went to St. John in January, have found ways to send care packages directly to those in need. Ms. Barker said she was shopping in October to fill up boxes with items like baby powder milk formula and diapers after being paired up with families through a site — Adopt a Family in USVI — that matches donors to specific people.

“At least you’re doing something,” she said. “You just feel so helpless up here.”

Tourism officials say they have not totally given up on leisure travelers. Mr. Izquierdo noted that big attractions like Old San Juan suffered only “minimal” structural damage (although it lost many trees).

And, he added: “At the core of every successful tourism destination is the quality of the people and hospitality, and that wasn’t washed away by the hurricane. That’s stronger than ever.”

But some in the tourism industry warned that a minimum level of services is required to lure travelers back. Jack Richards, president and chief executive of Pleasant Holidays in Los Angeles, which books trips for 23 countries in the Caribbean, said that the destination must have electricity, phone service, internet, clean water and medical supplies — and no public health issues.

Photo

“Given the level of devastation in Puerto Rico,” Mr. Richards said, “it’ll take a long time for things to get restored.”

Puerto Rico residents like my younger sister, Mari Navarro, and two nephews were still living day to day in a kind of surreal, stressed-out world as November approached. Our family home in San Juan, not far from the airport, suffered only minor damages except for the landscaping, which was gone. But without electricity Mari was cooking on a small gas stove, washing clothes and towels by hand and using flashlights to see at night.

My sister had prepared well for Hurricane Maria, but supplies were running low and she asked me to send D batteries for flashlights and a battery-powered fan. She had to line up for food and bottled water at stores.

She was back on the job as an account executive with a health insurer but she avoided driving except to work, she told me, because most traffic lights were not working. On a recent outing, two cars in front of her had crashed into each other, setting off a panic attack.

“I’m grateful that I have a roof over my head, that we’re all working and that we’re doing better than a lot of people,” she told me over the phone, “but sometimes it’s hard not to get depressed.”

TBS said in its own statement that production on “The Cops,” which was planned for a 2018 debut, had been “suspended until further review.”

Also on Friday, 3 Arts Entertainment, the company that had been managing Louis C.K., dropped him as a client. Two of the women who had experienced Louis C.K.’s misconduct believed that his manager, Dave Becky, wanted them to stop talking about their encounter with him. Mr. Becky denied making threats toward these women.

And Lewis Kay, who had been the comedian’s publicist, said in a Twitter post Friday, “As of today, I no longer represent Louis C.K.”

In their statement, the FX companies said, “Louis has now confirmed the truth of the reports relating to the five women victimized by his misconduct, which we were unaware of previously.”

The companies added, “As far as we know, his behavior over the past eight years on all five series he has produced for FX Networks and/or FX Productions has been professional.”

They continued, “However, now is not the time for him to make television shows. Now is the time for him to honestly address the women who have come forth to speak about their painful experiences, a process which he began today with his public statement.”

In that statement, Louis C.K. did not offer apologies to the women who shared their stories with the Times.

He said, however, “I have been remorseful of my actions. And I’ve tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I’m aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men who would never have put them in that position.”

Harassment Claims

Louis C.K. also said he needed to acknowledge “the hurt that I’ve brought on people who I work with.”

He added, “I’ve brought pain to my family, my friends, my children and their mother.”

Louis C.K. is just one of several powerful men who have recently faced rapid consequences after media reports brought attention to allegations of their sexual misconduct or harassment. Harvey Weinstein, the film producer and media executive; the actor Kevin Spacey; the filmmaker Brett Ratner; and the journalist Mark Halperin are among the prominent men to have experienced precipitous downfalls as accounts about them accumulated.

While Louis C.K. was one of the few men to admit to the conduct he’d been accused of, many people found his statement unsatisfactory and wondered why his behavior had not been addressed sooner. The actress Rose McGowan, who has said Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted her, wrote in a Twitter post on Friday, that she had heard stories about Louis C.K. two years ago even though she isn’t connected to the comedy scene. “Industry faux-shock is such a tired lie. I send my strength and love to all women hurt by him and the code of complicity.”

The distributor of Louis C.K.’s coming film, “I Love You, Daddy,” said Friday that it would not go ahead with its Nov. 17 release of the movie. The comedy, which he wrote and directed, was acquired by the entertainment company the Orchard in a $5 million deal. Louis C.K. stars in it as a TV comedy writer opposite John Malkovich as a notorious 68-year-old filmmaker who strikes up an uncomfortable relationship with the writer’s daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz), who has not yet turned 18.

Following preview screenings of “I Love You, Daddy,” several critics remarked on its troubling sexual politics and how certain scenes seemed to be commenting on Louis C.K.’s own reputation for misconduct.

HBO said that Louis C.K. had been dropped from the lineup of “Night of Too Many Stars,” a comedy benefit that it will broadcast Nov. 18, and that it had pulled other works of his from its on-demand service.

Netflix, which this year struck a deal with Louis C.K. to create two new stand-up specials for the streaming service, said on Friday that it will not produce the planned second special. (The first one, “Louis C.K. 2017,” was released in April.)

Mr. Schein has been unable to look for other photos taken by Johnnie Mae Crowder.","The deal was done at a crossroads.

There, according to legend, the bluesman Robert Johnson sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for otherworldly musical prowess — guitar playing, singing and songwriting that would make him an idol, still studied and revered almost 80 years after his death.

Zeke Schein came to a crossroads, too, when he bought an old photo (Slide 1) that he believes is only the third known image of Johnson. Johnson’s family, a prominent forensic expert and musicians who’ve been transformed by the bluesman’s recordings agreed with Mr. Schein. But skeptics questioned the likeness, the date — even Mr. Schein’s motives.

Intent on defending himself and the image, Mr. Schein began a journey to learn more about the sharp-dressed men in the sepia print. He chronicles his search in “Portrait of a Phantom: The Story of Robert Johnson’s Lost Photograph,” a book he co-wrote with Poppy Z. Brite, recently published by Pelican.

He talked about the book at another crossroads, Matt Umanov Guitars, a Greenwich Village landmark where he has worked since 1989. He wrote that the store is such a magnet that “if you sit at the front counter of Matt Umanov Guitars, the world comes to you.” Since we began this conversation Matt decided to close the store after 53 years. Zeke put on his walking shoes, and moved on to Rudy’s, his next crossroads.

Mr. Schein discovered the photo while searching for old guitars on eBay. The 3-inch-by-4-inch print from sheet film wasn’t in great shape – “The photo looked haunted, like it had been to hell and back,” he wrote. But when Mr. Schein saw it, he immediately believed that the man holding the guitar was Johnson.

With help from Tom Crandall, a friend in the store’s repair shop, Mr. Schein won the auction in 2005. Mr. Schein was familiar with vintage and vernacular photography. He makes photographs as well as plays music, with a deep appreciation of the tools of each form, since before selling guitars, he’d sold cameras and worked in a lab. He immediately thought the image was a contact print from sheet film, likely done with a Speed Graphic, because of the sharpness.

“Looking at the paper,” Mr. Schein said, “I could tell it was that cheaper, crumbly paper that you would see in old photo albums, photos of maybe my grandparents and even early photos of my father would be on that type of paper.” He dated it to the 1930s. Johnson died in 1938.

Photo

“And then if you look at the print, if you see it online, you’ll see that the edges are black,” Mr. Schein said. “It’s not masked. So you’re not seeing white edging on there — you’re seeing what looks like a negative which was laid down flat.” (A negative’s clear edge comes out black on a contact-sheet print.)

Mr. Schein also guessed that the man in the lighter suit in the photo was Johnny Shines, another blues legend who died in 1992. Mr. Schein later learned of a documentary about Johnson, “Can’t You Hear the Wind Howl?” in which Shines said that there was a photo of him and Johnson taken in 1937 by a photographer named Johnnie Mae Crowder in Hughes, Ark., and that it ran in a local newspaper. If the two were posing for a newspaper photographer, she might very well have used a Speed Graphic, which was standard equipment then.

After showing the photo to friends and musicians who, like Mr. Schein, knew intimately the details of the two authenticated photos of Johnson, many agreed that he’d discovered a third image. Trouble was, when he showed the photo to two old Delta bluesmen, David “Honeyboy” Edwards and Robert Lockwood Jr., who’d both known Johnson, neither of them recognized the man holding the guitar.

Skeptics questioned whether the photo was from the 1930s, since it looked as if the man on the right wore a zoot suit, a 1940s fashion fad featuring wide lapels and shoulders and high-waisted baggy pants. But the style was based on the “drape suit” worn by African-Americans a decade earlier; in the 1933 film “International House,” Cab Calloway’s band wore similar suits.

Some also have suggested that the photo was reversed, since the man in the light suit wore his watch on his right wrist and the man in the dark suit has a pocket square on the right side of his jacket, rather than the left. If the photo is flipped, this meant Johnson is holding the guitar as a left-handed player, not a righty. But since the guitar is stringless, it could have been a studio prop, so it wouldn’t matter how Johnson held it.

More people joined the search. Frank DiGiacomo, who wrote about Mr. Schein’s photo for Vanity Fair in 2008, showed a copy to Claude Johnson, Robert’s son, who agreed that it was his father.

A lawyer for the Johnson estate sent a copy of the photo to Lois Gibson, a forensic specialist who had identified the sailor in Alfred Eisenstaedt’s famous image of a sailor kissing a nurse in Times Square at the end of World War II. She said that the man holding the guitar in Mr. Schein’s photo appeared to be Johnson.

The Vanity Fair piece seemed only to spur attacks on the photo and criticism of Mr. Schein, with some accusing him of pushing it for financial gain, even though he’d assigned the copyright to the Johnson estate.

“We do all share a love of that music and we all play it, including writers and historians who decided to attack what I was doing and also question the integrity — my integrity — in what I was doing and that of the Johnson family,” Mr. Schein said. “They were accusing us of only being in it for money, which was never the goal for either of us. I needed to at least explain my position, why I cared so much about trying to put out a musician’s image who affected me.”

Despite years of investigations, more needs to be done. Mr. Schein has been unable to look for other photos taken by Johnnie Mae Crowder. “I stumbled on this one,“ he said. “I don’t have the skill set to go further than I did.”

But maybe you do.

“In a wild-hopes situation — wildest hopes — I hope someone reads my story and has the knowledge and experience to take my research and what I’ve been able to do a step further.”

College and university endowment earnings are usually tax-exempt. But as endowments have sought greater investment returns in recent years, they have shifted more of their money out of traditional holdings like United States equities to alternative, potentially more lucrative investments. These include private equity and hedge funds that frequently borrow money, opening them up to tax consequences.

When schools earn income from enterprises unrelated to their core educational missions, they can be required to pay a tax that was intended to prevent nonprofits from competing unfairly with for-profit businesses.

Establishing another corporate layer between private equity funds and endowments effectively blocks any taxable income from flowing to the endowments, the reason they are called blocker corporations. The tax is instead owed by the corporations, which are established in no-tax or low-tax jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands.

“Congress is essentially subsidizing nonprofits by allowing them to engage in these transactions,” said Norman I. Silber, a law professor at Hofstra University who co-authored a paper on blocker corporations in 2015. “They’re allowing them to borrow so that they can build up their endowments.”

The use of blocker corporations has raised concerns among policymakers in recent years. That’s partly because they cost the United States Treasury millions of dollars, but also because they legitimize an opaque offshore network sometimes used for nefarious purposes.

“They’re not cheating. They’re not hiding money or disguising money,” said Samuel Brunson, a law professor at Loyola University Chicago who has studied endowment taxation. “But they’re adding money to a system that allows people, if they want to hide their money, to do it.” Not only do the universities benefit — so does the wealthy and influential private equity industry.

Perhaps illustrating the sensitivity of the topic, officials at most of the college and university endowments that use blocker corporations, including Colgate, Dartmouth, Duke and Stanford, declined to comment specifically, citing longstanding policies against discussing their investments. Among them was Matt Kavgian, the director of strategic communications for Indiana University’s $2 billion endowment, which had invested $10 million with Quintana.

An exception was the Quintana shareholder Texas Christian University, whose chief investment officer, Jim Hille, acknowledged that the $1.5 billion endowment had used blocker corporations. Mr. Hille said the decision to use one often came down to whether the expected return would offset the cost of establishing a blocker corporation.

References to such corporations in the Appleby files, shared with The New York Times by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which obtained them from the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, date back at least to 2003. At that time, five elite schools — Columbia University, Dartmouth College, the University of Southern California, Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University — became partners in a Bermuda-based group called H&F Investors Blocker.

H&F Investors Blocker was formed to invest with one of the largest private equity firms, Hellman & Friedman, in shares of Axel Springer, a German publisher of newspapers and magazines.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

Minutes from meetings at Appleby’s office in Hamilton, Bermuda, never mention tax avoidance or even explain why the word “blocker” is used in the partnership’s title. But an audit by Ernst & Young, contained in the minutes, shows that H&F Investors Blocker would owe no federal income tax.

By 2008, the University of Texas system — whose endowment last year was $24.2 billion, behind Harvard’s ($34.5 billion) and Yale’s ($25.4 billion) — asked Appleby to set up a Cayman Islands company called TX Liquidity Capital so “certain tax advantages will accrue to the system,” documents show.

Alabama’s state auditor, Jim Ziegler, told The Washington Examiner that the women’s claims were “much ado about nothing” and said that Mr. Moore had done nothing “immoral or illegal.” (Alabama law, both in 1979 and now, finds that someone who is 19 or older and has sexual contact with someone between the ages of 12 and 16 is guilty of second-degree sex abuse.)

Mr. Ziegler sought to justify Mr. Moore’s actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph, saying, “Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus.”

“Those seats are designed to make the best possible use of the space,” an American spokesman, Josh Freed, said.
A spokesman for Spirit Airlines, Paul Berry, said the emphasis on pitch was an inaccurate way to assess today’s newer seat designs.
“While it’s only 28 inches in pitch, it actually feels like it’s about 30 inches,” he said.
One group, Flyers Rights, is petitioning the Federal Aviation Administration to set minimum dimensions for airline seat width and pitch.","While low-cost airlines like Spirit have narrowed the distance between rows of seats to as little as 28 inches, most of the big American airlines have kept the distance — what’s known in the business as seat pitch — at 30 inches. Anything less, the major airlines have found, pushes already beleaguered travelers to their limits.

This year, the news leaked that American Airlines was considering a cabin redesign that would leave a few rows in its new Boeing 737 Max fleet with just 29 inches of pitch, plans the carrier quickly dropped after a rash of complaints.

“We got a lot of pushback from our customers and, most notably, from our team members,” the airline’s chief executive, Doug Parker, told investors on a conference call in July. “While we could convince ourselves that that might be able to produce somewhat higher revenues on the aircraft, what it was doing to our perception with our team wasn’t worth it.”

The push to shrink the space between rows of seats comes as major carriers are squeezing 10 abreast in more long-haul jets, so that the middle section has four seats — and, by definition, two middle seats — rather than three.

But customers will be spared this experience on most flights within the United States, Mr. Aboulafia said, because there just isn’t enough space. “The good news is that pretty much every domestic flight you’re going to take is going to be in a 737 or A320 — no way can you do four-three,” he said.

Traditional airline seats were fashioned out of rigid aluminum frames, then wrapped in thick foam padding. But that approach, said Alex Pozzi, vice president for research and development in interior systems for Rockwell Collins, a manufacturer of aircraft seats, is no longer used, with the availability of more sophisticated, high-tech materials.

“We’ve been using a lot of advanced materials, a lot of composite materials, to allow the actual physical structure to get smaller,” he said. “We’ve also removed a lot of the hard points in the seat and gone to fabric suspension systems,” leading, he said, to seats more akin to ergonomic desk chairs.

“The less size that the seat structure itself takes up, the more space that’s left over for the passenger,” Mr. Pozzi said.

Or, as the case may be, for more passengers. “Over the last five years, as slimline seats become more common and were adopted by more airlines, airlines took the opportunity to basically take the space they were saving and, depending on the airline, most of the airlines took that space and added in an extra row or two,” said Jami Counter, vice president of TripAdvisor Flights, which owns the site SeatGuru.com. “The actual pitch would shrink, but theoretically, your leg room wouldn’t.”

“Now,” he added, “you’re cramming another person in there so you still have more people in that exact same space. It becomes a much more unpleasant flying experience.”

On American Airlines’ new 737s, which will be put into service beginning soon, seats have a minimum 30-inch pitch, although American says most seats have 31 inches. Seatback TV screens were eliminated and replaced with brackets that passengers can use to mount their own devices to watch video, and power sources to keep those devices running. The magazine holder is now closer to the top of the seatback to free up more knee room.

“Those seats are designed to make the best possible use of the space,” an American spokesman, Josh Freed, said.

Airlines contend that improved ergonomics and, in some cases, slightly wider seats make up for a tighter pitch. A spokesman for Spirit Airlines, Paul Berry, said the emphasis on pitch was an inaccurate way to assess today’s newer seat designs.

“If you just go by inches, it’s kind of an old measure. We’re kind of basing it on comfort level and the way we’ve engineered our seats,” he said. “While it’s only 28 inches in pitch, it actually feels like it’s about 30 inches,” he said.

But some consumer advocates say the issue goes beyond comfort. One group, Flyers Rights, is petitioning the Federal Aviation Administration to set minimum dimensions for airline seat width and pitch. The group won a round in its court battle with the F.A.A. in July, when a Federal District Court told the agency to address what it referred to as “the incredible shrinking airline seat.”

Paul Hudson, president of Flyers Rights, said the need for seat regulation is driven by safety concerns. Passengers have been getting taller and wider, even as airlines push for slimmer seats, but regulations still stipulate that planes have to be able to be evacuated in just a minute and a half.

“Obviously, if you’re squeezed into a very confined space, it’s going to be harder to get up and get out in an emergency,” Mr. Hudson said.

“The seats were originally designed for people, for men who averaged about 5 foot 10 inches and 170 pounds,” he said. “Right now, the average man is just under 200 pounds.”

The airline industry contends that further regulation is unnecessary. Carriers referred questions to the trade group Airlines for America, which responded with an emailed statement that read, in part, “All U.S. carriers meet or exceed federal safety standards and we continue to believe that there is no need for government to interfere.”

But some air travel professionals contend that advocates like Flyers Rights may have a point in arguing that tightly packed seats may be an impediment to evacuations.

“It won’t be necessarily a passenger comfort regulation, but more around safety,” Mr. Counter said.

Mr. Harteveldt agreed. “There may be a legitimate issue around safety,” he said. “That’s why we’re now starting to see this topic bubble up.”",Air Travelers Resisting the ‘Incredible Shrinking Airline Seat’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/business/airline-seat.html

The other priests listed were Joseph P. Byrns, who served from 1969 to 2002; William E. Finger, who served from 1962 to 1980; Stephen Placa, who served from 1995 to 2002; Thomas O.

Mr. Mangini declined to comment; the other six could not be reached.

Those seven priests represent a fraction of the Brooklyn and Queens clergy implicated in the 233 claims before the compensation program, which is awarding settlements to victims who agree to drop further action against the diocese. A website that tracks abuse allegations against priests, Bishopaccountablity.org, list 55 priests as accused abusers in the diocese since the 1930s, but the total number is unknown.

Victims of Father Lara, who served in Brooklyn for 19 years, and victim advocates said on Thursday that while they were glad that his name was being publicized, they felt it was too little too late.

“There is no excuse for a supposedly moral institution to wait 25 years to release a pedophile priest's name,” said Mitchell Garabedian, a lawyer portrayed in the Oscar-winning film “Spotlight,” about clergy sexual abuse. He is representing three people who claim they were abused by Mr. Lara between the ages of 9 and 11. “Because of the church’s immoral behavior, dozens, if not hundreds, of children have probably been sexually abused by Father Lara, and their lives have been destroyed and their families’ lives have been destroyed.”

Mr. Lara did not respond to a request for comment.

Thursday’s disclosure appears to be the first time the diocese has formally acknowledged the names of priests laicized for child sexual abuse. At least five people who say they were abused by Father Lara have applied for compensation.

Ricardo Gonzalez, 48, who has received compensation, said in an interview on Thursday that he was around 11 years old when Father Lara began to abuse him.

But little by little, in a process common to child sexual abusers known as grooming, Father Lara became intimate with Mr. Gonzalez. ""He wanted me to kiss him, he would get on top of me, he would say you can do better than that,” he said, remembering the terror he felt when invited to the rectory. “He would make me touch him in his private parts.”

As the abuse continued, Mr. Gonzalez, who is now a hairdresser, dropped out of high school and at one point attempted suicide, he said. As an adult, he has tried to track down Mr. Lara, and called institutions that had hired him to tell his story. But he felt he was never believed.

“I want everyone to know who he is,” he said. “I want him to lose his job, I want him to not have a drink of water. He ruined the little belief that I have. He is a very, very horrible person.”

Another victim, who asked to be referred to by his middle name, Armando, to protect his identity, noted that Mr. Lara favored Hispanic boys. He recalled how Father Lara seemed to always be around at St. Francis Xavier in Park Slope, as chaplain of the Boy Scouts and head of the altar boys.

He said he was abused from age 11 until he started college. Once, Father Lara bought him a sweatshirt from a trip to Scotland, he recalled, and asked him to strip naked before allowing him to put it on.

“I spent my life, not remembering,” Armando, 52, said. “I thought, I’m lucky, it didn’t impact me, God must have blessed me.” But three years ago, he said, the memories caught up with him, and his life began to fall apart. “I was just able to hold off a little longer,” he said.

Victims and their advocates had been tailing Mr. Lara for years. Robert M. Hoatson, a former priest who helps victims, said that he wrote to the University of Notre Dame around 2012 to warn it about Mr. Lara, who was a visiting professor at the time.

But then he went to at Arizona State University in Tempe as a research professor in the Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies. He continued to publish articles and books, and serve on the board of directors of the Society for the Arts in Religious and Theological Studies.

On Thursday, Arizona State University said that in response to the diocese’s revelation, it had asked Mr. Lara for his resignation and that he had given it.",Brooklyn Diocese Names 8 Priests Who Sexually Abused Children,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/nyregion/brooklyn-diocese-priests-sexual-abuse.html

Gotham West is one of a handful of expensive rental buildings offering excursions as the latest perk. Common, a developer of co-living housing, led New York City residents to a sleep-away camp near Lake George a few times this year. At 525 West 52nd Street, another Hell’s Kitchen rental, residents visited Storm King Art Center in Cornwall, N.Y., in September. And the Eugene, a rental near Hudson Yards, also took its residents apple picking last month.

In a sluggish rental market where renters at the top have oodles of options, the thinking goes: Shower existing tenants with unusual perks and maybe a new one will sign a lease. Post pictures of the events on social media, and prospective renters, particularly those who are new to the city and looking for friends, might take notice.

Such offerings are also a relatively inexpensive investment compared to a permanent fixture like a pet spa or an indoor pool. A field trip does not occupy valuable square footage, nor does it require expensive equipment.

On a dewy Saturday morning in October, Michael Borth, 43, a Broadway musician who went on the Warwick trip, stood in front of a row of Empire apple trees and described Gotham West as “by far the most social building I’ve ever lived in.” He shares a studio apartment there with his girlfriend, Deborah Avery, 43, also a Broadway musician.

Ms. Avery said that she was a Girl Scout the last time she went apple picking. “There are many buildings where I’ve lived next to people and never talked to them,” said Mr. Borth, who grew up in Wichita, Kan. Apparently, that’s not a good thing. “It’s very strange.”

I get that avoiding the neighbors might seem strange to some people, but do you really want the alternative? Get too chummy, and you could end up with a neighbor like Kramer from “Seinfeld,” who barges in unannounced. I grew up in California, a state where strangers are always striking up conversations. That’s why I left and moved to New York.

Even so, do you really make friends on a field trip for grown-ups? Maybe it’s just a good way to make the most of that hefty $700 amenity fee and get enough apples for a pie.

Residents said the morning ride up to Warwick was quiet as riders nursed their coffees and got a few more minutes of sleep before they disembarked. When the bus arrived around 10 a.m., the group quickly fanned out, couples breaking off together and single tenants wandering alone. Within minutes, everyone had dispersed.

Sign up for the outing without a plus-one and there was a good chance you would stay that way all day. As other orchard visitors meandered past me, clutching sticky children and heavy bags of fruit, I smiled weakly. They had no way of knowing that I had come with a group. I imagined them thinking: What grown-up goes apple picking alone?

Ruth Whippman, the author of “America the Anxious: How Our Pursuit of Happiness Is Creating a Nation of Nervous Wrecks,” likened the outing to the corporate retreat where you go bowling with the group from accounting. “Sometimes that can feel quite forced,” she said.

Yet, people are desperately seeking ways to look up from their iPhones and strike up a real-life conversation — at least 20 percent of Americans suffer from loneliness and social isolation, Ms. Whippman said. “There is a really big need for people to have new kinds of social opportunities,” she said.

But one that is choreographed might not produce the result management wants. “It’s so hard to know whether any social occasion will be a great party or whether it will be intrinsically awful where someone’s crying into their bag of apples,” she said.

The goal of these activities might be to “provide lifestyle enhancement opportunities,” as Christopher Jaskiewicz, the chief operating officer of the Gotham Organization, the developer of Gotham West, told me.

Even so, as enhancing as the day trip might be, people may not actually make friends. At best, you make some small talk until you go home. At worst, you get stuck sitting next to someone you really don’t like.

Melissa, a 38-year-old playwright who lives in a one-bedroom in Gotham West, had doubts about the trip, but she signed up anyway. “I was a little apprehensive,” she said, cradling an enormous bag of apples as we walked. Melissa asked to withhold her last name because she did not want anyone knowing where she lived. “I was worried that I would be picking apples with couples,” she said.

Instead, she spent the morning wandering the orchard alone, gathering fruit. “I got lost and I loved it,” she said. Other single day-trippers I encountered also spent much of the day on their own. While we were chatting, Melissa bumped into a cheerful woman from the building who had also come on her own. They traded pleasantries and went back to foraging for fruit.

As I bit into a crisp Winesap, I asked Melissa what she thought of other Gotham West mixers. Many of the events were geared toward singles, she said. But just because someone signed a lease to live in the same apartment complex does not mean you have anything more than that in common. “They want these events for people to meet other people,” she said. “But if you’re on your own, you just go off by yourself.”

In his book “Active Faith: How Christians Are Changing the Soul of American Politics,” former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed described 1989, the year the group was founded, as a dark one for religious conservatives. The once-powerful televangelists Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker were discredited by lurid scandals. In Virginia and New Jersey, anti-abortion Republican candidates lost gubernatorial races to pro-choice Democrats. “The number of conservative votes in Congress dwindled to barely enough to sustain President Bush’s abortion vetoes,” Reed wrote. The movement that had been so formidable at the start of the decade “seemed dead, and cultural elites danced on its grave.”

Seeking resurrection, the religious right turned to local politics, investing in the bench of the Republican Party. “We are training people to be effective — to be elected to school boards, to city councils, to state legislatures and to key positions in political parties,” Pat Robertson wrote in a 1991 Christian Coalition fund-raising letter. The next year, Sarah Palin would get her start by winning a seat on the Wasilla City Council, part of a wave of evangelicals pouring into local politics.

If there is one threadlike silver lining to Donald Trump’s election last year, it’s that it has forced the left to emulate the Christian right’s extremely successful strategy for building political power. For decades, Democrats have paid far less attention to local politics than Republicans. That’s part of the reason the party lost almost a thousand state legislative seats — there are 7383 in total — over the course of Barack Obama’s presidency. But in the last year, citizens nationwide — particularly women and people of color — who were horrified by Trump’s victory have decided to run for office in their own communities. And on Tuesday, many of them won.

The most important Democratic victory on Tuesday was that of Gov.-elect Ralph Northam in Virginia. But there were countless down-ballot triumphs across the country, some of which had a cinematic sweetness. In New Jersey, a 32-year-old named Ashley Bennett was disgusted when John Carman, a Republican county official, posted a Facebook meme that said, “Will the woman’s protest be over in time for them to cook dinner?” Though Bennett told me she never before thought of running for office, she decided to challenge Carman, and won. In Virginia, a 33-year-old trans woman named Danica Roem defeated a Republican state legislator who’d introduced a so-called “bathroom bill.” Crystal Murillo, a 23-year-old Mexican-American in Aurora, Colo., who was gutted by Trump’s election, unseated her Trump-supporting city councilwoman.

For the past year, the Democratic Party has been engaged in an angry internal debate over identity politics, which are often framed in opposition to a purely class-based appeal. At times, it feels like progressives are doomed to re-litigate the 2016 Democratic primary forever, tearing each other apart while Trump tears down the republic. But if you squint at Tuesday’s results, you can sort of see a synthesis emerging between Obama and Hillary Clinton’s theory of the emerging Democratic electorate — in which Democrats win by appealing to a coalition of white professionals and minorities — and Bernie Sanders’s focus on grass-roots organizing and economic populism.

In some ways the election was the revenge of the Obama coalition. Educated white liberals joined people of color to elect an amazingly diverse group of candidates. A Latina single mother, Michelle De La Isla, was elected mayor of Topeka, Kan. Wilmot Collins, a refugee from Liberia, won the mayoral race in Helena, Mont. Seattle elected its first lesbian mayor, Jenny Durkan.

At a July convention in Denver that brought together about three dozen local legislators, Bruce Hollands, executive director of the plastic pipe industry group Uni-Bell PVC Pipe Association, discussed what had gone wrong in Flint, and explained what needed to be done to open up local bidding for plastic water pipes. To spur local decision-making, the A.C.C.E. has also adopted model legislation pushing for more open bidding for water pipes.

“We’re just trying to take up policies that limit the size of government, that keep it from growing exponentially,” said Jon Russell, national director of the A.C.C.E. and a councilman from the town of Culpeper, Va.

Plastics are an obvious replacement for the country’s aging pipes. Lightweight, easy to install, corrosion-free and up to 50 percent cheaper than iron, plastic pipes have already taken the place of copper as the preferred material for service lines that connect homes to municipal mains, as well as water pipes inside the home.

Still, some scientists warn that the rapid replacement of America’s water infrastructure with plastic could bring its own health concerns.

Scientists are just starting to understand the effect of plastic on the quality and safety of drinking water, including what sort of chemicals can leach into the water from the pipes themselves, or from surrounding groundwater contamination. Studies have shown that toxic pollutants like benzene and toluene from spills and contaminated soil can permeate certain types of plastic pipes as they age. A 2013 review of research on leaching from plastic pipe identified more than 150 contaminants migrating from plastic pipes into drinking water.

“Plastics are being installed without any real understanding of what they’re doing to our drinking water,” said Andrew J. Whelton, assistant professor of civil engineering at Purdue University, and an author of the 2013 study. “We don’t know what chemicals we’re being exposed to.”

Sensing an opening, the iron pipe industry has started a public relations push of its own, voicing concerns over plastic, wooing President Trump with accolades for his infrastructure drive and setting up a war between the two industries.

“Iron is just more durable. It’s a more proven material,” said Patrick Hogan, president of the Ductile Iron Pipe Research Association, the industry’s main lobby group. “Iron’s been in the ground for 100 years.”

Plastic groups have criticized the studies, saying they focus on older generations of plastic piping and conflate different types of plastics. They also stress that their pipes are independently tested by the third-party organization.

“It’s not a new material. It’s a safe material. It’s independently tested,” said Mr. Hollands, executive director of the Uni-Bell plastic pipes group.

The industry outreach, at times, has been more overt.

At the height of Flint’s water crisis, the chief executive of one of the nation’s largest manufacturers of plastic pipes, JM Eagle, traveled to the beleaguered city and offered to replace the city’s lead pipes at no cost.

Pipes from JM Eagle would last 100 years and are a long-lasting and safe solution, the company’s chief executive, Walter Wang, told the City Council last February. “This water crisis, this contamination issue,” he said, “it’s hurting children and making them sick.”

JM Eagle, however, has faced recent legal problems. In 2013, a federal jury in California found that the Los Angeles-based company had defrauded states and municipalities for more than a decade by knowingly selling defective water pipes. In some places, PVC pipes that were supposed to last 50 years exploded in their first year, causing injuries and flooding.

JM Eagle declined to comment but has previously said the litigation was based on “scurrilous allegations” by a disgruntled former employee. Formosa Plastics, a Taiwanese industrial conglomerate that was its parent company at the time, agreed to pay $22.5 million in a settlement with municipalities and other government agencies in California.

The uncertainty over potable water pipes of all kinds is exacerbated by a lack of regulation over their safety. There is no federal oversight of the materials or processes used to manufacture plastic water pipes; instead, water pipes are certified and tested by an organization paid for by industry.

That organization, NSF International, displays a picture of the Capitol building on its regulatory resources web page and runs a hotline for questions on regulations and product safety. Yet it has never received regulatory authority from the federal government. Nor does it disclose test results for the pipes it certifies.

NSF International called its testing robust. “If a product does not meet the requirements of a standard, it will not pass,” said Dave Purkiss, the organization’s general manager of water systems.

For now, Flint is fitting the city with service lines made with another material: copper, at an expected cost of more than $140 million. Officials discussed creating a pilot area using plastic to replace the service lines to houses on several city blocks, according to Plastics News, though a Flint spokeswoman, Kristin Moore, said plastic pipes were not currently under consideration.

“When you take that inherent issue that we needed to rebuild trust of the citizens in the water system, we felt that copper was the way to go,” Michael McDaniel, a retired Michigan National Guard brigadier general put in charge of replacing Flint’s water pipes, said at a conference this year.

In Burton, just next door to Flint, budget realities have made plastics the realistic choice.

The small city of 29,000 saved $2.2 million by using plastic to replace its own 1930s-era water system after state regulators alerted the city to critically needed fixes. For a municipality struggling with a dwindling tax base, those savings were huge.

“We needed safe water, and we needed it fast. We needed to replace the system, and PVC was a good choice for us,” said Burton’s mayor, Paula Zelenko. “I’ve got to get the best bang for the buck, because bucks are hard to come by these days.”",$300 Billion War Beneath the Street: Fighting to Replace America’s Water Pipes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/climate/water-pipes-plastic-lead.html

What he saw there, he said in an interview, was denim done the right way — not mass-produced on modern looms (although the plant has plenty of those too), but painstakingly made on clanking 1940s American Draper X3 shuttle looms that churn out denim featuring a tighter weave, more interesting textures and of course, the de rigueur selvage stitching on the inside seam that jeans lovers proudly reveal by rolling their cuffs.

Personality comes at a cost — apparently to the company, for starters. A company spokeswoman cited the usual factors — changing market demands and foreign competition — as reasons it plans to close the plant, even though it was once the world’s largest, and long supplied the denim for Levi’s iconic 501 jeans.

Personality, it must be said, also comes at a cost to consumers. A pair of Tellason’s John Graham Mellor jeans, for instance, featuring White Oak denim and oozing with street cred (John Mellor is the real name of the Clash’s Joe Strummer, in case you need to be told), sells for $230.

For much of the past decade, that’s a cost that the cool kids apparently were happy to bear, which accounts for the explosion of retro-inflected denim brands (Tellason, Raleigh Denim, Taylor Stitch and Buck Mason, to name just a few) that used White Oak denim as a pillar of their branding.

It’s not 2006 anymore, however. Hipsterism is dead (or is it just ubiquitous?), the economy is iffy, and the cheap, disposable ethos of fast fashion has made its mark. That makes it tough when you’re in the slow fashion business.

Too many consumers “simultaneously complain about imported products, job loss and low wages, and then buy their jeans at Costco, with the same brand name as the bacon, toilet paper and dish soap in their cart,” said Tony Patella, a founder of Tellason, based in San Francisco, in a reference to Costco’s Kirkland brand.

Even before Cone Mills made its announcement, however, some premium indie brands that once prominently displayed the “Made in the U.S.A.” label were starting to embrace a new globalism. The New York brands Unis New York and Outlier now produce much of their clothing in Portugal.

“Italian quality at Chinese prices,” explained Brad Bennett, who runs the men’s wear site Well Spent.

And founders of Tellason, Buck Mason and Taylor Stitch all said in interviews that they planned to look to Japan for their denim, once their Cone supply runs out.

This is hardly surprising. America may have invented bluejeans, but Japan turned them into a religion. Ultra-premium Japanese brands like Iron Heart and the Flat Head have reverse-engineered the all-American Brando-biker-rebel aesthetic to such a convincing degree that they might as well be sewn in Milwaukee, alongside the Harley-Davidson plant.

Even clothiers that seemed eager to wave the flag are suddenly sounding like globalists.

“As much as the Trump administration is touting ‘America First,’ we believe we live in a global world, and provenance is becoming less important,” said Michael Maher, a founder of Taylor Stitch, which is based in San Francisco.

So much for the days when tattooed Brooklyn web designers and rifle-toting Montana ranchers seemingly stood arm in arm, united by their common love of Filson bags, Red Wing boots and White Oak denim. While virtually everyone says they want to keep jobs in the United States, “Made in the USA” has also become politicized, since the Trump administration attempted to seize the “Buy American” impulse for itself.

Maybe jeans enthusiasts simply have other stuff on their plates to think about.

“Considering just how bad the news has been lately, the Cone Mills closing is easy to feel unfazed by — or, at least, to lose in the fray,” said Mr. Bennett of Well Spent. “That’s not to say it’s not still a colossal bummer.

“She converted her passion for the canyon into fiery opposition to the Glen Canyon Dam,” Mr. Balken said in a telephone interview. “She conveyed the canyon’s beauty and essence to so many people nationwide.”

She was often referred to as “the Desert Goddess of Glen Canyon.”

Once the dam was built, she did not return to Glen Canyon. The loss was too great.

“What’s left of my rivers, what’s left of me,” she said when she was 96. “We’re probably going to go together.”

Kathryn Louise Lee was born on Oct. 23, 1919, in Aledo, Ill. Her family moved to Tucson when she was three months old, and she grew up loving the desert. Her father, Zanna, was an architect and homebuilder; her mother, the former Ruth Detwiler, was a decorator. Her mother pushed her to play the piano. Her father taught her to hunt rabbit and quail with a Remington shotgun.

Earning the lead in a high school play called “The Patsy” made her feel as if the stage were her living room. “Wow! This is where I belong!” she recalled thinking in 2008 in an oral history interview for the Cline Library at Northern Arizona University. “I knew every line of the play, I knew exactly what to do, and I was fine.”

That early acting experience led her to study drama at the University of Arizona. She went on to have a modest career as an actress that included roles on radio shows like “The Great Gildersleeve” and “The Railroad Hour,” a music series starring the singer Gordon MacRae.

She found greater acclaim as a folk singer, developing friendships with stars like Burl Ives, Josh White and Ramblin’ Jack Elliott. Mr. Ives praised her once by saying, “The best cowboy singer I know is a girl — Katie Lee.” Her repertoire was traditional for folk singers in the 1950s: songs about outlaws and murder, love and hate, cowboys, labor, poverty, injustice and politics.

But the planning for the dam on Glen Canyon gave her a particularly strong motivatation to sing.

“My river was about to be unjustly dammed … politically dammed,” she wrote in “All My Rivers Are Gone” (1998), one of several books she wrote about Glen Canyon. “Songs about my river! Songs of protest! Folk songs. Holy Mother!”

She added: “I had a cause! A cause that didn’t center on me-me-me: one that asked nothing of me, really, yet was far from mute. I’d never had a cause before, but now there was a place, almost a person, that needed my help.”

She did not sing only folk or protest songs. She recorded humorous songs about psychoanalysis on the 1957 album “Songs of Couch and Consultation.” With lyrics by the jazz saxophonist Bud Freeman and music by Leon Prober, the album became a hit in England and the songs became a popular element of her act. She had initially rejected Mr. Freeman’s suggestion that she record the songs but reconsidered after listening to his demo tapes on her way back from a trip to the Colorado River.

“The tunes were catchy,” she told The Arizona Republic in 1960, “so I thought, `Why not?’ ”

In “Stay as Sick as You Are,” she sang:

I love your streak of cruelty

Your psychopathic lies

The homicidal tendencies

Shining in your eyes.

She continued to sing about cowboys, rivers and canyons. She recorded the album “Love’s Little Sisters” in 1975 at a studio on the ranch owned by the Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart in Novato, Calif. At the time, Mr. Hart was living and working with Jerilyn Lee Brandelius, Ms. Lee’s stepdaughter.

Last month, at a party for her 98th birthday, Ms. Lee performed her composition “Song of the Boatman.” Holding a birthday card, she sang:

Today I know your magic call

Will lead me back to the canyon wall.

And the music in your rapids roar

Make this boatman’s song from his soul outpour.

In addition to Ms. Brandelius, Ms. Lee is survived by her son, Ronald Eld; another stepdaughter, Susie Brandelius; and two stepsons, Ken and John Brandelius.

Her longtime partner, Joey Van Leeuwen, whom she met on a trip to Australia in 1979, committed suicide one day after her death, Ms. Williamson said. Mr. Van Leeuwen, who filled their house with his wood carvings of birds, worried about what would happen to him if Ms. Lee died first. In “Kickass Katie Lee,” he said, “I would have a terrible life on my own.”

Ms. Lee was married at least twice. She was divorced from Eugene Busch Jr., a businessman, and became a widow after the death of Edwin C. Brandelius Jr., a racecar driver and track announcer.

Ms. Lee recalled in “All My Rivers Are Gone” that while on a trip to Glen Canyon in 1957, a year after the first dynamite blast that initiated construction of the dam, she took a break from lunch, stared at the river and talked to the water.

There’s no magic formula for getting into a selective college, but over a decade covering admissions for The Chronicle of Higher Education, I’ve picked up a thing or two. These takeaways, based on hundreds of interviews with admissions deans over the years, may help you navigate the process.

Admissions decisions aren’t all about you.

When colleges choose applicants, they’re juggling competing goals, like increasing diversity and bringing in more revenue. Admissions officers aren’t looking for students who fit just one description — say, those who’ve earned all A’s or won the most awards. So don’t take rejection personally.

Grades and test scores still carry the most weight.

Colleges often say they want to get to know the real you, but that’s probably true only if your academic accomplishments (and the rigor of courses you’ve taken) pass muster.

You’re more than a number.

After colleges identify a big batch of students with outstanding credentials, differences among them become more important, admissions deans say. Among some of the attributes they tell me they would like to see evidence of (in essays, extracurricular activities, recommendations) are: leadership, risk taking, emotional intelligence, fire for learning, critical thinking, curiosity, empathy, optimism, grit, perseverance and the ability to overcome obstacles.

Express your authentic self.

Overwhelmed by slick, boastful essays, colleges are eager for what they call “authentic” glimpses of applicants — their experiences, passions and goals. Some deans believe they’ll get deeper insight through alternative formats like videos, pictures, audio files or documents (an Advanced Placement English paper, maybe). A handful of prestigious schools, including Yale, the University of Chicago, Pomona College, Reed College and the University of Rochester, recently introduced this option. As with essays, too much polish is no good, deans say, so you might think twice about hiring a professional videographer. At Yale, about 400 applicants (out of nearly 33,000) for this year’s freshman class sent in something in an alternative format. In at least one case, the submission — a video showing leadership and impact on others — was, the dean told me, a “difference maker.”",10 Things to Know About Getting Into Your Dream College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/education/edlife/admissions-tips-on-getting-into-dream-college.html

According to lawyers from across the New York region, in at least 33 other cases, unusually long Postal Service delays resulted in rejections of DACA applications, throwing the lives of their clients into frantic limbo. Lawyers in Boston and Philadelphia, which also send their applications to the Chicago processing center, say they have not seen evidence of an issue with the mail.

But in Chicago, in the backyard of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency, there were at least 41 DACA recipients whose renewals, sent well before the deadline, arrived late, advocates said. According to Representative Luis V. Gutiérrez, Democrat of Illinois, an applicant sent a renewal on Sept. 13 and it arrived on Oct. 6. Another sent the paperwork on Sept. 21, and it was received on Oct. 9. “Because somebody else did not do their job correctly we are taking innocent young immigrants and making them deportable,” said Mr. Gutiérrez in a statement. “That is unacceptable.”

On Thursday, in a rare admission from a federal agency, the U.S. Postal Service took the blame. David A. Partenheimer, a spokesman for the post office, said there had been an “unintentional temporary mail processing delay in the Chicago area.”

But the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency said nothing more could be done; the decisions were final.

“According to U.S.C.I.S. regulations, a request is considered received by U.S.C.I.S. as of the actual date of receipt at the location for filing such request,” Steve Blando, a spokesman for the agency, wrote in a statement. He added: “U.S.C.I.S. is not responsible for the mail service an individual chooses, or for delays on the part of mail service providers.”

He later added, though, that “U.S.C.I.S. is committed to working with the U.S.P.S. to understand and address the U.S.P.S. error that occurred that delayed the mail.”

Because DACA is an executive order, signed by President Barack Obama in 2012, and not a statute, applicants cannot appeal the decision. Still, immigrants and their advocates viewed the agency’s unwillingness to revisit their applications as harsh and unfair.

“You can’t put the burden on the applicant to ensure the government agencies did their job,” said Camille Mackler, the director of legal initiatives for the New York Immigration Coalition. “Can you imagine if the I.R.S. didn’t pick up their mail for two weeks and you get a penalty because of it?”

The DACA program had offered temporary protection and work permits for about 800,000 young adults who had been brought to the United States illegally as children.

On Sept. 5, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced after months of speculation that the Trump administration was canceling the program. Recipients were allowed to keep their permits until they expired at the end of the current two-year term. The administration also offered a brief renewal window for recipients whose permits were expiring before March 5, which set off a scramble across the country from legal service providers to assist applicants.

There are three U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services intake locations, known as lockboxes, in the United States: in Phoenix, Chicago and Lewisville, Tex., a suburb of Dallas.

According to the immigration agency, its employees do not pick up the mail from the lockbox. The United States Department of the Treasury manages the process but uses a courier service that picks up the mail from post offices each morning. Express Mail items, the agency said, are picked up in the afternoon. Also, items are delivered to the lockbox by the courier services FedEx, DHL and the United Parcel Service.

In a memo after DACA was rescinded, the Department of Homeland Security said renewals had to be “accepted” by Oct. 5. Immigration lawyers contrasted that with a permanent residency opportunity the government offered in 2001, when applications only had to be postmarked by the deadline of April 30. Acknowledging the high volume of applications, the government offered a grace period for paperwork to be received by May 3.","Post Office Fails to Deliver on Time, and DACA Applications Get Rejected",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/nyregion/post-office-mail-delays-daca-applications.html

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

The clue was “You might find one at a sawmill,” and the answer is LUMBERJACK, a 10 letter word, but the slot only has room for seven letters. How do you fill in the entire answer?

Entering a Rebus on the Web

Step 1: Select the square in which you want to enter a rebus. Click the Rebus button on the toolbar above the clue lists, or simply press Escape (Esc). This will open an expandable square in which you can type multiple characters. Step 2: Type in your answer and press Enter/Return, or click anywhere outside the field to close and save your rebus. To cancel your entry instead, press Escape.

Step 1: Click on the square in which you want to enter the rebus. Tap the “More” key on the bottom left-hand side of the screen. Step 2: Tap the “Rebus” key. This will open up a larger square in which you can type multiple letters. Step 3: Type in the letters and then tap anywhere inside the grid to close and save your rebus.

The process for entering a rebus on an Android device is the same as for the iOS process, except that on the Android app, the Ellipsis key [ ... ] on the lower left-hand side is used.

Today Danang’s beaches once again lure visitors, and a building frenzy of resorts has brought five-star luxury to one of the world’s five remaining Communist nations. Danang’s city planners fought hard to win rights to host the APEC forum, which will see the leaders of 21 economies in attendance, including President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Xi Jinping of China.

Signs of the warming relationship between the United States and Vietnam are in evidence down the coast from Danang, where an American aircraft carrier is scheduled to make a port call next year, most likely at Cam Ranh Bay, the naval base once used by the Americans.

“When we fight, we must use everything we have, the ancient jungle and the deep ocean, the rivers and the mountains and our bones and flesh,” said Dao Kim Long, a veteran of the American War who also fought the French as a 14-year-old guerrilla. “But when we shake hands, we can begin a friendship with all our heart.”

Vietnam’s tilt toward the United States owes much to the looming shadow of a far more enduring and challenging antagonist: China. Like many countries in the region, Vietnam is keen for an American counterweight to balance against the growing heft of China.

In May, the Vietnamese were given a United States Coast Guard cutter and six new patrol boats to defend the swath of the South China Sea that Hanoi considers its own. Beijing, which has more aggressively asserted that nearly the entire waterway is its own, has clashed repeatedly with Vietnam over competing claims.

There are still notable policy differences. The United States ranks as the top destination for Vietnamese exports, and Hanoi was particularly disappointed when Mr. Trump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, which would have given Vietnam better access to its No. 1 market.

Trade is expected to be a major topic during the meetings Mr. Trump will hold with Tran Dai Quang, his Vietnamese counterpart, on Saturday in Hanoi.

“Vietnamese officials are waiting to see if, during Trump’s bilateral meetings, he stays focused on America First or if he raises more substantive suggestions about how the two countries can engage economically,” said Murray Hiebert, a senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

Photo

During his May meeting with Mr. Phuc, Mr. Trump refrained from censuring Vietnam for its mounting crackdown on dissent, which has resulted in the arrests of dozens of bloggers, religious leaders and activists.

In a Nov. 7 letter, 20 members of the House of Representatives, from both parties, called for Mr. Trump to raise “Vietnam’s dismal human rights record” when he sees Mr. Quang on Saturday.

Five decades ago, Mr. Trump was exempted from military service during the Vietnam War with a bone spur diagnosis. On Friday, in between events at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Mr. Trump met with American veterans of the Vietnam war and signed a proclamation commemorating the conflict’s 50th anniversary.

“Each of you, under the most difficult conditions, did what you had to do, and you did it well,” Mr. Trump told the veterans. “They’re brave, they’re strong, they’re great patriots, and we just want to thank you and all of the thousands and thousands, and all of the people that served with you and in all of the other wars.”

He said his administration was working to secure the return of 1,253 veterans still missing in Vietnam and that it “will not rest” until they are brought home.

The president’s first contact with Vietnam was on land contaminated by the United States military half a century ago.

Danang’s airport is on the site of an old American air base where barrels of the defoliant Agent Orange were once stored and mixed. Dioxin, a toxic contaminant, seeped into the ground and nearby water sources.

Since then, families living in the area have experienced higher rates of children with birth defects, most of which render them severely disabled. Nationwide, the Vietnamese Red Cross estimates that three million Vietnamese have been damaged by dioxin poisoning, either from their parents’ exposure or from the polluted environments themselves.

After decades of rejecting any link between dioxin and a multitude of cancers, birth defects and other physical ailments, the United States government in 2007 started to address the health and environmental consequences of the toxic compound in Vietnam.

Five years later, the Americans began paying for the decontamination of the area around the Danang airport, where dioxin readings 365 times the safe level were found. By the middle of next year, the area should be entirely free of dioxin residue. (Efforts to fund further dioxin cleanups have caused budgetary wrangling between the State Department and the Pentagon.)

“Only a few years ago a large portion of the Danang airport was a toxic waste site that posed grave risks to human health,” said Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who has led the congressional effort to redress one of the world’s most persistent chemical assaults on the environment.

“Today it is a fully functioning airport for a city of 1.3 million people,” said Mr. Leahy, who visited Danang in 2014. “The fact that this very location is the site of the APEC summit, attended by the president of the United States, speaks volumes.”","In Danang, Vietnam, Trump Makes a Friendlier American Landing",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/world/asia/trump-apec-danang-vietnam-china.html

Song of the Wild: A First Book of Animals

By Nicola Davies. Illustrated by Petr Horacek.

Jellyfish, flamingoes, butterflies; pandas, zebras, vipers. This beautifully illustrated oversize compendium will be a treat for anyone who likes to look at and think about the staggering variety of animals on this planet. Davies (“King of the Sky”) has a degree in zoology and a clear passion for animal life. A brief verse on each spread is both awed and intimate — “The panda walks alone,” she writes, “and the reason for its color / we may never really know” — leaving ample space for Horacek’s vividly colored, painterly art.

Inky’s Great Escape: The Incredible (and Mostly True) Story of an Octopus Escape

By Casey Lyall. Illustrated by Sebastià Serra.

Few stories of animal escapades rival octopus escapes for mind-boggling fun. Lyall embellishes wildly on the story of Inky, who broke out of a New Zealand aquarium in 2016. This Inky is a raconteur and a patient opportunist who escapes on a dare from his tankmate, Blotchy. Inky’s physical feats are, of course, incredible: He makes himself “flat as a piece of seaweed,” then coils his body into a rope, slipping down the drain and out to the ocean. With Technicolor flair, Serra’s madcap cartoony illustrations rev up the story even more.

Written and illustrated by Matt Tavares.

Red and Lulu, a devoted pair of cardinals, live year-round in a giant pine tree overlooking the snug house of a family of humans. But the tree is chopped down and strapped to a truck, with Lulu in its branches. Red’s journey to find his mate makes for gorgeous sweeping vistas and heightened emotion, especially when he finds her in the illuminated branches of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. Tavares (“Crossing Niagara”) lets the holiday note waft lightly, bringing equal cheer to the celebration of pair-bonding and New York City.

“Saudi Arabia should pay for our therapy,” Karim Traboulsi, an editor at the news site The New Arab, wrote in a post on Facebook.","The backdrop to the crisis was a series of steps by Saudi Arabia in recent days to confront its ascendant regional rival, Iran, and the surprise arrests of about 200 Saudis, including 11 princes, in what the government describes as an anti-corruption campaign but which critics see as a consolidation of power by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.

Lebanon had already been drawn into the crisis in two ways: After a rocket was fired from Yemen at the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Saturday, Saudi officials accused Hezbollah and Iran of aiding in the attack. And they declared that the attack amounted to a declaration of war by Lebanon, a leap given that the weak Lebanese state does not control Hezbollah.

At the same time, the Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, unexpectedly flew to Riyadh and declared his resignation there on Saturday. Suspicions were growing among officials and diplomats in Beirut on Thursday that he had not only been pressured to do so by Saudi Arabia but was being held there against his will.

Despite the worries, analysts, officials and diplomats said that although they were not privy to the thinking of the Saudi crown prince, it was far-fetched that Saudi Arabia would launch a military action against Lebanon, since it is already overstretched in a war it started two years ago against Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen.

And Saudi Arabia has expressed displeasure with Lebanon this way before: This was at least the fourth time in five years that it asked its citizens to leave Lebanon.

But even before the current crisis, fears were building in Lebanon that Israel — which shares Saudi Arabia’s goal of rolling back Iranian power — would instigate another war against Hezbollah to curtail the increased power, influence and weaponry the Lebanese group has accumulated while playing a decisive role in the war in neighboring Syria.

Several Israeli officials seized on Mr. Hariri’s resignation — which he attributed to Iranian interference — as proof that Hezbollah, Iran and the Lebanese government were one and the same. That has fueled anxiety even as both Israel and Hezbollah insist that while they are prepared for a war, they do not want one now.

“I don’t think we’re on the brink of war, but it certainly constitutes an escalation,” said Andrew Exum, a former top Middle East policy official at the Pentagon, said in a telephone interview.

The question was whether heightened tensions would start one anyway.

Israeli officials, while cheering Prince Mohammed’s tough line on Iran, said they were uncertain that the crown prince was experienced or adroit enough to avoid setting off a broader regional conflict, perhaps one that could drag Israel in.

“Israel has two objectives: to stop Iran’s path towards dominance and hegemony in the region, and to create an alliance of the rational players in the region that would include Israel,” said Naftali Bennett, the Israeli minister of education and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet. “That is certainly a positive development to have such an alignment. At the same time, we have to be very cautious to prevent an unnecessary escalation in the region.”

Daniel B. Shapiro, a former United States ambassador to Israel, said more bluntly that it was one thing for Israel to see eye to eye with Saudi Arabia about who their adversaries were, “but it’s another to let a young, impulsive leader set the pace, when he won’t have to do all the fighting.”

Adding to the confusion, no one professes to understand Saudi Arabia’s logic or goals in Lebanon. Mr. Hariri’s resignation, apparently aimed at isolating Hezbollah, seemed likely only to strengthen it and its allies. It has humiliated Mr. Hariri, Saudi Arabia’s main ally in the country, created a potentially destabilizing political crisis in Lebanon and given Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, an opportunity to appear the elder statesman, calling for calm and declaring that Mr. Hariri is welcome back any time.

Some analysts suggested the Saudi escalation in Lebanon was less about making a dent in Hezbollah’s power and more a distraction from what appears to be a political purge at home and largely failed attempts to counter Iran in Syria and Yemen abroad. The developments fueled speculation that Prince Mohammed might be positioning himself to announce his accession to the throne.

“Maybe he felt he could score easier points in Lebanon and say internally, ‘Look, I’m being tough against Hezbollah,’ ” said Michael Young, a Lebanese analyst. “All this suggests to me that the arrival of King Mohammed is going to be sooner than later.”

Rather than war, analysts say Saudi Arabia’s next steps against Lebanon may be economic, like the boycott and blockade Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies are conducting against Qatar.

Saudi Arabi and its allies could expel Lebanese citizens, close air routes, cut off diplomatic relations and demand that Hezbollah be thrown out of government or forced to disarm, the political blogger Elias Muhanna wrote.

Those measures would be likely to hurt Hezbollah least, since unlike other parties and ordinary Lebanese, it can draw on extensive financial support from Iran.

But none of that was reassuring to people in Lebanon, a country of about 6.2 million people that for most its history has been batted between regional and global powers, most recently between Saudi Arabia and Iran, that exploit its own internal divisions. The country survived a devastating war in 2006 when Hezbollah fought Israel to a draw.

Lebanon was transfixed all week by the question of why Mr. Hariri had not come back or spoken to journalists or even many of his political allies and advisers. Lebanese followed social media sites late Wednesday night tracking a flight from Riyadh that they thought he might be on. He wasn’t.

His political party, the Future Movement, stopped short of publicly agreeing with Hezbollah and its ally, President Michel Aoun, that Mr. Hariri was a hostage. But it issued a statement implying he was not operating under his own free will, referring to him as still being the prime minister.

His return “is necessary to restore dignity and respect to Lebanon,” the statement said, stressing its support for his leadership and vowing “to follow him in whatever he decides.”

Mr. Hariri, a dual citizen of Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, met the ambassadors of Britain and the European Union and the chargé d’affaires from the American Embassy on Wednesday and Thursday at his Riyadh residence. Other Western diplomats, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that those envoys, too, came away with the impression that he could not speak freely.

The American ambassador to Lebanon, Elizabeth Richards, posted photographs of a meeting with Lebanese Army officials and emphasized international support for the Lebanese government.

But President Trump in recent days has posted on Twitter messages of unspecified support for Saudi Arabia’s rulers, saying they “know exactly what they are doing.”

Lebanon tried to handle the stress with its customary mix of jitters and jadedness. People debated whether to stock up on canned food for a coming war, but also ratcheted up the black humor.

I was a typical beginner, even if I didn’t live in your typical neighborhood: This was the South Bronx during the era when arson and abandonment fueled by government dysfunction turned it into a globally-infamous and desolate urban landscape.

My spirit sometimes felt as broken as the sidewalks and buildings of my neighborhood on Fox Street, since I had grown disillusioned with art school and was floundering with my identity. I was a Puerto Rican and a New Yorker, but it was hard to reconcile those two identities. I struggled in New York because I wasn’t recognized as American. And when I moved to the island for a while, I wasn’t recognized as Puerto Rican, either.

Even in art school I sometimes wasn’t recognized as the one thing I had set out to be – a photographer. Luckily, one of my teachers who was familiar with my work suggested I meet a friend of hers, Mel Rosenthal, who taught photography at Empire State College.

Mel instantly liked what I was shooting, and it was fitting that we met at that time. While I was photographing the Longwood section of South Bronx, Mel was out making pictures on the streets of his youth a few miles north in the Bathgate neighborhood for images that would later be published as “In the South Bronx of America.”

Mel let me into his life, and I was alongside him when he took many of the pictures in his book. We made the connections between his youth as a Jewish man who returned to where he had grown up on the streets of the South Bronx and seeing how its current residents – my family and friends – had been disenfranchised. Mel introduced me to politics and taught me who the players were and how they were being exposed. There was the catalyst that got me thinking how I could use photography to change and document that.

Mel’s approach to documentary photography was shaped by his own strong belief in social justice, which led him back to his old neighborhood to document how its beleaguered residents confronted its decline, the impact of city policies of official neglect, or the guerilla ingenuity of Puerto Rico’s Villa Sin Miedo, a land rescue effort to provide affordable housing.

What was central in his work – and what he taught us – was that when people let you into their lives, your photographs can amplify their voices on the issues that mattered to them, despite the silence and indifference of the rest of the city and its power brokers. Under his guidance, I started making those connections between my neighborhood’s decline and the larger forces buffeting it, from political neglect and corruption to the greed of landlords who cut services and then abandoned their properties or hired people to torch them for insurance.

Photo

My work from that era was influenced by Mel’s lessons and his own example as a compassionate photographer on a mission. Sure, I took pictures of the fires, the abandoned buildings or skeletal cars dumped on the streets. But I also caught early B-Boys dancing at the Hunts Point Palace, kids playing on the streets and the other rhythms of life. And, sadly, I also have portraits of friends who would not survive much past their teenage years, their lives cut short by drugs, AIDS or guns.

I am but one of many young, socially aware photographers fortunate to have attended Mel’s seminal workshops where he introduced us to the world of documentary photography and photojournalism. The summer workshops were a six-week intensive course where some of the best photojournalists in the world shared their images of the issues of the time, from covering the wars in Central America to poverty in the middle America and around the world.

The students who attended those workshops fanned out throughout New York City covering the rise of AIDS and the birth of political activism in the gay and lesbian community, as well as protests against racism and police brutality that turned the streets of black and Latino communities into raging battlegrounds. There wasn’t a single week where there wasn’t a demonstration taking place and that was the real classroom where Mel’s students learned their craft.

Mel came into his own as a photographer during the social unrest of the 1960s. Maybe it’s not a coincidence that his former students are now photojournalists documenting very similar deep divisions that are consuming our country.

Mel died last week from the effects of Alzheimer’s, a disease that slowly and painfully took him from us. The best memorial we can give him is to continue the practice as he taught it.

In my boyhood I read Agatha Christie’s 1934 mystery novel “Murder on the Orient Express,” a copy of which was handed down to me by my mother, a mystery enthusiast. In my early teens I saw the then-grand movie adaptation, an all-star cast affair directed by Sidney Lumet and featuring Albert Finney as the finicky Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Christie’s novel derives much of its notoriety from the solution to its mystery. It’s very novel; whether it’s ingenious or just ostentatious is still debated by mystery lovers. But even more than 40 years after Mr. Lumet’s film I had presumed that the ending was so well-known that there would be little point in a remake. And yet, as the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins said in a different context, generations have trod, have trod, have trod, and there are plenty of millennials who haven’t read the book.

Photo

Mr. Finney’s embodiment of Poirot in the Lumet picture was a marathon of sorts, with the actor testing how many of the beloved character’s irritating yet endearing quirks could be pushed to the limits of coherence. In this latest version, Kenneth Branagh, who also directs (from a script by Michael Green), gives us a Poirot who’s fussy but not too fussy, and rather crisp in his English-language diction. Most radically, this is a Poirot with heart. This interpretation is a dumb idea, but Mr. Branagh, an actor of prodigious skills, can at least pull this one half off. It’s not the only dumb idea in this film, which nevertheless bounces along in a way that’s sometimes almost entertaining.

Video

Mr. Branagh shot the film in the 65-millimeter format, which offers a particular kind of “big movie” resolution. People tend to think that big-gauge celluloid is best for big-vista movies, such as “Lawrence of Arabia,” but Mr. Branagh’s picture is set almost entirely on a train. It is a very opulent train, and the cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos gets all its ornate detail. It also gets the detail of the mostly C.G.I. special effects and settings, and here the marriage of digital and analog is awkward. In further pursuit of 65-millimeter shots, Mr. Branagh opens up the story regularly, however. He has the train stall on a cliff-side rail, supported by elaborate scaffolding on which he stages a foot chase. He has Poirot deliver his final summation of the case in a train tunnel.

As in Mr. Lumet’s adaptation, the supporting cast here is full of stars. Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Penélope Cruz, Derek Jacobi, and newer faces like Daisy Ridley and Leslie Odom Jr., fill out the roster of subjects. Johnny Depp, who is known to make some eccentric choices in crafting his characters, does not (necessarily) disappoint in the role of the murder victim, Edward Ratchett. Imbuing that unsavory character with the dopiest of gangster mannerisms, Mr. Depp may remind you of Matt LeBlanc’s “Friends” character, Joey Tribbiani. It’s as if Joey, that lovable bad actor, is trying to make the most of his first big break in the movies.",Review: An All-Star ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ With Few Surprises,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/movies/murder-on-the-orient-express-review-kenneth-branagh.html

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Most of us solve crossword puzzles in our SPARE TIME, but I’ve gotten mail from people who have told me that they solved under their desks during classes to make a boring lecture go faster. In another lifetime, I raced my boss to see who could finish fastest when we should have been working. So clearly, spare time is the not the same as down time. Spare time is all in the eye of the solver.

Roland Huget returns with a wide open grid that has only 60 words in it. The pinwheel design intrigued me, although I felt a bit boxed in by the long, black square “arms” that made, as he admits, the puzzle feel like four mini-crosswords. If I’m going to be boxed in, so to speak, I like to see each sector really shine, and I’m not sure this one did it for me. As always, your mileage may vary, but there are more “RE-” words in here than I like to see (RELET, REVOICE, REBOX, REAWAKENS) and each section has some gluey bits that made me feel as if the majority of the puzzle had been filled using the autofill option in a puzzle constructing software program.

Yes, I know it’s Saturday. There is some nice fill in here (I liked SEAFARERS, GO IT ALONE, SPARE TIME, LOSE A STEP). And PAPETERIE might just become the ETUI of stationery products one day. But I really like some knotty wordplay in my late week cluing, and this seemed mostly definitional. Combine that with the lack of real sparklers in the fill, and the puzzle as a whole feels vaguely disappointing. To me. You might feel otherwise, and that’s perfectly O.K.

Tricky Clues

The Tricky Clues section is generally limited to clues that involve some sort of wordplay, and there wasn’t much of it in today’s puzzle. Even so, here is a selection of clues that might have been speed bumps for some solvers.

41A: Foreign language in the clue = foreign language answer. “Un examen” is “a test” in French, so the answer would be ELEVE, or French for “student.”

36D: “It’s not the main story” is a SUBPLOT.

43D: Now we’re talking, sort of. “It can get the blood flowing” could be anything exciting, but today it’s a STENT.

Constructor Notes

This puzzle was constructed in October 2016 and accepted for publication in February of this year. It is one of a series of open grids that I constructed in the late summer and fall of 2016. This grid has the largest open square count of any I have constructed to date. The layout of the blocks was designed for that purpose. It is as close to being four independent mini-puzzles as you can get, and this fact needs to be taken into account in the cluing so that solvers can gain a foothold. This grid took longer than most to construct, and in the end required compromises, as has been my experience with many puzzles. The Scrabble average often suffers in grids like this because the friendliest letters in the open areas tend to be the ones with the lowest scores. I hope solvers enjoy this one.

“Your social alliances affect how you weight information,” said Dr. Seifert.","Agents with links to the Russian government set up an endless array of fake accounts and websites and purchased a slew of advertisements on Google and Facebook, spreading dubious claims that seemed intended to sow division all along the political spectrum — “a cultural hack,” in the words of one expert.

Yet the psychology behind social media platforms — the dynamics that make them such powerful vectors of misinformation in the first place — is at least as important, experts say, especially for those who think they’re immune to being duped. For all the suspicions about social media companies’ motives and ethics, it is the interaction of the technology with our common, often subconscious psychological biases that makes so many of us vulnerable to misinformation, and this has largely escaped notice.

Skepticism of online “news” serves as a decent filter much of the time, but our innate biases allow it to be bypassed, researchers have found — especially when presented with the right kind of algorithmically selected “meme.”

At a time when political misinformation is in ready supply, and in demand, “Facebook, Google, and Twitter function as a distribution mechanism, a platform for circulating false information and helping find receptive audiences,” said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College (and occasional contributor to The Times’s Upshot column).

For starters, said Colleen Seifert, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, “People have a benevolent view of Facebook, for instance, as a curator, but in fact it does have a motive of its own. What it’s actually doing is keeping your eyes on the site. It’s curating news and information that will keep you watching.”

That kind of curating acts as a fertile host for falsehoods by simultaneously engaging two predigital social-science standbys: the urban myth as “meme,” or viral idea; and individual biases, the automatic, subconscious presumptions that color belief.

The first process is largely data-driven, experts said, and built into social media algorithms. The wide circulation of bizarre, easily debunked rumors — so-called Pizzagate, for example, the canard that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex ring from a Washington-area pizza parlor — is not entirely dependent on partisan fever (though that was its origin).

For one, the common wisdom that these rumors gain circulation because most people conduct their digital lives in echo chambers or “information cocoons” is exaggerated, Dr. Nyhan said.

In a forthcoming paper, Dr. Nyhan and colleagues review the relevant research, including analyses of partisan online news sites and Nielsen data, and find the opposite. Most people are more omnivorous than presumed; they are not confined in warm bubbles containing only agreeable outrage.

But they don’t have to be for fake news to spread fast, research also suggests. Social media algorithms function at one level like evolutionary selection: Most lies and false rumors go nowhere, but the rare ones with appealing urban-myth “mutations” find psychological traction, then go viral.

There is no precise formula for such digital catnip. The point, experts said, is that the very absurdity of the Pizzagate lie could have boosted its early prominence, no matter the politics of those who shared it.

“My experience is that once this stuff gets going, people just pass these stories on without even necessarily stopping to read them,” Mr. McKinney said. “They’re just participating in the conversation without stopping to look hard” at the source.

Digital social networks are “dangerously effective at identifying memes that are well adapted to surviving, and these also tend to be the rumors and conspiracy theories that are hardest to correct,” Dr. Nyhan said.

One reason is the raw pace of digital information sharing, he said: “The networks make information run so fast that it outruns fact-checkers’ ability to check it. Misinformation spreads widely before it can be downgraded in the algorithms.”

The extent to which Facebook and other platforms function as “marketers” of misinformation, similar to the way they market shoes and makeup, is contentious. In 2015, a trio of behavior scientists working at Facebook inflamed the debate in a paper published in the prominent journal Science.

The authors analyzed the news feeds of some 10 million users in the United States who posted their political views, and concluded that “individuals’ choices played a stronger role in limiting exposure” to contrary news and commentary than Facebook’s own algorithmic ranking — which gauges how interesting stories are likely to be to individual users, based on data they have provided.

Outside critics lashed the study as self-serving, while other researchers said the analysis was solid and without apparent bias.

The other dynamic that works in favor of proliferating misinformation is not embedded in the software but in the biological hardware: the cognitive biases of the human brain.

Purely from a psychological point of view, subtle individual biases are at least as important as rankings and choice when it comes to spreading bogus news or Russian hoaxes — like a false report of Muslim men in Michigan collecting welfare for multiple wives.

Merely understanding what a news report or commentary is saying requires a temporary suspension of disbelief. Mentally, the reader must temporarily accept the stated “facts” as possibly true. A cognitive connection is made automatically: Clinton-sex offender, Trump-Nazi, Muslim men-welfare.

And refuting those false claims requires a person to first mentally articulate them, reinforcing a subconscious connection that lingers far longer than people presume.

Over time, for many people, it is that false initial connection that stays the strongest, not the retractions or corrections: “Was Obama a Muslim? I seem to remember that....”

In a recent analysis of the biases that help spread misinformation, Dr. Seifert and co-authors named this and several other automatic cognitive connections that can buttress false information.

Another is repetition: Merely seeing a news headline multiple times in a news feed makes it seem more credible before it is ever read carefully, even if it’s a fake item being whipped around by friends as a joke.

And, as salespeople have known forever, people tend to value the information and judgments offered by good friends over all other sources. It’s a psychological tendency with significant consequences now that nearly two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news from social media.

“Your social alliances affect how you weight information,” said Dr. Seifert. “We overweight information from people we know.”

The casual, social, wisecracking nature of thumbing through and participating in the digital exchanges allows these biases to operate all but unchecked, Dr. Seifert said.

Stopping to drill down and determine the true source of a foul-smelling story can be tricky, even for the motivated skeptic, and mentally it’s hard work. Ideological leanings and viewing choices are conscious, downstream factors that come into play only after automatic cognitive biases have already had their way, abetted by the algorithms and social nature of digital interactions.

“I thought if you’re writing hateful comment towards Hillary or Trump that are really, really angry and horrible, I thought that person is going to be horrible in person as well,” Mr. Lien said.

“Just to see their homes, their decorations around them, their computers — all of those things give quite a lot of personality to the photo,” Mr. Lien said.
Mr. Lien spent weeks researching and studying commenters.","Nick Haynes didn’t seem so bad.

Sure, online he had promised civil war if Hillary Clinton were elected, but Mr. Haynes was first and foremost a family man. He’d given up his days of motorcycles and drinking to live a sober life in a sleepy Pennsylvania town with his four children, where he had a full-time job as a truck driver.

But his family life contrasted sharply with his other full-time job, that of a prolific online commenter. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he tweeted an average of 57 times a day about a corrupt system, biased media and “Killary.” He compared voting for Mrs. Clinton to killing your own children.

It was this disconnect between “normal life” and intense online debate that drove Kyrre Lien, a photographer based in Oslo, to look into the lives of the online commenting community. For a project called “The Internet Warriors,” Mr. Lien combed through tens of thousands of online comments to put together a group of 27 internet debaters from around the world, representing all sides of the political spectrum.

“They had steady jobs, they had family, they had friends and lived quite a normal life, but at the same time, you saw they had these hateful comments,” he said. “That was part of what drove me to dig into this.”

In the case of Mr. Haynes, Mr. Lien assumed that he would personify his comments.

“I thought if you’re writing hateful comment towards Hillary or Trump that are really, really angry and horrible, I thought that person is going to be horrible in person as well,” Mr. Lien said. “But many of the people were actually quite nice, made me coffee and tea and, until politics came up, it was like flipping the switch on a different personality.”

Still, Mr. Lien is hesitant to categorize them as internet trolls.

“Labeling them all as internet trolls would be too harsh. Many of them are trolls, but many of them are just really strongly opinionated people,” Mr. Lien said. “All of the people I met are really dedicated in the cause they’re fighting.”

They have full-time jobs and families, they are men and women of all ages, who feel marginalized in some way or another. Take, for example, Ashleigh Jones, 22, a psychology student in Cardiff, Wales. She’s amassed more than 180,000 tweets on various subjects including entertainment, L.G.B.T. issues and “hot guys.”

“Some people have also called me a troll, like when I said that ISIS should kill David Cameron,” Ms. Jones told Mr. Lien, referring to the former British prime minister. “I don’t think I’m a troll. I might have strong opinions, but they are just that — opinions. For me, a troll is someone who is ruining the discussion, and that’s not me.”

The photographs feature portraits of the commenters, many of them in their natural commenting habitat inside their homes. Video interviews accompany the subjects online, as well as a book.

“Just to see their homes, their decorations around them, their computers — all of those things give quite a lot of personality to the photo,” Mr. Lien said.

Mr. Lien spent weeks researching and studying commenters. One thread took him down a dark path on Kim Kardashian’s Facebook account.

But in the end, that was one type of opinion he wasn’t able to capture on camera — misogynists.

Mr. Lien found that the motivation behind commenters depends on their political affiliation. On the right, it’s “because they feel threatened and society is letting them down, they’re being left by themselves,” Mr. Lien said, whereas people on the left “feel that we need to stand up for what we believe in.”

“There is so much ignorance and hate directed towards my religion in the comment section that I quickly become irritated.

It’s a bit scary to engage in these discussions, but I feel that it’s important to balance out all the negativity that is posted.”

Mr. Lien may have spent four years trailing the lives of what he calls internet warriors, but the photographer is far from calling himself a troll.

“I’d like to be more of an internet peacekeeping force than an internet warrior,” he said.

President Vladimir V. Putin’s government warned on Friday that it planned to crack down on CNN in Russia, possibly barring the news network from cable television packages, in retaliation for an American censure of RT, the state-run Moscow news organization.

CNN was among several American media organizations, including the federally funded Voice of America and Radio Liberty, that pro-Putin lawmakers said they would consider naming as foreign agents. That designation, which the networks would be required to place on their published work in Russia, amounts to being labeled by the Russian government as a hostile intelligence outfit.

The move — which could restrict the distribution and operations of foreign mass media in Russia — comes as RT, formerly known as Russia Today, has agreed to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent in the United States. And it opens a new front in an intercontinental dispute over Russia’s role in last year’s presidential election.

United States intelligence agencies have accused RT of acting as a propaganda outlet for Russian interests. During the presidential race, RT frequently portrayed the United States as a nation in disarray, often in sensational YouTube videos that racked up millions of views.

The disappearance of the spare tire might be more than just an exercise in efficiency.","An increasingly popular alternative to spares is the so-called run-flat design, which most new BMW models use. Intended to make roadside tire changes unnecessary, this solution employs a reinforced tire sidewall that typically lets the driver continue for 50 miles at up to 50 miles an hour after air pressure is lost. But they can be more costly: It may be necessary to replace, rather than simply patch, a damaged tire, and replacements are typically priced $25 to $50 higher than a conventional design.

Another alternative is the self-sealing tire, an older solution reappearing in modern form on the battery-powered Chevrolet Bolt, where reduced weight translates to more miles per charge. Designed solely as an electric vehicle, the Bolt has no provision for carrying a spare. According to Michelin, which supplies the Bolt’s Energy Saver A/S Selfseal rubber, the extra cost of a self-sealing tire — which can continue down the road even with a nail in the tread — is about $33 compared with conventional tires of the same size.

But some models are losing the spare without the benefit of run-flat or self-sealing rubber, instead including conventional tires and a leak repair kit — packaged in an aerosol can or used in conjunction with a small air compressor powered by the car’s battery.

Such kits skim weight while skipping the tire, but have limited abilities to deal with any road hazard more serious than a nail hole in the tire’s tread section. A larger tear in the tire — something that can happen when modern low-profile tires meet a pothole — or damage to the sidewall or wheel rim will not be fixed by a leak kit. The sealants, which are usually one-time use devices, have a finite shelf life — usually from four to eight years, AAA said — and cost about $40 to replace.

Even if a leak sealant kit gets you back on the road in a hurry after a minor puncture, it could complicate a permanent repair. Affixing an internal patch after a sealant has been used requires a thorough cleanup of all the goo inside, said Tom Carter, technical communications director for Michelin.

For a car owner — and certainly renters who might not know what they are getting into — the best way to prevent an unpleasant middle-of-the-night surprise is to check for a spare and be sure that it holds air. If there’s a sealant kit instead, read the owner’s manual (which may be on a DVD or available on the car’s display screen) and learn how to use it.

In some cases, greater peace of mind is available from the automakers.

For instance, although mainstream versions of the 2017 Honda Civic come from the factory with space-saver spares, the Civic Si does not. A spare wheel kit, including a jack and tools, is available from Honda dealers as an accessory for the Civic Si at a suggested retail price of $254. The tire, which must be purchased separately, runs about $115 from sources like Tirerack.com.

BMW offers a compact spare kit — including jack and wrench — for many of its X Series sport utility vehicles and for the 5 and 7 Series sedans. In most cases, it’s a $150 option when ordering the car, though on some models with conventional tires it is free. On the sport utility models, the compact spare fits entirely within a compartment under the rear floor, but on the sedans it juts out too high, meaning the floor panel cannot lie flat.

Not surprisingly, independent online retailers have also emerged to fill the hole. Buyers should make sure to compare prices with the dealership and to determine that there is a storage spot in the car where the tire can be secured. As designers work to smooth airflow under the car for fuel-economy improvements, those compartments are going away, too.

The disappearance of the spare tire might be more than just an exercise in efficiency. It may be a sociological statement. A survey by AAA found that some 20 percent of drivers do not know how to change a flat tire, and with the rise of roadside assistance coverage for new cars, that number is unlikely to shrink.

The era of cars proudly displaying a spare tire mounted on the front fender or rear bumper — a standby of prewar classics — is long gone, and the tradition of suburban dads gathering to inspect a neighbor’s new purchase may have to undergo a major change.

Instead of crowding around the front end to see what’s under the hood, perhaps they’ll be checking the trunk to see if it’s got a spare.","Cars Lose the Spare Tire for a Leaner Ride, but It Could Cost You",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/business/spare-tires.html

Even better, if this man persists in interrupting me, I can signal to a bouncer and have him kicked out.

Yes. I can have a rude man removed from my workplace. I wonder if Hope Hicks, the White House communications director, might want to have that power. Wouldn’t any woman?

But the moment a female comic steps offstage, her power dissipates. She is a woman, again. A famous comic can masturbate in front of her and his powerful manager can tell her to stop complaining about it. In standup comedy, the contrast between those two states is so depressingly clear. We get to be the person onstage who we wish were offstage.

There’s a Hulu documentary called “Too Funny to Fail,” about Dana Carvey’s sketch show on ABC. Louis C.K. was the head writer, the guy who presumably did the hiring. When I started watching it, of course I noticed that all the writers on the show were men. And they are all great — not a dud in the bunch. But were there a couple of great female writers who didn’t even try to get a job on that show because they’d heard weird stuff about the guy who did the hiring?

All new comics need the same thing: huge amounts of stage time. There are no shortcuts in standup comedy. The quest to become a good comedian is brutal. It takes at least 10 years of performing, almost every night. You get that performing time in at open mics, where you have to line up during the day for a spot that night, at open mics that run until 1 or 2 a.m., at shows where you have to talk two, or 10, friends into coming just so that you can have a chance to perform.

Both male and female comics have to do these things. But if you also have to maneuver around a problematic guy, you’ll miss some opportunities. If you perform 10 times a week and your male counterpart performs 12 times a week, he will get better faster. And because you won’t get paid work until you’re good, your quest will take longer.

Often when I am part of a predominantly male lineup, I will watch the women in the crowd. After the third or fourth man in a row, some of them look tired. I see them thinking, “Another one?”

When a female comic takes the stage on such a night, there is often palpable joy from the women in the audience. For a few minutes, they don’t have to look at the world through male eyes. It’s a relief, an end to dude fatigue. I have never understood why male comics put up with all-male or mostly male lineups, why they aren’t demanding to follow a female comic. The audience will be so much more excited about you if you’re not the sixth man in a row.

After the allegations about Louis C.K. were made public on the record, a friend texted me the names of two more famous male standup comics who she heard are “next.” It is so strange to see sexual harassment being taken seriously, at long last. It has made me examine my own life, 30 years of swimming under, over and around sharks. What could I have accomplished if I’d been able to put that energy elsewhere?

But so far, those pledges have proved inadequate. Most industrialized countries — from Europe to Japan to the United States — aren’t on track to meet their emissions goals. And even if they were, the current pledges put the world on course to heat up 3 degrees Celsius or more, an outcome with a far greater risk of destabilizing ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, drastic sea-level rise and more destructive heat waves and droughts. To stay well below 2 degrees, countries would need to cut back fossil-fuel emissions far more rapidly than they’ve promised so far.

In 2018, leaders plan to assess their efforts to date and discuss what further action could help lessen the odds of drastic global warming — with the goal of crafting newer, stronger national pledges by 2020. But before they can do any of that, they need to agree to formal ground rules for that exercise. That “rule book” will be a focus at Bonn.

How do countries plan to make progress on climate change?

One widely recognized problem with the current Paris pledges is that they’re fairly vague.

China promised that its emissions would peak around 2030, but the country’s energy data is notoriously murky, so it’s hard to tell how much progress it’s actually making. Similarly, the European Union vowed to cut emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, but offered few specifics on how to achieve that goal — making it hard to gauge whether European policymakers could realistically be doing much more.

At Bonn, negotiators will be discussing how to make these pledges more rigorous and transparent, so that countries can more readily be held accountable for their actions. That means tackling questions like: What’s the best way to track nations’ progress, to see if they’re doing what they said they would do? Is there a way to tell if a country’s pledge could be made more ambitious? Which specific policies are working well and which aren’t?

Because the Paris pledges are largely voluntary — world leaders would have never agreed to a deal otherwise — no one can force governments to take additional action. But, the idea goes, if pledges and policies are made more transparent, world leaders will be better able to pressure and help each other to do more.

The final draft of this “rule book” is not due until next year, and it may not actually get finished at Bonn, but negotiators are hoping to make significant progress on a long list of items at these talks. As always, diplomacy tends to proceed fitfully.

What role will the United States play?

Even though the Trump administration has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement, the United States can’t formally exit the climate talks until 2020. So the State Department is sending a small team of negotiators to discuss some of the details of the pact.

Photo

The United States and China will still preside over a working group on transparency, though it remains to be seen how much influence American officials can wield.

The administration will also hold an event in Bonn with representatives from energy companies to promote coal, natural gas and nuclear power as solutions to global warming. Other countries are expected to view the American push to promote fossil fuels with a wary eye.

In the meantime, a coalition of pro-Paris governors and other officials plan to attend the conference to tout efforts that states, cities and businesses are making to reduce emissions despite the Trump administration’s stance — highlighting the country’s deep divide over climate policy.

What big disagreements might arise in Bonn?

Discussions around the “rule book” for assessing and ratcheting up pledges could prove contentious. In the past, for instance, the United States has insisted that developing countries be held to the same strict monitoring standards as wealthy countries, while China and India have pushed for a bifurcated system.

Developing countries have also argued that they need financial aid from wealthier nations to expand clean energy and adapt to the ravages of climate change.

The government of Fiji is presiding over the Bonn conference, which will put the spotlight on issues like “loss and damage” — that is, whether wealthy nations should compensate island nations and other poorer countries for the droughts, storms and rising sea levels that their emissions are causing. The Paris agreement broached this issue only briefly, and industrialized nations have resisted calls to be held legally liable for their role in warming the planet.

What’s the best-case scenario from Bonn? What’s the worst?

Some climate advocates are hoping for a relatively low-key conference that makes modest progress on issues like transparency and climate finance. In this scenario, American officials would play a quietly constructive role in helping craft the rule book for ratcheting up pledges. And nonstate actors, including cities and businesses, would continue to press forward on efforts to tackle climate change outside of the formal United Nations process.

Conversely, it’s entirely possible that the Trump administration’s rejection of the Paris deal could lead other countries to disengage from global efforts to address climate change. Or the talks could get bogged down by the traditional rifts between richer and poorer nations. That, in turn, could stall momentum right before the next big round of climate talks in 2018 — when countries are supposed to get down to the details of what’s needed to step up their climate policies going forward.",What’s at Stake in the Bonn Climate Talks?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/climate/bonn-climate-change-conference.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

According to an analysis in January from the Joint Committee on Taxation, most taxpayers who claim the deduction have incomes below $100,000, with about 40 percent below $75,000. More than half of those who claim it are older than 65, according to AARP, the lobby for older Americans. They often face staggering medical and long-term care costs.

The deduction also helps younger families struggling to pay the enormous cost of caring for children with chronic conditions or disabilities, and couples going through costly fertility treatments like in vitro fertilization. In interviews, some who claimed it said the deduction is the difference allowing them to afford mental health care, new chemotherapy drugs, or cancer surgeries by doctors who fall outside insurance networks.

“I understand that in order to get tax reform through there need to be some ‘pay fors,’ but getting those revenues from families who have been hardest hit by high cost medical conditions like autism or cancer seems a bit like targeting hurricane victims as a potential source of revenue,” said John Rodakis, 48, of Dallas, who has a son with autism and runs a nonprofit foundation devoted to autism research.

The Joint Committee estimated that the deduction for medical expenses would cost the federal government $10 billion next year, if it were not eliminated. That is far less than the two big deductions the Republican bill would preserve: one for interest paid on home mortgages is expected to cost $63.6 billion, and one for charitable donations, $47.8 billion. Most taxpayers claiming those deductions have incomes above $100,000.

Taxpayers claimed a total of $87 billion in medical costs through the deduction in 2015, according to the Internal Revenue Service. An increase in the standard deduction would not nearly make up for that, tax experts said. The average Medicare beneficiary, for example, pays $5,680 a year in out-of-pocket costs, according to AARP.

Last year Heather Block, 54, deducted $9,349 in medical expenses. For most of her career as a freelance international aid worker, she carried two health insurance policies. Before she got breast cancer six years ago, she said, “it wouldn’t have dawned on me that people had these medical expenses.”

Her cancer is now stage 4. One month this year, she said, oral chemotherapy alone was $4,000. “I feel like I’ve had a running contest since I got cancer,” she said, “Am I going to use up my savings and go bankrupt or am I going to die first?”

While the Affordable Care Act expanded coverage to millions more Americans and limited out-of-pocket costs, many, like Ms. Block, still face large expenses that insurance does not cover.

“It’s like a backstop, and until such time that we have a health care system that covers everybody for everything, we’re going to need that backstop,” said Alexandra Thornton, the senior director of tax policy at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress. “That’s the thing with deductions, they recognize that sometimes people are in a situation where it’s harder to pay their taxes. Some are harder to defend, but this is one of the easier ones.”

Lisa and Peter Witzler’s second son, Jackson, was born with spina bifida, a defect caused when the spinal cord does not close in the womb. By his fifth month of life, he’d spent three months in the hospital — six weeks in neonatal intensive care — and his parents had spent the money they had planned to put toward day care.

Doctors had recommended private nursing because Jackson had severe sleep apnea and would repeatedly stop breathing and turn blue. But insurance would not cover it.

“We didn’t have that time to prepare or save for anything,” said Mr. Witzler, a union organizer.

The family, which lives in Montgomery Village, Md., had $25,000 in unreimbursed medical expenses last year. Being able to deduct those expenses, the Witzlers said, is the difference between their son getting treatment now, or needing more public services later in his life.

“It’s a misnomer,” said Ms. Witzler, who works for the federal government doing conflict resolution. “The idea that these are extra things, that it’s deducting things that are not essential or necessary.”

Adrienne Lynch, who is 34 and lives in Austin, Tex., is undergoing in vitro fertilization for the second time this year. “We have spent around $43,586, and that won’t be the last of it for 2017,” she said. Ms. Lynch, who manages regional media advocacy for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said that the deduction, which would lower her taxable income by more than $20,000, would help rebuild the emergency savings that she and her husband have spent on fertility treatments this year.

“To go after this is a gut punch,” she said.

Robert Graboyes, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said the plan to eliminate the deduction was “part of a larger deal where one way you pay for broad tax cuts for a large part of the population is by ending a variety of small ones. My guess is they needed some revenue and this was a way to do it.”

But eliminating the deduction could hasten the speed at which some older Americans spend down their savings and have to go on Medicaid, a far greater expense for the federal government.

“Already I’m having to dip severely into whatever I’ve saved,” said Jennifer Clark, 76, of Falls Church, Va. She has multiple sclerosis and a form of blood cancer, and while insurance covers her chemotherapy and other medications, she pays out of pocket for part-time aides, dental care, a portion of her physical therapy, some of her medications and the continuing care retirement community she lives in.

Sheet pans

These are Thanksgiving Day workhorses. Line quarter-size trays with paper towels and use them to dry freshly washed herbs. (Once the herbs dry, place the herbs stem-first in a glass of water and cover the top with a plastic bag. You can store these covered herbs in the fridge until you are ready to use them.)

Mr. Brafman declined to comment on the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, except to say he would “vigorously defend” his client.

Paz de la Huerta, an actress known for her work on “Boardwalk Empire,” has accused the movie mogul of raping her on two occasions in 2010 in her TriBeCa apartment. The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., has said his office is investigating those accusations.

The accusation presents challenges for investigators. Seven years have passed and the crime was not reported to the police at the time. Ms. de la Huerta did speak to a therapist about the encounters, saying she felt coerced to have sex with Mr. Weinstein because of his power and rank in the industry, according to her lawyer, Aaron Filler.

In Los Angeles, the authorities are delving into similar accusations by an 38-year-old Italian actress who maintains Mr. Weinstein forced his way into her room at a Beverly Hills hotel in February 2013 and raped her in a bathroom.

Ms. Berk declined to comment on that investigation. She was first hired by Mr. Weinstein in October 2016 and brought in Mr. Brafman as her co-counsel in Manhattan earlier this year.

Ms. Berk, who graduated from Harvard Law School, grew up in Chapel Hill, N.C., where her father and mother also practiced law. She has a reputation for avoiding publicity and working behind the scenes to negotiate favorable plea bargains or to stave off criminal charges.

Mr. Brafman has a more modest educational pedigree but a touch of showmanship. The son of Holocaust survivors, he grew up in Brooklyn and Queens, earning his bachelor’s degree at night at Brooklyn College. He earned a law degree from Ohio Northern University’s College of Law before landing a job in Manhattan district attorney’s office in the late 1970s.

As a defense lawyer, he has represented mobsters and drug dealers, as well as celebrities like the artists Jay-Z and Michael Jackson. In court, has a knack for getting inside the heads of witnesses on cross-examination, and he often uses self-deprecating humor to win over jurors, making quips, for example, about his own short stature.

“Ben grew up as a borscht belt comedian, and he has got the quickest wit,” said Paul Shechtman, another criminal defense lawyer. “Jury trials, even in high profile cases, can be dull and humor keeps a jury awake and can keep them on your side.”","For Harvey Weinstein, a New York Lawyer With a List of Celebrity Clients",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-lawyer-benjamin-brafman.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Song of the Wild: A First Book of Animals

By Nicola Davies. Illustrated by Petr Horacek.

Jellyfish, flamingoes, butterflies; pandas, zebras, vipers. This beautifully illustrated oversize compendium will be a treat for anyone who likes to look at and think about the staggering variety of animals on this planet. Davies (“King of the Sky”) has a degree in zoology and a clear passion for animal life. A brief verse on each spread is both awed and intimate — “The panda walks alone,” she writes, “and the reason for its color / we may never really know” — leaving ample space for Horacek’s vividly colored, painterly art.

Inky’s Great Escape: The Incredible (and Mostly True) Story of an Octopus Escape

By Casey Lyall. Illustrated by Sebastià Serra.

Few stories of animal escapades rival octopus escapes for mind-boggling fun. Lyall embellishes wildly on the story of Inky, who broke out of a New Zealand aquarium in 2016. This Inky is a raconteur and a patient opportunist who escapes on a dare from his tankmate, Blotchy. Inky’s physical feats are, of course, incredible: He makes himself “flat as a piece of seaweed,” then coils his body into a rope, slipping down the drain and out to the ocean. With Technicolor flair, Serra’s madcap cartoony illustrations rev up the story even more.

Red & Lulu

Written and illustrated by Matt Tavares.

Red and Lulu, a devoted pair of cardinals, live year-round in a giant pine tree overlooking the snug house of a family of humans. But the tree is chopped down and strapped to a truck, with Lulu in its branches. Red’s journey to find his mate makes for gorgeous sweeping vistas and heightened emotion, especially when he finds her in the illuminated branches of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. Tavares (“Crossing Niagara”) lets the holiday note waft lightly, bringing equal cheer to the celebration of pair-bonding and New York City.

How to Be an Elephant: Growing Up in the African Wild

Written and illustrated by Katherine Roy.

From Babar to Little Elliot, fictional elephants have charmed generations of kid readers. But make room for this account of real-life elephants that follows a baby through her first two years, explaining elephant society and biology and how the young learn. The energetic illustrations are whimsical on one page, scientifically precise on the next. As in her wonderful “Neighborhood Sharks,” Roy reels you in with startling facts, then shows how a dominant species is really vulnerable, dependent on humans to choose to practice conservation.

“It’s physical de-escalation on an oppositional line,” Ms. Thurman explained with typical hyperarticulacy.","Plays, however, were Ms. Thurman’s first taste of acting. As a sophomore at her Massachusetts boarding school, she played the female lead in “The Crucible.” More than 30 years later, there was swagger in her throaty voice when she said, “It was an achievement for a sophomore to get the role that usually a senior gets.”

Some agents she’d met while modeling the summer before came to see the play. Their interest helped persuade her parents, Robert Thurman, a professor of Buddhist Studies at Columbia University, and Nena von Schlebrügge, a former fashion model who now helps to run Menla, a retreat in the Catskill Mountains, to let her transfer to Manhattan’s Professional Children’s School. By 17, she had booked her first four film roles, including a clamshell-born Venus in “The Adventures of Baron Munchausen” and the convent girl Cécile in “Dangerous Liaisons.”

“It wasn’t very difficult to cast her,” said Stephen Frears, the director of “Dangerous Liaisons,” speaking by telephone. “She was so striking, so beautiful and so fresh.”

She was also, as Mr. Frears said, “very formidable.” That’s a hallmark of her career and also maybe a clue to why that career has been so eclectic. Ms. Thurman isn’t a delicate actress or a melting one or the kind who comes right to the front of a movie screen and invites you in. There’s a remove in a lot of her best work (“Henry & June,” “Kill Bill”), a sense that she has emotions and ideas that are hers alone.

She has refused to be typecast as a siren or a femme fatale and has struggled to find roles that attract her. It isn’t that she won’t play wives and girlfriends — she will, she has. But these are women as likely to steal a scene as to yield to it.

Quentin Tarantino, who directed her as a gangster’s wife in “Pulp Fiction” and wrote the “Kill Bill” movies for her, compared Ms. Thurman to golden-age luminaries like Greta Garbo and Bette Davis. “There’s this year’s blonde and there’s last year’s blonde. Interchangeable. But to me, Uma has a quality that could rank with a Marlene Dietrich,” he said in a phone interview. He also called her, with affection, “a big, tall willow.”

Will Ms. Thurman’s old-Hollywood style play on Broadway? Her 1999 outing, as the film star Jennifer in Martin Crimp’s version of Molière’s “The Misanthrope,” didn’t dazzle critics. “She brings to mind a beautiful, sheltered girl at her first grown-up dance, putting on airs and hoping against hope she’ll get away with it,” Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times.

Did the tone of the responses surprise her? “I don’t expect anyone to pat me on the back,” she said. That script, a series of rhymed couplets barnacled with topical quips, “was so impenetrably difficult,” she said. “It was madness.”

Since then, the closest Ms. Thurman has come to a stage role was a guest-star arc on the first season of the NBC show “Smash,” in which she played Rebecca, a movie star trying to conquer Broadway, felled at an out-of-town tryout by a tainted smoothie.

Nothing so dramatic has affected “The Parisian Woman,” but Ms. Thurman and Mr. Willimon have both found themselves in the news for reasons unrelated to the play. As rehearsals began, accusations against Mr. Weinstein broke wide. As to whether she had personally been subject to abuse, Ms. Thurman gave the clipped response, “I’ll discuss it when I want to discuss it.” (In an “Access Hollywood” interview, which has since gone viral, she offered a similar answer, though in more obviously indignant tones.)

In late October, the allegations against Mr. Spacey also surfaced and production on “House of Cards,” was halted. (Mr. Willimon left the series in 2016.)

Though “The Parisian Woman” traffics in questions of sex and power, any discussion of these real-world events “never made its way into the rehearsal room,” Ms. MacKinnon said firmly.

Inside that room, a few days before the actors were to move into the theater for technical rehearsals, Ms. Thurman clacked onto the temporary set in teal heels, prop phone in her hand, gemstone glint in her eye. With mischief and languor, she subdued her lover (Marton Csokas) and teased her husband (Josh Lucas). (Mischief extended to her downtime, too. When this reporter slunk into the room, Ms. Thurman called brightly, “Write some fake news for us today!”)

The blocking for the scene wasn’t set yet; the pacing juddered. But when Ms. Thurman lobbed a line like, “I can’t control who falls in love with me,” it landed.

Ms. MacKinnon occasionally stopped the action to offer a suggestion. Sometimes the suggestions were Ms. Thurman’s. Maybe she could speak an early line more lightly. Maybe she should cross the stage later. She asked Ms. MacKinnon if she could sit during an argument with Mr. Csokas’s character, the better to soothe him. “It’s physical de-escalation on an oppositional line,” Ms. Thurman explained with typical hyperarticulacy.

Rehearsing a play has required some adjustments in the ways she attacks a role. Her method is still what Mr. Tarantino described as motivated by emotional connection to a character and “from the inside out,” he said. “She’s not surface, right?”","Uma Thurman, Ready to Be Tested",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/theater/uma-thurman-the-parisian-woman.html

But the report unquestionably introduced new waves of uncertainty and turmoil into a race for the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, the attorney general.

The women cited in The Washington Post article said that Mr. Moore had pursued them in the 1970s and 1980s when he was a lawyer in his early 30s.

Mr. Moore was defiant, denying the charges and attacking the news media.

“These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and The Washington Post on this campaign,” he said in a statement. He later attributed the news to “The Obama-Clinton Machine’s liberal media lap dogs.”

Brett Doster, an adviser to Mr. Moore, said the candidate would “absolutely not” drop out of the race, calling the charges “a fabricated November surprise.”

Others in Alabama shrugged at the allegations. “There’s nothing to see here,” said Jim Zeigler, the state auditor and a longtime supporter of Mr. Moore. “Single man, early 30s, never been married, dating teenage girls. Never been married and he liked younger girls. According to The Washington Post account he never had sexual intercourse with any of them.”

But Mr. Moore’s candidacy appears to be in grave danger. Senate Republicans moved en masse to distance themselves from their nominee almost as soon as the news article was posted.

A statement from Vice President Mike Pence said: “The Vice President found the allegations in the story disturbing and believes, if true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office.”

That statement was repeated by numerous Republicans, including the president who was traveling in Asia.

“Like most Americans the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a person’s life,” Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in statement from Danang, Vietnam, where the president is attending an economic summit meeting. “However, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.”

“If these allegations are true, his candidacy is not sustainable,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Republican. Mr. Cornyn said he wanted to know more before withdrawing his endorsement of Mr. Moore.

The party, already reeling from the election losses they suffered on Tuesday, is defending a two-seat majority in the Senate and faces a handful of difficult elections next year.

Mr. Moore’s candidacy had already worried party leaders who had embraced Mr. Moore despite his long record of incendiary comments about gays, Muslims and African-Americans.

Alabama election law indicates, with little ambiguity, that the deadline has passed for candidates to be replaced on the ballot. The state election code says a candidate who wishes to withdraw from a race must do so 76 days before Election Day. The Alabama vote is in little more than a month.

“It’s too late to substitute a candidate,” said John Merrill, the Alabama secretary of state, a Republican. “Judge Moore will be the candidate on the ballot with this election cycle remaining on the schedule it’s currently on.”

Republican lawyers and strategists in Washington were engaged in a furious search on Thursday for creative ways around that restriction, seeking a loophole that would allow the party’s leadership in the state to anoint a new candidate. The prospect of a write-in candidacy, for a third candidate, was also under consideration, according to party aides.

Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who ran her own successful write-in campaign in 2010, said: “If in fact what I just read is true, he needs to get out of this race immediately. I think it’s pretty clear cut.”

She called for Senator Luther Strange, who was appointed to fill Mr. Sessions’s seat but lost to Mr. Moore in a bitterly contested Republican runoff in September, to run as a write-in.

One of the women, Leigh Corfman, told The Washington Post that she was 14 when Mr. Moore, 32 at the time, drove her to his home in Gadsden, Ala. He took off her shirt and touched her bra and underwear while also guiding her hand over his pants, Ms. Corfman told The Post.

“I wanted it over with — I wanted out,” she told the newspaper.

CNN reported that it had spoken with Ms. Corfman’s stepfather, who said the family “stands by” what was reported in The Post.

Republican leaders are in a politically perilous situation, saddled with an embattled nominee unwilling to step aside in one of the country’s most conservative states. The charges reignited hostilities between Mr. McConnell’s political allies, who poured millions of dollars into the campaign to stop Mr. Moore, and President Trump’s former chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who rallied support for the former justice.

“This is what happens when you let reckless, incompetent idiots like Steve Bannon go out and recruit candidates who have absolutely no business running for the U.S. Senate,” said Josh Holmes, a former McConnell aide.

Mr. Bannon did not immediately reply to text messages or phone calls, but Breitbart posted an article with Mr. Moore’s statement shortly before The Post published its report.

Steven Law, the head of a McConnell-aligned “super PAC” that led an onslaught against Mr. Moore in the Republican runoff, did not wait for a guilty verdict before he excoriated Breitbart for “defending ‘consensual’ sex between a 32-year-old and a 16-year-old.”

Private polling by both parties has shown that while Mr. Moore retains a passionate following among conservatives, he is a deeply divisive figure among more moderate Republicans, and some party officials now worry that the charges will convince moderates to stay home or vote for the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, a former United States attorney.

The Jones campaign said in a statement that “Roy Moore needs to answer these serious charges.”

Cleveland Poole, the chairman of the Republican Party in rural Butler County, said those most likely to defect were not ardent Moore supporters but voters who already have doubts. “They are going to be put off by it and might well stay home,” he said.

In a statement, Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, called the allegations “deeply disturbing,” and said she would withhold judgment until “we know the facts.” Senator Richard Shelby, the dean of the state’s congressional delegation, told reporters in Washington that if the charges were accurate “he wouldn’t belong in the Senate.”

Mr. Doster, the adviser to Mr. Moore, said the candidate’s campaign chairman, Bill Armistead, had talked to members of Alabama’s congressional delegation after the report broke. “Everybody has been supportive,” Mr. Doster said.

But a Republican familiar with the conversation said the House members on the call had told Mr. Armistead it was imperative that they aggressively respond to the article or risk losing support from the party’s elected officials.

Randy Brinson, president of the Christian Coalition of Alabama, said he expected voters would mostly give Mr. Moore the benefit of the doubt.

“Until I see something different, I would support Roy Moore because of what he says he’s going to do and who he is as a person,” Mr. Brinson said.

Mr. Zeigler said the account given by Ms. Corfman was “the only part that is concerning.” As Mr. Zeigler described it: “He went a little too far and he stopped.”

Had the girl been 16 at the time and not 14, he added, “it would have been perfectly acceptable.”

For Democrats, the prospect of a wounded Mr. Moore was a gift.

“This is revolting and the Republican Party and everybody’s who endorsed Roy Moore needs to disavow his candidacy right now and ask him to withdraw,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who leads the Senate Democratic campaign arm.

Until recently, few Democratic officials believed that Mr. Jones could topple Mr. Moore in a state that has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1992, and Democrats have debated fiercely whether to commit resources to the race.

Myth 4: Liberal arts majors are unemployable.
The liberal arts is a favorite target of politicians, with the latest salvo coming from the governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin.
Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize — writing, synthesis, problem solving — are sought after by employers.
One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job.","Take the median lifetime earnings of business majors, the most popular undergraduate degree. The typical graduate earns $2.86 million over a lifetime. When you put business graduates side by side with those who graduated with what are considered low-paying majors, you’ll see that those who are slightly above the median salary in their fields are not that far behind the business grads. For example, an English major in the 60th percentile makes $2.76 million in a lifetime, a major in psychology $2.57 million and a history major $2.64 million.

Myth 2: Women want to have it all.

Women are now the clear majority on college campuses, making up 56 percent of students enrolled this fall. They are also more likely than men to graduate.

But when it comes to selecting a major, what women choose tends to segregate them into lower paying fields, such as education and social services, according to a report that Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce will publish later this year. Just look at some of the highest paying fields and the proportion of women who major in them: business economics (31 percent), chemical engineering (28 percent), computer science (20 percent), electrical engineering (10 percent), mechanical engineering (8 percent).

“Women can’t win even as they dominate at every level of higher education,” said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown center.

Dr. Carnevale wouldn’t speculate as to why women make their choices. But he notes that if the proportion of women in fields where men dominate increased by just 10 percent, the gender pay gap would narrow considerably: from 78 cents paid to women for every dollar men receive to 90 cents for every dollar men receive.

Myth 3: Choice of major matters more than choice of college.

Not so. In seven states — Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington — students can search public databases for early earnings of graduates of institutions within the state. And those databases show that students who graduate from more selective schools tend to make more money. After all, the better the college, the better the professional network opportunities, through alumni, parents of classmates and eventually classmates themselves.

These undergraduates are more able to pursue majors in lower paying fields because their networks help them land good jobs. Arts, humanities and social science majors are more prevalent on elite campuses than at second-tier colleges, where students tend to pick vocational majors like business, education and health. In all, more than half of students at less selective schools major in career-focused subjects; at elite schools, less than a quarter do, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight of the 78 “most selective schools” in Barron’s rankings, compared with 1,800 “less selective schools.”

“Students at selective colleges are allowed to explore their intellectual curiosity as undergraduates because they will get their job training in graduate school or have access to a network that gets them top jobs, regardless of their undergraduate major,” Dr. Carnevale said.

They are also more likely to have two majors than students at second-tier colleges, who tend to be more financially needy and have to work, affording less time to double major.

One tip: Complementary majors with overlapping requirements are easier to juggle, but two unrelated majors probably yield bigger gains in the job market, said Richard N. Pitt, an associate professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University who has studied the rise of the double major. “It increases your breadth of knowledge,” he said.

Myth 4: Liberal arts majors are unemployable.

The liberal arts is a favorite target of politicians, with the latest salvo coming from the governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin. “If you’re studying interpretive dance, God bless you, but there’s not a lot of jobs right now in America looking for people with that as a skill set,” Governor Bevin said in a speech in September.

Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize — writing, synthesis, problem solving — are sought after by employers. A 2017 study by David J. Deming, an associate professor of education and economics at Harvard, found jobs requiring both the so-called soft skills and thinking skills have seen the largest growth in employment and pay in the last three decades.

One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job. But a study by Burning Glass Technologies, a Boston-based company that analyzes job-market trends, concluded that if liberal arts graduates gain proficiency in one of eight technical skills, such as social media or data analysis, their prospects of landing entry-level jobs increase substantially.

The long-held belief by parents and students that liberal arts graduates are unemployable ignores the reality of the modern economy, where jobs require a mix of skills not easily packaged in a college major, said George Anders, author of “You Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a ‘Useless’ Liberal Arts Education.” In his book, Mr. Anders profiles graduates with degrees in philosophy, sociology and linguistics in jobs as diverse as sales, finance and market research.

“Once C.E.O.s see liberal arts graduates in action,” Mr. Anders said, “they come aboard to the idea that they need more of them.”

Myth 5: It’s important to choose a major early.

Why settle on a field of study before experiencing the smorgasbord college has to offer, be it study abroad, a club activity or a surprising elective?

Of students who said they felt committed to their major when they arrived on campus, 20 percent had selected a new major by the end of their first year, according to a national survey by the University of California, Los Angeles.

Changing majors can cost you a semester or two, especially if you switch to one unrelated to your first choice. To reduce that risk, several schools, including Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Lehman College in the Bronx, have created “meta-majors,” which group majors under a larger academic umbrella.

“We have moved away from trying to get students to choose their majors as they enter,” said Timothy Renick, Georgia State’s vice provost and vice president for enrollment management and student success.

Instead, all incoming students choose from one of seven meta-majors, representing large academic and work force fields, such as business, education and STEM. First semester, students gather in learning communities and register for a block of general-education courses within that meta-major. Programming is designed so that students get to know the differences between majors within the field.

“Students in our business meta-major get to understand the difference between finance, accounting, management and marketing so they can choose their major from an informed perspective,” Dr. Renick said. They usually do by the end of their first year.

Myth 6: You need a major.

A handful of colleges, including Indiana University and the Evergreen State College, offer the option to ignore the official list of majors and design a course of study. Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The Times, designed his at Indiana — enigmatology.

“Majors are artificial and restrictive,” said Christine Ortiz, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on leave to design a new nonprofit university that will have no majors, and also no lectures or classrooms.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“Majors result from the academic structure of the university, tied to the classic academic disciplines. There is no reason they need to be boxed up like that. They don’t take into account emerging fields that cross disciplines.”

Majors tend to lag behind changes in the workplace. No wonder fewer than a third of college graduates work in jobs related to their majors. And picking one based on today’s in-demand jobs is risky, said Dr. Webber of Temple, especially if the occupation is threatened by automation.

Hours later, on Saturday evening, a missile fired from Yemen came close to Riyadh before being shot down. Saudi Arabia later blamed Iran and Hezbollah for the missile, suggesting that they had aided the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen to fire it.

Before the world had a chance to absorb this news, the ambitious and aggressive Saudi Arabian crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the arrest of hundreds of Saudis, including members of the royal family, in what was either a crackdown on corruption, as Saudi officials put it, or a purge, as outside analysts have suggested.

It then emerged that the week before, Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, who has been sent on missions both to Israel and Saudi Arabia, had visited Riyadh on a previously undisclosed trip and met until the early morning hours with the crown prince. The White House has not announced what they discussed but officials privately said that they were meeting about the administration’s efforts to forge an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.

No one expects Saudi Arabia, which is mired in a military conflict in Yemen, to start another war itself. On Friday, Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said that Saudi Arabia had asked Israel to attack Lebanon, after essentially kidnapping Mr. Hariri.

“I’m not talking here about analysis, but information,” he said. “The Saudis asked Israel to attack Lebanon.”

He provided no evidence of his claim, but Western and regional analysts have also said that, given all the confusing and unexpected events and unpredictable players, they could not entirely rule out such a scenario.

Israeli officials, however, have been publicly predicting another war with Hezbollah, an increasingly well armed antagonist, while also vowing to do all they can to postpone it.

“There are now those in the region who would like Israel to go to war with Hezbollah and fight a Saudi war to the last Israeli,” said Ofer Zalzberg, a Jerusalem-based analyst for International Crisis Group. “There is no interest in that here.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long considered Iran to be Israel’s foremost enemy, a potential nuclear threat as well as a strategic adversary seeking to convert postwar Syria into a staging ground for attacks against Israel or into a corridor to transfer missiles and other weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon.

So Saudi Arabia’s stepped-up efforts to oppose Iranian influence in Lebanon drew measured applause in Jerusalem. But many Israelis fear that the aggressive actions by the Saudi crown prince could drag Israel into a war that it does not want.

Daniel Shapiro, a former United States ambassador to Israel, said that Israel and Saudi Arabia were pursuing similar goals at sharply different speeds and levels of proficiency.

“I’m not sure they’re aligned tactically,” he said in an interview. Prince Mohammed, he added, “seems very impatient to actually spark the confrontation.”

There are no signs of war preparations in Israel. The country is not mobilizing troops on its northern border or calling up reservists, and Mr. Netanyahu has given no indication that he sees a conflict as imminent.

Moreover, Israel’s war planners predict that the next war with Hezbollah may be catastrophic, particularly if it lasts more than a few days. Hezbollah now has more than 120,000 rockets and missiles, Israel estimates, enough to overwhelm Israeli missile defenses.

Many of them are long-range and accurate enough to bring down Tel Aviv high-rises, sink offshore gas platforms, knock out Ben-Gurion Airport or level landmark buildings across Israel.

Nor is Hezbollah necessarily hankering for battle with Israel, according to analysts who study the militant group closely. It is still fighting in Syria, where it has been backing the government of President Bashar al-Assad, and it is being drained by medical costs for wounded fighters and survivor benefits for the families of those killed, said Giora Eiland, a retired Israeli major general and former head of the country’s National Security Council.

“Hezbollah as an organization is in a very deep economic crisis today,” Mr. Eiland said. “But at the same time, the weaker they are, the more dependent they are on Iranian assistance — so they might have to comply with Iran’s instructions.”

But there have long been fears that now that the Syrian war — in which Hezbollah played a decisive role, gaining new influence, power and weapons — is almost over, Hezbollah’s enemies might seek to cut it down to size.

Mr. Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, implied Friday that its fight in Syria was nearly finished. If Saudi Arabia’s goal was to force Hezbollah to leave Syria, he said: “No problem. Our goal there has been achieved. It’s almost over anyway.”

World leaders have sought to tamp down tensions.

The American secretary of state Rex W. Tillerson warned Friday “against any party, within or outside Lebanon, using Lebanon as a venue for proxy conflicts or in any manner contributing to instability in that country,” a message apparently aimed at Hezbollah as well as Saudi Arabia.

President Emmanuel Macron of France left Saudi Arabia on Friday after a brief, last-minute meeting with the crown prince.

During the unexpected two-hour visit on Thursday, Mr. Macron “reiterated the importance France attaches to Lebanon’s stability, security, sovereignty and integrity,” his office said. He also discussed “the situation in Lebanon following the resignation of Prime Minister Hariri,” his office said, but provided no further details.

A group of countries and organizations interested in Lebanon’s stability met Friday with the Lebanese president, Michel Aoun, and issued a statement expressing “concern regarding the situation and prevailing uncertainty in Lebanon” and calling for Lebanon to be “shielded from tensions in the region.”

The members of the group, the International Support Group for Lebanon — including the United Nations, Britain, China, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States, as well as the European Union and the Arab League — are not all on the same side of the issues at stake so the statement seemed to reflect broad international concern.

At a news conference in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, before the meeting, Mr. Macron said he did not share Saudi Arabia’s “very harsh opinions” of Iran.



Analysts say a new war in the region is unlikely but some have warned that the increased tensions could provoke an economic crisis or even start a war accidentally. Miscalculations have started wars before, as in the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah.

Experts caution that Israel is often only a mistake or two from being drawn into combat.

“It’s a dangerous situation now,” said Amos Harel, the military reporter for Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper. “It only takes one provocation, another reaction, and it can get all of a sudden completely out of control.

Facebook’s current initiatives to crack down on fake news can, theoretically, be applicable to misinformation on other issues. However, there are several human and technical barriers that prevent misinformation about reproductive rights from being identified, checked and removed at the same — already slow — rate as other misleading stories.

First, the question of what’s considered a “fake news” site is not always black and white. Facebook says it has been tackling the sources of fake news by eliminating the ability to “spoof” domains and by deleting Facebook pages linked to spam activity. For example, this year Facebook identified and deleted more than 30 pages owned by Macedonian publishers, who used them to push out fake stories about United States politics, after alarms had been sounded about sites in the country spreading misinformation about the 2016 campaign. (Facebook says some of the sites may have been taken down for other terms-of-service violations.) But anti-abortion sites are different. They do not mimic real publications, and they publish pieces on real events alongside factually incorrect or thinly sourced stories, which helps blur the line between what’s considered a news blog and “fake news.”

Second, Facebook says one of its key aims in tackling fake news is to remove the profit incentive, because it says “most false news is financially motivated.” It says it hopes to do that by making it more difficult for the people behind the fake news sites to buy ads on its platform and by detecting and deleting spam accounts, which it says are a major force behind the spread of misinformation.

However, the incentive for the people who write content for anti-abortion news sites and Facebook pages is ideological, not financial. Anti-abortion, anti-science content isn’t being written by spammers hoping to make money, but by ordinary people who are driven by religious or political beliefs. Their aim isn’t to profit from ads. It’s to convince readers of their viewpoint: that abortion is morally wrong, that autism is caused by vaccines or that climate change isn’t real.

Finally, public pressure influences where Facebook directs its attention. Facebook may be focused on fake news and the United States election now, but its efforts to prevent the spread of misinformation in the buildup to the election were practically nonexistent. It took action only after intense scrutiny.

Now Facebook and its fact-checking partners say its focus is “on the worst of the worst, on the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain.” Simply put, without increased pressure, Facebook’s technical efforts and its human efforts, like fact-checkers’ trawling through flagged content, make it likely that the company, in the months to come, will be seeking out only the “obvious” flags of fake news stories and not the misinformation that is fueled by real people with no financial incentive. That is why those of us who are concerned by the misinformation around reproductive rights need to make ourselves heard.

The Irish government says it will hold a referendum next year on whether to relax the country’s strict ban on abortion. Some abortion-rights campaigners have expressed concern over the role of misinformation on social media platforms like Facebook in the lead-up to the vote, but it’s far from clear whether those concerns are being listened to.

Curbing the spread of fake news is no easy task, and Facebook says it cannot “become arbiters of truth” in the fight against fake news. But at the very least, the company can address its continuing role in inadvertently spreading false information about issues that go beyond the United States election and Russia.",Facebook Is Ignoring Anti-Abortion Fake News,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/opinion/facebook-fake-news-abortion.html

People tend to do things, like donate organs, when it’s the default option as opposed to something they need to request. They tend to be less likely to miss appointments if you tell them how many other patients show up for theirs. They tend to be more likely to engage in preventive behaviors like using sunscreen if you focus on the benefits, not the harms. Many are turning to ideas like these to improve medication adherence.

But those excited about the potential of behavioral economics should keep in mind the results of a recent study. It pulled out all the stops in trying to get patients who had a heart attack to be more compliant in taking their medication. (Patients’ adherence at such a time is surprisingly low, even though it makes a big difference in outcomes, so this is a major problem.)

Photo

Researchers randomly assigned more than 1,500 people to one of two groups. All had recently had heart attacks. One group received the usual care. The other received special electronic pill bottles that monitored patients’ use of medication. Those patients who took their drugs were entered into a lottery in which they had a 20 percent chance to receive $5 and a 1 percent chance to win $50 every day for a year.

That’s not all. The lottery group members could also sign up to have a friend or family member automatically be notified if they didn’t take their pills so that they could receive social support. They were given access to special social work resources. There was even a staff engagement adviser whose specific duty was providing close monitoring and feedback, and who would remind patients about the importance of adherence.

This was a kitchen-sink approach. It involved direct financial incentives, social support nudges, health care system resources and significant clinical management. It failed.

The time to first hospitalization for a cardiovascular problem or death was the same between the two groups. The time to any hospitalization and the total number of hospitalizations were the same. So were the medical costs. Even medication adherence — the process measure that might influence these outcomes — was no different between the two groups.

The researchers in this trial deserve praise for their frank assessment of their results, as well as for trying to brainstorm ways in which they might achieve success in the future. Getting patients to change their behavior is very hard. In the past, we’ve tried making drugs free to patients to get them to adhere to their medications and improve outcomes. That failed. We’ve tried lotteries (as in the study above) to nudge people to achieve better compliance. That failed.

Maybe financial incentives, and behavioral economics in general, work better in public health than in more direct health care. There have been successes, after all, with respect to weight loss — although these seemed to disappear over time. We’ve also seen promise with respect to smoking cessation, although these come with caveats as well.

Experts caution that the interventions that achieve success are often very intensive. They demand a great deal of attention, and can be quite expensive. Moreover, they are very focused, usually on a single issue or condition.

In a substantial rebuke, the FX Networks and FX Productions, which produce and broadcast several of his television shows, said Friday that they were ending their association with him. His overall production deal with FX was canceled, and he lost his role as executive producer – as well as the compensation that came with that title – on the FX comedy shows “Better Things” and “Baskets,” as well as the Amazon series “One Mississippi,” and a TBS animated series, “The Cops.”

TBS said in its own statement that production on “The Cops,” which was planned for a 2018 debut, had been “suspended until further review.”

Also on Friday, 3 Arts Entertainment, the company that had been managing Louis C.K., dropped him as a client. Two of the women who had experienced Louis C.K.’s misconduct believed that his manager, Dave Becky, wanted them to stop talking about their encounter with him. Mr. Becky denied making threats toward these women.

And Lewis Kay, who had been the comedian’s publicist, said in a Twitter post Friday, “As of today, I no longer represent Louis C.K.”

In their statement, the FX companies said, “Louis has now confirmed the truth of the reports relating to the five women victimized by his misconduct, which we were unaware of previously.”

The companies added, “As far as we know, his behavior over the past eight years on all five series he has produced for FX Networks and/or FX Productions has been professional.”

They continued, “However, now is not the time for him to make television shows. Now is the time for him to honestly address the women who have come forth to speak about their painful experiences, a process which he began today with his public statement.”

In that statement, Louis C.K. did not offer apologies to the women who shared their stories with the Times.

He said, however, “I have been remorseful of my actions. And I’ve tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I’m aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men who would never have put them in that position.”

Harassment Claims

Louis C.K. also said he needed to acknowledge “the hurt that I’ve brought on people who I work with.”

He added, “I’ve brought pain to my family, my friends, my children and their mother.”

Louis C.K. is just one of several powerful men who have recently faced rapid consequences after media reports brought attention to allegations of their sexual misconduct or harassment. Harvey Weinstein, the film producer and media executive; the actor Kevin Spacey; the filmmaker Brett Ratner; and the journalist Mark Halperin are among the prominent men to have experienced precipitous downfalls as accounts about them accumulated.

While Louis C.K. was one of the few men to admit to the conduct he’d been accused of, many people found his statement unsatisfactory and wondered why his behavior had not been addressed sooner. The actress Rose McGowan, who has said Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted her, wrote in a Twitter post on Friday, that she had heard stories about Louis C.K. two years ago even though she isn’t connected to the comedy scene. “Industry faux-shock is such a tired lie. I send my strength and love to all women hurt by him and the code of complicity.”

The distributor of Louis C.K.’s coming film, “I Love You, Daddy,” said Friday that it would not go ahead with its Nov. 17 release of the movie. The comedy, which he wrote and directed, was acquired by the entertainment company the Orchard in a $5 million deal. Louis C.K. stars in it as a TV comedy writer opposite John Malkovich as a notorious 68-year-old filmmaker who strikes up an uncomfortable relationship with the writer’s daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz), who has not yet turned 18.

[ Louis C.K. is accused by 5 women of sexual misconduct ]

Following preview screenings of “I Love You, Daddy,” several critics remarked on its troubling sexual politics and how certain scenes seemed to be commenting on Louis C.K.’s own reputation for misconduct.

HBO said that Louis C.K. had been dropped from the lineup of “Night of Too Many Stars,” a comedy benefit that it will broadcast Nov. 18, and that it had pulled other works of his from its on-demand service.

Netflix, which this year struck a deal with Louis C.K. to create two new stand-up specials for the streaming service, said on Friday that it will not produce the planned second special. (The first one, “Louis C.K. 2017,” was released in April.)

I feel like that’s a problem with political music.","“It’s amazing and very powerful, but it galvanizes the opinions of people in the audience who already agree with it,” Mr. Lang said of the piece. “And chances are the people who wouldn’t agree with it are not in the audience.”

But three works the Crossing will perform this weekend are different, Mr. Lang said, in particular because of their subtlety and deeply personal nature.

The text for Mr. Hearne’s piece “Consent,” for example, quotes old love letters he has written, as well as text messages that were used in the Steubenville rape case of 2013. An unsettling suite by Mr. Lang, “the national anthems,” repurposes anthem lyrics to reveal how, he said, “our civilization is very fragile, and we are terrified of losing it.”

And Ms. Shaw’s work “To the Hands” contains a movement of spoken numerical figures — data about displaced people around the world — over a solo instrument’s arpeggios that oscillate between beautiful order and unnerving dissonance.

“It’s just a sort of gentle smearing of something that is otherwise comfortable, and over time the repetition is really insidious and potent,” said Ms. Shaw, who made the piece’s parts available for free online with the note that any performance should come with “rigorous solicitation of donations for those without homes (locally and globally).”

In a round-table interview, the composers discussed how they approach political music, and whether musicians even have the right to engage in hot-button issues of the day. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

You write a piece of political music, then it’s performed. What comes next?

DAVID LANG I have my piece “the little match girl passion,” which is about whether people pay attention to homelessness and the suffering of those around us. People frequently use this piece to raise money. One of our jobs is to raise these issues and make these pieces be useful, but the truth is that the amount of money someone can make off a piece of contemporary music is probably pretty tiny compared to the problems of the world. A real point of these pieces is for us to figure out how to be better citizens. An entire community of people may have their minds on this issue, and then go out and change their communities.

TED HEARNE I totally agree. Using that particular piece to raise money is almost beside the point, I think.

What right do composers have to write about things like consent and the refugee crisis?

LANG I think all three of our pieces are about us examining how we feel about these topics. This authenticity question is a really interesting question for me. I think a lot of these issues of people figuring out who has the right to speak are important, and I agree there are some issues where the right to speak is really central to the issue of who actually gets to speak. But the other side of that problem, for me, is that some of these problems are so pervasive in our society that they’re going to need every single person to commit themselves to solving them in order to get addressed.

CAROLINE SHAW I’m not sure I can say that I should or that I can present work that’s meaningful and deeply engages with issues. But I want to try, and I have to keep trying. And I think there’s something about engaging with political issues specifically in choral music because it’s a very community-oriented art. There is, or at least there used to be, a really great tradition of community choirs around the world. You can write something that people sing together and talk about with each other, and that’s where the conversations have to start.

HEARNE I would never try to pretend that I’m not a white man. That’s a part of my identity, so examining that through my work is something that is necessary for me to do to try to get a better understanding of how to live in the world. I think that anybody doing that is valuable. Pretending to speak for somebody who had a completely different experience from you is a different thing.

What makes political music successful?

LANG It’s very hard to have a kind of music that changes someone’s mind without really noticing it. A really incredible piece of art about politics is “The Threepenny Opera.” No one is a good character, and no one tells you what to think. It’s this disturbing situation that’s also really enjoyable with music. The social message is something you have to decode, maybe weeks later as you think about it or sing the songs to yourself.

HEARNE I love “Threepenny Opera.” It’s very inspirational to me. It also has me thinking about ways an artist can use their work to create something that you couldn’t imagine. That’s a metaphor for what you can do in the world. When some formal idea is obliterated or when somebody samples a piece of music that has nothing to do with the genre, it creates this kind of chaos of reference or this juxtaposition that nobody could imagine. That is a political act.

Are there any common mistakes in writing political music?

LANG I never want anyone to think I am ordering them to do or feel something. There’s a lot of music that we listen to in our lives that is very good at making us feel something whether we want to or not, like film music. But when I write a piece of music where I want to cry, I don’t care where anybody else cries, and I don’t want to order anyone to cry at a specific moment. I feel like that’s a problem with political music.

SHAW But there are artists where it is extremely important to be clear exactly what they think and they want you to think that way, like a lot of political hip-hop music. It’s just not how I operate.

After 13 years in Israel, he returned to New York in 1969 to become director of the Jewish Museum, where he sought to reconcile its liturgical agenda with more contemporary art.
In the early 1970s, after the Jewish Museum presented an exhibition curated by the photographer Cornell Capa, Mr. Katz persuaded Mr. Capa that his International Center for Photography needed a museum to house its collection.
Asked in 1997 by The Times to draw on his many professional incarnations to define art, Mr. Katz replied: “People look at art as if it were a checklist; the label is sometimes more important than the work of art.
“If it’s not visual and it’s not visceral and it’s not communicative, it’s not a work of art.”","Typically, he said, after such investments, the only legacy of those exhibitions was a catalog.

“The most logical extension of this fleeting experience,” he said, “is a film, with a long shelf life and a huge audience.”

Mr. Katz had not considered himself a serious student in high school and entered college contemplating a career in journalism or theater.

He appeared in plays while in college and performed sock-puppet shows for children on weekends, but abandoned thoughts of a theatrical career after he was found to have a minor speech impediment and had what he described, without elaborating, as “an unfortunate onstage experience” while performing in an Ibsen play.

His epiphany was a 90-minute standing-room-only lecture without notes at Columbia by the art historian Meyer Schapiro in which “connections were made like so many synapses firing — everything from psychoanalysis and religion to politics and semiotics,” Mr. Katz wrote in his autobiography, “The Exhibitionist: Living Museums, Loving Museums” (2016).

“Those 90 minutes sealed the deal,” he wrote. “I would study art history and archaeology.”

Karl L. Katz — his son said the middle initial did not stand for anything — was born on Oct. 22, 1929, in Brooklyn to Maurice Katz, a salesman, and the former Rose Leibovitz, both of whom were active in Jewish and Zionist causes.

A yeshiva student, he graduated from Midwood High School in Brooklyn and was muddling his way through Long Island University when his older brother suggested he transfer to Columbia’s School of General Studies, which had been reorganized into an undergraduate college after World War II to accommodate returning veterans.

He earned a bachelor’s degree in art history and Semitic studies and a master’s in fine arts and archaeology at Columbia. He completed his doctoral thesis in early Hebrew manuscripts from Yemen but never fulfilled the language requirement for his doctorate; he said he could not bring himself to learn German so soon after the Holocaust.

In addition to his son, Mr. Katz, who lived in Manhattan, is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Segal, whom he married in 1978, and his brother, Elihu.

Mr. Katz began his career when he was recruited in 1953 as an educator at the Met during the exhibition “From the Land of the Bible.” He then went to Israel as an archaeologist and was hired as curator of the National Bezalel Museum, the forerunner to the Israel Museum, on which he collaborated with Teddy Kollek, the mayor of Jerusalem.

After 13 years in Israel, he returned to New York in 1969 to become director of the Jewish Museum, where he sought to reconcile its liturgical agenda with more contemporary art.

He left in 1971 to rejoin the Met as chairman for special projects, a job he held until 1980. He then directed the museum’s office of film and television until 1991, when he founded Muse.

Among the documentaries that company has produced are “Degenerate Art” (1993), about an exhibition commissioned by Hitler to denigrate modern art; “Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry” (2012), about the Chinese artist and activist; and “Herb & Dorothy” (2008), about the art collectors Herbert and Dorothy Vogel.

In the early 1970s, after the Jewish Museum presented an exhibition curated by the photographer Cornell Capa, Mr. Katz persuaded Mr. Capa that his International Center for Photography needed a museum to house its collection. It opened in 1974 in a former mansion on Fifth Avenue.

Asked in 1997 by The Times to draw on his many professional incarnations to define art, Mr. Katz replied: “People look at art as if it were a checklist; the label is sometimes more important than the work of art.

“My sense is that looking at art is like having a conversation,” he continued. “If it’s not visual and it’s not visceral and it’s not communicative, it’s not a work of art.”","Karl Katz, Museum Director in New York and Israel, Dies at 88",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/obituaries/karl-katz-museum-director-in-new-york-and-israel-dies-at-88.html

In his book “Active Faith: How Christians Are Changing the Soul of American Politics,” former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed described 1989, the year the group was founded, as a dark one for religious conservatives. The once-powerful televangelists Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker were discredited by lurid scandals. In Virginia and New Jersey, anti-abortion Republican candidates lost gubernatorial races to pro-choice Democrats. “The number of conservative votes in Congress dwindled to barely enough to sustain President Bush’s abortion vetoes,” Reed wrote. The movement that had been so formidable at the start of the decade “seemed dead, and cultural elites danced on its grave.”

Seeking resurrection, the religious right turned to local politics, investing in the bench of the Republican Party. “We are training people to be effective — to be elected to school boards, to city councils, to state legislatures and to key positions in political parties,” Pat Robertson wrote in a 1991 Christian Coalition fund-raising letter. The next year, Sarah Palin would get her start by winning a seat on the Wasilla City Council, part of a wave of evangelicals pouring into local politics.

If there is one threadlike silver lining to Donald Trump’s election last year, it’s that it has forced the left to emulate the Christian right’s extremely successful strategy for building political power. For decades, Democrats have paid far less attention to local politics than Republicans. That’s part of the reason the party lost almost a thousand state legislative seats — there are 7383 in total — over the course of Barack Obama’s presidency. But in the last year, citizens nationwide — particularly women and people of color — who were horrified by Trump’s victory have decided to run for office in their own communities. And on Tuesday, many of them won.

The most important Democratic victory on Tuesday was that of Gov.-elect Ralph Northam in Virginia. But there were countless down-ballot triumphs across the country, some of which had a cinematic sweetness. In New Jersey, a 32-year-old named Ashley Bennett was disgusted when John Carman, a Republican county official, posted a Facebook meme that said, “Will the woman’s protest be over in time for them to cook dinner?” Though Bennett told me she never before thought of running for office, she decided to challenge Carman, and won. In Virginia, a 33-year-old trans woman named Danica Roem defeated a Republican state legislator who’d introduced a so-called “bathroom bill.” Crystal Murillo, a 23-year-old Mexican-American in Aurora, Colo., who was gutted by Trump’s election, unseated her Trump-supporting city councilwoman.

For the past year, the Democratic Party has been engaged in an angry internal debate over identity politics, which are often framed in opposition to a purely class-based appeal. At times, it feels like progressives are doomed to re-litigate the 2016 Democratic primary forever, tearing each other apart while Trump tears down the republic. But if you squint at Tuesday’s results, you can sort of see a synthesis emerging between Obama and Hillary Clinton’s theory of the emerging Democratic electorate — in which Democrats win by appealing to a coalition of white professionals and minorities — and Bernie Sanders’s focus on grass-roots organizing and economic populism.

In some ways the election was the revenge of the Obama coalition. Educated white liberals joined people of color to elect an amazingly diverse group of candidates. A Latina single mother, Michelle De La Isla, was elected mayor of Topeka, Kan. Wilmot Collins, a refugee from Liberia, won the mayoral race in Helena, Mont. Seattle elected its first lesbian mayor, Jenny Durkan. After a year in which liberals have been bludgeoned by demands that they abandon identity politics and empathize with resentful Trump voters, the election was a reminder that white men needn’t be the center of the political universe.",Revenge of the Obama Coalition,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/opinion/democrats-election-obama-coalition.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Why not make a full-length documentary about his issues with the Kwik-E-Mart owner, Mr. Kondabolu thought, which could serve as a jumping-off point to talk about all the other things the comic had been stewing about?
In a 2007 interview, Mr. Azaria, who declined to comment for this article, conceded that his rendering of an Indian accent is “not tremendously accurate.” Mr. Kondabolu agrees.

Why not make a full-length documentary about his issues with the Kwik-E-Mart owner, Mr. Kondabolu thought, which could serve as a jumping-off point to talk about all the other things the comic had been stewing about?

Working with the director Michael Melamedoff, the film crew began production in April 2016, greenlit by truTV as part of its shift to comedy programming. To tackle the project, he enlisted some high-powered help. In one sequence, the actor Aziz Ansari (“Master of None”) describes being in a car with his dad when a man drives up and asks them where the nearest Quik-E-Mart is. Dr. Vivek Murthy, the 19th surgeon general of the United States, talks about enduring the taunts of an Apu-imitating bully in the seventh grade. And Maulik Pancholy (“30 Rock”) recounts how much he hated going into 7-Eleven stores as a kid, lest his friends see an Indian store clerk and start doing “the Apu thing.”

In the film, Mr. Kondabolu places Apu within the broader history of Hollywood’s depiction of Indians, including Peter Sellers’s brownface rendition of an idiot in the 1968 Blake Edwards film “The Party” and the Indians feasting on chilled monkey brains in Steven Spielberg’s “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.” He also reached out to a who’s-who of South Asian actors to talk about their experiences in Hollywood, in the vein of Philip Kan Gotanda’s 1987 play “Yankee Dawg You Die” and Mr. Ansari’s 2015 “Master of None” episode “Indians on TV.”

Among the anecdotes: Sakina Jaffrey (“House of Cards”) cornering the market on “weeping, ethnic moms of potential rapists and murderers,” and Mr. Penn being asked to play a character named Taj Mahal, which he credits with his subsequent starring roles in the “Harold and Kumar” movies. “For the record,” Mr. Penn said in an interview, “I had a great time doing it.”

The narrative spine of the film, however, chronicles Mr. Kondabolu’s attempts to trace the character’s origin story and secure an interview with Mr. Azaria, the voice of Apu since the character’s creation in 1990.

In a 2007 interview, Mr. Azaria, who declined to comment for this article, conceded that his rendering of an Indian accent is “not tremendously accurate.” Mr. Kondabolu agrees. In the film, he describes Mr. Azaria’s rendition as “a white guy doing an impression of a white guy making fun of my father.”

Onscreen, Dana Gould, a writer and executive producer on “The Simpsons,” tries to explain what makes Apu humorous. Barney, the town wino, is funny because he’s a drunkard, he explains; Smithers, Mr. Burns’s sycophantic assistant, is funny because he’s closeted. (Since that interview, Smithers has come out.) Apu? He’s funny because he sounds like an Indian, or at least Mr. Azaria’s version of one. “There are accents that by their nature, to white Americans, I can only speak from experience, sound funny,” Mr. Gould says in the film.

“This isn’t just a blind spot that the writers had,” Mr. Melamedoff said. “This was a blind spot we all had, on a national level.”

The unintended result: a generation of Indian actors being asked to channel Apu in countless auditions. “Here you are, you’ve gone to theater and film school, you’re pursuing this dream, and you’re being told, do it just like Apu from ‘The Simpsons,’” Mr. Penn said in an interview.

Still unclear is who originally pushed for Apu’s broad accent. Was Mr. Azaria asked by producers “how offensive can you make it,” as he claimed in that earlier interview? Or did he come up with the accent unprompted, as the “Simpsons” writer Mike Reiss said in a 2016 podcast?

Mr. Kondabolu pressed Mr. Azaria for an interview. The two exchanged emails, had one phone conversation (untaped) and even discussed the possibility of conducting the interview on neutral ground (on the podcast “WTF With Marc Maron,” say, or on NPR’s “Fresh Air,” with Terry Gross).

“Hari was sort of like, what’s the purpose if I can’t get Hank,” said Utkarsh Ambudkar (“Pitch Perfect”), who, as Apu’s Indian-American nephew on a 2016 episode of the series, blasted Apu to his animated face as a sellout and a stereotype.

“And I was like, are you kidding me?” Mr. Ambudkar said. “You got all these brown people to come together and talk about something. We could have been talking about model trains! But some 15-year-old kid is going to be like, look at all these powerful, talented, visible brown people in one place. I can do this, too.”",You Love ‘The Simpsons’?

Hours later, on Saturday evening, a missile fired from Yemen came close to Riyadh before being shot down. Saudi Arabia later blamed Iran and Hezbollah for the missile, suggesting that they had aided the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen to fire it.

Before the world had a chance to absorb this news, the ambitious and aggressive Saudi Arabian crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the arrest of hundreds of Saudis, including members of the royal family, in what was either a crackdown on corruption, as Saudi officials put it, or a purge, as outside analysts have suggested.

It then emerged that the week before, Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, who has been sent on missions both to Israel and Saudi Arabia, had visited Riyadh on a previously undisclosed trip and met until the early morning hours with the crown prince. The White House has not announced what they discussed but officials privately said that they were meeting about the administration’s efforts to forge an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.

No one expects Saudi Arabia, which is mired in a military conflict in Yemen, to start another war itself. On Friday, Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said that Saudi Arabia had asked Israel to attack Lebanon, after essentially kidnapping Mr. Hariri.

“I’m not talking here about analysis, but information,” he said. “The Saudis asked Israel to attack Lebanon.”

He provided no evidence of his claim, but Western and regional analysts have also said that, given all the confusing and unexpected events and unpredictable players, they could not entirely rule out such a scenario.

Israeli officials, however, have been publicly predicting another war with Hezbollah, an increasingly well armed antagonist, while also vowing to do all they can to postpone it.

“There are now those in the region who would like Israel to go to war with Hezbollah and fight a Saudi war to the last Israeli,” said Ofer Zalzberg, a Jerusalem-based analyst for International Crisis Group. “There is no interest in that here.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long considered Iran to be Israel’s foremost enemy, a potential nuclear threat as well as a strategic adversary seeking to convert postwar Syria into a staging ground for attacks against Israel or into a corridor to transfer missiles and other weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon.

So Saudi Arabia’s stepped-up efforts to oppose Iranian influence in Lebanon drew measured applause in Jerusalem. But many Israelis fear that the aggressive actions by the Saudi crown prince could drag Israel into a war that it does not want.

Daniel Shapiro, a former United States ambassador to Israel, said that Israel and Saudi Arabia were pursuing similar goals at sharply different speeds and levels of proficiency.

“I’m not sure they’re aligned tactically,” he said in an interview. Prince Mohammed, he added, “seems very impatient to actually spark the confrontation.”

There are no signs of war preparations in Israel. The country is not mobilizing troops on its northern border or calling up reservists, and Mr. Netanyahu has given no indication that he sees a conflict as imminent.

Moreover, Israel’s war planners predict that the next war with Hezbollah may be catastrophic, particularly if it lasts more than a few days. Hezbollah now has more than 120,000 rockets and missiles, Israel estimates, enough to overwhelm Israeli missile defenses.

Many of them are long-range and accurate enough to bring down Tel Aviv high-rises, sink offshore gas platforms, knock out Ben-Gurion Airport or level landmark buildings across Israel.

Nor is Hezbollah necessarily hankering for battle with Israel, according to analysts who study the militant group closely. It is still fighting in Syria, where it has been backing the government of President Bashar al-Assad, and it is being drained by medical costs for wounded fighters and survivor benefits for the families of those killed, said Giora Eiland, a retired Israeli major general and former head of the country’s National Security Council.

“Hezbollah as an organization is in a very deep economic crisis today,” Mr. Eiland said. “But at the same time, the weaker they are, the more dependent they are on Iranian assistance — so they might have to comply with Iran’s instructions.”

But there have long been fears that now that the Syrian war — in which Hezbollah played a decisive role, gaining new influence, power and weapons — is almost over, Hezbollah’s enemies might seek to cut it down to size.

Mr. Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, implied Friday that its fight in Syria was nearly finished. If Saudi Arabia’s goal was to force Hezbollah to leave Syria, he said: “No problem. Our goal there has been achieved. It’s almost over anyway.”

World leaders have sought to tamp down tensions.

The American secretary of state Rex W. Tillerson warned Friday “against any party, within or outside Lebanon, using Lebanon as a venue for proxy conflicts or in any manner contributing to instability in that country,” a message apparently aimed at Hezbollah as well as Saudi Arabia.

President Emmanuel Macron of France left Saudi Arabia on Friday after a brief, last-minute meeting with the crown prince.

During the unexpected two-hour visit on Thursday, Mr. Macron “reiterated the importance France attaches to Lebanon’s stability, security, sovereignty and integrity,” his office said. He also discussed “the situation in Lebanon following the resignation of Prime Minister Hariri,” his office said, but provided no further details.

A group of countries and organizations interested in Lebanon’s stability met Friday with the Lebanese president, Michel Aoun, and issued a statement expressing “concern regarding the situation and prevailing uncertainty in Lebanon” and calling for Lebanon to be “shielded from tensions in the region.”

The members of the group, the International Support Group for Lebanon — including the United Nations, Britain, China, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States, as well as the European Union and the Arab League — are not all on the same side of the issues at stake so the statement seemed to reflect broad international concern.

At a news conference in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, before the meeting, Mr. Macron said he did not share Saudi Arabia’s “very harsh opinions” of Iran.



Analysts say a new war in the region is unlikely but some have warned that the increased tensions could provoke an economic crisis or even start a war accidentally. Miscalculations have started wars before, as in the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah.

Experts caution that Israel is often only a mistake or two from being drawn into combat.

“It’s a dangerous situation now,” said Amos Harel, the military reporter for Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper. “It only takes one provocation, another reaction, and it can get all of a sudden completely out of control.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — If you were not aware what a Wall Street reformer might want, you will learn it today in Jules Markey’s puzzle. This was a nice midweek theme that kept its secret until the very end for me.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Markey offers us a list theme of phrases that feel fresh: Three of the four make their New York Times Crossword debuts today, as does the revealer. Hidden in each phrase is a word that can be used before the word “BANKS,” and solvers are directed to those words by the circled/shaded squares.

For example, at 17A, the answer to the clue “Weave or tailgate, say” is DRIVE RECKLESSLY. The revealer at 62A, BREAK UP THE BANKS, is a hint that the ultimate answer to 17A is RIVER BANKS.

Tricky Clues

1A/1D: Were you flummoxed by the “Drug referenced in ‘The Joyous Cosmology’ ”? Here’s how to solve that one: First, it’s only three letters, so that narrows things down quite a bit. Second, 1A is fairly easy: The famous LOCH Lomond is in Scotland. With the L in the first square, the answer has to be LSD.

18D: R.V. TRIP is a bit random to my ears, but I know people vacation in Winnebagos.

50D: I didn’t know the director Hal ASHBY, although I know the film “Shampoo” that he directed. I guessed at ASHER, realized it was wrong when I solved 70A’s YMCAS, and guessed again at ASHBY.

Constructor Notes

The idea for this puzzle came during the election season of 2016. The revealer was heard and seen quite often at many campaign rallies, and it’s 15 letters long! It was quite natural then to try to turn it into a puzzle theme. I first thought to use the names of some banks in phrases but found that really wasn’t working, so i quickly settled on types of banks instead. What you see are the theme entries I first came up with, I’m pretty happy with the 4-1; 1-2-1; 1-4; 1-2-1 break patterns. After acceptance, I sent Will a version with all the theme entries spanning the grid, but he felt the fill had been too compromised, so he stayed with this version. Thanks to Will, Joel and team for polishing it up. I hope it was a pleasurable solve.

The neighborhood exploded. Angry black residents assailed the driver, who escaped via a volunteer Jewish ambulance crew. Two hours later, a crowd surrounded and stabbed a rabbinical student named Yankel Rosenbaum, who died of a wound not noticed at the hospital.

Three days of mayhem followed, with bands of black residents taking over the streets, some chanting “Heil Hitler” or “Kill the Jews,” and Jewish residents accusing the black mayor of permitting a “pogrom,” or organized massacre of an ethnic group. Crowds hurled bricks and bottles at police patrols, forcing them to run for their lives; the mayor and police commissioner also came under attack. Network news reports showed buildings and police cars on fire, and a mayor who appeared powerless — some said unwilling — to restore order.

Finally, the mayor and police department changed tactics, from negotiating to arresting the combatants. The fires and crowds dissipated. The news cameras went home. But the damage was done.

In his office a quarter-century later, Mr. Dinkins dismissed a question about whether, had he changed tactics one night sooner, he might have won re-election.

“You don’t know that until after the fact,” he said. “I said to the police brass, Whatever you guys are doing, it ain’t working. You need to get it together. But whether some police thought that I wanted them to be lenient on blacks attacking Jews — I can’t imagine how they would have thought that — but that was not the case. I got accused of that, and that’s painful.”

Had he won, in turn, his place in history might have been different, said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. The police cadets he had authorized would have hit the streets on his watch; crime might have really dropped, as it did under Mr. Giuliani, aided by the end of the crack epidemic; and the Walt Disney Company’s restoration of the New Amsterdam Theater in 1997, which began the transformation of 42nd Street (the deal was started by Mr. Dinkins and closed by Mr. Giuliani), would have lifted his mayoralty.

Mr. Dinkins declined to speculate. “The action that one takes in a circumstance like that ought not be based on what will get me votes or lose me votes,” he said. “It ought to be based on what is the right thing to do. Everybody’s a whole lot smarter after the fact.”

New Yorkers do not always love their mayors. Mr. de Blasio, in a July poll by Quinnipiac University, had an approval rating of just 50 percent, with only 46 percent of respondents saying he deserved re-election. After three years in office, Mr. Bloomberg had an approval rating of just 43 percent.

Neither met any real resistance to re-election. Mr. Giuliani finished his first term with a 62 percent approval rating, but sunk badly in his second, before he rebounded with his dynamism after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Mr. de Blasio, who was a junior staffer under Mr. Dinkins, said Mr. Dinkins’s problem was an image created for him by the tabloids, which were still loud and powerful in the early ’90s.

“Dinkins got a raw deal largely because of race,” Mr. de Blasio said in a telephone interview before his re-election. “And he got a raw deal because he was not a loud, showy personality and he wasn’t always trying to claim credit. But any normal assessment of history would say, wait a minute, he added cops, that’s why this turned around.”

“The thing I learned from that is an audacity of how to deal with what appeared to be an intractable problem,” Mr. de Blasio added. “The fact that we’re the safest big city in America today directly links to his actions with getting resources from Albany to get us the size of the police force we needed.

“None of his predecessors figured out how to do it. I’m not sure his successor, who took a lot of the credit for work done with resources Dinkins got — I’m not sure his successor could have pulled it off in Albany as a political reality.”",David Dinkins Doesn’t Think He Failed.

But solutions are still in the formation stage. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for instance, said late last month that it would establish a code of conduct for members but noted that such action was “a complex process that will take some time.”

Melissa Silverstein, the founder of Women and Hollywood, a nonprofit that advocates for gender parity in the film business, said the involvement of Ms. Winfrey and other major stars was encouraging.

“There is a real desire to not let this moment pass,” she said. “When Oprah gets involved, you have a real chance.”

Say you want to show a friend Los Angeles. Taking her to lunch at Grand Central Market might be a good place to begin.

For the last century, the downtown landmark has hawked produce, spices and other goods to Angelenos of all races and classes. And more recently, the market has gentrified. (Goodbye apothecary. Hello Instagram-worthy egg sandwich!)

The bustle at lunch hour remains palpable, though and a few old-guard food vendors are still standing. In a town where people spend hours alone in their cars, the city’s immigrants, bankers and tourists continue to rub shoulders at Broadway and Hill Street.

Last week, after years of financial tumult, the historic market changed hands. Langdon Street Capital bought it from the Yellin Co., whose late founder purchased it in 1984, confident that a downtown renaissance was coming.

Locals have watched warily as that very renaissance has caused the market to undergo a rapid transformation. The new owners say they understand the anxiety and promise not to change much.

“I love the market,” said Adam Daneshgar, president of Langdon Street Capital. “This is a passionate project for us. The market holds such a significant place in the city.”

“We do believe there’s some greater potential for it,” he added. “But we love it as is.”

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Everyone have a glass of milk ready? Thanks to Herre Schouwerwou, we have a tasty snack in our puzzle today. We’re just going to have to find it.

Today’s Theme

This isn’t going to be as simple as taking your snack out of a cardboard box. It’s midweek, so you’re going to have to do a little detective work.

As it happens, our snack today is on both sides of a black square, as the revealer clues at 54- and 56A say. We are told that the lunchbox items we are looking for are ANIMAL CRACKERS, and the four that we are given are “cracked” by that black square.

Still don’t see them? Here’s one: 17A is MCGREGOR and 18A is I’LL ASK, and the two entries are separated by a single black square. If you look closely and even scratch and sniff the entries, which have been scented to smell like the aforementioned ANIMAL CRACKERS so you can easily track them down [Don’t listen to her. And for the love of all that is holy, do not scratch your screens. Or your newspapers. — Ed.], the last letters of MCGREGOR and the first letters of I’LL ASK spell out the cracked GORILLA:

MCGREGOR / I’LL ASK

Now you find the other CRACKERS, and don’t forget to drink your milk.

Tricky Clues

24D: I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that this is more of a West Coast thing, but the portmanteau of “smoke” and “haze” is SMAZE.

35D: BOATS take you from riverbank to riverbank, so they are the “Connection between banks?”

Constructor Notes

DISCLAIMER: No animals were harmed in the making of this puzzle. I don’t recall the exact inspiration for this puzzle, but I was probably hungry and noticed an animal split between two entries in another crossword. To limit the theme choices, I decided to use only animals in the current Barnum’s box (according to Wikipedia) that were five letters or longer. The other decision was where to place the revealer. I’m not a fan of center placement and that would mean changing the grid to 14 or 16 squares wide or just having ANIMAL CRACKER, which wasn’t great. You can’t eat just one! So I went with the “cracked” revealer that fortunately echoed the theme. Will liked the concept, but asked to remove some iffy fill and to replace HIPPO, which was the only shortened entry. Of two revised submissions, the one that had the longest split entries was chosen over the one that had VEGANS crossing ANIMAL. Kudos to Will and Joel for the double “parked” clues for 49- and 50-Across. Hope this satisfies your crossword snacking pleasure!

Here’s another sign of progress: Believe it or not, corporate directors are more active in their oversight than they used to be. Egregious board practices and chummy appointments are less common.

From the Archives Read some of the notable articles, columns and investigations from Gretchen Morgenson over the last two decades.

Nell Minow is a corporate governance expert and vice chairwoman at ValueEdge Advisors, a firm that guides institutional shareholders on reducing risk in their portfolios. She has been rattling cages in the governance field since the mid-1980s and says she’s seen a definite improvement in boardroom makeup and practices.

“When I started in this field, O. J. Simpson was on five boards, including the audit committee of Infinity Broadcasting,” she recalled in an interview. “And at another company, the C.E.O.’s father was on the compensation committee. We’ve come a long way.”

That’s not to say that problems arising from sleepy and clubby boards have been eradicated. “Exhibit A is executive compensation,” Ms. Minow said. “The first C.E.O. pay package I ever complained about was $11 million. The very fact that that has gone completely berserk shows that boards are still a long way from where they should be.”

A case in point: Thomas M. Rutledge, the head of Charter Communications, who received $98 million in 2016, according to Equilar, a compensation analytics company. Yes, he’s an outlier, but the average chief executive compensation at 200 large public companies last year was almost $20 million, Equilar said.

Something else that hasn’t changed over the decades is analyst and investor reliance on companies’ creative earnings calculations. These figures, which do not conform to generally accepted accounting practices, typically exclude costs that companies incur in their operations. Such costs include stock awards given to executives and employees and merger expenses. Excluding them makes a company’s results look more dazzling than they otherwise would.

Inventive earnings calculations, while more prevalent today, were very popular in the lead-up to the dot-com crash. Back then, analysts valued companies based on imaginative, nonfinancial metrics like the number of page views a retail website received or the percentage of “engaged shoppers” visiting a site. That didn’t end well, even for many companies that had exhibited highly engaged shoppers and millions of views.

“I find it ironic that GAAP is much better than it has been for a long time, but analysts have more disdain for it,” Mr. Ciesielski said, referring to generally accepted accounting principles. “They blindly accept the methodology that management gives them. Folks prefer darkness, I guess.”

To be sure, embracing management’s preferred financial figures isn’t as perilous when stock prices are rocketing. Bull markets cover a multitude of sins, after all. But as the dot-com episode showed, genuine earnings growth — the kind companies can take to the bank — becomes a crucial underpinning when share prices turn down. That’s not true with financial metrics that can only be characterized as “earnings before the bad stuff.”

My search for truths on Wall Street and elsewhere over the years has sometimes raised hackles. That’s to the good. It wasn’t my job to be part of a company’s spin machine.

But responses from my subjects could get a little kooky. A favorite example occurred in the early 2000s, and it involved a major Wall Street firm.

I had written about an arbitration case that an investor client had brought against the firm. The firm prevailed in the matter, and the general counsel convened a dinner to celebrate.

In a phone conversation, the firm’s general counsel told me that the menu for the dinner had featured a photograph of me, placed inside a red circle with a slash though it. The general counsel told me how he had scoured the web for just the right picture. The menu garnered lots of laughs from the attendees, he added.

I never did find out what that celebration cost the firm’s shareholders.

Incidents like that, however, were relatively rare. And they were far outweighed by the appreciation that readers expressed.

“You must continue your work of skewering people and customs in our capitalist society that abuse the process,” a reader in Jackson, Miss., wrote in 2001. Others expressed thanks for my being “a good and consistent questioner,” for writing for the “financially illiterate,” for pushing to make the rules for investing fair and firm.

And I loved receiving a Christmas card from a reader in Maryland a couple of years ago that simply said: “Thank you for telling truth!”

I can mock his clothing and speculate on his abilities in the bedroom. I can tell his girlfriend that she can do better. I can smack him down, like an insect.

Even better, if this man persists in interrupting me, I can signal to a bouncer and have him kicked out.

Yes. I can have a rude man removed from my workplace. I wonder if Hope Hicks, the White House communications director, might want to have that power. Wouldn’t any woman?

But the moment a female comic steps offstage, her power dissipates. She is a woman, again. A famous comic can masturbate in front of her and his powerful manager can tell her to stop complaining about it. In standup comedy, the contrast between those two states is so depressingly clear. We get to be the person onstage who we wish were offstage.

There’s a Hulu documentary called “Too Funny to Fail,” about Dana Carvey’s sketch show on ABC. Louis C.K. was the head writer, the guy who presumably did the hiring. When I started watching it, of course I noticed that all the writers on the show were men. And they are all great — not a dud in the bunch. But were there a couple of great female writers who didn’t even try to get a job on that show because they’d heard weird stuff about the guy who did the hiring? Are those women still in the business?

I wonder if there’s a parallel universe where I was born male and became a comic. Am I rich in that universe? Do I headline stadiums? Is my wife taking care of my son so that I can focus exclusively on my career? Am I better at networking with men because I’m not worried about sending the wrong message? Do I hang out after my show and have drinks because I know that will help me get work?

All new comics need the same thing: huge amounts of stage time. There are no shortcuts in standup comedy. The quest to become a good comedian is brutal. It takes at least 10 years of performing, almost every night. You get that performing time in at open mics, where you have to line up during the day for a spot that night, at open mics that run until 1 or 2 a.m., at shows where you have to talk two, or 10, friends into coming just so that you can have a chance to perform.

Both male and female comics have to do these things. But if you also have to maneuver around a problematic guy, you’ll miss some opportunities. If you perform 10 times a week and your male counterpart performs 12 times a week, he will get better faster. And because you won’t get paid work until you’re good, your quest will take longer.

Often when I am part of a predominantly male lineup, I will watch the women in the crowd. After the third or fourth man in a row, some of them look tired. I see them thinking, “Another one?”

When a female comic takes the stage on such a night, there is often palpable joy from the women in the audience. For a few minutes, they don’t have to look at the world through male eyes. It’s a relief, an end to dude fatigue. I have never understood why male comics put up with all-male or mostly male lineups, why they aren’t demanding to follow a female comic. The audience will be so much more excited about you if you’re not the sixth man in a row.

After the allegations about Louis C.K. were made public on the record, a friend texted me the names of two more famous male standup comics who she heard are “next.” It is so strange to see sexual harassment being taken seriously, at long last. It has made me examine my own life, 30 years of swimming under, over and around sharks. What could I have accomplished if I’d been able to put that energy elsewhere?

Of all Puerto Rico’s continuing miseries seven weeks after Hurricane Maria’s devastation, the most blatantly unjust is that islanders have been denied the more generous and swifter food relief distributed to storm victims this year in Texas and Florida under the emergency food stamp program.

Yes, both the island and mainland victims are United States citizens. But not all citizens are created equal: A 35-year-old congressional budget cap on Puerto Rico’s food stamp program has limited the amount of disaster aid immediately available. Texas and Florida have no such federal restraints and were able to quickly increase food stamp help in the face of the hurricane damage last summer.

It is hard to argue with Puerto Rican officials pointing to the disparity as painful evidence of a colonial second-class status suffered by citizens of this American territory, citizens who lack political clout, voting representation in Congress or a say in who’s in the White House.

Puerto Rico already was fighting bankruptcy before the hurricane hit. Since then, nearly 60 percent of the island’s power generation remains offline, its tourist and farming economies have been crippled and 100,000 of its 3.4 million residents joined a growing exodus to the mainland (where they at least will gain full federal voting rights). It will take months more to install temporary tarps on the roofs of tens of thousands of ruined houses and import more than 50,000 utility power poles and 6,500 miles of cable. There is also disturbing evidence, as Frances Robles reported in The Times, that the lack of power may be killing the very sick and the very old in overheated hospitals and nursing homes.

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

Photo

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

It was as if someone aimed a fire hose at everything inside, and left it running for hours, she said; two weeks later, Maria turned the hose on again.

They have replaced or boarded over the openings, but the walls inside are “still wet to the touch,” she said. “The bathroom roof is falling apart. There’s a lot of mold, greenish and bluish, coming out of the walls.”

Nearly everything they owned was ruined. An outer wall of their apartment, in a building in the Tutu High Rise Community, shifted in one of the storms, so the rooms flood anew with each rainfall. Their only way to cook was on a campfire, and with no refrigeration, they had to be careful to buy only as much food as they could prepare and eat each day. Across the islands, mosquitoes and flies proliferate in the standing water and rotting garbage, and like many people, Ms. Mahoney, unable to close her home to the elements, worries about a disease outbreak.

Now, she has an added worry, an infant to care for — Trinity Luisa Mathurin, born in a hospital on Oct. 19.

The baby’s arrival helped convince the parents that they had to move, Ms. Mahoney said, “because it’s not sanitary.”

But she is acutely aware that others are less fortunate. She and Mr. Mathurin have been sheltering neighbors whose apartment lost entire walls, so that their furniture literally blew away.

With many homes destroyed, their family is not high on the list to get a more intact unit in the Tutu complex, a public housing project — but that is as it should be, Ms. Mahoney said. The storms left their 2011 Toyota Yaris with shattered windows and soaked upholstery, but to her surprise, it runs.

She used to work at a hotel, but the storms put it out of business. After a few weeks, roads were cleared and some cell service returned, so her husband, a painter, was able to reach his boss and return to work on repair projects.

“It feels like we’re actually making a bit of progress,” she said. “But it’s still such a long, long way to go.”

FRIDAY PUZZLE — This is a perfect puzzle for a Friday. It’s a puzzle by Kameron Austin Collins and Brendan Emmett Quigley and, if I can make a recommendation, it is best done curled up on the couch with a fine beverage, and the knowledge that the weekend is at hand. Maybe there’s some music playing in the background, and some good chocolate nearby. All I know is that I smiled all the way through this puzzle, and I hope you did, too.

The reason I smiled is because this was the most satisfying tug-of-war I’ve been a part of in a long time. I didn’t know all the answers. Well, my brain did, mostly, but the answers weren’t always at the surface. I had to dig for some of them, and work the grid for others.

Meaty, lively entries (I was actually surprised that there were only two debuts today), and a mostly clean grid. Sneaky clues that are just out of reach, but which fall upon second look.

22A: The trick to a clue like “You, overseas” is to know that it is asking you for the word “You” in a foreign language (hence the clue word “overseas”). Got that? Good. Now your job is to figure out which language. There are a lot to choose from. TOI, for example, means “you” in French, but that’s not the answer. Now, if you know about the lean and hungry CASSIUS, who went on to be one of the recipients of Julius Caesar’s famous “Et tu”’s, you can fill that in, and that gives you the S. The only language I know that has a word meaning “you” that begins with an S is German, and the word is SIE.

There were worries that this finely detailed show, based on Eran Kolirin’s screenplay for the 2007 film of the same title, might not survive the transfer to Broadway. First staged to sold-out houses late last year at the Atlantic Theater Company, it exuded a shimmering transparency that might well have evaporated in less intimate quarters.

Yet “The Band’s Visit” — which follows the modest adventures of a touring Egyptian band stranded in an Israeli village significant only for its insignificance — more than holds its own on a larger stage. Its impeccably coordinated creative team has magnified and polished its assets to a high sheen that never feels synthetic.

This show was always close to perfect musically. (Mr. Yazbek’s quietly simmering score, which inflects Broadway balladry and character songs with a haunting Middle Eastern accent, felt as essential as oxygen.) But it felt a shade less persuasive in its connective spoken scenes.

That is, to say the least, no longer a problem. Though the lives it depicts are governed by a caution born of chronic disappointment, Mr. Cromer’s production now moves wire to wire with a thoroughbred’s confidence.

Such assurance is all the more impressive when you consider that “The Band’s Visit” is built on delicately balanced contradictions. It finds ecstasy in ennui; eroticism among people who rarely make physical contact; and a sense of profound eventfulness in a plot in which, all told, very little happens.

The story is sprung when the members of the Alexandria Ceremonial Band, led by their straight-backed conductor, Tewfiq (Mr. Shalhoub), board a bus in 1996 for an engagement at the Arab Cultural Center in the city of Petah Tikva. Thanks to some understandable confusion at the ticket counter, they wind up instead in the flyblown backwater of Bet Hatikva.

They register as unmistakably alien figures there, looking like refugees from Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band in their powder-blue uniforms. (Sarah Laux did the costumes.) And there’s not a bus out of this godforsaken hole until the next morning.

Just how uninteresting is Bet Hatikva? Its residents are happy to tell you, in some of the wittiest songs ever written about being bored. The “B” that begins its name might as well stand for “basically bleak and beige and blah blah blah.”

Leading this civic inventory is a cafe proprietor named Dina (Ms. Lenk, in a star-making performance), a wry beauty who clearly doesn’t belong here and just as clearly will never leave. Like her fellow citizens, she sees the defining condition of her life as eternal waiting, a state in which you “keep looking off out into the distance/ Even though you know the view is never gonna change.”

Scott Pask’s revolving set, so fitting for a world in which life seems to spin in an endless circle, captures the sameness of the view. But Tyler Micoleau’s lighting, and the whispers of projections by Maya Ciarrocchi, evoke the subliminal changes of perspective stirred by the arrival of strangers.

Connections among the Egyptian and the Israeli characters are inevitably incomplete. To begin with, they don’t share a language and must communicate in broken English. And as the stranded musicians interact with their hosts, their shared story becomes a tally of sweet nothings, of regretful might-have-beens.

That means that the cultural collisions and consummations that you — and they — might anticipate don’t occur. Even the frictions that emerge from uninvited Arabs on Israeli soil flicker and die like damp matches.

The show is carefully veined with images of incompleteness: a forever unlit cigarette in the mouth of a violinist (George Abud); a clarinet concerto that has never been completed by its composer (Alok Tewari); a public telephone that never rings, guarded by a local (Adam Kantor) waiting for a call from his girlfriend; and a pickup line that’s dangled like an unbaited hook by the band’s aspiring Lothario (Ari’el Stachel, whose smooth jazz vocals dazzle in the style of his character’s idol, Chet Baker).

All the cast members — who also include a deeply affecting John Cariani, Kristen Sieh, Etai Benson and Andrew Polk — forge precisely individualized characters, lonely people who have all known loss, with everything and nothing in common. A marvelous Mr. Shalhoub (“Monk”) has only grown in the role of a man who carries his dignity and private grief with the stiffness of someone transporting perilously fragile cargo.

As for Ms. Lenk, seen on Broadway last season in Paula Vogel’s “Indecent,” she is the ideal avatar of this show’s paradoxical spirit, at once coolly evasive and warmly expansive, like the jasmine wind that Dina describes in the breakout ballad “Omar Sharif.”

Listening to Tewfiq sing in Arabic, she wonders, “Is he singing about wishing?” She goes on: “I don’t know what I feel, and I don’t know what I know/All I know is I feel something different.”

The critical acclaim for its rieslings has fed a growth in production and the arrival of new producers.

By 2011, the last year for which New York kept records of grape acreage, riesling was by far the region’s most planted of white vinifera grapes, the European species that accounts for all the familiar fine-wine grapes. Even so, the region still has many acres of hybrid and native American grapes, like concord and Niagara, a legacy of its history both as a producer of cheap fortified wines and of small wineries that did the bulk of their business selling directly to visitors.

Still, few regions in the world flourish with only one signature wine. For as long as riesling has prospered in the Finger Lakes, winemakers there have debated what its red counterpart ought to be.

I’ve had charming pinot noirs, made in a fresh, delicate style rather than with opulent fruit. I’ve had intriguing teroldegos and blaufränkisches. Yet the most consistently good and distinctive reds I’ve had from the Finger Lakes have been cabernet francs.

In the last five years or so, I have seen more cabernet francs from the region. It has not been a lot — cab franc acreage accounts for less than a third of riesling acreage — but enough to notice.

As with riesling, focusing on cab franc is not at all a marketing no-brainer. It’s the other cabernet, the one without a clear identity and name recognition. The easy path is not necessarily the best path, as was true with riesling, so maybe cabernet franc, too, makes sense.

Seeking a deeper understanding of Finger Lakes cabernet franc, the wine panel recently tasted 20 bottles primarily from the 2014 and ’15 vintages, with one ’16 thrown in. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Christy Frank — who, with her husband, owns Copake Wine Works in Columbia County, N.Y. — and Thomas Pastuszak, wine director of the NoMad.

Thomas and his wife, Jessica Brown, also happen to own a small Finger Lakes label, Terrassen Cellars, that makes cabernet franc. Our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch, was unaware of the connection and included a bottle in our blind tasting. To avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest, we did not include it in our rankings.

As we tasted through the 20 bottles, a clear profile of Finger Lakes cabernet franc emerged. These wines were pale in color, savory and spicy, more than sweetly fruity. Indeed, the fruit flavor tended more toward the tart end of the spectrum, leavened with herbal and mineral touches.

These wines spoke plainly of cool-climate viticulture, a phrase often bandied about by regions that have little claim to it. Yet it is a true description of conditions in the Finger Lakes, where alcohol levels only occasionally rise above 13 percent, compared with the 14 percent to 15 percent seen regularly in California. The best cabernet francs were light- to medium-bodied with almost delicate textures and lively acidity, the sort that would go especially well on the Thanksgiving table.

“People are looking for more food-friendly wines,” Thomas said. “Cool-climate cabernet franc will appeal to those seeking mineral-driven, acid-driven, more firmly tannic wines.”

It’s certainly a lovely, desirable style, though perhaps not mainstream American yet.

“Up in Copake, a lot of people want something local,” Christy said. “But they also want something that’s big and rich, so it’s a fine line.”

As a sommelier, Thomas has tried to pique his customers’ interest in NoMad’s excellent selection of Finger Lakes wines.

“I used to say, ‘Think of a lighter version of cabernet sauvignon,’” he said. “Now I say, ‘A spicier version of pinot noir.’ It’s been more successful in terms of peoples’ expectations.”

Our top wine, a 2014 from Lakewood Vineyards, epitomized the prevailing Finger Lakes style. The wine was fresh, with an almost crunchy texture and nuanced, savory flavors of flowers, herbs and spicy fruit. By contrast, our No. 2 bottle, a 2015 Le Breton from Schneider & Bieler, was darker and more concentrated than many of the other wines. It nonetheless was well balanced, with the typical tart, herbal flavors.

No. 3 was the 2014 Wisdom from Inspire Moore, a deliciously saline, savory mouthful, with flavors of both tart and sweet fruit. No. 4 was the 2014 North Block Six from Atwater Estate, floral and herbal, with a kind of tense energy to it.

Other wines well worth trying include the savory 2014 Hermann J. Wiemer; the floral, earthy 2015 Damiani; the spicy, refreshing 2016 Hosmer and the delicate but deep 2015 Keuka Lake Vineyards.

Almost any of these bottles is an excellent value. None of our favorites cost more than $25.

A few cabernet franc-based wines like Bloomer Creek’s excellent White Horse were not included in our tasting because they didn’t meet the 75 percent threshold for using the name of the grape on the label. Perhaps we were being arbitrary, but it was how we narrowed the field.

The focus on riesling and cabernet franc is not to say that the Finger Lakes do not produce many other fine wines. I’ve had good chardonnays and gamays. I’ve enjoyed pinot noirs. And the sommelier Pascaline Lepeltier has recently teamed with Nathan Kendall, of N. Kendall, to make Chëpìka, an intriguing pétillant naturel made of the native grapes Catawba and Delaware.

It’s the kind of experimentation that suggests a serious exploration of the region’s potential. It will only get better from here.

Recipe: Braised Chicken With Gochujang

Many of the Finger Lakes cabernet franc wines exhibited restrained fruit, whispers of spice and musky smoke in a brooding package. The wines could handle food with some complexity and heat, so I turned to a slow braise, which infuses meat with deep flavor and produces a warming, stewlike dish. It’s the cooking method of choice when the weather brings a chill. The process is what I call the usual three-step affair (brown chicken parts or meat, add other ingredients and some liquid, cover and slowly simmer). But I gave the chicken a bit of heat, unpacking the Korean condiment gochujang with sake, ginger, garlic and some well-mannered poblano chiles. The finished dish would welcome a pillow of steamed rice alongside. FLORENCE FABRICANT

This is of course a larger pattern in American life. As one reader put it on my Facebook page: “Those who moralize most, sin most.”

That’s not always true, and sanctimonious hypocrites inhabit the left as well as the right: Harvey Weinstein participated in a “women’s march.” But we’re at a watershed moment in the aftermath of the Weinstein case, trying to end impunity for sexual assault, and allegations against our leaders are even more serious than those against our entertainers.

The Alabama state auditor, a Republican named Jim Ziegler, defended Moore as “clean as a hound’s tooth” and offered a bizarre defense of child abuse: He asserted that the Virgin Mary was a teenager when Joseph married her (in fact, the Bible does not indicate her age), adding: “They became parents of Jesus.”

Sigh. When Christians cite the Bible to defend child molestation, Jesus should sue for defamation.

Meanwhile, an Alabama Republican legislator, Ed Henry, went even further: He said that the women accusing Moore should be prosecuted for waiting to make their allegations.

Looking back, some of the grossest immorality of the late 20th century had nothing to do with gay bath houses, as preachers sometimes suggested, but rather with the blowhard televangelists who suggested that AIDS was God’s punishment of gay men. This smirking moralizing slowed the response to AIDS and arguably resulted in millions dying unnecessarily all over the world.

In my columns, I’ve repeatedly defended evangelical Christians, and protested that they are one of the few groups that it’s socially acceptable for liberals to mock, stereotype and discriminate against. Some liberals still haven’t forgiven me for my “Hug an Evangelical” column 13 years ago. But I find it infuriating to see some evangelicals now downplaying child molestation or our president’s boasts of sexual assault.

We all make compromises — I supported Bill Clinton in 1992 over George H.W. Bush, whom I thought was personally more moral — but that doesn’t require downplaying the inexcusable. I used to complain that conservatives believe that morality is about only personal behavior, while liberals believe it is only about policy positions, while actually it’s about both. Sadly, some of the “family values” conservatives now don’t seem to care about either private or public morality.

If evangelical Christians want to engage in activism, they needn’t support hypocrites and bigots; they can support lifesaving organizations like World Vision or African Mission Healthcare Foundation, or fight human trafficking by supporting International Justice Mission, or reduce abortions by backing the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.

As it happened, just before the revelations about Moore became public, I visited leaders of an inspiring tri-faith project in Omaha, where a church, a synagogue and a mosque are partnering on a shared site to build empathy and understanding. I asked the pastor involved, Rev. Eric Elnes, for his reaction to Moore.

“Blazing with self-righteous indignation toward others is often what people use to hide their own sins in the shadows,” Elnes said. “This is probably why Jesus’ biggest problem — by far — was with the self-righteous. When it came to those whom society cast away as ‘sinners,’ Jesus was repeatedly gentle, gracious, encouraging, and forgiving, but he continually castigated the self-righteous.”

Elnes added: “I’ve never understood why certain Christians are so eager to turn the United States into a Christian country when their time would be so much better spent turning their churches into Christian churches.”

THURSDAY PUZZLE — There are few things that infuriate solvers more than a rebus theme, but I think I could safely say that having to write backward in a grid is pretty high up there.

“Saudi Arabia should pay for our therapy,” Karim Traboulsi, an editor at the news site The New Arab, wrote in a post on Facebook.","The backdrop to the crisis was a series of steps by Saudi Arabia in recent days to confront its ascendant regional rival, Iran, and the surprise arrests of about 200 Saudis, including 11 princes, in what the government describes as an anti-corruption campaign but which critics see as a consolidation of power by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.

Lebanon had already been drawn into the crisis in two ways: After a rocket was fired from Yemen at the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Saturday, Saudi officials accused Hezbollah and Iran of aiding in the attack. And they declared that the attack amounted to a declaration of war by Lebanon, a leap given that the weak Lebanese state does not control Hezbollah.

At the same time, the Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, unexpectedly flew to Riyadh and declared his resignation there on Saturday. Suspicions were growing among officials and diplomats in Beirut on Thursday that he had not only been pressured to do so by Saudi Arabia but was being held there against his will.

Despite the worries, analysts, officials and diplomats said that although they were not privy to the thinking of the Saudi crown prince, it was far-fetched that Saudi Arabia would launch a military action against Lebanon, since it is already overstretched in a war it started two years ago against Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen.

And Saudi Arabia has expressed displeasure with Lebanon this way before: This was at least the fourth time in five years that it asked its citizens to leave Lebanon.

But even before the current crisis, fears were building in Lebanon that Israel — which shares Saudi Arabia’s goal of rolling back Iranian power — would instigate another war against Hezbollah to curtail the increased power, influence and weaponry the Lebanese group has accumulated while playing a decisive role in the war in neighboring Syria.

Several Israeli officials seized on Mr. Hariri’s resignation — which he attributed to Iranian interference — as proof that Hezbollah, Iran and the Lebanese government were one and the same. That has fueled anxiety even as both Israel and Hezbollah insist that while they are prepared for a war, they do not want one now.

Reaction in Washington on Thursday to Saudi Arabia’s decision to order its citizens out of Lebanon was also cautious.

“I don’t think we’re on the brink of war, but it certainly constitutes an escalation,” said Andrew Exum, a former top Middle East policy official at the Pentagon, said in a telephone interview.

The question was whether heightened tensions would start one anyway.

Israeli officials, while cheering Prince Mohammed’s tough line on Iran, said they were uncertain that the crown prince was experienced or adroit enough to avoid setting off a broader regional conflict, perhaps one that could drag Israel in.

“Israel has two objectives: to stop Iran’s path towards dominance and hegemony in the region, and to create an alliance of the rational players in the region that would include Israel,” said Naftali Bennett, the Israeli minister of education and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet. “That is certainly a positive development to have such an alignment. At the same time, we have to be very cautious to prevent an unnecessary escalation in the region.”

Daniel B. Shapiro, a former United States ambassador to Israel, said more bluntly that it was one thing for Israel to see eye to eye with Saudi Arabia about who their adversaries were, “but it’s another to let a young, impulsive leader set the pace, when he won’t have to do all the fighting.”

Adding to the confusion, no one professes to understand Saudi Arabia’s logic or goals in Lebanon. Mr. Hariri’s resignation, apparently aimed at isolating Hezbollah, seemed likely only to strengthen it and its allies. It has humiliated Mr. Hariri, Saudi Arabia’s main ally in the country, created a potentially destabilizing political crisis in Lebanon and given Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, an opportunity to appear the elder statesman, calling for calm and declaring that Mr. Hariri is welcome back any time.

Some analysts suggested the Saudi escalation in Lebanon was less about making a dent in Hezbollah’s power and more a distraction from what appears to be a political purge at home and largely failed attempts to counter Iran in Syria and Yemen abroad. The developments fueled speculation that Prince Mohammed might be positioning himself to announce his accession to the throne.

“Maybe he felt he could score easier points in Lebanon and say internally, ‘Look, I’m being tough against Hezbollah,’ ” said Michael Young, a Lebanese analyst. “All this suggests to me that the arrival of King Mohammed is going to be sooner than later.”

Rather than war, analysts say Saudi Arabia’s next steps against Lebanon may be economic, like the boycott and blockade Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies are conducting against Qatar.

Saudi Arabi and its allies could expel Lebanese citizens, close air routes, cut off diplomatic relations and demand that Hezbollah be thrown out of government or forced to disarm, the political blogger Elias Muhanna wrote.

Those measures would be likely to hurt Hezbollah least, since unlike other parties and ordinary Lebanese, it can draw on extensive financial support from Iran.

But none of that was reassuring to people in Lebanon, a country of about 6.2 million people that for most its history has been batted between regional and global powers, most recently between Saudi Arabia and Iran, that exploit its own internal divisions. The country survived a devastating war in 2006 when Hezbollah fought Israel to a draw.

Lebanon was transfixed all week by the question of why Mr. Hariri had not come back or spoken to journalists or even many of his political allies and advisers. Lebanese followed social media sites late Wednesday night tracking a flight from Riyadh that they thought he might be on. He wasn’t.

His political party, the Future Movement, stopped short of publicly agreeing with Hezbollah and its ally, President Michel Aoun, that Mr. Hariri was a hostage. But it issued a statement implying he was not operating under his own free will, referring to him as still being the prime minister.

His return “is necessary to restore dignity and respect to Lebanon,” the statement said, stressing its support for his leadership and vowing “to follow him in whatever he decides.”

Mr. Hariri, a dual citizen of Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, met the ambassadors of Britain and the European Union and the chargé d’affaires from the American Embassy on Wednesday and Thursday at his Riyadh residence. Other Western diplomats, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that those envoys, too, came away with the impression that he could not speak freely.

The American ambassador to Lebanon, Elizabeth Richards, posted photographs of a meeting with Lebanese Army officials and emphasized international support for the Lebanese government.

But President Trump in recent days has posted on Twitter messages of unspecified support for Saudi Arabia’s rulers, saying they “know exactly what they are doing.”

Lebanon tried to handle the stress with its customary mix of jitters and jadedness. People debated whether to stock up on canned food for a coming war, but also ratcheted up the black humor.

“Saudi Arabia should pay for our therapy,” Karim Traboulsi, an editor at the news site The New Arab, wrote in a post on Facebook.","Saudi Arabia Orders Its Citizens Out of Lebanon, Raising Fears of War",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-lebanon-war.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Well, look who’s collaborating on crossword puzzles. Digital crossword editor Joel Fagliano and assistant crossword editor Sam Ezersky offer us a midweek puzzle with just enough of a mental tug-of-war to get us over the hump. Not only that, but I always enjoy when constructors show us something we might not have noticed before about words.

Today’s Theme

At first glance, few solvers will know what the three-part lists in this theme are about, but all you need is one solved theme entry and the rest of them will easily fall into place.

For me it was APOSTATES, at 15D. I already had the “A” from Edgar ALLAN Poe at 15A, and I knew that “Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Ohio” were all STATES, so I used my superpower of staring at the clue until I burned a hole in my screen to figure out that the answer — and the theme — was the first letter of each of the items in the list plus what they are. That would be APO + STATES, or the word APOSTATES. Now you go figure out the other three. It’s not that hard, but it’s certainly fun.

To make up for the relative easiness of the theme, our intrepid constructors have thrown in some speed bumps in the nontheme fill, which certainly slowed me down. I was not familiar with the term DAD ROCK (a debut), which I presume one listens to when one has a dad bod. At 20D, I filled in KNEECAP because I solved this on a Monday and I haven’t yet had enough coffee to remember that the patella is the KNEECAP. So a “Patella protector” would be a KNEEPAD. Finally, I got Naticked at the crossing of 46A and 47D. I just couldn’t wrap my head around ISOGON/GHANA.

President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines said on Friday that he had stabbed someone to death when he was a teenager, the latest claim from a leader who has boasted of personally killing people while defending a violent crackdown on drugs.

Revolution is in the air this week — at least, it’s in a handful of new books set in Revolutionary times. Three founding fathers feature in two of our recommended titles: “Friends Divided: John Adams and Thomas Jefferson,” by Gordon S. Wood, and “The Three Lives of James Madison,” by Noah Feldman. Russell Shorto brings to life half a dozen players from the era of American independence in “Revolution Song,” including the first American president. Much has changed since the Washington Administration, however; Jeremi Suri argues in “The Impossible Presidency” that as the nation has grown, the job of leading it may be too unwieldy for one person to manage. Perhaps it’s time to overhaul the Oval Office, and not just replace the drapes.

VIVIAN MAIER: A Photographer’s Life and Afterlife, by Pamela Bannos. (The University of Chicago Press, $35.) The photographer Vivian Maier’s work was only discovered when more than 100,000 negatives turned up after her death, at 83, in 2009. She was immediately heralded as one of the 20th century’s great photographers, but myths built up around her and controversy over the control of her work have kept us from seeing her clear. Pamela Bannos attempts to dislodge the portrayal of Maier as a mysterious, freakish figure. Our critic Parul Sehgal says she succeeds. “The achievement of Bannos’s intelligent, irritable self-reflexive study is in its restraint,” Sehgal writes. “She unseats the ghost and restores to us the woman.”

REVOLUTION SONG: A Story of American Freedom, by Russell Shorto. (Norton, $28.95.) George Washington is the hub of Shorto’s book, which artfully weaves together the stories of six individuals from the Revolutionary period — including a shoemaker, a Seneca chief, a freed slave and a memoirist who faked her own death — to give a sense of how far-reaching a phenomenon the War of Independence was.

SCHLESINGER: The Imperial Historian, by Richard Aldous. (Norton, $25.95.) Through the middle of the 20th century, the speechwriter and Kennedy aide Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. could reliably be found at the epicenter of Democratic debate and governance. Now he has found in Aldous an agreeably judicious biographer who gracefully balances an appreciation for his subject’s talents as a writer of narratives and speeches with an acknowledgment of his shortcomings as a political analyst and aide.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Boo! Sorry, no Halloween puzzle today. That in itself is spooky, but we’ve solved a couple of Halloween-themed puzzles already, and honestly, how much candy can you eat? Instead, today’s puzzle by Alex Eaton-Salners is a history lesson.

It’s not often that we see a 500th anniversary tribute crossword puzzle, and it happens to be done really well, so I was impressed.

Today’s Theme

History books tell us that a German monk named MARTIN LUTHER nailed a document called the “Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences,” better known as the “Ninety-Five Theses,” to the DOOR of ALL SAINTS CHURCH in WITTENBERG on October 31, 1517, although Mr. Eaton-Salners maintains that this act was actually performed on a later date.

The “Ninety-Five Theses” was a response to the Catholic Church’s practice of selling “INDULGENCES,” where Catholics could purchase absolution from sins, among other forms of corruption that he believed were happening in the church at the time. It was an invitation to debate the church’s practices as a whole, and was later considered to be a foundation for the PROTESTANT REFORMATION (interestingly, the word REFORMATION has appeared in The New York Times Crossword only once before, 50 years ago, and was related to the religious movement.)

“One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.","A serpentine river gently cuts through a mountain plateau. Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Photo

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Photo

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

In 1955, after two years in the Army, Mr. Rogin joined Sports Illustrated, which Time Inc. had begun the year before.
“He was writing at the very apex of the market for protagonists who were middle-aged, Jewish, Manhattanite male intellectuals/writers and musers,” Mr. Jennings wrote.
(It appears in the anthology “The Lowbrow Reader Reader” as well.)
The magazine also arranged for a Mr. Rogin to do a reading at an event at the Housing Works Bookstore in SoHo.","Gilbert Leslie Rogin was born on Nov. 14, 1929, in Brooklyn. His father, Robert, was a lawyer. His mother, the former Lillian Ruderman, had been an actress who, under the name Billie Rudell, made several Broadway appearances in the 1920s.

Mr. Rogin grew up in Manhattan and graduated from Columbia College. In 1951 he began a brief stint at The New Yorker as an office gofer; his assignment on his second day on the job was to bring a suit of clothes to a funeral home for Harold Ross to be laid out in. Mr. Ross, the magazine’s founding editor, had just died.

In 1955, after two years in the Army, Mr. Rogin joined Sports Illustrated, which Time Inc. had begun the year before. His job was to clip articles from newspapers and the wire services for filing in the magazine’s library, but he began writing almost immediately, and soon was a reporter.

Photo

He became known for elegant phrasing and carefully observed profiles of figures like the boxer Floyd Patterson and the basketball star Bill Russell. In 2014, when the magazine commemorated its 60th anniversary by republishing 60 of its best articles, one by Mr. Rogin was among them: “12 Days Before the Mast,” his account of participating in a sailing race from California to Hawaii aboard a 55-foot yawl. Not a sailing fan, he found the experience underwhelming.

“It was a numbing, embittering and largely useless 12 days,” he wrote. “There was no plot, no suspense. Our progress was as lacking in memorable incident as the passage of an hour hand across the face of a clock. We proved only that a curving, erratic line is not the shortest distance between two points.”

When not on assignment for Sports Illustrated, Mr. Rogin began writing short fiction. The New Yorker published its first Rogin story, “Ernest Observes,” in 1963, and they came regularly after that, right up through “The Hard Parts” in November 1978. More appeared in other magazines.

A story collection, “The Fencing Master,” came out in 1965, and in 1971 Mr. Rogin published his first novel, “What Happens Next?” The poet L. E. Sissman, reviewing that book in The New York Times, called it “a novel of the first importance.”

A second novel, “Preparations for the Ascent,” thematically related to the first, came in 1980. In 2010 the two novels were reissued by Verse Chorus Press as a single volume. Jay Jennings, in the introduction to that republication, wrote of the similarities that run through much of Mr. Rogin’s funny, understated fiction.

“The protagonist,” Mr. Jennings wrote, “no matter the name, is a (presumably autobiographical) middle-aged, Jewish, Manhattanite male, a magazine writer of eclectic intellectual interests and eccentric habits.”

As to why Mr. Rogin’s fiction, whose admirers included John Updike, had been largely forgotten, Mr. Jennings speculated that oversaturation might have played a part.

“He was writing at the very apex of the market for protagonists who were middle-aged, Jewish, Manhattanite male intellectuals/writers and musers,” Mr. Jennings wrote. “The ur-text in this genre is Saul Bellow’s ‘Herzog’ (1964), with cohorts Mailer, Malamud and others doing variations on the theme.”

It also certainly did not help that Mr. Rogin abruptly abandoned fiction. The story that drew the discouraging New Yorker rejection back in 1980, “My Masterpieces,” did eventually see the light of print, in 2010, when The Lowbrow Reader published it. (It appears in the anthology “The Lowbrow Reader Reader” as well.) The magazine also arranged for a Mr. Rogin to do a reading at an event at the Housing Works Bookstore in SoHo.

“Gil was accustomed to the upper echelon of publishing — The New Yorker and whatnot — and here he was, publishing his lost masterpiece in some idiot’s comedy zine,” Jay Ruttenberg, editor of The Lowbrow Reader, who joined with Mr. Jennings in getting Mr. Rogin’s novels republished, said in an email. “But he was genuinely appreciative of our efforts and visibly delighted by the attention.”

Mr. Rogin’s shift away from fiction coincided with his rise to the top editing spot at Sports Illustrated, where his eccentric style alienated some writers — Dan Jenkins was one — but was embraced by others.

“He’d make his changes with a touch so light that you could only nod appreciatively,” Jerry Kirshenbaum, a writer and editor at the magazine for 30 years, wrote in an email. “You didn’t feel like your fingers were being chopped off the way it was with some other editors. With Gil, it was like having a manicure.”

Yet there could also be bellowing and red-penciled rage, and savvy staff members learned that Mr. Rogin was a man of sometimes strange routines that were not to be disrupted.

“Between 2 and 3, everybody had to be silent while he took his nap,” Mr. Lidz said in an interview. Breakfast was always Bumble Bee tuna eaten from the can. He would often edit in the bathroom adjacent to his office. When he traveled, his assistant had to be sure not only that the hotel had a pool but that it was suitable for Mr. Rogin to swim his daily laps in — no kidney shapes allowed.

An oft-told tale: Once, on the road, Mr. Rogin turned up for his swim to find that the hotel pool was being drained; he frantically swam his mile’s worth of laps anyway, racing the declining water level.

Mr. Rogin married Ruth Copes in 1963. That marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, with whom he had a relationship of more than 30 years; they married in 2010.

His oddities aside, Mr. Rogin was adept and versatile enough that, in 1984, Time moved him — despite his reluctance — to Discover, its struggling science magazine, which he helped stabilize. In 1986 it won a National Magazine Award for general excellence. In 1987 Mr. Rogin became corporate editor, the No. 3 editing position in the Time Inc. empire.

In that capacity, he helped Quincy Jones found Vibe magazine in 1993. And his volatile impatience seemed to grow.

“He felt that the guilty should be shot,” Jason McManus, who as editor in chief was his boss, said on the occasion of Mr. Rogin’s retirement in 1993. “I often made him unhappy by my reluctance to take summary action on some perceived outrage; on the other hand, if I instantly had taken Gil’s advice, hardly any of our present managing editors would still be employed, nor would I.”","Gilbert Rogin, 87, Magazine Editor and Writer of Droll Fiction, Dies",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/obituaries/gilbert-rogin-87-magazine-editor-and-writer-of-droll-fiction-dies.html

But the results are mixed, and it’s not clear whether puzzle solving has any purely physiological benefits.

The psychological benefits, though, are not in question.

“When you do a puzzle, the mind becomes completely absorbed in the task at hand,” said Joanne Cohen-Katz, a psychologist in Allentown, Pa. “There is total focus on what is happening in the moment, which is the definition of mindfulness. And we know that mindfulness results in all sorts of positive changes in the brain.”

For one, solving a crossword can be a path to serenity in a world of uncertainty.

“I don’t think I have to sell you on the increased demand for this type of pastime in an increasingly worried world,” wrote Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times, in a memo to Lester Markel, the Sunday editor, after the Pearl Harbor attack. “You can’t think of your troubles while solving a crossword.”

In recent interviews, New York Times crossword enthusiasts shared their emotional connections to the pastime and described the value they find in the exercise.

Harry Hassell, of Jackson Heights, Queens, remembered his mother working on crosswords. “Amid the chaos of the household, it allowed her a personal pleasure and a routine all her own,” he said. “It also allowed me to see her not just as a car-pooling, tennis-playing mother, but also as a clever, intelligent, word-loving woman.”

Such intergenerational connections, forged over black-and-white grids, can have long-term implications.

“I first started doing crosswords as a child while visiting my Grandma Pat,” said Neil Padrick Wilson, a claims analyst in Tacoma, Wash. “She would sit at the big dining room table, dipping toast in her coffee. I would dip toast in my hot chocolate and we would work through a puzzle together. It got me to think, it got me to learn and it got me to know her better.”

Puzzles became so important to Mr. Wilson that he began to create them, and a crossword he made recently ran in The Times.

While not all enthusiasts go on to construct puzzles, it’s not uncommon for an early habit to persist.

“Rituals are often key in bonding with others, particularly family rituals,” said Ray Bepko, a clinical psychologist in Clinton, N.Y. “Pastimes and hobbies are very much a part of this and impact our adult relationships.”

That seems to be at least one reason people continue or develop a solving habit in adulthood, Dr. Bepko said. “Accessing this deep emotional connection is a source of comfort and reassurance anytime, particularly in difficult moments.”

Of course, puzzles are games, and they’re meant to be fun — especially in the addictive “aha!” moments that many solvers describe.

Moving forward, Pence offered this suggestion: “I have to tell you, we find comfort in the Good Book.”

The host, Storme Warren at Sirius XM, asked Pence if we could be assured of never seeing this kind of thing again. Pence fumbled for an answer, then said, “We’re united in our resolve to end such evil in our time.”

But there is no resolve. No legislative action. No executive action. Nothing but meek, passive acceptance of the great horror that makes the United States stand out from every other civilized country. Oh, and since Pence expressed resolve to end evil after Las Vegas, more than 900 Americans have lost their lives to guns.

In Texas this week, Pence told families, “We are working with leaders in Congress to ensure that this never happens again.” That’s a lie, which should be surprising for a man who wears his faith on both sleeves. But it is not unusual for Pence. PolitiFact rated 48 percent of his statements false or mostly false. He has learned from his master.

Here’s what the administration is actually doing: In one of his first acts as president, Trump signed a bill making it easier for the mentally ill to buy guns.

Pence can sound insipid on any topic. When the tape emerged last year of Trump boasting about how to be a sexual predator and get away with it, Pence urged his ticket mate to pray. His piety is the cover for Trump’s amorality.

I’m not against people of faith in public life. The left should be faulted for intolerance of those who express belief in a higher power or religious tradition. But I’m with the first Catholic president, John F. Kennedy, who famously said, “I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute.” In that, he stands with the Constitution.

Pence calls himself a Christian first, a conservative second and a Republican third. Since taking the oath of office, he’s supposed to be a citizen first. But Pence is a theocrat — one who hasn’t had a new thought in years — and that’s why he sounds so vacuous.

As governor of Indiana, he signed a measure that legalized discrimination against gays and made his state a pariah. It was only under pressure from the business community that he was forced to retreat. Still, his long record of anti-gay actions prompted even Trump to joke that Pence wants to “hang them all.” The White House denied the quote.

As Jane Mayer documented in her portrait of Pence in The New Yorker, he is also the ultimate corporate tool. The Koch brothers own him. He has called climate change “a myth” and has helped to plant fossil-fuel toadies in crucial Trump administration posts.

Battling with McConnell

PETERS: So was that like a Fort Sumter in your civil war? You’ve got Jeff Flake on the run? BANNON: No. It’s not Fort Sumter, but we did — look, what’s happened here recently is you — is you see that those politicians that really don’t understand the Trump movement or haven’t been supportive of the president. And we had, you know, Big Luther in Alabama. We had Corker in Tennessee, and we had Flake in Arizona, and there’ll be more. There’ll be more. Don’t think that — don’t think that you know not one of these senators has run out there and said publicly and said, “I want the endorsement of Mitch McConnell.” Yet they’re all coming to us. PETERS: Do you think Mitch McConnell will be majority leader at this time next year? BANNON: I absolutely do not think he will be majority leader. PETERS: Is that your personal mission to make that not happen? BANNON: It’s not my personal mission, but it is an objective that I — I have an objective that Mitch McConnell will not be majority leader, and I believe will be done before this time next year.

Conservatives like Mr. Bannon want to make the 2018 Senate elections, in large part, a referendum on Mr. McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader. In his meetings with potential Senate candidates, Mr. Bannon has been asking them to make a pledge not to support Mr. McConnell for another term as leader.

A major factor determining whether this insurgent conservative movement succeeds will be how angry Republican voters are at incumbents. Right now, that anger is running hot. Mr. McConnell is the most unpopular national political figure, according to a recent Harvard poll. But if Republicans start looking more politically competent — by passing, for example, a tax cut — voters may be less likely to turn on them.

Forcing Republicans to take sides

BANNON: Now, who did Gillespie campaign with? He campaigned with George Bush and Marco Rubio. And I think Condi Rice. Right? He — did he have — he had George Bush standing next to him. Did he have Donald Trump standing next to him? No, he did not. People are going to have to get over their differences on the right. And I’ve said this — Breitbart was very active in this — in this campaign at the end doing lots of stories, doing lots of profiles. Breitbart radio. And the reason is — is that, hey, Gillespie’s not a guy that’s particularly, you know, excites me.

Will the Republican Party be the Bush/Rubio party or the Trump Party? That is the question that Mr. Bannon sees as defining this looming battle between conservatives. Bush/Rubio is shorthand for the establishment that Mr. Bannon loathes — the party that favors a softer, more inclusive approach toward immigration laws and a more active role for America in the global community. The Trump Party rejects those premises entirely.

The establishment wing of the party considered these debates settled. What Mr. Trump did — and what Mr. Bannon helped draw out in Mr. Trump — was to force these issues and make Republicans take sides. We know what side won 2016. We don’t know yet which will prevail in 2018 and beyond.

On the Virginia governor’s race

BANNON: And by the way, the Gillespie campaign never really coordinated, never really reached out. The whole thing on the Trump stuff was a little bit grafted on. Now, some of the issues of MS-13 and — and sanctuary cities certainly came up. I do believe that — that Gillespie was a little halfhearted. It wasn’t embracing the core parts of the Trump agenda and driving and making it every day. The Trump agenda will win, and I understand how the — PETERS: I wonder if it was something of a problem of Gillespie himself because he was seen by conservatives as a creature of the swamp, so to speak, or of the establishment. BANNON: 100 percent. But even with the Trump people, this is the thing — I — I tried in — in the — the stories of Breitbart, in the other stories that came out on the other con — far-right news services. Is that even with the Trump people — and that’s with the Corey Stewart. You — if you lose in a primary, you got to get over it. The only way this thing’s going to work is to keep this coalition together.

Even if Ed Gillespie had sold himself as a cloned Donald Trump, it still would not have been enough to win the governor’s race in Virginia, illustrating the challenges of the Bannon/Trump model in swing states like Virginia with large, highly educated suburban populations.

That model works well in rural states, in the South and central Plains. It worked — but just barely — in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, where less than 80,000 votes delivered the White House to Mr. Trump. Whether it can work there again is Mr. Bannon’s crucible.

On the white nationalist appeal

PETERS: So there’s no doubt though that that message of President Trump’s has appeal with white nationalists. Is that an unfortunate reality, an unintended consequence? BANNON: I think it’s, I think it’s, I think it’s nonsense. I think it’s nonsense. PETERS: You don’t think he appeals to them at all? BANNON: I think these guys grab on to anything they can. No, the message is one of, this guy is the least racist guy I’ve ever met. And nothing in the campaign, and nothing that he’s done to date. That’s all that’s all left wing. That’s MSNBC nonsense. And by the way, you can’t help with a couple of, these guys are marginalia to marginalia. Right? So they’ll grab onto anything — and by the way, every time they say Trump’s name, MSNBC has got a camera on it and The New York Times has an article on it, right? Because you’re obsessed with it. PETERS: You’re saying it’s a media fabrication. BANNON: Absolutely, a hundred percent it’s a hundred percent media fabrication. And, by the way, because they realize that they think the only way they can run is by smearing you to be a nativist, a misogynist, a racist, a homophobe. Just go down the line.

This is a question that will continue to dog Mr. Trump, Mr. Bannon and the politicians who wrap themselves in their agenda. Mr. Bannon has denounced and rejected white nationalism publicly, as has Mr. Trump.

Though the family maintains tight control of Chaplin’s image — for example, the only place to buy a postcard depicting him hereabouts is at the Chaplin’s World gift shop — several sites in Vevey pay homage to him, including most notably the Läderach chocolate shop. Almost 20 years ago, its chief chocolatier, Blaise Poyet, approached the family about making a confection in Chaplin’s honor. He modeled it on the Little Tramp’s oversize shoes and rendered them in chocolate.

“They have three characteristics based on Charlie,” said Mr. Poyet, seated in the shop’s kitchen. “First, he was strong, hard. So I use dark chocolate. Second, he was very romantic, and for that I use caramel. And third, he was original, so I use pine nuts, which is unusual.”

A cafe down the street bears his French pet name, Le Charlot, and a women’s shop had a window decorated with a bowler hat, cane, red rose and a number of film stills that harmonized with the vintage-inspired dresses on sale. “It’s a homage to the museum,” said a sales clerk. “He was a romantic.”

PARIS — At the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art in the Montparnasse district, the party was swinging. A group of chic Parisians was bobbing absent-mindedly to “San Francisco,” by the Gallic rock legend Johnny Hallyday , which was blasting through the foyer. Others were picking through a jumble of costumes and props in an improvised photo studio. One woman had squeezed into a banana-yellow African batik dress; her partner had opted for retro sunglasses and an African feather wand. The couple regarded themselves with approval in a mirror, and struck a pose for a waiting photographer.

Parisian art galleries aren’t renowned for their decadent party spirit, at least not on weekday afternoons. But the Cartier Foundation was doing its utmost to get into the groove. A few days earlier, it had opened “ Mali Twist ,” a show dedicated to the renowned Malian photographer Malick Sidibé, and now a highlight of this year’s Paris Photo week. Some 250 black-and-white photographs crowd every inch of wall. In one, a pair of teenage boys in wildly patterned bell bottoms pose moodily with a guitar. Nearby, a glacially sophisticated young woman in shades and a tailored suit looks as if she were about to set off down a catwalk.

Billed as the largest Sidibé retrospective ever staged, and the first in continental Europe since the photographer’s death last year, “Mali Twist” pays tribute to a man who produced electrifyingly modern images of night life in the country’s capital, Bamako, in the 1960s and ’70s. On view through Feb. 25, it also retells one of the most remarkable stories in contemporary art. After growing up in rural Mali, the son of a stock breeder, Sidibé worked full time as a photographer for just a few decades, before disappearing into obscurity. After being “discovered” by Western curators in the ’90s, he ended up being awarded the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement at the Venice Biennale in 2007, the first photographer — and the first artist from Africa — ever to win that honor.

The show’s curator, André Magnin, recalled how he first encountered Sidibé, on a trip to Bamako in 1992. He had arrived on a mission to track down a mysterious photographer whose work he’d seen in New York. That man was Seydou Keïta , whose pensive studio portraits of Malians in the 1950s later won worldwide acclaim. Mr. Magnin contacted him, and while in Bamako, he also met a man who spent his time mending cameras and taking passport photos in a run-down joint called Studio Malick.

“In one night, in a few minutes, I met Keïta and Sidibé, two masters,” Mr. Magnin said, adding, “It was like a dream.”

The images that Mr. Magnin and his colleague Françoise Huguier turned up astonished the art world, and changed perceptions of African visual culture for good. Accustomed to depictions of remote tribes or shots of famine and conflict, Western viewers could scarcely believe their eyes: The idea that West African baby boomers spent the 1960s doing the twist or grooving to the Rolling Stones , like their contemporaries in Minneapolis and Marseille, was more than many could comprehend.

Image A young man poses in Sidibé’s studio in “Un Ye-Ye en Position,” from 1963. Credit Malick Sidibé/Fondation Cartier pour l’art contemporain, Paris

Manthia Diawara, a filmmaker who now teaches at New York University , grew up a few streets away from Studio Malick and was part of a teenage group that called itself Les Rockers. In a telephone interview from Senegal, he recalled how sitting for Sidibé became a rite of passage: “You went to your tailor with your James Brown album, and you said to him, ‘I want my jacket to look exactly like this,’ and you’d do your hair like him, everything else. Then Malick would take your picture and make you immortal.”

The renowned Malian musician Boubacar Traoré — whose hypnotic song “ Mali Twist ” gives the exhibition at the Cartier Foundation its name — also grew up on the scene. He and his friends pooled money to host semi-legal “surprise parties,” jiving to James Brown, Otis Redding and the Beatles, as well as salsa and European music. “The nights were magnificent,” he said in an interview. “It was a time without worries. Everybody was happy.”

For a roving photographer like Sidibé, keeping up with this hectic night life wasn’t easy: After long days at the studio, he spent much of the 1960s and early ’70s racing between these parties, sometimes as many as four a night . He would announce his arrival by setting off a flash gun, then take hundreds of snaps of people cavorting, before heading back to the studio to develop negatives, then put prints on display for sale.

One of Sidibé’s photographs has become deservedly famous: “Nuit de Noël (Happy-Club)” from 1963. It portrays a brother and sister dancing, he in a tie and flawless safari suit, she barefoot but in a full-skirted dress. The pair are concentrating hard, but have radiant half-smiles. “You can see from their eyes how happy they were,” Mr. Magnin said. “All these pictures are full of tenderness, full of love.”

Yet there is more to Sidibé’s photographs than straightforward joy, Mr. Diawara emphasized: They capture a fragile moment in Malian history, when the country was still in the first flush of independence from French colonial rule. “There was so much confidence in these pictures,” he said. “We honestly believed in the image we were projecting. There was so much power.”

After the socialist ruler Modibo Keïta was toppled by a military coup in 1969 , the atmosphere became more repressive. Mr. Diawara said that he found looking at Sidibé’s images both “sweet and bitter;” the life they portrayed was gone, swept away by worsening economic problems ( United Nations data now ranks Mali one of the poorest countries in the world ) and the rise of Islamist extremism.

“Many of my friends are — I don’t know a gentler way to put this — orthodox religious men,” Mr. Diawara said. “They no longer tolerate their children to dress the way they used to dress.”

For Sidibé’s work itself, the future is uncertain. This is the second retrospective since the photographer’s death, created from a selection of around 10,000 negatives and prints kept in Paris by Mr. Magnin, on loan from the Sidibé family. Yet a majority of the archive — perhaps more than 300,000 frames in negative, as well as many vintage prints — remains piled in cardboard boxes in Bamako. Most of the images have barely been examined, and there are fears that some have gone missing. Photographs that once sold for a handful of Malian francs now go for thousands of dollars. The fact that Sidibé’s survivors include more than a dozen children and three wives makes administering the estate even more complicated.

Mr. Magnin’s hope was that a major photography foundation, perhaps an African one, would step in. “I would be happy for that,” he said. “But I’m not sure what the family wants, it’s too difficult. They are afraid.”

After talking, we headed upstairs so that Mr. Magnin could sneak a cigarette. As we stood by the entrance, a willowy teenager threw a flamboyant, hip-thrusting pose for his friend, playfully impersonating one of the pictures in the gallery.

“I am sorry Malick is not still here,” Mr. Magnin said. “He would have enjoyed it, every minute.”

93,"['older', 'shingles', 'cases', 'dr', 'effectiveness', 'zostavax', 'age', 'excuses', 'vaccine', 'pain', 'shingrix']","Large international trials have shown that the vaccine prevents more than 90 percent of shingles cases, even at older ages.
The currently available shingles vaccine, called Zostavax, only prevents about half of shingles cases in those over age 60 and has demonstrated far less effectiveness among elderly patients.
Though Zostavax, introduced in 2006, can reduce shingles cases by about half (and postherpetic neuralgia by two-thirds), that overall rate conceals big differences by age.
Further, “it tends to be a bit of an ouch-y vaccine,” Dr. Schaffner cautioned.
“Compared to shingles, a little arm pain for a day or so is a small price to pay,” Dr. Schaffner said.","“This really looks to be a breakthrough in vaccinating older adults,” agreed Dr. Jeffrey Cohen, a physician and researcher at the National Institutes of Health.

What’s causing the enthusiasm: Shingrix, which the pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline intends to begin shipping this month. Large international trials have shown that the vaccine prevents more than 90 percent of shingles cases, even at older ages.

The currently available shingles vaccine, called Zostavax, only prevents about half of shingles cases in those over age 60 and has demonstrated far less effectiveness among elderly patients.

Yet those are the people most at risk for this blistering disease, with its often intense pain, its threat to vision and the associated nerve pain that sometimes last months, even years, after the initial rash fades.

Almost all older Americans harbor the varicella zoster virus that causes shingles; they acquired it with childhood chickenpox, whether they knew they had the disease or not.

The virus stays dormant until, for unknown reasons, it erupts decades later. The risk rises sharply after age 50.

Shingles is hardly a minor menace. “A million cases occur in the United States each and every year,” Dr. Schaffner said. “If you’re fortunate enough to reach your 80th birthday, you stand a one-in-three to one-in-two chance of shingles.”

Preventing the great majority of these cases — along with the risk of lingering and debilitating nerve pain, called postherpetic neuralgia — would represent a major advance in public health.

So while the old vaccine will remain on the market, the C.D.C. committee voted to make Shingrix the preferred vaccine and recommended it for all adults over age 50 — a group younger by a decade than those earlier encouraged to get Zostavax.

The committee also recommended Shingrix for adults who’ve previously gotten Zostavax, since a smaller study in people over age 65 demonstrated effectiveness and safety in those already vaccinated. The Food and Drug Administration approved Shingrix last month.

Once the C.D.C.’s director endorses the committee’s recommendations, and the agency publishes them, insurers — including Medicare and Medicaid — will start covering the vaccine.

“By early 2018, it should be broadly available to consumers in the U.S.,” said Dr. Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GSK Vaccines. (Canada has also approved Shingrix; it awaits approval in Australia, Japan and Europe.)

What makes the new vaccine so promising, especially for older adults?

* It provides better protection against shingles from the start. Though Zostavax, introduced in 2006, can reduce shingles cases by about half (and postherpetic neuralgia by two-thirds), that overall rate conceals big differences by age.

That vaccine’s effectiveness drops from 64 percent for people in their 60s to 38 percent among those over age 70, and falls still lower for people in their 80s.

But the new vaccine protects nearly as well in older groups as in the middle-aged. Shingrix racked up a 97 percent effectiveness rate in adults over age 50 and, in a separate study of people over age 70, prevented 90 percent of shingles in those 70 to well past age 80.

“In groups such as the elderly, who often don’t maintain vigorous responses to vaccines, this represents extremely strong disease protection,” said Dr. Kathleen Dooling, an epidemiologist at the C.D.C.

* Shingrix’s protection appears to last longer. Among seniors, the effectiveness of Zostavax wanes with disappointing speed. “After 11 years, the protection was close to zero,” Dr. Harpaz said.

Regulators don’t yet have 11 years of data on Shingrix, but in some samples, it remained effective for six years or longer, according to GSK. That should great reduce the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia, too, assuming the 42 million people in their 50s start getting vaccinated.

* The new vaccine may protect people with compromised immune systems.

A substantial number of older Americans have suppressed immunity because they’re undergoing chemotherapy or transplants, have H.I.V. or take steroids. For them, the previous vaccine was off-limits because it was made with a weakened live virus.

Yet immune suppression itself leaves the people vulnerable to shingles. Shingrix, a recombinant vaccine made from a glycoprotein and a combination of immunity boosters called adjuvants, doesn’t pose the same danger.

The C.D.C. committee held off on recommending Shingrix for the immunocompromised, because GSK is still running trials with these patients. But since the F.D.A. did not declare Shingrix contraindicated for them when approving it, they can get the vaccine once it’s available.

Public health advocates do foresee a couple of potential problems.

First, Shingrix requires two doses, administered at least two months apart. Prodding the older population to get a single shot has proved tough: barely 31 percent of those over age 60 have been vaccinated against shingles. How much harder will it be to persuade people to get two Shingrix injections?

Further, “it tends to be a bit of an ouch-y vaccine,” Dr. Schaffner cautioned.

In studies, most older recipients said they’d experienced pain, redness or swelling in their upper arms for a day or two after the shot, and 8.5 percent of those over age 70 deemed those symptoms uncomfortable enough to interfere with normal activities.

About half of those over age 70 reported more systemic side effects like fatigue, fever or aching joints, lasting one to two days. Physicians and pharmacists should prepare people for such reactions, Dr. Schaffner said.

“If people anticipate it, they’ll cope with it better. They’ll take a couple of Tylenol” — and not worry that something is seriously wrong.

They may feel pocketbook pain, too. Zostavax is the most expensive adult vaccine, and at $140 for each dose (plus the cost of administering the injection), Shingrix will be pricier still.

The 50- to 65-year-old cohort, many of whom have coverage under employee health plans, may not find that much of a barrier. At older ages, cost matters more.

Medicare will cover Shingrix under Part D (like its predecessor), not under Part B like the flu vaccine. That complicates reimbursement for those seeking vaccination in doctors’ offices, so Medicare patients will probably find it simpler to head for a pharmacy.

But not all Medicare recipients have Part D, and those that do could face co-payments.

Still, it’s no contest: The hazards of shingles and its complications dwarf any problems yet reported with Shingrix.

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

Some Senate Republicans have encouraged Senator Luther Strange of Alabama, who lost to Mr. Moore in a bitterly contested Republican runoff in September, to run as a write-in candidate, an option Mr. Strange is considering, according to Republicans who have spoken to him.

In addition to Mr. Strange, Republicans in Washington and Alabama have approached multiple other potential candidates about mounting a write-in effort, including Representative Robert Aderholt, a mainstream conservative from the northern end of the state. But it is unclear that any prominent Republican will be willing to mount a wild-card campaign for the Senate unless Mr. Moore stands down first.

Absent Moore’s cooperation, Republicans in Washington have conferred with election lawyers to explore other long-shot options for replacing or marginalizing him, several of which would likely lead to a clash in court with Mr. Moore and his supporters.

One approach that Republicans are considering, according to people briefed on the deliberations, would involve asking Gov. Kay Ivey to order a new date for the election, scheduling it for early next year and giving the party time to persuade Mr. Moore to withdraw, or force him out of the race.

Alabama election law requires candidates to withdraw at least 76 days before an election in order to be replaced on the ballot, a deadline Mr. Moore has already missed.

State law gives the governor broad authority to set the date of special elections, and Ms. Ivey, who is a Republican, already rescheduled the Senate election once, after inheriting the governor’s office in April when her predecessor, Robert Bentley, resigned in a sex and corruption scandal. Ms. Ivey’s advisers have not ruled out exercising that power again, according to Republicans in touch with her camp, but she has signaled that she would like reassurances of support from the White House before taking any such step.

A spokesman for the governor did not reply to an email asking about her intentions.

But there is no apparent precedent for rescheduling an election so close to the planned vote, and it is unlikely Ms. Ivey could move the election without a court battle, Republicans acknowledged. But advocates of a delay say at least it could keep the election date tied up in court.",Republicans Try to Block Moore’s Path as Candidate Denies Sexual Misconduct,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/us/politics/roy-moore-alabama-republican.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

No matter where you lived in New York, sooner or later all roads led to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue, the commercial and cultural heart of East Harlem.

Joseph Rodriguez was no exception: Though born and raised in Brooklyn — with detours at Rikers and a life-changing encounter with photography — he, as a teenager, liked to hang out at his uncle’s candy store and numbers spot where the streets were abuzz with music and life. Those early encounters led to a May 1990 National Geographic cover story and the most important project of his life after he spent the latter half of the 1980’s photographing El Barrio’s streets and residents in their homes and on the block.

Now, a revised version of that body of work will be on display at the Bronx Documentary Center, as well as in the new book, “Spanish Harlem: El Barrio in the ’80s.”

While it is “easy to make gritty pictures of poverty,” Mr. Rodriguez was looking to go deeper and connect with people whose struggles he knew intimately as the son of a single mother.

“I carried this story for a long time before I could go out and make the work,” he said. “That was an important path for me to understand patience and waiting, connecting and trust.”

His images reflect an intimacy — and long-term commitment — that marks his later work in East Los Angeles, Romania and Puerto Rico. For him, this project was deeply personal, and still is.

“We’re not garbage people, we have a presence,” he said. “One thing that was extremely important was to show our children with some dignity. You see their strength. We’ve gone through hell and back, just like now in Puerto Rico. But we get up, and we fight back.”

Many have argued that President Trump’s biggest success has been Justice Neil Gorsuch’s ascension to the Supreme Court. While it was a major victory, Mr. Trump’s troubling nominations to the lower courts may be his most lasting legacy.

Every president selects judges whose legal, social and political views generally reflect his own. Conservatives complained about President Barack Obama’s choices, as did liberals about President George W. Bush’s, but most of them were accepted across the aisle as credible and qualified. Some of President Trump’s nominees, however, are so far outside the mainstream that even conservative Republicans like Senators John Kennedy of Louisiana and John Cornyn of Texas have expressed dismay.

There are 145 vacancies in the federal judiciary, with 18 of those on the Courts of Appeals, and more will surely arise. The Republican-controlled Senate has swiftly confirmed 12 nominees so far. And thanks to life tenure, most of them will serve for decades.

Consider some of the least qualified and most bizarre of his selections.

Leonard Steven Grasz, a nominee for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based in St. Louis, received a rare “not qualified” rating from the American Bar Association because his “temperament issues, particularly bias and lack of open-mindedness, were problematic.” He serves on the board of an organization that has supported the closing of clinics offering women reproductive care, has condemned Supreme Court decisions that protect women’s rights, and has asserted that abortions put women’s lives at risk.

Thomas A. Farr has been nominated to serve on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. President Bush recommended him for the same seat in 2006, but the Senate Judiciary Committee did not even advance his nomination to the full Senate, probably because of his longstanding ties to racist politicians, and because of his opposition to voting rights, workers’ rights and economic equality.

Honey Nut is America’s best-selling breakfast cereal, and by a comfortable margin.

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

Photo

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

In addition to Mr. Strange, Republicans in Washington and Alabama have approached multiple other potential candidates about mounting a write-in effort, including Representative Robert Aderholt, a mainstream conservative from the northern end of the state. But it is unclear that any prominent Republican will be willing to mount a wild-card campaign for the Senate unless Mr. Moore stands down first.

Absent Moore’s cooperation, Republicans in Washington have conferred with election lawyers to explore other long-shot options for replacing or marginalizing him, several of which would likely lead to a clash in court with Mr. Moore and his supporters.

One approach that Republicans are considering, according to people briefed on the deliberations, would involve asking Gov. Kay Ivey to order a new date for the election, scheduling it for early next year and giving the party time to persuade Mr. Moore to withdraw, or force him out of the race.

Alabama election law requires candidates to withdraw at least 76 days before an election in order to be replaced on the ballot, a deadline Mr. Moore has already missed.

State law gives the governor broad authority to set the date of special elections, and Ms. Ivey, who is a Republican, already rescheduled the Senate election once, after inheriting the governor’s office in April when her predecessor, Robert Bentley, resigned in a sex and corruption scandal. Ms. Ivey’s advisers have not ruled out exercising that power again, according to Republicans in touch with her camp, but she has signaled that she would like reassurances of support from the White House before taking any such step.

A spokesman for the governor did not reply to an email asking about her intentions.

But there is no apparent precedent for rescheduling an election so close to the planned vote, and it is unlikely Ms. Ivey could move the election without a court battle, Republicans acknowledged. But advocates of a delay say at least it could keep the election date tied up in court.",Republicans Try to Block Moore’s Path as Candidate Denies Sexual Misconduct,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/us/politics/roy-moore-alabama-republican.html

In “The Exterminating Angel,” based on the 1962 Luis Buñuel film, Ms. Luna plays Leticia, an opera diva who is part of a blue-bloods dinner party, the guests of which find themselves mysteriously unable to leave at the end of the evening. The vocal demands are a workout for almost every performer onstage.

“The note,” Mr. Adès said, “the range, the tessitura, is a metaphor for the ability to transcend these psychological and invisible boundaries that have grown up around them.”

Adding to the excitement of the high A is its placement in the score. Unlike in other high-flying parts — the imperious Queen of the Night in “The Magic Flute,” the spunky Zerbinetta in “Ariadne auf Naxos,” the long-suffering title role in “Lucia di Lammermoor” — there’s little time for Ms. Luna to warm up: The A is her very first note, sung before she’s even visible onstage. (She sings it again a short time later, as the party guests, in a surreal portent, leave the stage and re-enter.)

“It’s a moment of arrival,” Mr. Adès said. “It had to be on this note.”

Growing up in Oregon, Ms. Luna sang the daunting Queen of the Night when she was still in high school “just because it was fun,” she said. “And I liked the sensation it made in my bones, in my head, in my sinuses. It just gave me a high. It still gives me a high.”

Her topmost register is unusually lucid and effortless. Even in those notes unattainable by most other sopranos, and even when those notes are held far longer than the pecks requested by most other composers, Ms. Luna’s tone is full. She manages to avoid shrillness in what she aptly calls the “Wagnerian coloratura spectacle” that is her final “Exterminating Angel” aria, a flood of sustained superhigh sound up to F.

Even if nothing in previous Met history has equaled her high A, other singers have come close, sometimes adding unwritten interpolations and transpositions to show off their personal stratospheres. A number of the highest notes in Met history have emerged from sopranos singing the title part in “Lucia di Lammermoor”; it’s no coincidence that this is the role Ms. Luna’s character performs just before the dinner party at the start of “The Exterminating Angel.”

Ellen Beach Yaw, born near Buffalo in 1869, sang a G above C as Lucia in her single Met performance in 1908. The review in The New York Times praised her “flutelike Santos-Dumont notes,” comparing her to a Brazilian aviation pioneer, and added, in a reference to a Wild West gunslinger: “She hit that high G as promised, but it is like Bat Masterson hitting a tomato can with a .44 at four paces.”

The celebrated French soprano Lily Pons sustained a high F in the final mad scene from “Lucia” — sung, at her Met debut in 1931, “in legitimate note, not bird whistles or falsetto,” according to The New York Post. At the turn of the 20th century, Sibyl Sanderson, as Massenet’s Manon, hit a G, known as her “Eiffel Tower note.” Mado Robin, a French coloratura, was recorded shrilling up to a B flat, but she never sang at the Met.

More recently, Natalie Dessay was known in New York for her crystal-clear G’s as the mechanical doll Olympia in Offenbach’s “Les Contes d’Hoffmann.” Just this fall, Erin Morley’s Olympia ornaments brought her up to A flat, a feat Rachele Gilmore achieved in the role at the Met in 2009.

The company admits it is possible that an even higher note could have slipped through the archival cracks. “There’s no record keeping of such things, especially of improvised stuff,” said Peter Clark, the Met’s archivist, who remembers hearing Pons’s F on a radio broadcast as a child. “So it’s not to say that in 1908, say, something higher didn’t happen. But I doubt that it wouldn’t be mentioned somewhere.”

“The Exterminating Angel” isn’t the first time Mr. Adès has pushed a singer to extremes, nor was “The Tempest.” In fact, one of his very first works, “Five Eliot Landscapes” for soprano and piano, from 1990, ends on a sustained G flat.

“It’s a certain amount of useful cruelty involved,” he said with a chuckle, before correcting himself. “Not cruelty, but the callowness of youth.”

Callow or not, he’s still at it. Mr. Adès said that in the score of “The Tempest,” which had its premiere in London in 2004, he had placed a high G in brackets, indicating a note that at the time he only dreamed of hearing.

When she sang the part at the Met, Ms. Luna could reach the G. Now, more than a decade later, the score of “The Exterminating Angel” has a high B in brackets — yet another seemingly impossible note, waiting patiently for a soprano who can crack yet another music-stave ceiling.","At the Met Opera, a Note So High, It’s Never Been Sung Before",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/arts/music/metropolitan-opera-high-note-exterminating-angel.html

The Times analysis, using the open-source software TaxBrain, found that roughly one-quarter of families in the middle class would see their taxes increase in 2018, by about $1,000 on average. By 2026, the share seeing an increase would rise slightly, to about one-third, and the average increase would rise to about $1,600. For the majority of middle-class families that receive a tax cut, the average savings would be about $1,300 in 2018 and $1,700 in 2026.

How Much Would People Save? People across income brackets would see savings from the Senate plan in 2018. But for many in the middle class, the savings would be relatively small. The table below shows the average savings, by income, for those who would receive a tax cut.

The Times analysis defines the middle class broadly as those earning between two-thirds and twice the median household income, or about $50,000 to $160,000 per year for a family of three. To focus on families, the analysis excluded individual filers and households headed by people 65 or older and is adjusted for the size of each household.

Under the House bill, The Times has found, about half of middle-class families would pay more in taxes in 2026.

The analysis did not seek to calculate how workers might benefit from a steep cut in the corporate tax rate, which both the Senate and House bills would reduce to 20 percent from a top rate of 35 percent today, or project how the bills might increase economic growth and, with it, Americans’ wages.

On Friday, the independent Tax Foundation released an analysis of the plan’s growth effects. It projected that the Senate bill would increase gross domestic product by 3.7 percent over the next decade and raise wages by 2.9 percent across the economy.

For taxpayers earning more than $1 million a year, the Senate bill offers a more limited upside and downside than the House bill.

The Senate bill is less likely than the House bill to yield tax increases for high-income Americans, in part because it cuts the top marginal personal tax rate, while the House bill creates a so-called “bubble rate” that would actually raise taxes on many high-salaried workers.

The Senate measure would also produce a smaller average tax windfall for high earners than the House version, in part by offering less generous benefits for owners of businesses known as pass-throughs, which are not organized as corporations.

Under the Senate plan, “Americans are especially likely to face a tax increase if they have a smaller family, have mostly wage income instead of investment income, or claim some of the many deductions that the bill repeals, like those for state and local taxes and employee business expenses,” said Lily Batchelder, a professor and tax specialist at New York University Law School, who worked on economic policy in the Obama administration. “They are increasing taxes on many in the middle class, while concentrating their tax cuts on the wealthy.”

The Senate bill appears much better for the very wealthy than it is for the somewhat wealthy. About half of families earning between two and three times the median income — or about $160,000 to $240,000 for a family of three — would pay more in 2018 than under existing law. But among the richest families, those earning more than about $500,000 for a family of three, nearly 90 percent would get a tax cut.

The findings come with an important caveat: The Senate bill, as written, appears unable to muster the 60 votes needed to avoid a Democratic filibuster, meaning Republicans will need to amend it to comply with the budget reconciliation rules and allow permit passage by a simple majority. Those changes could likely include putting expiration dates on some of the bill’s major provisions, which could make the final version of the bill look less favorable to the middle class, particularly in later years.

The Times’s figures are based on an analysis of Census Bureau data using a tax model from the Open Source Policy Center, a Washington research organization affiliated with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. Because the analysis is based on publicly available data, not actual tax records, it may not capture all the intricacies of Americans’ household finances.

The Senate bill differs sharply from the House version in its approach to cutting taxes on businesses. But when it comes to taxes on individuals and families, the bills are more similar than different. Both would double the standard deduction while eliminating a raft of deductions and credits. Both would make the child tax credit more generous. Both would restructure federal income tax brackets to impose lower marginal tax rates at most income levels, although the Senate approach, unlike the House version, doesn’t eliminate two brackets entirely.

The Senate bill includes features that would make its plan more favorable to the middle class. It preserves some popular tax deductions and credits that the House bill initially would have eliminated, and it makes the child tax credit somewhat more generous and widely available. On the other hand, the Senate bill, unlike the House version, would eliminate the deduction for property taxes, which could lead to higher federal taxes for homeowners in areas with high property tax rates or expensive housing markets.

Aparna Mathur, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said senators could improve the bill with further changes, such as expanding the earned-income tax credit and extending the benefits of the child tax credit to more low-income taxpayers. “We clearly need to do more to help the lowest-income families,” she said. “At the same time, we can engage in more base broadening for the highest-income households, perhaps by eliminating and not just capping the mortgage-interest deduction.”

The Times analysis found that roughly one-fifth of the Senate bill’s cuts in 2018 would go to families and individuals earning $1 million or more, and close to half would go to people earning at least $200,000. Between 10 million and 15 million taxpayers earning less than $100,000 a year would pay more than under existing law.

Families earning more than $1 million a year would see their after-tax income rise by about 1.7 percent in 2018 compared with what they would make under current law, nearly triple the gains enjoyed by those earning less than $200,000.

Over all, the Senate bill would cut individual income taxes by about $30 billion in 2018, and by $900 billion over the next decade, according to Congress’s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.

And Mr. Brady said explicitly that the revision would preserve the carried interest provision for real estate interests.
But as a symbol, the carried interest loophole looms large, calling into question the fairness of the entire proposed tax code.
Republicans seem to be gambling that most Americans won’t care about a few rich private equity managers if their own taxes go down, their stock portfolio goes up and economic growth accelerates.
“I don’t think most Republicans really care about carried interest,” he said.","The former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was excoriated for taking advantage of the loophole in 2012, and as a candidate Mr. Trump repeatedly promised to close it.

“The hedge fund guys didn’t build this country,” Mr. Trump said in 2015. “These are guys that shift paper around, and they get lucky.”

“They are energetic,” he added. “They are very smart. But a lot of them — it’s like, they are paper pushers. They make a fortune. They pay no tax. It’s ridiculous, O.K.?”

Yet in the House plan unveiled last week, and in the Senate plan released Thursday, the carried interest loophole emerged unscathed.

The proposed legislation “is a home run for private equity investors,” said Victor Fleischer, a law professor at the University of San Diego who has spent years arguing (persuasively, in my view) that the loophole should be closed. “If you were designing something that perfectly avoids hitting private equity, venture capital and real estate, this would be it.” (Mr. Fleischer is also a contributor to The New York Times.)

This week, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, said he would address concerns about the loophole by seeking to extend the holding period for assets that qualified for the tax break from one year to three years. That’s better than doing nothing, and might affect some hedge funds. But they could easily qualify simply by holding the assets for more than three years.

Mr. Brady’s tweak would have no impact at all on most private equity managers, who typically buy companies, restructure and refinance them, and then sell them, usually after seven to 10 years. Most real estate partnerships have similar holding periods. And Mr. Brady said explicitly that the revision would preserve the carried interest provision for real estate interests.

“The amendment will encourage and reward long-term investment while also applying equally to all sources of growth capital — no matter if that investment is provided by hedge funds, private equity, venture capital or otherwise,” Shane McDonald, a spokesman for Mr. Brady, told me. “By providing a three-year holding period on certain assets, this amendment strikes the right balance for economic growth and fairness without stifling investment in American entrepreneurship.”

But the primary argument against the carried interest loophole isn’t that those who benefit from it don’t hold their assets long enough. It’s that the “carry” — the percentage of an investment’s gains that the manager takes as compensation — should be treated as a payment for services and taxed like regular income, and not be viewed as a return on invested capital, in which the manager has put assets at risk.

“The real issue is that carried interest is compensation for services performed for the investment fund,” Mr. Fleischer said. “The theory behind the Republican plan is that somehow, holding something for a longer period of time makes it more like a financial investment. But why would that be the case?

“If you write a book, and it takes three or four years before you earn a royalty, that doesn’t make the income a capital gain,” he continued. “If a movie takes three years to generate a return, that doesn’t make it a capital gain. There’s no reason why financial services should be any different.”

Proponents of the loophole, most of whom benefit from it one way or another, have long argued that the lower tax rate encourages risk taking and hence economic growth, an argument that Republican lawmakers appear to have embraced.

But there’s little empirical support for the position.

Mr. Fleischer argues that the proposed tax bill — by slashing the corporate and pass-through tax rates and preserving the lower rate for capital gains — already heavily favors risk taking and investment.

“We don’t need to further subsidize people who go to work in this sector by giving them a lower tax rate,” he said. “There’s no shortage of people who want to go into private equity and earn millions or billions of dollars.”

The rationale, he said, “is absurd.”

That the carried interest provision survived, despite Mr. Trump’s campaign statements and populist hostility to it, appears to be a testament to the enduring influence that Wall Street and wealthy investors exert over both the White House and Congress.

Some of Mr. Trump’s most prominent backers and donors come from the world of private equity, hedge funds and real estate partnerships, among them Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the powerhouse firm Blackstone; Wilbur Ross, the former private equity executive who is now secretary of commerce; Thomas J. Barrack, Jr., executive chairman of Colony Northstar, a real estate investment trust, and chairman of the president’s inauguration committee; Betsy DeVos, a co-founder of the Windquest Group and now secretary of education; and Stephen A. Feinberg, a co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management and a Trump donor and adviser. And Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, are prominent alumni of Goldman Sachs, which has a range of hedge fund and private equity clients.

More broadly, preserving the break for carried interest fits into the overarching theme of the Republican tax plan: that what is good for investors is good for economic growth, which in turn is good for everyone, including the working poor. That’s why the proposed code is tilted so heavily toward investors rather than people who earn salaries or compensation for services rendered.

That’s also why it’s imprecise to say the proposed code benefits the “rich.” While most rich people are also investors, and thus will benefit disproportionately, not all rich people will benefit. People with high incomes generated primarily by their own labor or services may actually see their federal tax increase, especially if they lose their deductions for state and local taxes. The proposed code specifically names lawyers, doctors, athletes and performers — all of whom work for a living — as ineligible for the lower pass-through rate.

The plan “is a tax increase on the working upper middle class and the rich in states like California, New York and New Jersey in order to benefit the people who own pass-through entities and are shareholders,” Mr. Fleischer said.

Tax reform advocates generally agree that a fair code shouldn’t single out certain groups for favorable treatment at the expense of others. There is already widespread resentment that ultrarich investment managers pay such low rates — nowhere near the top 39.6 percent rate.

Closing the loophole may promote fairness, but it wouldn’t do much to help the overall budget deficit. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that eliminating it would generate $17 billion over 10 years, a drop in the bucket given that Republicans have been trying to close a budget gap in the trillions. Mr. Fleischer contends that the figure is much higher, more like $180 billion over 10 years. Even that is a modest down payment on the larger cuts the tax plan calls for.

But as a symbol, the carried interest loophole looms large, calling into question the fairness of the entire proposed tax code. That’s a shame, since large elements of the proposal have widespread bipartisan support. (Even former President Barack Obama agreed that the corporate tax rate needed to be lowered for the United States to be competitive.)

There’s still a chance that lawmakers will eliminate the loophole as the bill moves through Congress.

Mr. Rosenthal said he wasn’t holding his breath. Republicans seem to be gambling that most Americans won’t care about a few rich private equity managers if their own taxes go down, their stock portfolio goes up and economic growth accelerates. “I don’t think most Republicans really care about carried interest,” he said.",A Tax Loophole for the Rich That Just Won’t Die,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/business/carried-interest-tax-loophole.html

In “The Exterminating Angel,” based on the 1962 Luis Buñuel film, Ms. Luna plays Leticia, an opera diva who is part of a blue-bloods dinner party, the guests of which find themselves mysteriously unable to leave at the end of the evening. The vocal demands are a workout for almost every performer onstage.

“The note,” Mr. Adès said, “the range, the tessitura, is a metaphor for the ability to transcend these psychological and invisible boundaries that have grown up around them.”

Adding to the excitement of the high A is its placement in the score. Unlike in other high-flying parts — the imperious Queen of the Night in “The Magic Flute,” the spunky Zerbinetta in “Ariadne auf Naxos,” the long-suffering title role in “Lucia di Lammermoor” — there’s little time for Ms. Luna to warm up: The A is her very first note, sung before she’s even visible onstage. (She sings it again a short time later, as the party guests, in a surreal portent, leave the stage and re-enter.)

“It’s a moment of arrival,” Mr. Adès said. “It had to be on this note.”

Growing up in Oregon, Ms. Luna sang the daunting Queen of the Night when she was still in high school “just because it was fun,” she said. “And I liked the sensation it made in my bones, in my head, in my sinuses. It just gave me a high. It still gives me a high.”

Her topmost register is unusually lucid and effortless. Even in those notes unattainable by most other sopranos, and even when those notes are held far longer than the pecks requested by most other composers, Ms. Luna’s tone is full. She manages to avoid shrillness in what she aptly calls the “Wagnerian coloratura spectacle” that is her final “Exterminating Angel” aria, a flood of sustained superhigh sound up to F.

Even if nothing in previous Met history has equaled her high A, other singers have come close, sometimes adding unwritten interpolations and transpositions to show off their personal stratospheres. A number of the highest notes in Met history have emerged from sopranos singing the title part in “Lucia di Lammermoor”; it’s no coincidence that this is the role Ms. Luna’s character performs just before the dinner party at the start of “The Exterminating Angel.”

Ellen Beach Yaw, born near Buffalo in 1869, sang a G above C as Lucia in her single Met performance in 1908. The review in The New York Times praised her “flutelike Santos-Dumont notes,” comparing her to a Brazilian aviation pioneer, and added, in a reference to a Wild West gunslinger: “She hit that high G as promised, but it is like Bat Masterson hitting a tomato can with a .44 at four paces.”

The celebrated French soprano Lily Pons sustained a high F in the final mad scene from “Lucia” — sung, at her Met debut in 1931, “in legitimate note, not bird whistles or falsetto,” according to The New York Post. At the turn of the 20th century, Sibyl Sanderson, as Massenet’s Manon, hit a G, known as her “Eiffel Tower note.” Mado Robin, a French coloratura, was recorded shrilling up to a B flat, but she never sang at the Met.

More recently, Natalie Dessay was known in New York for her crystal-clear G’s as the mechanical doll Olympia in Offenbach’s “Les Contes d’Hoffmann.” Just this fall, Erin Morley’s Olympia ornaments brought her up to A flat, a feat Rachele Gilmore achieved in the role at the Met in 2009.

The company admits it is possible that an even higher note could have slipped through the archival cracks. “There’s no record keeping of such things, especially of improvised stuff,” said Peter Clark, the Met’s archivist, who remembers hearing Pons’s F on a radio broadcast as a child. “So it’s not to say that in 1908, say, something higher didn’t happen. But I doubt that it wouldn’t be mentioned somewhere.”

“The Exterminating Angel” isn’t the first time Mr. Adès has pushed a singer to extremes, nor was “The Tempest.” In fact, one of his very first works, “Five Eliot Landscapes” for soprano and piano, from 1990, ends on a sustained G flat.

“It’s a certain amount of useful cruelty involved,” he said with a chuckle, before correcting himself. “Not cruelty, but the callowness of youth.”

Callow or not, he’s still at it. Mr. Adès said that in the score of “The Tempest,” which had its premiere in London in 2004, he had placed a high G in brackets, indicating a note that at the time he only dreamed of hearing.

When she sang the part at the Met, Ms. Luna could reach the G. Now, more than a decade later, the score of “The Exterminating Angel” has a high B in brackets — yet another seemingly impossible note, waiting patiently for a soprano who can crack yet another music-stave ceiling.","At the Met Opera, a Note So High, It’s Never Been Sung Before",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/arts/music/metropolitan-opera-high-note-exterminating-angel.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

It has also occasioned a suite of exhibitions in this region, under the umbrella title “1917: Total War in Flanders,” that explore how the Great War intensified 100 years ago into an unprecedented catastrophe.

These shows, in museums and at battle sites, examine a wide range of topics: the use of photography in the war effort, the provision of medical care, the participation of colonial forces and the ecological impact of the fighting. All of them complement the region’s already substantial collection of museums and heritage sites, including large Commonwealth, German and Belgian cemeteries and monuments at almost every intersection. Free of the nationalism that can divert military anniversaries — consider “Blood Swept Land and Seas of Red,” the grossly jingoistic installation of ceramic poppies that festered around the Tower of London in 2014 — these Belgian exhibitions are models of sincerity and sobriety.

I traveled here to see them in part to consider whether museums can make sense of war, and in part because, like most Americans, I felt I knew too little about World War I. Passchendaele may be a byword for suffering in Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but in America it is hardly known, and the larger war, which killed more Americans than Korea and Vietnam combined, has long been overshadowed by subsequent conflicts.

Washington still has no World War I memorial; if it ever gets one, it will not be on the National Mall. New exhibitions and displays at several Smithsonian museums have elicited almost no media coverage.

(Ypres is the French name for this city of 35,000; these days it goes by the Dutch name Ieper, though Commonwealth soldiers, struggling with the French monosyllable, pronounced it “Wipers.”)

The museum’s permanent exhibition, which opened in 2012, tells a harrowing story of the war in Flanders from 1914 onward, and mixes archival materials with some uncommonly sensitive multimedia features. Shovels and water pumps evoke the trenches, and gas masks recall that earlier battles around Ypres, in 1915, saw the first use of chemical weapons in warfare.

In 1916, buoyed by the French prime minister Georges Clemenceau’s call for a “total war,” in which industry and civil society joined with the military for an all-out onslaught, British generals ordered troops to make excruciating, pointless sallies that gained a few meters of territory at the expense of thousands of lives.

A battle meant to last 72 hours slogged on for five months. Yet generals and grand strategy are largely absent in this museum; instead, at intervals, screens show actors reading the diaries of ordinary troops, Allied and German alike, who see the carnage up close. One panoramic screen features Harvey Cushing, the American doctor in Mr. Englund’s “The Beauty and the Sorrow,” who with two nurses recounts the daily casualties, and how their early delusions of the grandeur of war gave way to the ire and fatalism that would become the hallmarks of European modernism.",How to Remember a War Without Glory?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/arts/design/ypres-exhibitions-world-war-i.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

She saw: “Children in proper school uniforms carrying shoes, trying to decide between the lure of a coco palm adventure to one side and the delicious morning sea on the other.”

I, too, saw children, dozens of them on either side of the street one morning. Most of the children wore traditional uniforms, white shirts and blouses and plaid skirts or dark or khaki shorts or pants. They huddled together chatting and giggling, not paying attention to the dark blue sea on one side or the colorfully painted houses and buildings in the hills on the other. These children reminded me of children you would see heading to school in my native Haiti, or most other Caribbean islands, their range of black and brown skin glistening in the sun. The older ones kept their younger siblings at their side, even as they climbed into public transportation minivans and buses.

I went in search of more of those “vivid images” in Lorde’s essay and, besides the school children at Grand Anse Beach, there was Fat Woman-Who-Fries-Fish-In-The-Market. I did not see her inside the turquoise-and-white square building downtown. She was not standing near the massive fish laid out on slabs waiting to be gutted. Nor was she by the smaller ones piled into buckets out front.

The fish market smelled predictably like the sea. The buzz of the customer and buyer exchanges was a lot more subdued than I expected. Not all the vendors had customers. The market’s relative calm on a Friday afternoon reminded me how small Grenada is. The island is 120 square miles and has about 100,000 residents.

That night while pondering all this in my hotel room at the Coyaba Beach Resort, I parted the curtains and looked for a full moon to turn the beach outside “flash green.” October is perhaps the wrong time of year for this. Lorde had seen the sand turn green in April. There was no full moon, but I slept with the sliding door to the terrace open so I could hear the waves gently grazing the shore.

I AM NOT A GOOD TOURIST. I can easily evoke for myself the worse case scenario in any type of travel situation. I have immigrant guilt about taking time off. I am a bad swimmer. I am self-conscious in bathing suits, so most of my tourism is done through books. But because of my writing, I am invited to quite a few places and whenever I can I go.

I was in Grenada, which was largely unaffected by the hurricanes, to receive an honorary degree from the University of the West Indies Open Campus. Unlike U.W.I.’s brick and mortar campuses, the Open Campus is a virtual one. The 657 students in my graduating class hailed from all over the English-speaking Caribbean. They earned their degrees online. Only 139 graduates would cross the stage though.

Not all the graduates always travel to the Open Campus ceremonies, my hosts from the University of the West Indies told me. However, this year there were students who wanted to come to their graduation in Grenada but could not. Most of the graduates travel from other countries for the Open Campus ceremony, which takes place in a different location each year. Many had homes that were damaged or destroyed. Some lost loved ones along with everything they owned.

I was told the story of one graduate from Trinidad who stayed home because she had donated her plane ticket money to relief efforts in Dominica, which has U.W.I.’s most devastated campus. Some of the students from that campus are still unaccounted for.

Hurricane Maria struck Dominica, the southernmost of the Leeward Islands as a Category 5 storm on Sept. 18. Dominica’s Prime Minister, Roosevelt Skerrit, whose own roof collapsed during the storm, later told CNN: “Our agriculture sector is 100 percent destroyed. Our tourism is, I would say, about 95 percent destroyed.”

In front of the supermarket across from the Coyaba Beach Resort were blue barrels lined up to collect food and other urgently needed supplies for Dominica. At The Beach House Restaurant, just north of the airport, where I attended a pre-graduation cocktail party the night before the ceremony, the young female singer entertaining us with classic soul, as well as Caribbean covers, reminded everyone to drop something in the basket that would usually hold her tips. This time the funds would go to Dominica.

I have never been to Dominica but now I wish I had. This is not just born out of a desire to see a place “before.” Before the devastation, before the storm. I am from a place, Haiti, that constantly evokes nostalgia in the people who have seen it, lived in it, and loved it “before.”

DOMINICA GRENADA Trinidad and Tobago GRENADA Gouyave Caribbean Sea Grenville Grand Etang National Park St. George’s Grand Anse Beach Coyaba Beach Resort The Beach House Restaurant St. George’s University Maurice Bishop International Airport 4 miles

This longing for before always saddens me because it makes the present seem even worse. But I still wish I had seen Dominica before, in part because it is the birthplace of one of my favorite novelists, Jean Rhys. The places that Antoinette, Rhys’ doomed narrator in “Wide Sargasso Sea,” longs for have flaming sunsets and rivers so clear that you can see the pebbles at the bottom. They have moss-covered gardens filled with orchids, hibiscus and flamboyants, which are illuminated at night by fireflies.

This is one of the ways I have imagined Dominica, along with what I have seen in travel guides: its high mountain peaks, forts, lush rain forests, reefs, gorges, lakes and water falls.

Dominica is also home to Xuela Claudette Richardson, the narrator of Jamaica Kincaid’s novel “The Autobiography of My Mother.” At 15, Xuela was taken by her father to Roseau, the capital of Dominica. Roseau, Xuela finds — like a lot of places in the Caribbean — “had a fragile foundation, and from time to time was destroyed by forces of nature, a hurricane or water coming from the sky as if suddenly the sea were above and the heavens below.”

“THE SECOND TIME I came to Grenada,” Audre Lorde wrote in “Grenada Revisited,” “I came in mourning and fear that this land which I was learning had been savaged, invaded, its people maneuvered into saying thank you to their invaders.”

Lorde’s second visit was in late 1983, after then U.S. president Ronald Reagan had deployed Marines to the island. Reagan declared that he wanted to prevent a “Soviet-Cuban” colony from taking root in Grenada and protect American citizens on the island, many of whom were students at St. George’s University School of Medicine.

I visited St. George’s University, whose students and officials, Lorde pointed out, later denied that they were ever in danger. The school, which is no longer just a medical school, but also covers other disciplines, is an island unto itself, with its many salmon-colored buildings, massive water tanks, security personnel and buses. All over the campus are breathtaking views of True Blue Bay, the point where the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean meet.

If Reagan was so interested in seeing democracy flourish in the Caribbean, Lorde wondered, why did the U.S. government support Haiti’s Jean-Claude Duvalier and his repressive regime? She also mentioned Puerto Rico.

In 1897, she wrote, “U.S. Marines landed in Puerto Rico to fight the Spanish-American War. They never left.”

Puerto Rico was as devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria as Dominica, Barbuda and the U.S. Virgin Islands. I have not been to Puerto Rico either. I have only visited it in books, particularly through the eyes of young Esmeralda Santiago in her memoir, “When I Was Puerto Rican.”

I imagined the guavas that she taught me and other readers to eat at the beginning of her book being no longer able to grow, the fields they came from deep in the countryside flattened, and the families that farmed them struggling to stay alive without food or clean water.

I watched an interview with the tireless mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulín Cruz Soto, and heard echoes of Audre Lorde in her voice.

“There is nothing that unites people more anywhere in the world than injustice,” the mayor said. “We have to get food, we have to get water or else we are being condemned to a slow death. It may be easy to try to disregard us. It may be easy because we are a U.S. territory and a colony of the United States. But we’re a people, damn it.”

The blessings of our islands are also our curse. Our geography gives us year-round sun and beautiful beaches, but more and more in the age of climate change, we are on the front line of destruction.

“We are a people” seems to be what we have been saying for generations to all our colonizers and invaders who seemed intent on destroying us. And now more than ever, Mother Nature, too.

We are a people, the Arawaks and Taínos might have said, even as they died trying to prove it. We have even inherited the word for hurricane, huracán, from them.

“Much has been terribly lost in Grenada,” Lorde wrote at the end of her 1983 visit, “but not all — not the spirit of the people.”

THE SPIRIT of the people is also captured in this poem I have been carrying with me for years before coming to Grenada. It was written by the Grenadian poet and short story writer Merle Collins.

“We speak,” she wrote in “Because the Dawn Breaks,” “for the same reason that the thunder frightens the child

that the lightning startles the tree …”

The people of the Caribbean speak, the poet wrote, because we “were not born

to be your vassals.”

Moore has vehemently denied the allegation, which was detailed in a Washington Post article on Thursday that was reported and written meticulously. Part of what made it so persuasive was that the girl — now woman — spoke on the record and has repeatedly voted for Republicans, including Donald Trump. She’s putting her name to her accusation and risking the harassment that could come with that, and she’s not easily cast as a pawn of Democrats trying to buoy Moore’s opponent, Doug Jones.

Also persuasive: She’s not alone. Three other women — all of them also named — told The Post that when Moore was in his 30s and they were between the ages of 16 and 18, he dated or tried to date them. One claimed that he plied her with alcohol before she was old enough to drink legally. None of these three accused him of unwanted sexual contact, but their accounts support the idea that Moore was untroubled by age gaps that would trouble a better man considerably.

Are you really surprised? If so, you might want to see a doctor about your amnesia, because my memory is pretty spotty and still I can recall Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker and Larry Craig and David Vitter, and with just a few minutes of Googling, I could fill the rest of this column with more names of more pastors and politicians who presented themselves as steadfast moral conservatives and were revealed to be agents of precisely the kind of behavior they so exuberantly condemned. These frauds and hypocrites are as legion now as lepers were in the days of Jesus.

If I sound bitter, I am, because they have long been among the principal purveyors of hatred for gay people like me. They’re a big reason that so many of us grew up terrified that we’d be ostracized, wondering if there was something twisted in us and confronted with laws that treated us as second-class citizens. We were supposedly in moral error, and thus deserved a lesser lot.

Second class is actually a much higher category than the one into which Moore would corral us. In 2002 he called sexual relations between people of the same gender “an act so heinous that it defies one’s ability to describe it.” Trust me on this: It’s not so terribly difficult to describe. I’ll walk him through it over a chicken salad sandwich in the Times cafeteria. My treat.

In 2005 he said that having sex with somebody of the same gender was akin to having sex with a cow, a horse or a dog, and that not having sex with a cow, a horse, a dog or a person of the same gender was “a moral precept upon which this country was founded.” I do not recall the bestiality clause of the Constitution, but, as mentioned, my memory is spotty.

In 2016 Moore was expelled as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court because he instructed the state’s judges to defy the United States Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. This was the second time that Moore was yanked from that job; he’d previously ignored a federal court’s ruling that a Ten Commandments monument should be removed from the Alabama Judicial Building. Some patriot he is. His particular take on his chosen religion overrides the law of the land and permits him to act as he sees fit. Imagine if all Americans adopted that attitude..

And it is most decidedly a personal take, in which he picks and chooses what to be outraged by. Although Christianity as I understand it doesn’t smile on the florid lying, womanizing, hypersexual vocabulary and assorted cruelties that have been prominent threads in Donald Trump’s life, Moore and many other evangelical Christians spared Trump their censure. I understand their motivation to vote for him: abortion. But that didn’t compel them to remain so mum about his misdeeds or summon the adoration that some of them did. (I’m looking at you, Jerry Falwell Jr.)

On Thursday, Moore tweeted that “the forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal — even inflict physical harm — if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me.” So this is a war waged on him and his kind? What about the war that his breed of conservatives has been waging on the rest of us? It is arrogant and without empathy, and some of its generals use their cause as camouflage.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Julia Child’s time in France inspired her to capture the country through its cuisine, introducing French cooking to kitchens around the world. But it was that same French magic — and Ms. Child herself — that inspired her husband, Paul, to also capture the country, albeit through a different medium, photography. A new book lets him offer a personal glimpse into the world beyond the kitchen.

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

Private colleges and universities have increased their endowments spectacularly through aggressive fund-raising and these kinds of investment and tax-avoidance techniques. Stanford University, one of the schools found to use offshoring, increased its endowment to $18 billion in 2012 from $2 billion in 1977. Harvard’s endowment grew to $32 billion (in inflation-adjusted dollars) from $6 billion during the same period.

The problem with enormous endowment growth is that private institutions have not used the resource boom to provide greater benefits to the public. Stanford is a case in point. Despite having increased its endowment tenfold, Stanford still only enrolls about 1,600 new freshmen every year — approximately the same number of new freshmen it enrolled annually in the 1970s. As a result, Stanford now spends about $55,000 each year on every full-time student, just from its endowment. That’s a ninefold increase since the 1970s after adjusting for inflation.

Harvard, Princeton and Yale all spend even greater sums per student from their endowments.

It’s true that a number of these wealthy universities have begun to increase the generosity of undergraduate financial aid, essentially offering free college, room and board to the lowest-income students. That’s a good thing, but most qualified low-income students receive zero financial aid from the wealthiest colleges because they are never admitted. According to the Stanford economist Raj Chetty, the top 38 private colleges today enroll more students from the top 1 percent of the nation’s income spectrum than from the bottom 60 percent. Basically, what wealthy colleges end up spending on low-income students is a drop in the bucket compared with what they could be doing.

America’s top public universities, on the other hand, have substantially increased their enrollments since the 1970s despite shrinking state funding. They also tend to enroll low-income students at much higher rates. The University of California, Berkeley, enrolls more low-income students than the entire Ivy League.

It would be easier to turn a blind eye to the increasingly lavish exclusiveness of the Ivies if it didn’t come at such great public expense. Just three tax breaks related to endowments now come at a cost of nearly $20 billion in reduced federal tax revenue annually. If that $20 billion was captured as federal revenue instead, it would provide nearly enough funds to double the federal Pell Grant program for low-income students.

The answer is not necessarily to tax endowments, though they have only been fully tax exempt since 1984. But if wealthy private colleges want their endowments to remain tax exempt, they need to start providing much greater public benefits. The most obvious place to begin is a substantial increase in undergraduate enrollment, especially of underrepresented students.

There has been a marked increase in anxiety about the cost and value of a college degree. Wealthy colleges could help assuage that by enrolling many more students from other walks of life. They can certainly afford to do so.",How the Ivy League Hides Its Cash,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/opinion/ivy-league-offshore-tax-stanford.html

Honey Nut is America’s best-selling breakfast cereal, and by a comfortable margin.

In the terror-struck and vertiginous days after Donald Trump’s election a year ago, as I tried to make sense of America’s new reality, I called people who lived, or had lived, under authoritarianism to ask what to expect. I wasn’t looking for concrete predictions — one of the disorienting things about that moment was that no one, no matter how learned, had any idea what was happening — but for insights into how the texture of life changes when an autocratic demagogue is in charge.

A secular Turkish journalist told me, her voice sad and weary, that while people might at first pour into the streets to oppose Trump, eventually the protests would probably die out as a sense of stunned emergency gave way to the slog of sustained opposition. The Russian dissident writer Masha Gessen warned that there’s no way, with a leader who lays siege to the fabric of reality, to fully hold on to a sense of what’s normal. “You drift, and you get warped,” she told me.

They were both right. The country has changed in the past year, and many of us have grown numb after unrelenting shocks. What now passes for ordinary would have once been inconceivable. The government is under the control of an erratic racist who engages in nuclear brinkmanship on Twitter. He is dismantling the State Department, defending the hollowing out of the diplomatic corps by saying, on Fox News, “I’m the only one that matters.”

He publicly pressures the Justice Department to investigate his political opponents. He’s called for reporters to be jailed, and his administration demanded that a sportscaster who criticized him be fired. Official government statements promote his hotels. You can’t protest it all; you’d never do anything else. After the election, many liberals pledged not to “normalize” Trump. But one lesson of this year is that we don’t get to decide what normal looks like.

That’s close to 20 percent of the corporate tax revenue that is collected each year. This is legal.

These figures represent a huge loss of resources that, if collected, could be used to cut taxes on the rest of us, or spent on social programs to help people in our societies.

How do they do it?

For an example, look no further than your search bar. In 2003, a year before it went public, Google (now a multinational conglomerate known as Alphabet) began a series of moves that would allow it to obtain favorable tax treatment in the future.

(now Alphabet) Google Ireland Holdings bermuda “Managed” (now Alphabet) Google Ireland Holdings bermuda “Managed” (now Alphabet) Google Ireland Holdings bermuda “Managed” Google Ireland Limited IRELAND (now Alphabet) Google Ireland Holdings bermuda “Managed” Google Ireland Limited IRELAND Google Affiliate Google Affiliate Google Affiliate Africa europe Middle east (now Alphabet) Google Ireland Holdings bermuda “Managed” Google Ireland Limited IRELAND IRELAND $$$ Google Affiliate France (now Alphabet) Google Ireland Holdings $$$ bermuda “Managed” Google Ireland Limited IRELAND IRELAND $$$ Google Affiliate France First, it transferred ownership of intellectual property related to its all-important search and advertising technologies to an entity named Google Ireland Holdings. Why Ireland? Because not only did it have favorable corporate tax rates, its regulations also allowed Google Ireland Holdings to incorporate there but be “managed” in Bermuda. Google Ireland Holdings then created another Irish subsidiary, Google Ireland Limited, and granted it a license to use the technology now owned by the Irish parent company. Under this arrangement, which as far as we know is still in place, it is Google Ireland Limited that actually licenses the tech of Google’s main business to all the Google affiliates in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. (Google has a similar offshoot in Singapore that covers business in Asia). Google France, for example, pays royalties to Google Ireland Limited. That entity in turn moves its profits to Bermuda via a royalty payment to the Google Ireland Holdings.

See where this is going? In 2015, $15.5 billion in profits made their way to Google Ireland Holdings in Bermuda even though Google employs only a handful of people there. It’s as if each inhabitant of the island nation had made the company $240,000.

The corporate tax rate there?

Zero

In doing this, Google didn’t break the law. Corporations like Google are simply shifting profits to places where corporate taxes are low. It’s not just Internet companies with valuable intellectual property that do this. A car manufacturer, for instance, might shift profits by manipulating export and import prices – exporting car components from America to Ireland at artificially low prices, and importing them back at prices that are artificially high.

According to the latest available figures, 63 percent of all the profits made outside of the United States by American multinationals are now reported in six low- or zero-tax countries: the Netherlands, Bermuda, Luxembourg, Ireland, Singapore and Switzerland. These countries, but above all the shareholders of these corporations, benefit while others lose.

My colleagues Thomas Torslov and Ludvig Wier and I combined the data published by tax havens all over the world to estimate the scale of these losses. The $70 billion a year in revenue that the United States is deprived of is nearly equal to all of America’s spending on food stamps. The European Union suffers similar losses.

So what can be done?

Thankfully, Ireland has announced it will close the “double Irish” loophole that Google used, and arrangements that take advantage of that loophole must be terminated by 2020. But similar strategies will be used as long as we let companies choose the location of their profits.

Just look at what Apple did in 2014 — it’s one of the most spectacular revelations from the newly released Paradise Papers. After learning Irish authorities were going to close loopholes it had used, Apple asked a Bermuda-based law firm, Appleby, to design a similar tax shelter on the English Channel island of Jersey, which typically does not tax corporate income. Appleby duly obliged, and Jersey became the new home of the (previously Irish) companies Apple Sales International and Apple Operations International.

A potential fix would be to allocate the taxable profits made by multinationals proportionally to the amount of sales they make in each country.

Say Google’s parent company Alphabet makes $100 billion in profits globally, and 50 percent of its sales in the United States (a relatively similar scenario to the first quarter of this year, in which that figure was 48 percent). In that case, $50 billion would be taxable in the United States, irrespective of where Google’s intangible assets are or where its workers are employed. A system similar to this already governs state corporate taxes in America.

Such a reform would quash artificial profit-shifting. Corporations may be able to shift around profits, assets, and subsidiaries, but they cannot move all their customers to Bermuda.

This system is not perfect, but it’s orders of magnitude better than both the laws that now govern the taxation of international profits and the tax package being proposed by congressional Republicans. Under the proposed plan some international profits would be taxed at 10 percent, but there are many likely exemptions.

One advantage of allocating taxable profits as I suggest is that this reform can be adopted unilaterally. There is no need for the United States (or any other nation that wants to cut down on tax avoidance) to obtain permission from anybody.

But we’d still face an equally daunting problem, the far more shadowy – and ultimately illegal – tax evasion of ultrawealthy individuals, many of them with net worths already bolstered by the proceeds of corporate tax avoidance. Here’s an example.

Meet Michael. Michael is the (fictional) chief executive and owner of an American company, Michael & Company. Like many people, he would like to pay as little in taxes as possible. But unlike most people, he can take some steps that will allow him to do just that.

Michael & Co. America Anonymous Shell Co. Inc. Cayman Islands Michael & Co. America Anonymous Shell Co. Inc. Bank Cyprus Cayman Islands Michael & Co. America Anonymous Shell Co. Inc. Bank Cyprus Cayman Islands Michael & Co. America Anonymous Shell Co. Inc. Bank Cyprus Cayman Islands First, he creates an anonymous shell company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, which has lax regulations on disclosing the identities of company owners. He then opens an account under the shell company’s name in Cyprus (or one of many other tax havens, such as Switzerland, Hong Kong and Panama, whose banks cater to the wealthy and aren't reliable about cooperating with foreign tax authorities). Finally, Michael & Company buys fictitious services from the Cayman shell company (“consulting,” for example) ... … and, to pay for these services, wires money to the shell company’s Cyprus account.

The transaction generates a paper trail that can appear legitimate at first glance. But the reality is more insidious. By paying for fictitious consulting, Michael fraudulently reduces the taxable profits of Michael & Company, and thus the amount of corporate income tax he pays.

And once the money has arrived in Cyprus, it is invested in global financial markets and generates income that the Internal Revenue Service can tax only if Michael reports it or if his Cypriot bank informs the I.R.S.

It’s supposed to, but many offshore banks have routinely violated their obligations in the past, by pretending they didn’t have American customers or hiding them behind shell companies. So this way, Michael can evade American federal income tax as well as paying fewer corporate taxes through his company.

And meanwhile, in America, if he wants to use any of the money stashed in Cyprus, he can simply go to an ATM and make a withdrawal from his offshore account.

How do we know all this?

Until recently, we did not have a good sense of who owns the wealth held offshore, but with my colleagues Annette Alstadsaeter and Niels Johannesen, we have been able to make progress thanks to leaks over the last few years. In 2015, the Swiss Leaks revealed the owners of bank accounts at HSBC Switzerland, and in 2016 the Panama Papers revealed those of the shell companies created by the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. These showed that 50 percent of the wealth held in tax havens belongs to households with more than $50 million in net wealth, a minuscule number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals who avoid paying their fair share. In the Paradise Papers, we see that these are not only Russian oligarchs or Belgian dentists who use tax havens, but rich Americans too.

As I mentioned above, about 11.5 percent of world G.D.P. is held offshore by households. For a long time, the bulk of it was held in Switzerland, but a fast-growing fraction is now in Hong Kong, Singapore and other emerging havens.

We can stop offshore tax evasion by shining some light on darker corners of the global banking industry. The most compelling way to do this would be to create comprehensive registries recording the true individual owners of real estate and financial securities, including equities, bonds and mutual fund shares.

One common objection to financial registries is that they would impinge on privacy. Yet countries have maintained property records for land and real estate for decades. These records are public, and epidemics of abuse are hard to come by.

The notion that a register of financial wealth would be a radical departure is wrong. And the benefits would be enormous, as comprehensive registries would make it possible to not only reduce tax evasion, but also curb money laundering, monitor international capital flows, fight the financing of terrorism and better measure inequality.",How Corporations and the Wealthy Avoid Taxes (and How to Stop Them),https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/10/opinion/gabriel-zucman-paradise-papers-tax-evasion.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

To spur local decision-making, the A.C.C.E. has also adopted model legislation pushing for more open bidding for water pipes.

“We’re just trying to take up policies that limit the size of government, that keep it from growing exponentially,” said Jon Russell, national director of the A.C.C.E. and a councilman from the town of Culpeper, Va.

Plastics are an obvious replacement for the country’s aging pipes. Lightweight, easy to install, corrosion-free and up to 50 percent cheaper than iron, plastic pipes have already taken the place of copper as the preferred material for service lines that connect homes to municipal mains, as well as water pipes inside the home.

Still, some scientists warn that the rapid replacement of America’s water infrastructure with plastic could bring its own health concerns.

Scientists are just starting to understand the effect of plastic on the quality and safety of drinking water, including what sort of chemicals can leach into the water from the pipes themselves, or from surrounding groundwater contamination. Studies have shown that toxic pollutants like benzene and toluene from spills and contaminated soil can permeate certain types of plastic pipes as they age. A 2013 review of research on leaching from plastic pipe identified more than 150 contaminants migrating from plastic pipes into drinking water.

“Plastics are being installed without any real understanding of what they’re doing to our drinking water,” said Andrew J. Whelton, assistant professor of civil engineering at Purdue University, and an author of the 2013 study. “We don’t know what chemicals we’re being exposed to.”

Sensing an opening, the iron pipe industry has started a public relations push of its own, voicing concerns over plastic, wooing President Trump with accolades for his infrastructure drive and setting up a war between the two industries.

“Iron is just more durable. It’s a more proven material,” said Patrick Hogan, president of the Ductile Iron Pipe Research Association, the industry’s main lobby group. “Iron’s been in the ground for 100 years.”

Plastic groups have criticized the studies, saying they focus on older generations of plastic piping and conflate different types of plastics. They also stress that their pipes are independently tested by the third-party organization.

“It’s not a new material. It’s a safe material. It’s independently tested,” said Mr. Hollands, executive director of the Uni-Bell plastic pipes group.

The industry outreach, at times, has been more overt.

At the height of Flint’s water crisis, the chief executive of one of the nation’s largest manufacturers of plastic pipes, JM Eagle, traveled to the beleaguered city and offered to replace the city’s lead pipes at no cost.

Pipes from JM Eagle would last 100 years and are a long-lasting and safe solution, the company’s chief executive, Walter Wang, told the City Council last February. “This water crisis, this contamination issue,” he said, “it’s hurting children and making them sick.”

JM Eagle, however, has faced recent legal problems. In 2013, a federal jury in California found that the Los Angeles-based company had defrauded states and municipalities for more than a decade by knowingly selling defective water pipes. In some places, PVC pipes that were supposed to last 50 years exploded in their first year, causing injuries and flooding.

JM Eagle declined to comment but has previously said the litigation was based on “scurrilous allegations” by a disgruntled former employee. Formosa Plastics, a Taiwanese industrial conglomerate that was its parent company at the time, agreed to pay $22.5 million in a settlement with municipalities and other government agencies in California.

The uncertainty over potable water pipes of all kinds is exacerbated by a lack of regulation over their safety. There is no federal oversight of the materials or processes used to manufacture plastic water pipes; instead, water pipes are certified and tested by an organization paid for by industry.

That organization, NSF International, displays a picture of the Capitol building on its regulatory resources web page and runs a hotline for questions on regulations and product safety. Yet it has never received regulatory authority from the federal government. Nor does it disclose test results for the pipes it certifies.

NSF International called its testing robust. “If a product does not meet the requirements of a standard, it will not pass,” said Dave Purkiss, the organization’s general manager of water systems.

For now, Flint is fitting the city with service lines made with another material: copper, at an expected cost of more than $140 million. Officials discussed creating a pilot area using plastic to replace the service lines to houses on several city blocks, according to Plastics News, though a Flint spokeswoman, Kristin Moore, said plastic pipes were not currently under consideration.

“When you take that inherent issue that we needed to rebuild trust of the citizens in the water system, we felt that copper was the way to go,” Michael McDaniel, a retired Michigan National Guard brigadier general put in charge of replacing Flint’s water pipes, said at a conference this year.

In Burton, just next door to Flint, budget realities have made plastics the realistic choice.

The small city of 29,000 saved $2.2 million by using plastic to replace its own 1930s-era water system after state regulators alerted the city to critically needed fixes. For a municipality struggling with a dwindling tax base, those savings were huge.

“We needed safe water, and we needed it fast. We needed to replace the system, and PVC was a good choice for us,” said Burton’s mayor, Paula Zelenko. “I’ve got to get the best bang for the buck, because bucks are hard to come by these days.”",$300 Billion War Beneath the Street: Fighting to Replace America’s Water Pipes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/climate/water-pipes-plastic-lead.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

A group of chic Parisians was bobbing absent-mindedly to “San Francisco,” by the Gallic rock legend Johnny Hallyday, which was blasting through the foyer. Others were picking through a jumble of costumes and props in an improvised photo studio. One woman had squeezed into a banana-yellow African batik dress; her partner had opted for retro sunglasses and an African feather wand. The couple regarded themselves with approval in a mirror, and struck a pose for a waiting photographer.

Parisian art galleries aren’t renowned for their decadent party spirit, at least not on weekday afternoons. But the Cartier Foundation was doing its utmost to get into the groove. A few days earlier, it had opened “Mali Twist,” a show dedicated to the renowned Malian photographer Malick Sidibé, and now a highlight of this year’s Paris Photo week. Some 250 black-and-white photographs crowd every inch of wall. In one, a pair of teenage boys in wildly patterned bell bottoms pose moodily with a guitar. Nearby, a glacially sophisticated young woman in shades and a tailored suit looks as if she were about to set off down a catwalk.

Billed as the largest Sidibé retrospective ever staged, and the first in continental Europe since the photographer’s death last year, “Mali Twist” pays tribute to a man who produced electrifyingly modern images of night life in the country’s capital, Bamako, in the 1960s and ’70s. On view through Feb. 25, it also retells one of the most remarkable stories in contemporary art. After growing up in rural Mali, the son of a stock breeder, Sidibé worked full time as a photographer for just a few decades, before disappearing into obscurity. After being “discovered” by Western curators in the ’90s, he ended up being awarded the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement at the Venice Biennale in 2007, the first photographer — and the first artist from Africa — ever to win that honor.

The show’s curator, André Magnin, recalled how he first encountered Sidibé, on a trip to Bamako in 1992. He had arrived on a mission to track down a mysterious photographer whose work he’d seen in New York. That man was Seydou Keïta, whose pensive studio portraits of Malians in the 1950s later won worldwide acclaim. Mr. Magnin contacted him, and while in Bamako, he also met a man who spent his time mending cameras and taking passport photos in a run-down joint called Studio Malick.

“In one night, in a few minutes, I met Keïta and Sidibé, two masters,” Mr. Magnin said, adding, “It was like a dream.”

The images that Mr. Magnin and his colleague Françoise Huguier turned up astonished the art world, and changed perceptions of African visual culture for good. Accustomed to depictions of remote tribes or shots of famine and conflict, Western viewers could scarcely believe their eyes: The idea that West African baby boomers spent the 1960s doing the twist or grooving to the Rolling Stones, like their contemporaries in Minneapolis and Marseille, was more than many could comprehend.

Manthia Diawara, a filmmaker who now teaches at New York University, grew up a few streets away from Studio Malick and was part of a teenage group that called itself Les Rockers. In a telephone interview from Senegal, he recalled how sitting for Sidibé became a rite of passage: “You went to your tailor with your James Brown album, and you said to him, ‘I want my jacket to look exactly like this,’ and you’d do your hair like him, everything else. Then Malick would take your picture and make you immortal.”",Malick Sidibé’s Mali: Scenes of a Rollicking Night Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/arts/design/malick-sidibes-work-reveals-a-hidden-africa-it-loves-to-party.html

(Buildings that were converted years after they were built — say, from rental to co-op — were analyzed separately.) There were a total of 11,893 sales, using data from July 2016 to June 2017.

Unsurprisingly, the city’s newest apartments, dominated by luxury condos, got top dollar, with a median sales price of $3.05 million, almost twice that of units in buildings constructed during the previous decade. The best bargains, however, weren’t found in the oldest apartments, but in the 1950s stock, which sold for a median $737,500, the lowest of any decade. Time was kinder to apartments built before World War II, which reached a sales peak of $1.5 million for apartments in buildings from the early 1900s.

The midcentury price drop is not just a matter of taste, but also of substance. “By postwar, the size of apartments were shrinking, the ceiling heights were down, and the number of rooms declined,” said Andrew S. Dolkart, a professor of historic preservation at Columbia University.

After World War II, a surge in housing demand and the development of previously underused land around the city’s elevated train lines, especially on the East Side, brought a wave of new rental buildings, he said.

One of the early successes was Manhattan House, built in 1951: a sleek, light-brick building in Lenox Hill, set back from the street with a large green space and private balconies for some residents. Now a condo, the building frequently has $3 million-plus listings.

The model was perhaps too successful, as developers cashed in on the white-brick look with derivative designs on the cheap. “It’s second-class architecture,” said Andrew Alpern, an architectural historian and author, of the era that eschewed the structural hallmarks of prewar design, like double masonry walls for sound insulation and windows in bathrooms and kitchens.

“For a while, they were despised by people who thought they had the right to despise them,” said Carol Herselle Krinsky, a professor of art history at New York University, about the early reception of postwar brick buildings. Even now, she added, “things haven’t changed much.”

As the New York Times lamented in a 1979 article, “Tower after tower of white or brown or red brick is the norm, with cramped rooms that are not so much well laid out as they are squeezed in for maximum profit.”

But these buildings, by and large, were not meant for the elite, historians said. Built mostly as rentals to meet pent-up demand, they catered to the middle class — or at least what passes for middle class in Manhattan.

And they remain some of the most affordable apartments in the city. More than two-thirds of sales in 1960s buildings over the past year were for less than $1 million — more in that price range than in buildings from any decade. Apartments from the 1960s were also among the most popular with the past year’s buyers, accounting for more than 14 percent of the analyzed sales, second only to those from the 1920s (16.3 percent of sales).

Many of the postwar buildings that were built as rentals were converted to co-ops in the 1980s, and they deserve recognition in their own right, said Jonathan J. Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, which analyzed the data.

“We could talk all day about the cranes dotting the sky today, but it pales in comparison to the conversion and new-development frenzy of the 1980s,” he said. Because most of the buildings being converted were originally rental, the units tended to be smaller and more affordable — especially compared to the luxury condos being sold today.

That combination of factors is why midcentury apartments remain one of the cheaper ways to get into hip neighborhoods, said Jaclyn B. Treinkman, an associate broker with Compass who recently listed an apartment in a stout 1959 building in Greenwich Village for $550,000. Similar but newer apartments in the area might list in the $700,000 range, she said.

“It was homey-slash-ugly,” said Devon Talbott, 30, an actor who owns the apartment with his family. The unit was configured as a studio, with red walls and dated finishes, when Mr. Talbott and his family bought it in 2007 for $465,000. But the comparatively low price, he said, allowed them to transform the roughly 500-square-foot space into a one-bedroom with two Murphy beds, a sliding partition wall and a small recording booth for Mr. Talbott, a voice actor for the Japanese animated series “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.”

The renovation, designed by Elise Kodish of Anne Zuckerberg Associates, incorporated 1960s and 1970s motifs like painted glass cabinets and a modernist chandelier hung above Macassar ebony wood cabinets with a tiger-stripe pattern. Mr. Talbott, who is now working on a horror web series called “Fear,” is selling because his family is moving to Brooklyn. But their fondness for postwar redos remains: They plan to keep a smaller studio that Ms. Kodish also revamped in a white-brick 1960s building across the street.

The postwar pedigree is a lure for others as well. The Sovereign, a 47-story tower in Sutton Place built in 1974, was designed by Emery Roth & Sons, an architecture firm known for prewar developments like the San Remo towers. Its International-style lobby — complete with Venini crystal chandeliers, iron-mesh curtains and rosewood paneling — remains largely unchanged.

In the building’s heyday, celebrities like Freddie Mercury and Calvin Klein lived there, said Jessica G. Ushan, an associate broker with Brown Harris Stevens who has sold more than 200 apartments in the Sovereign since the 1990s. The rock-star edge has dulled a bit in recent years, with more empty nesters than pop artists calling it home. But the building’s staying power is in its design.

Half the units have floor plans resembling the Classic Six or Classic Seven layouts of prewar apartments, with distinct living and dining areas and a maid’s room, Ms. Ushan said, while the other half are L-shaped, with a more modern, open floor plan. The under-nine-foot ceilings may be lower than those in most new development, but they are offset in part by the private balconies — and by the prices. As Ms. Ushan said, “It’s about half the price of a new condo.”

H.R. Vanoosten Morris, 52, a retired asset fund manager, is selling a two-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath unit in the building for $2.295 million. His husband, Neal Prince, who died in April and was an architect known for his interior design of the InterContinental Hotels, bought the unit in 1978. Mr. Prince kept the original Classic Six floor plan intact because he thought the formal dining and living rooms were ideal for entertaining. The space still has the designer’s antique-green marble flooring, mirrored walls and custom-built glass-and-metal dining table that seats at least 12, which will stay with the apartment.

Ms. Ushan said the buyer will likely want to renovate the kitchen, which is dated by today’s standards, and possibly open the adjacent pantry and maid’s room to create a larger open space. But she is not discounting the vintage appeal.

“Some things get so old, they get new again,” she said, noting that some buyers seek out retro décor with an eye to giving it a modern spin.

For other buyers of postwar apartments — particularly those built later — age is just a number.

“I guess the ’80s is a long time ago now, but it doesn’t seem like it,” said Sander Ross, a retired tax attorney. In 2014, he bought an apartment with his wife, Carol, the general counsel for a publishing company, at the Dag Hammarskjold, a concrete-and-glass condo built in 1984, for $1.775 million.

The 43-story tower in Turtle Bay, near the United Nations, was one of the first luxury condos built in the 1980s, said Richard Balzano, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman who sold the couple the two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath apartment.

“It was very much ahead of its time,” Mr. Balzano said, with features like nine-foot ceilings and building amenities like a children’s playroom and an indoor pool on the top floor — unheard of today, because developers now put the most expensive units at the top of the building.

The apartment needed work. Mr. Ross and his wife raised the ceilings, which had been lowered by a previous owner to house lighting, installed taller doors and gutted most of the space, at a cost of about $400,000. “I don’t think a co-op would have allowed us to do this kind of thing,” he said.

For their effort, they got a condo with some of the amenities of a newer building at a fraction of the price. (The median cost of a 1980s apartment last year was $1.19 million, compared to $3.05 million for new construction.) The unit has a balcony that overlooks several parks, and the master bedroom has a dead-on view of the Pepsi-Cola sign in Long Island City. They’re not planning to sell.

For Ms. Chwals, the serial home buyer in the 1960s West Village co-op, living in a midcentury building also meant a break from new-condo monotony.

“I liked that it wasn’t the sleek, post-Carrie Bradshaw version of New York,” she said, referring to the television series “Sex and the City,” which aired in the late 1990s and early 2000s. More to the point, she thought the prewar stock in her price range was tiny and overpriced.

Over the years, she has learned to appreciate the plainness of her building, the way an artist sees a canvas. “Because it’s a box, there’s no loyalty to preserving someone’s architectural vision,” she said of the renovations that she and her husband, Walter Lee, have done.

Ms. Chwals, 37, who works for an arts education nonprofit, made her first purchase there: a studio apartment, in 2004. In 2010, she and Mr. Lee, who is also 37 and works in financial services, bought a two-bedroom. Then they bought an adjacent studio to create a combined three-bedroom home with room for their two young daughters. Now they’re selling that three-bedroom apartment, which is listed for $3.795 million with James Morgan of Compass, to move into a larger duplex in the building.

In the three-bedroom, the couple took down interior walls to create a largely open floor plan. Working with the design firm Studio g & a, they used bright wallpaper, big art and colorful carpets to decorate the unadorned space. The living and dining areas flow together, and a sliding walnut door closes off a dressing room. The windows are not floor to ceiling, as in newer buildings, but Ms. Chwals sees that as a plus: “You’d end up living with your shades drawn, anyway.”

There is also something comforting about not living in the “it” building on the block. Over the years she has become friendly with her neighbors, who range in age from young parents to retirees.

“There’s a real sense of community that I don’t think we’d get if we were in a shinier new building,” she said.",The Plight of the Postwar Apartment,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/realestate/plight-of-postwar-apartment.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“Well, maybe Putin is right,” he replied, adding, “Maybe he’s more akin to me than I know.”

On immigration

In a July radio interview, Mr. Moore expressed a lack of familiarity with contemporary immigration issues, saying that he did not know what the Dreamer program was.

He has since studied up, and during a September debate attacked Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, calling the program a “mere memo” that violated the law.

In an earlier debate, he expressed strong support for President Trump’s views on immigration.

“I think everyone who is here illegally should be vetted to see if they should stay here,” he said. “I think those coming across the border are the bigger problem right now. Congress has to address why can’t we close our borders.

“We have got to support the president’s efforts to stop this,” he added. “If it takes a wall, I say build a wall.”

Mr. Moore denies the existence of evolution.

“There is no such thing as evolution,” he told The Washington Post this month. “That we came from a snake? No, I don’t believe that.”

On the Second Amendment

During a rally earlier this month, Mr. Moore expressed his strong support for the Second Amendment, and delighted a crowd by taking a small gun out of his pocket.

“Guns don’t kill; people kill,” he said. “Cars kill. Are we going to get rid of our cars? Are we going to get rid of our knives? No. We have to bring morality back to our country.”

On health care

Mr. Moore is likely to be a hard-liner on the subject of health care. In an appearance on Fox News on Wednesday, he called the Graham-Cassidy plan “socialized medicine” and said that he would not have supported it. “We promised to repeal Obamacare and we should repeal it.”

Despite running against a candidate who had extensive establishment support and was helped by a super PAC aligned with Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, Mr. Moore told Fox News that he was open to working with Mr. McConnell.

“As long as he stands for a Conservative agenda and what we promised people as Republicans, I’ll work with anyone,” he said.

Finally, through Twitter, I was able to reach someone close to the scene, Joseph Silva. He agreed to take some pictures of the emergency responders, email them to me and describe what he saw.

At the same time, Ms. Caron reached a local constable who confirmed a shooting had occurred at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs. There were numerous victims, including children, he said.

We were at last able to post our first article about 3 p.m. and build on our reporting in several updates. And as time went on, the scale and horror of what happened came into sharper focus.

The extent of the tragedy was driven home when I got a call from a parishioner, Sandy Ward. She was among several parishioners I found on a Facebook page for the church; I’d left a message for her hours earlier.

My interview with Ms. Ward was extraordinary. We’d spoken for about five minutes before she told me that three of her grandchildren and a daughter-in-law had been shot. Her grandson, 5, was shot four times and was in surgery, she said. At the time of our conversation, she was still awaiting word on her other family members.

I was struck by the unfailing politeness and consideration she showed by calling me back from a hospital at a time of great personal crisis. I wished her strength and healing. She asked for prayers.

Maybe it was my adrenaline starting to ebb or maybe it was this up-close example of the enormous tragedy that befell a small Texas community — but at the end of the interview, I could feel my voice starting to crack.

I got off the phone and took a moment to regain my composure. There was more work to do.

Besides, logic and moral consistency aren’t prevalent among Bible-thumping scolds.

Moore has vehemently denied the allegation, which was detailed in a Washington Post article on Thursday that was reported and written meticulously. Part of what made it so persuasive was that the girl — now woman — spoke on the record and has repeatedly voted for Republicans, including Donald Trump. She’s putting her name to her accusation and risking the harassment that could come with that, and she’s not easily cast as a pawn of Democrats trying to buoy Moore’s opponent, Doug Jones.

Also persuasive: She’s not alone. Three other women — all of them also named — told The Post that when Moore was in his 30s and they were between the ages of 16 and 18, he dated or tried to date them. One claimed that he plied her with alcohol before she was old enough to drink legally. None of these three accused him of unwanted sexual contact, but their accounts support the idea that Moore was untroubled by age gaps that would trouble a better man considerably.

Are you really surprised? If so, you might want to see a doctor about your amnesia, because my memory is pretty spotty and still I can recall Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker and Larry Craig and David Vitter, and with just a few minutes of Googling, I could fill the rest of this column with more names of more pastors and politicians who presented themselves as steadfast moral conservatives and were revealed to be agents of precisely the kind of behavior they so exuberantly condemned. These frauds and hypocrites are as legion now as lepers were in the days of Jesus.

If I sound bitter, I am, because they have long been among the principal purveyors of hatred for gay people like me. They’re a big reason that so many of us grew up terrified that we’d be ostracized, wondering if there was something twisted in us and confronted with laws that treated us as second-class citizens. We were supposedly in moral error, and thus deserved a lesser lot.

Second class is actually a much higher category than the one into which Moore would corral us. In 2002 he called sexual relations between people of the same gender “an act so heinous that it defies one’s ability to describe it.” Trust me on this: It’s not so terribly difficult to describe. I’ll walk him through it over a chicken salad sandwich in the Times cafeteria. My treat.

In 2005 he said that having sex with somebody of the same gender was akin to having sex with a cow, a horse or a dog, and that not having sex with a cow, a horse, a dog or a person of the same gender was “a moral precept upon which this country was founded.” I do not recall the bestiality clause of the Constitution, but, as mentioned, my memory is spotty.

In 2016 Moore was expelled as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court because he instructed the state’s judges to defy the United States Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. This was the second time that Moore was yanked from that job; he’d previously ignored a federal court’s ruling that a Ten Commandments monument should be removed from the Alabama Judicial Building. Some patriot he is. His particular take on his chosen religion overrides the law of the land and permits him to act as he sees fit. Imagine if all Americans adopted that attitude..

And it is most decidedly a personal take, in which he picks and chooses what to be outraged by. Although Christianity as I understand it doesn’t smile on the florid lying, womanizing, hypersexual vocabulary and assorted cruelties that have been prominent threads in Donald Trump’s life, Moore and many other evangelical Christians spared Trump their censure. I understand their motivation to vote for him: abortion. But that didn’t compel them to remain so mum about his misdeeds or summon the adoration that some of them did. (I’m looking at you, Jerry Falwell Jr.)

On Thursday, Moore tweeted that “the forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal — even inflict physical harm — if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me.” So this is a war waged on him and his kind? What about the war that his breed of conservatives has been waging on the rest of us? It is arrogant and without empathy, and some of its generals use their cause as camouflage.

And Finally ...

Say you want to show a friend Los Angeles. Taking her to lunch at Grand Central Market might be a good place to begin.

For the last century, the downtown landmark has hawked produce, spices and other goods to Angelenos of all races and classes. And more recently, the market has gentrified. (Goodbye apothecary. Hello Instagram-worthy egg sandwich!)

The bustle at lunch hour remains palpable, though and a few old-guard food vendors are still standing. In a town where people spend hours alone in their cars, the city’s immigrants, bankers and tourists continue to rub shoulders at Broadway and Hill Street.

Last week, after years of financial tumult, the historic market changed hands. Langdon Street Capital bought it from the Yellin Co., whose late founder purchased it in 1984, confident that a downtown renaissance was coming.

Locals have watched warily as that very renaissance has caused the market to undergo a rapid transformation. The new owners say they understand the anxiety and promise not to change much.

“I love the market,” said Adam Daneshgar, president of Langdon Street Capital. “This is a passionate project for us. The market holds such a significant place in the city.”

“We do believe there’s some greater potential for it,” he added. “But we love it as is.”

Then in 1996, an art historian identified it as a Michelangelo. The call was hotly debated, but the attribution has stood. And the “circa 1496-97” date now attached to the work makes it altogether possible that Michelangelo carved the figure at age 21, making him the prodigy he claimed to be.

With this sculpture, he had found what would be his favorite subject, and the one that would make his name: the heroic male body. Approximately a decade after the “Young Archer” came the colossal “David,” and with that Michelangelo was a star, a Medici darling, and on his way to becoming the new kind of public celebrity he aimed to be: not just a highly skilled maker of things, but a multitasking, miracle-working aristocrat of creativity called a genius. If Michelangelo didn’t coin the term, he (with a reluctant nod to Leonardo da Vinci) coined the type.

Prestigious commissions, in painting, sculpture and architecture, piled up. In 1504, he was asked to do a fresco for the Council Chamber of the Palazzo della Signoria, the seat of the Florentine government. Leonardo, more than 30 years his senior, and no friend, was assigned the opposite wall. The idea was that they both would paint a historic battle, Michelangelo’s being one in which a troop of 14th-century Florentine soldiers interrupted a swim in the Arno to take an enemy by surprise.

Photo

He turned the scene into a polyphonic chorale of pumped bodies: abs, pecs, lats, glutes, buns. We know the image well, though the fresco — thanks to the first of what would be endless Medici interventions — never got beyond the full-scale cartoon stage. Ink and chalk sketches on paper of the individual figures exist. So does a drawing of the whole composition, now so smudged it looks like a puff of smoke. The most vivid piece of evidence is a large 1540 oil painting here by Bastiano da Sangallo, who saw the finished cartoon before it was whitewashed out.

Photo

All of this material, now scattered among museums — the Louvre, the Uffizi, the Albertina in Vienna — has been brought together at the Met. This is how the exhibition, organized by Carmen C. Bambach, a curator in the museum’s department of drawings and prints, works. It ingeniously reconstructs Michelangelo projects by assembling related designs in dense, connect-the-dots clusters.

This is, of course, the only way to present architecturally scaled art, or long-vanished things. The show is as close as we can now get to seeing the massive sculptural tomb of Pope Julius II in its many aborted iterations; it was this “urgent” commission (years before Julius’s death) that pulled Michelangelo off the battle fresco. And a selection of plans — scribbled on paper scraps, spread across pasted-together sheets — for the facade of the Medici parish church of San Lorenzo adds up to a beguiling archive of thinking-in-progress. Rarely has architectural design felt more expressively personal, moody, painterly, calligraphic.

Part of Ms. Bambach’s goal, and one that she pursues in her labor-of-love catalog, is to revisit the original Renaissance concept of design — disegno — as a theoretical category, an aesthetic and ethical end in itself. A basic idea was that just as the physical world represented, in every shade and contour, divine labor so, on a human level, did (or could) art. Michelangelo benefited mightily from this elevation of the artist from workshop drone to deity (and brand). In his later megastar years, people actually referred to him as God. The Sistine Chapel ceiling is a work of disegno in excelsis: the story of the Creation told through superhuman craft.

Video

The exhibition’s long central gallery is given over to the ceiling, a project so complex that Michelangelo gave up organizing a production team and did most of the job himself. You can see him plugging away at it, on scaffolding just under the ceiling, in a self-caricature drawn in the margin of a handwritten sonnet. “I’ve already grown a goiter at this drudgery,” he grouses. “My brush, above me all the time, drips paint, turning my face into a perfect drop cloth.”

In the Sistine paintings — the male body — and nearly all the bodies are male — are muscle on top of muscle, Arnold Schwarzenegger circa 1975. The Classical ideal — balance, just-rightness — has been pumped out of existence. Mannerist too-muchness — the 21st century knows a lot about this — rules. Neither the ceiling, nor the later, nightmarish “Last Judgment,” is art you’re invited to love. It aims to overpower you, make you feel small, crushed by cosmic history. Some viewers find the experience a thrill. I’ve always found it off-putting.

It’s in drawings that I start to feel close to this art and its maker. One chalk-sketched titan has an oddly lumpy, imperfect, maybe-not-young body; and he’s sleeping. Clearly, he’s a studio assistant who’s been roped into posing at the end of a day. And while the mood of the “Last Judgment” fresco is full-orchestra cataclysmic, ink sketches for it can be light, almost tender. In one, the resurrected dead float in space, speck-like and weightless, like birds lifting off from a foggy lake.

And then there are drawings generated by tenderness itself. This is true of a gallery devoted to fanciful “divine heads,” including one of a doleful Cleopatra, that the middle-aged artist made as gifts for young male aristocrats — Gherardo Perini, Andrea Quaratesi, Tommaso de’ Cavalieri — on whom he had developed crushes. His black chalk portrait of Quaratesi, who was 37 years his junior, as a somber dreamboat with plush lips and faraway eyes is here and it’s an eye-stopper. So are several discretely erotic mythological drawings he gave as Valentines to Cavalieri who, whatever the sexual nature of their bond, became a lifelong friend.

Louis C.K. on Friday released a statement in response to a report published Thursday in The New York Times about several women who stepped forward to discuss experiences with him in which he committed acts of sexual misconduct. In his statement, Louis C.K. said, “These stories are true.”

[Louis C.K. Admits to Misconduct as Media Companies Cut Ties]

The complete statement from Louis C.K. appears below:

I want to address the stories told to The New York Times by five women named Abby, Rebecca, Dana, Julia who felt able to name themselves and one who did not.

These stories are true. At the time, I said to myself that what I did was O.K. because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true. But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn’t a question. It’s a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly. I have been remorseful of my actions. And I’ve tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I’m aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men who would never have put them in that position. I also took advantage of the fact that I was widely admired in my and their community, which disabled them from sharing their story and brought hardship to them when they tried because people who look up to me didn’t want to hear it. I didn’t think that I was doing any of that because my position allowed me not to think about it. There is nothing about this that I forgive myself for. And I have to reconcile it with who I am. Which is nothing compared to the task I left them with. I wish I had reacted to their admiration of me by being a good example to them as a man and given them some guidance as a comedian, including because I admired their work.

The hardest regret to live with is what you’ve done to hurt someone else. And I can hardly wrap my head around the scope of hurt I brought on them. I’d be remiss to exclude the hurt that I’ve brought on people who I work with and have worked with who’s professional and personal lives have been impacted by all of this, including projects currently in production: the cast and crew of Better Things, Baskets, The Cops, One Mississippi, and I Love You, Daddy. I deeply regret that this has brought negative attention to my manager Dave Becky who only tried to mediate a situation that I caused. I’ve brought anguish and hardship to the people at FX who have given me so much The Orchard who took a chance on my movie. and every other entity that has bet on me through the years. I’ve brought pain to my family, my friends, my children and their mother.

I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want. I will now step back and take a long time to listen. Thank you for reading.",Louis C.K.

Documentaries have been preserving the music through a historical lens, but it’s also being celebrated — and reimagined — through an artistic one.

SALAMISHAH TILLET Yes, I thought about that trend in June when BET premiered “Tales,” Irv (Gotti) Lorenzo’s series of “song stories.” Each episode is inspired by lyrics from hip-hop songs, like Notorious B.I.G.’s “I Got a Story to Tell.” After the first episode, I realized that hip-hop has been so influential in American culture that it made sense for it to shape the actual format of a television show too. Especially now, as TV networks are trying to appeal to a younger, more diverse audience.

QUESTLOVE I’m so jealous of “Tales,” at least in the concept. Back on “Chappelle’s Show,” one of the ideas we had that never quite panned out was similar in conception. Dave [Chappelle] wanted to make narrative stories out of hip-hop lyrics that, on their face, are just ridiculous. We developed one, based on Nas’s “If I Ruled the World,” where we took the line “I’d open every cell in Attica, send ‘em to Africa,” and built off that. The idea was that 2,000 prisoners in orange jumpsuits were getting off an airplane, and Nelson Mandela was standing there, saying, “What the hell?”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

CARAMANICA Not surprising that Chappelle was a decade before anyone else on that — I would have loved to see that through his lens. This conversation is reminding me of an annotation of Biggie Smalls lyrics that ran in Vibe magazine back in 1998. Michael Eric Dyson [now a professor at Georgetown University] likened them to “The Epic of Gilgamesh” and “The Godfather,” worthy of consideration alongside those great works of art. Back then, those were still newish, bold contentions.

Photo

TILLET Sometimes it’s easy to forget that the early creators of hip-hop had to prove over and over again that they were creating “music” and not so-called “noise.” But the recent crop of films, like “Straight Outta Compton” and “All Eyez on Me,” nostalgically remind us of those hard-fought battles and prove once again that hip-hop’s original naysayers and censors were dead wrong.

QUESTLOVE For me, I look at music within a 25-year cycle, a way of giving people in their thirties a last go-round of traveling through their childhood memories before they are required to be wise older statesmen and stateswomen. Hip-hop has reached that moment in the life cycle.

TILLET So, does this mean hip-hop is now in middle age? It is clearly the music of grown folks on television — the Roots are the house band on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” Biggie’s “Hypnotize” is selling Oreo Thins of all things, and “Empire” is a hit show. But what are the conditions that make hip-hop’s rising profile on TV possible? There are nearly 500 scripted shows a year now. One way of catering to niche audiences is to hire the kind of showrunners who haven’t been tapped before. In many cases, this means that those of us who grew up loving hip-hop are now both the creators and the consumers of these stories.

Photo

QUESTLOVE And the most interesting projects are the ones that have a sense of the history, and sometimes actually dramatize those links. The BET mini-series about New Edition was successful because it understood that history — it staged New Edition’s inspirations and influences as part of the story. All of these kids watching it and hearing “Holding On” came to see, for instance, that Jeffrey Osborne isn’t just the “On the Wings of Love” guy, but that he was in L.T.D., a funk and soul band whose work was one of the main inspirations for New Edition.

CARAMANICA The history of popular music in this country is in lock step with the rest of the country’s history, from the slavery era until now. That’s why it’s so crucial to tell these stories faithfully and from these perspectives. “Straight Outta Compton” is a biopic, but also functions as cultural and political history. “The Get Down” is magical realism, but doubles as a lens onto how the government-abetted devastation of New York City created the space for raw cultural innovation. These aren’t just stories about sounds — they’re documents, biographical or fictional, of our struggles as a nation.

TILLET That recent trio of films about West Coast hip-hop remind us of the underbelly of American history, showing us how police brutality against African Americans in the ’80s and early ’90s — like Rodney King’s beating by the L.A.P.D. — birthed N.W.A’s rage and enabled Tupac’s reign. In a way, the recent back-to-back appearance of these films validates these stories and underscores that their version of racial violence, despite the conservative backlash at the time (and today!), was the truth. These movies carry a political urgency that speaks volumes in our era of Black Lives Matter and of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem.

Photo

QUESTLOVE Now that I think about it, though, it’s also important to note that there’s an element that’s generally missing from this latest crop of films. That’s the drug and violence culture. Crack and guns were central to those movies of the ’90s, like “Juice” and “Menace II Society.” Now, hip-hop movies don’t depict them as much, maybe because the drugs of choice in our moment, like weed, are either accepted as recreational or are legal pharmaceuticals like opioids that are affecting white kids as much as black kids. That’s content rather than style, but it’s another example of how the idea of hip-hop culture has shifted over the years.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

CARAMANICA After the 90s — when we had “In Living Color,” “New Jack City,” “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” “Boyz N the Hood” and more — Hollywood’s appetite for black film and TV seemed to dry up. It spoke of a lack of imagination about the sorts of hip-hop-informed films and shows that might be made. “Dope,” which came out a couple of years ago, felt like a sibling to the films you’re talking about, but in a vastly different framework.

QUESTLOVE I really like “Dope,” which is an interesting movie to me, a bridge between the hard-core hip-hop movies of the ’90s and the more aware and inclusive millennial attitude that we have now. There’s more of an openness to sexual orientation, to educational possibilities and to different kinds of diversity.

Photo

Anyway, when you look back at all those events from the early 90s, whether the Los Angeles riots or the heyday of “Yo! MTV Raps,” you see a period where hip-hop became the vehicle for rebellion. Back then hip-hop wasn’t just selling like crazy, it was starting to represent the challenge to the established order that rock ‘n’ roll had represented for decades. When Nirvana topped the charts with “Nevermind,” it marked a sea change in American pop music. But, just before Nirvana, you have N.W.A’s “Efil4zaggin,” which was the first so-called hard-core hip-hop album to top the charts. Then you get Ice Cube’s “The Predator.” You have Cypress Hill’s “Black Sunday.” You have Snoop Dogg’s “Doggystyle.” So partly that’s why the nostalgia is coming in hot and heavy in the TV and film world now. That period of hip-hop is still so connected to ideas of challenging power and speaking out. It’s an alternative history.

TILLET “History gets told by the winners,” laments the R&B singer Michel’le in her Lifetime biopic “Surviving Compton,” which came out last year. As the film’s narrator, she is talking about her erasure from the rise of N.W.A in “Straight Outta Compton,” and by extension the absence of other black women from these stories. The movie depicts domestic abuse that the singer has alleged she experienced living with Dr. Dre and also focuses on the importance of her R&B vocal contributions to Dre’s early sound and success. (Dr. Dre has denied abusing Michel’le.) In many ways, the biopic is a corrective to “Straight Outta Compton” and “The Defiant Ones”; both link hip-hop’s maturity as a cultural phenomenon to the story of Dr. Dre coming into his manhood. “Surviving Compton” highlights the sexist challenges that African-American women endured as early producers, singers, rappers, D.J.s or just plain old fans of hip-hop.

QUESTLOVE Here, I want to make a case for “The Breaks,” which started as a TV movie and became a series on VH1 before moving to BET. “The Breaks” is about early ’90s hip-hop, and it’s well-crafted. The writing is great, and the minor details are correct. They get the drum machines right. They get the microphones right. It also helps that it was inspired by “The Big Payback,” a book written by one of the founding fathers of hip-hop journalism, Dan Charnas, who was writing long-form essays about the hip-hop world back before anyone wanted anything to do with it. He’s already part of the culture, and the show respects and extends that.

TILLET What I like about “The Breaks” is that its central character, Nikki, is a woman who is not a rapper or a D.J., but is the real genius behind the vision, hustle, sound and style of early ’90s hip-hop . (Like Cookie, who finally gets to be the C.E.O. on “Empire”!) She is a descendant of those pioneering female entrepreneurs and executives, like Sylvia Robinson of Sugar Hill Records, who ensured that hip-hop would live far into the future.

CARAMANICA I’m excited by the promise of what happens when the genre’s influence is even more diffuse — when hip-hop is more than just subject matter, or even a soundtrack, but rather serves as a knowledge base, aesthetic framework and value set that shapes all kinds of creative output. Look at Viceland’s slate of shows: You have a talk show, “Desus & Mero,” that’s high-end hip-hop public-access television; “Huang’s World,” in which the chef Eddie Huang reckons with global culture with a politics informed by hip-hop; and loose-format food programming starring the rapper-gourmand Action Bronson. None of these shows are about hip-hop in any real way, but they carry its values out into the world. Also I don’t want to gloss over how integral hip-hop has been in the late-reality-TV era, thanks to the Mona Scott-Young “Love & Hip Hop” empire and its many imitators.

TILLET And of course, reality shows like “Love & Hip Hop” or “Growing Up Hip Hop” have little to do with the music, but are all about interpersonal drama fueled by hip-hop culture. I’m more drawn to the shows and films that revel in hip-hop’s innovation rather than the ones steeped in nostalgia or melodrama.

QUESTLOVE To me, FX’s “Atlanta” is what would happen if Woody Allen directed Master P’s “I’m Bout It.” It’s one of the first black surrealist hip-hop comedies.

TILLET Set in the here and now, “Atlanta” and “Insecure” have the privilege of not fighting those early culture wars. They simply assume the reign of hip-hop today and are more experimental with how they incorporate a hip-hop aesthetic into their shows. “Atlanta” is the best analogue to hip-hop I’ve ever seen on TV — the storytelling is playful, defiant, dissonant, magical, tragic, decadent and triumphant, all at once. And what’s so fun about Issa Rae’s protagonist Issa Dee on “Insecure,” is that she isn’t a wannabe M.C., but, rather, rap is the art form she turns to on the fly, when she is talking to herself or her friends.

CARAMANICA To me it’s further confirmation of what we’ve known for years already: Hip-hop is lingua franca. On “The Mayor,” the new ABC sitcom, a rapper runs for mayor — and wins — and I don’t find it even slightly fanciful. Mostly I’m just trying to figure out which real-life rapper is going to make this fictional narrative real.

TILLET “The Mayor” feels like a bit of a throwback to me. Like if the “Fresh Prince” ran for public office. But I love the idea that his mayor’s political obligations are now competing with his artistic ambitions. That is the dilemma actual hip-hop artists, like Jay-Z, are trying to reconcile for themselves.

CARAMANICA I found it striking that Courtney Rose, the titular mayor [played by Brandon Micheal Hall], says right off the bat that he wants to perform with Taylor Swift, a gesture seemingly aiming to please people both red and blue. (Though to be honest, it probably would have the opposite effect.) There’s a genteel political toothlessness that you’d expect from an ABC family sitcom, but maybe there’s something quietly radical about hip-hop inserting itself even into that prosaic format.

TILLET On the flip side of family-friendly TV, I’m assuming USA’s “Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and The Notorious B.I.G.” is a culmination of the network’s move beyond blue skies to a grayer, more serious television lineup. Most important, here’s hoping that the slate of programs coming two decades after Biggie’s murder in 1997, including the Johnny Depp movie “LAbyrinth,” pressure the Los Angeles police to finally solve these murders, give the rappers’ families some closure and get all of us who grew up with their deaths as our generational tragedy closer to the truth than ever before.",Rap Disrupted Music First.

Paz de la Huerta, an actress known for her work on “Boardwalk Empire,” has accused the movie mogul of raping her on two occasions in 2010 in her TriBeCa apartment. The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., has said his office is investigating those accusations.

The accusation presents challenges for investigators. Seven years have passed and the crime was not reported to the police at the time. Ms. de la Huerta did speak to a therapist about the encounters, saying she felt coerced to have sex with Mr. Weinstein because of his power and rank in the industry, according to her lawyer, Aaron Filler.

But when Mr. Schein saw it, he immediately believed that the man holding the guitar was Johnson.
With help from Tom Crandall, a friend in the store’s repair shop, Mr. Schein won the auction in 2005.
Mr. Schein has been unable to look for other photos taken by Johnnie Mae Crowder.","The deal was done at a crossroads.

There, according to legend, the bluesman Robert Johnson sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for otherworldly musical prowess — guitar playing, singing and songwriting that would make him an idol, still studied and revered almost 80 years after his death.

Zeke Schein came to a crossroads, too, when he bought an old photo (Slide 1) that he believes is only the third known image of Johnson. Johnson’s family, a prominent forensic expert and musicians who’ve been transformed by the bluesman’s recordings agreed with Mr. Schein. But skeptics questioned the likeness, the date — even Mr. Schein’s motives.

Intent on defending himself and the image, Mr. Schein began a journey to learn more about the sharp-dressed men in the sepia print. He chronicles his search in “Portrait of a Phantom: The Story of Robert Johnson’s Lost Photograph,” a book he co-wrote with Poppy Z. Brite, recently published by Pelican.

He talked about the book at another crossroads, Matt Umanov Guitars, a Greenwich Village landmark where he has worked since 1989. He wrote that the store is such a magnet that “if you sit at the front counter of Matt Umanov Guitars, the world comes to you.” Since we began this conversation Matt decided to close the store after 53 years. Zeke put on his walking shoes, and moved on to Rudy’s, his next crossroads.

Mr. Schein discovered the photo while searching for old guitars on eBay. The 3-inch-by-4-inch print from sheet film wasn’t in great shape – “The photo looked haunted, like it had been to hell and back,” he wrote. But when Mr. Schein saw it, he immediately believed that the man holding the guitar was Johnson.

With help from Tom Crandall, a friend in the store’s repair shop, Mr. Schein won the auction in 2005. Mr. Schein was familiar with vintage and vernacular photography. He makes photographs as well as plays music, with a deep appreciation of the tools of each form, since before selling guitars, he’d sold cameras and worked in a lab. He immediately thought the image was a contact print from sheet film, likely done with a Speed Graphic, because of the sharpness.

“Looking at the paper,” Mr. Schein said, “I could tell it was that cheaper, crumbly paper that you would see in old photo albums, photos of maybe my grandparents and even early photos of my father would be on that type of paper.” He dated it to the 1930s. Johnson died in 1938.

Photo

“And then if you look at the print, if you see it online, you’ll see that the edges are black,” Mr. Schein said. “It’s not masked. So you’re not seeing white edging on there — you’re seeing what looks like a negative which was laid down flat.” (A negative’s clear edge comes out black on a contact-sheet print.)

Mr. Schein also guessed that the man in the lighter suit in the photo was Johnny Shines, another blues legend who died in 1992. Mr. Schein later learned of a documentary about Johnson, “Can’t You Hear the Wind Howl?” in which Shines said that there was a photo of him and Johnson taken in 1937 by a photographer named Johnnie Mae Crowder in Hughes, Ark., and that it ran in a local newspaper. If the two were posing for a newspaper photographer, she might very well have used a Speed Graphic, which was standard equipment then.

After showing the photo to friends and musicians who, like Mr. Schein, knew intimately the details of the two authenticated photos of Johnson, many agreed that he’d discovered a third image. Trouble was, when he showed the photo to two old Delta bluesmen, David “Honeyboy” Edwards and Robert Lockwood Jr., who’d both known Johnson, neither of them recognized the man holding the guitar.

Skeptics questioned whether the photo was from the 1930s, since it looked as if the man on the right wore a zoot suit, a 1940s fashion fad featuring wide lapels and shoulders and high-waisted baggy pants. But the style was based on the “drape suit” worn by African-Americans a decade earlier; in the 1933 film “International House,” Cab Calloway’s band wore similar suits.

Some also have suggested that the photo was reversed, since the man in the light suit wore his watch on his right wrist and the man in the dark suit has a pocket square on the right side of his jacket, rather than the left. If the photo is flipped, this meant Johnson is holding the guitar as a left-handed player, not a righty. But since the guitar is stringless, it could have been a studio prop, so it wouldn’t matter how Johnson held it.

More people joined the search. Frank DiGiacomo, who wrote about Mr. Schein’s photo for Vanity Fair in 2008, showed a copy to Claude Johnson, Robert’s son, who agreed that it was his father.

A lawyer for the Johnson estate sent a copy of the photo to Lois Gibson, a forensic specialist who had identified the sailor in Alfred Eisenstaedt’s famous image of a sailor kissing a nurse in Times Square at the end of World War II. She said that the man holding the guitar in Mr. Schein’s photo appeared to be Johnson.

The Vanity Fair piece seemed only to spur attacks on the photo and criticism of Mr. Schein, with some accusing him of pushing it for financial gain, even though he’d assigned the copyright to the Johnson estate.

“We do all share a love of that music and we all play it, including writers and historians who decided to attack what I was doing and also question the integrity — my integrity — in what I was doing and that of the Johnson family,” Mr. Schein said. “They were accusing us of only being in it for money, which was never the goal for either of us. I needed to at least explain my position, why I cared so much about trying to put out a musician’s image who affected me.”

Despite years of investigations, more needs to be done. Mr. Schein has been unable to look for other photos taken by Johnnie Mae Crowder. “I stumbled on this one,“ he said. “I don’t have the skill set to go further than I did.”

But maybe you do.

“In a wild-hopes situation — wildest hopes — I hope someone reads my story and has the knowledge and experience to take my research and what I’ve been able to do a step further.”

This relationship held even when he excluded the United States, indicating that it could not be explained by some other factor particular to his home country. And it held when he controlled for homicide rates, suggesting that mass shootings were better explained by a society’s access to guns than by its baseline level of violence.

Factors That Don’t Correlate

If mental health made the difference, then data would show that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other countries with fewer mass shootings. But the mental health care spending rate in the United States, the number of mental health professionals per capita and the rate of severe mental disorders are all in line with those of other wealthy countries.

A 2015 study estimated that only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to mental health issues. And Mr. Lankford, in an email, said countries with high suicide rates tended to have low rates of mass shootings — the opposite of what you would expect if mental health problems correlated with mass shootings.

Whether a population plays more or fewer video games also appears to have no impact. Americans are no more likely to play video games than people in any other developed country.

Racial diversity or other factors associated with social cohesion also show little correlation with gun deaths. Among European countries, there is little association between immigration or other diversity metrics and the rates of gun murders or mass shootings.

A Violent Country

America’s gun homicide rate was 33 per million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership.

Americans sometimes see this as an expression of deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley.

Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process.

They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns.

More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across virtually every axis: among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities and when controlling for crime rates. And gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders, according to a recent analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries.

This suggests that the guns themselves cause the violence.

Comparisons in Other Societies

Skeptics of gun control sometimes point to a 2016 study. From 2000 and 2014, it found, the United States death rate by mass shooting was 1.5 per one million people. The rate was 1.7 in Switzerland and 3.4 in Finland, suggesting American mass shootings were not actually so common.

But the same study found that the United States had 133 mass shootings. Finland had only two, which killed 18 people, and Switzerland had one, which killed 14. In short, isolated incidents. So while mass shootings can happen anywhere, they are only a matter of routine in the United States.

As with any crime, the underlying risk is impossible to fully erase. Any individual can snap or become entranced by a violent ideology. What is different is the likelihood that this will lead to mass murder.

In China, about a dozen seemingly random attacks on schoolchildren killed 25 people between 2010 and 2012. Most used knives; none used a gun.

By contrast, in this same window, the United States experienced five of its deadliest mass shootings, which killed 78 people. Scaled by population, the American attacks were 12 times as deadly.

Beyond the Statistics

In 2013, American gun-related deaths included 21,175 suicides, 11,208 homicides and 505 deaths caused by an accidental discharge. That same year in Japan, a country with one-third America’s population, guns were involved in only 13 deaths.

This means an American is about 300 times more likely to die by gun homicide or accident than a Japanese person. America’s gun ownership rate is 150 times as high as Japan’s. That gap between 150 and 300 shows that gun ownership statistics alone do not explain what makes America different.

The United States also has some of the weakest controls over who may buy a gun and what sorts of guns may be owned.

Switzerland has the second-highest gun ownership rate of any developed country, about half that of the United States. Its gun homicide rate in 2004 was 7.7 per million people — unusually high, in keeping with the relationship between gun ownership and murders, but still a fraction of the rate in the United States.

Swiss gun laws are more stringent, setting a higher bar for securing and keeping a license, for selling guns and for the types of guns that can be owned. Such laws reflect more than just tighter restrictions. They imply a different way of thinking about guns, as something that citizens must affirmatively earn the right to own.

The Difference Is Culture

The United States is one of only three countries, along with Mexico and Guatemala, that begin with the opposite assumption: that people have an inherent right to own guns.

The main reason American regulation of gun ownership is so weak may be the fact that the trade-offs are simply given a different weight in the United States than they are anywhere else.

After Britain had a mass shooting in 1987, the country instituted strict gun control laws. So did Australia after a 1996 shooting. But the United States has repeatedly faced the same calculus and determined that relatively unregulated gun ownership is worth the cost to society.

That choice, more than any statistic or regulation, is what most sets the United States apart.

“In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate,” Dan Hodges, a British journalist, wrote in a post on Twitter two years ago, referring to the 2012 attack that killed 20 young students at an elementary school in Connecticut. “Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.”",What Explains U.S. Mass Shootings?

Part of what made it so persuasive was that the girl — now woman — spoke on the record and has repeatedly voted for Republicans, including Donald Trump.

Also persuasive: She’s not alone. Three other women — all of them also named — told The Post that when Moore was in his 30s and they were between the ages of 16 and 18, he dated or tried to date them. One claimed that he plied her with alcohol before she was old enough to drink legally. None of these three accused him of unwanted sexual contact, but their accounts support the idea that Moore was untroubled by age gaps that would trouble a better man considerably.

Are you really surprised? If so, you might want to see a doctor about your amnesia, because my memory is pretty spotty and still I can recall Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker and Larry Craig and David Vitter, and with just a few minutes of Googling, I could fill the rest of this column with more names of more pastors and politicians who presented themselves as steadfast moral conservatives and were revealed to be agents of precisely the kind of behavior they so exuberantly condemned. These frauds and hypocrites are as legion now as lepers were in the days of Jesus.

If I sound bitter, I am, because they have long been among the principal purveyors of hatred for gay people like me. They’re a big reason that so many of us grew up terrified that we’d be ostracized, wondering if there was something twisted in us and confronted with laws that treated us as second-class citizens. We were supposedly in moral error, and thus deserved a lesser lot.

Second class is actually a much higher category than the one into which Moore would corral us. In 2002 he called sexual relations between people of the same gender “an act so heinous that it defies one’s ability to describe it.” Trust me on this: It’s not so terribly difficult to describe. I’ll walk him through it over a chicken salad sandwich in the Times cafeteria. My treat.

In 2005 he said that having sex with somebody of the same gender was akin to having sex with a cow, a horse or a dog, and that not having sex with a cow, a horse, a dog or a person of the same gender was “a moral precept upon which this country was founded.” I do not recall the bestiality clause of the Constitution, but, as mentioned, my memory is spotty.

In 2016 Moore was expelled as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court because he instructed the state’s judges to defy the United States Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. This was the second time that Moore was yanked from that job; he’d previously ignored a federal court’s ruling that a Ten Commandments monument should be removed from the Alabama Judicial Building. Some patriot he is. His particular take on his chosen religion overrides the law of the land and permits him to act as he sees fit. Imagine if all Americans adopted that attitude..

And it is most decidedly a personal take, in which he picks and chooses what to be outraged by. Although Christianity as I understand it doesn’t smile on the florid lying, womanizing, hypersexual vocabulary and assorted cruelties that have been prominent threads in Donald Trump’s life, Moore and many other evangelical Christians spared Trump their censure. I understand their motivation to vote for him: abortion. But that didn’t compel them to remain so mum about his misdeeds or summon the adoration that some of them did. (I’m looking at you, Jerry Falwell Jr.)

On Thursday, Moore tweeted that “the forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal — even inflict physical harm — if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me.” So this is a war waged on him and his kind? What about the war that his breed of conservatives has been waging on the rest of us? It is arrogant and without empathy, and some of its generals use their cause as camouflage.

For Asian-American chefs, this is the conundrum, and the opportunity.","So these chefs’ cooking, born of shame, rebellion and reconciliation, is not some wistful ode to an imperfectly remembered or never-known, idealized country. It’s a mixture of nostalgia and resilience. It wasn’t taught — certainly not in the way other cuisines have been traditionally taught. Graduates of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., recalled that little time was devoted to Asian cooking; at Le Cordon Bleu in London and in Paris, none. One instructor took offense when Preeti Mistry, whose Indian-inflected restaurants include Juhu Beach Club in Oakland, Calif., likened a French stew to curry. Another told David Chang that pork stock, essential to tonkotsu ramen, was “disgusting.”

Neither does their cooking have much kinship with the “fusion” cuisine of the early 1990s, when non-Asian chefs like Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Gray Kunz began folding Eastern ingredients into otherwise Western dishes. (“Fusion” is another term that sits uneasily with Asian-American chefs. “I wouldn’t call myself ‘fusion,’ ” said Maiko Kyogoku, the owner of the idiosyncratic Bessou in New York. “To describe food that way? It’s an extension of myself.”) In spirit, Asian-American cooking is closer to other American-born cuisines with tangled roots: the Lowcountry cooking of coastal South Carolina, which owes a debt to slaves from West Africa who brought over one-pot stews and ingredients like okra, peanuts and black-eyed peas; and Tex-Mex, which is not a bastardization of Mexican food but a regional variant of it, cultivated by Tejanos, descendants of Hispanics who lived in Texas when it was part of Mexico and, before that, New Spain.

There’s also no one cultural touchstone or trauma that binds Asian immigrants: no event on a national scale that has brought us together. But part of what distinguishes our experience from that of other immigrants and people of color is the fraught, intimate relationship between our countries of origin and the U.S., which has been foe and protector, oppressor and liberator, feared and adored. In 1899, the British writer Rudyard Kipling urged the U.S. to “take up the White Man’s burden” in the Philippines after the Spanish-American War:

Go send your sons to exile

To serve your captives’ need

[...] Your new-caught, sullen peoples,

Half devil and half child.

This begot more than a century of American military intervention in East and Southeast Asia, and a history of conflicting images: Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima; the Vietcong in black pajamas and the American atrocities at My Lai; teeming refugee camps and smiling American G.I.s handing out candy, decade after decade, to throngs of dark-haired, starving children.

Any immigrant is an outsider at first. But for Asians in America, there is a starker sense of otherness. We don’t fit in to the American binary of white and black. We have been the enemy; the subjugated; the “lesser” peoples whose scramble for a foothold in society was historically seen as a menace to the American order. And yet we’ve also been the “good” immigrants, proving ourselves worthy of American beneficence — polite, humble, grateful, willing to work 20-hour days running a grocery store or a laundry or a restaurant that will never be “authentic” enough, to spend every dime on our children’s test prep so that they get into the best schools, because we believe in the promise of America, that if you work hard, you can become anyone. If you try hard enough, you might even be mistaken for white.

Among the children of immigrants, Asians in America seem most caught in a state of limbo: no longer beholden to their parents’ countries of origin but still grasping for a role in the American narrative. There is a unique foreignness that persists, despite the presence of Asians on American soil for more than two centuries; none of us, no matter how bald our American accent, has gone through life without being asked, “Where are you from? I mean, originally?” But while this can lead to alienation, it can also have a liberating effect. When you are raised in two cultures at once — when people see in you two heritages at odds, unresolved, in abeyance — you learn to shift at will between them. You may never feel like you quite belong in either, but neither are you fully constrained. The acute awareness of borders (culinary as well as cultural) that both enclose and exclude, allows, paradoxically, a claim to borderlessness, taking freely from both sides to forge something new. For Asian-American chefs, this seesaw between the obligations of inheritance and the thrill of go-it-aloneness, between respecting your ancestors and lighting out for the hills, manifests in dishes that arguably could come only from minds fluent in two ways of life.

Thus the kaiseki at Niki Nakayama’s n/naka, in Los Angeles, always includes a pasta course. Her slyly voluptuous “carbonara” of abalone livers and egg yolks is a homage to Tokyo-style wafu spaghetti with briny pickled cod roe — only here it’s capped with shaved truffles. At Tao Yuan, in Brunswick, Me., Cara Stadler takes tiles of goat cheese made by a local creamery and sears them, as is done in Yunnan, to approximate rubing, a sturdy farmer’s cheese. But instead of merely sprinkling the cheese with sugar or salt, she counters its meatiness with a bright grace note of mint and watermelon from summer’s height. A Caesar salad might be supplanted by a canoe of romaine, grilled for a hint of smoke and loaded with dainty jako (dried baby sardines) and quail eggs as anchors, as at Bessou in New York. Or, as re-envisioned by Chris Kajioka at Senia, in Honolulu, it might be a mossy cliff of charred cabbage — a wink at an iceberg wedge — dusted with shio kombu (shredded kelp boiled in soy and mirin), soaked through with dashi and ginger, and surrounded by daubs of heady green goddess dressing and buttermilk turned to gel. It’s not so much a salad as a cheeky biography of it by the barbarian at the gates, achieving the quintessence of an American classic through Asian ingredients.

And while Asian-American cooking may not be expressed in or identified by a single set of flavors, one thing that does unite such disparate traditions is an emphasis on textures. Indeed, if the cuisine can be said to have revolutionized American food, it’s by introducing unfamiliar mouth feels — crackle where one doesn’t expect it, slime in a country that’s always shied away from that sensation — into our culinary vocabulary. Justin Yu, who recently opened Theodore Rex in Houston, rhapsodizes about “the crunch that you can hear in the back of your head”; unrendered, gelatinous animal skin, “a fun burst of fat and softness”; broths barely skimmed, or with a spoonful of fat added “to coat the lips.” The maverick Katsuya Fukushima, of Daikaya in Washington, D.C., once turned natto — a gooey, slippery skein of fermented soybeans, with the perfume of castoff socks — into an earthy caramel over soft-serve. Like Latin-American food, which made Americans crave heat, Asian-American cuisine has made “difficult” textures not only desirable but as integral to food as flavor itself. That certain ingredients still make some Western diners squeamish is part of its provocative fun.

But the question remains: Does calling this kind of cooking Asian-American cuisine deepen and contextualize our understanding of it, or is it just a label, like speaking of Asian-American art or fiction — a way of simplifying a complex story and making it a marketable cliché? The danger is fetishizing Asian features, a tendency that diminishes: If you are an exotic object or phenomenon, you may never become recognized or acknowledged as more. “White chefs are using these ingredients and saying, ‘Oh, it’s so strange,’ ” Tin Vuong, of Little Sister in Los Angeles, said. “It isn’t.” Instead of a historical matrix of Asian culinary traditions, “young cooks just see a big pantry,” Fukushima said. “Take a little bit of this, a little bit of that — there’s no soul to it.”

Chang believes that food “has the potential to sort of show that we’re all the same.” But even he isn’t entirely comfortable with the ubiquity of kimchi. “Let’s say you spent no time in Asia, you just found a recipe on YouTube,” he said. “That’s appropriation. It’s not about skin color. You have to have a story, pay respect to what it was and what it means.” At the same time, it seems reductive to expect Asian-American chefs to make food that somehow reflects their personal “story.” On season three of “Top Chef,” Hung Huynh, a Vietnamese-American contestant, was faulted for cooking that was technically dazzling but lacked explicit reference to his roots. “You were born in Vietnam,” Tom Colicchio, the head judge, said. “I don’t see any of that in your food.” (It’s hard not to hear an echo of the trope of the inscrutable Oriental, whose motives can’t be deciphered, and the common criticism of Asian-Americans at school and at work as being overly cerebral and lacking feeling.) The strictures of reality TV do demand a baring of the soul, but not all Asian-American chefs want to work with Asian flavors — and when they do, it’s not always in expected ways.

Must every Italian chef make lasagna, every French chef coq au vin? Anita Lo, who closed her fine-dining restaurant Annisa in New York earlier this year, cooked there for 17 years without fealty to one region or cultural tradition. This puzzled some diners. “I had someone come in and say, ‘Where’s the big Buddha head?’ ” she said. When publications request recipes and she submits one without Asian ingredients, the response is often, “We were really hoping for something Asian” — or Asian-ish: Anything with soy, apparently, will do. “I send in Japanese, which isn’t even my background, but that works,” she said.

Corey Lee’s “Benu” cookbook is filled with stories: of his grandmother foraging for acorns; of his mother forcing him to drink a tonic of brewed deer’s antlers; of his father bringing home live lobster for his son’s birthday, and of the joys of eating tomalley (the wet gray-green paste that acts as a lobster’s liver and pancreas) on buttered bread. All suggest that Lee’s dishes, however rarefied, are also deeply autobiographical. But Lee demurs, the way a novelist might, fending off a critic’s attempt to find in his books correlations to actual events, wanting them to stand alone as fully imagined works of art. “There’s great pressure for chefs to have a story,” he said. “Maybe there’s no story beyond, ‘I want to serve this food and it tastes good.’ ”

It’s the eternal plea of the minority, to ask to be judged not by one’s appearance or the rituals of one’s forbears but for the quality of one’s mind and powers of invention. Certainly our country was predicated on the right to shed one’s past and be reborn, to come from nothing and work your way up; in this, Asians may be among the most American of Americans. But why is the choice always between exotic caricature or rootlessness? The philosopher Slavoj Zizek argues that the embrace of “ethnic” restaurants is merely “tolerance” of a “folklorist Other deprived of its substance”: “The ‘real Other’ is by definition ‘patriarchal,’ ‘violent,’ never the Other of ethereal wisdom and charming customs.” Too often Asian-American chefs are presumed to double as educators or ambassadors, representing an entire race, culture or cuisine.

In the end, doesn’t it matter — not to others, but to ourselves — where we are from? And no, I don’t mean “originally.” I mean the forces that made us: the immigrants who raised us, with all their burdens and expectations, their exhortations to fit in but never forget who we are; and the country we grew up in, that is our only home, that taught us we are “other” but also seems, in some confused, tentative way, to want to learn something from us.

For Asian-American chefs, this is the conundrum, and the opportunity. The foods of their childhoods were once mocked and rejected by their non-Asian peers (and by their ashamed or rebellious younger selves); then accepted in dilute, placating form; and now are able to command audiences who clamor for their sensations and aggressive flavors, and who might be unnerved if they knew exactly what they were putting in their mouths. What may be most radical about Asian-American cuisine is the attitude that informs and powers it, reflecting a new cockiness in a population that has historically kept quiet and encouraged to lay low. It’s food that celebrates crunchy cartilage and gelatinous ooze, that openly stinks, that declares: This is what I like to eat. What about you?

Despite its pragmatic restraint, Ford has invested hundreds of millions in self-driving cars and is making surprising progress.
Which means that Argo is an independent company, but only barely — 40 of its 230 employees are transfers from Ford, and Ford is its only corporate partner.
Ford wants Argo to look and feel like a nimble tech start-up, not a subsidiary of a century-old auto company.
“The narrative, probably even two years ago, would have been ‘tech companies win, autos lose,’ ” he said.","On a sunny afternoon in early October, I drove across a parking lot in Ann Arbor, Mich., and down a sloping road to a second, private lot. A fence lining the lot’s perimeter was covered in black fabric, as if to deter snoops. Behind it was a 32-acre Potemkin village. There were paved roads with names and signs: Liberty Street, Main Street, Wolverine Avenue. There was a traffic roundabout, a covered underpass and a railroad crossing. There were cosmetic props, too — newspaper boxes, sidewalk benches, a row of fake storefronts.

Mcity, as the facility is known, was built by the University of Michigan as a testing ground for automakers, including Ford, which has been experimenting with self-driving cars here for about two years. I parked my rental and climbed into the back of a white Ford Fusion with four spinning Lidar sensors on the roof, each roughly the size of a water glass, and a rack of high-performance computers in the trunk. Next to me sat Randy Visintainer, Ford’s director of autonomous vehicle development. Jakob Hoellerbauer, a young Ford engineer, took the driver’s seat. Wayne Williams, a Ford research scientist, sat beside him in the passenger seat typing on a laptop. We put on our seatbelts, and Hoellerbauer hit the ignition and pulled into the road. A beep came from the dashboard, indicating that the car was ready to engage self-driving mode. Hoellerbauer pushed a button on the steering wheel and took his hands away.

“We are now autonomous,” Williams announced.

The car glided along Main Street to a four-way stop, waited for another car (driven by a researcher) to clear the intersection, then made a gentle right turn. Autonomous cars are programmed to drive conservatively, and any time our Fusion sensed an approaching object — like a Ford employee, role-playing an oblivious pedestrian — it slowed down until it was sure the path was clear, then proceeded cautiously. It felt like being chauffeured by an elderly ghost.

Two minutes into the drive, the car pulled around a traffic circle and up to a blinking red light at an empty intersection. It stopped. A few seconds passed. Perhaps, I thought, it was just being characteristically risk-averse. Then a few more seconds passed, and the engineers started to look nervous. Williams squinted at his laptop.

“So right now, we’re not sure if the intersection is clear, so we’re being very cautious,” Williams said, speaking for the car. “It’s expecting ...” He trailed off and turned to Hoellerbauer. “Why don’t you just overtake it?” Hoellerbauer grabbed the wheel and tapped the gas pedal, overriding the self-driving system and manually steering us through the intersection.

“We didn’t see that happen this morning,” Williams explained, by way of an apology. We took another lap around Mcity, and when we reached the intersection again, the car did the exact same thing.

Self-driving cars raise the specter of horrific malfunctions — a code glitch that sends a car careering off a cliff, a remote hack that disables the brakes — but perfectly innocuous problems like the one we experienced will be far more common, and no less an impediment to road-readiness. There are dozens of autonomous vehicles being tested all over the world — 43 companies are testing 295 different self-driving vehicles in California alone — and not one of them has a clean record. A self-driving Uber vehicle zoomed through a red light in San Francisco last year. The sensors on cars used by Waymo, the self-driving-car division of Alphabet, Google’s corporate parent, have struggled in heavy rain and snow. I’ve had half a dozen self-driving-car experiences in my life, including a white-knuckle trip down Manhattan’s West Side Highway in a Tesla Model X whose owner had set it to “autopilot” mode, and I wouldn’t describe any of them as relaxing.

How quickly these rides will improve depends on whom you ask. Silicon Valley futurists, in typically sanguine fashion, predict that we are months, not years, away from a Cambrian explosion of autonomous cars. Waymo has a pilot program for its self-driving vehicles already underway in Arizona and says it’s “really close” to being fully operational. Lyft, which has partnered with a start-up called Drive.ai, is aiming to have a fleet of self-driving cars operating in the Bay Area by the end of the year. And Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, which has offered semiautonomous features since 2015, has suggested that its cars could be fully autonomous as soon as 2019.

But that’s California, where optimism is the coin of the realm. In Detroit, the timeline looks slower and more incremental. Ford, in particular, believes that the first generation of driverless cars will be limited, capable of traveling only in commercial fleets inside carefully plotted urban areas. Other cars will simply get smarter without being autonomous, with features like collision prevention and self-parking becoming more common. Self-driving technology will eventually be more sophisticated and will one day be capable of full door-to-door autonomy in every possible area and condition, but as Ford sees it, that’s not going to happen overnight, or even very soon.

Despite its pragmatic restraint, Ford has invested hundreds of millions in self-driving cars and is making surprising progress. In a report earlier this year, Navigant Research placed Ford at the top of its leader board, ahead of tech companies like Waymo and Uber as well as auto rivals like GM and Toyota, based on Ford’s advanced manufacturing capabilities coupled with its strides in software development. The report generated headlines like, “Detroit Is Kicking Silicon Valley’s Ass in the Race to Build Self-Driving Cars,” and delivered a morale boost to Ford, which showed up late but finally felt as if it had a chance.

Ford’s big, blinking target is 2021 — the year it hopes to release a vehicle that meets the Society of Automotive Engineers International’s definition of Level 4 autonomy (no human operator required in the area and conditions it’s programmed for). It’s a tough deadline for a company whose culture might be the exact opposite of Silicon Valley’s, where companies release half-finished “minimum viable products” and abide by maxims like “move fast and break things.” Before Ford — or any conventional automaker — produces anything, each part has to pass a grueling battery of tests and certifications. There is a reason “automotive grade” has become a synonym for “reliable.” “Our vehicles have to be a trusted product,” Chris Brewer, Ford’s chief engineer for autonomous vehicles, told me. “That is a little more important than ‘Did my phone freeze or not?’ ”

Americans are wary of driverless cars — 56 percent, according to the Pew Research Center, would prefer not to ride in one — and when I talked to Brewer, it occurred to me that some part of that hesitation might stem from who we assume will be producing them: Silicon Valley tech giants, the same stateless behemoths that have spent the last few decades barging into old-line industries like the Kool-Aid Man, destroying working-class jobs and leaving behind cold, modern efficiency. But maybe these skeptics could be persuaded to trust Detroit. After all, Brewer is right — self-driving cars aren’t smartphones. They’re two-ton projectiles that take your parents to the grocery store and your kids to soccer practice, that will need to make billions of computational decisions per second while moving at 65 miles per hour, that contain within them the power to extinguish human life. You kind of want them to take a while.

Leading Ford into this weird new era is Jim Hackett, who was named chief executive in May. Hackett, 62, is an oddity by Detroit standards. A design-minded aesthete in an industry dominated by gearheads and number crunchers, he spent two decades running Steelcase, a Michigan-based office-furniture company whose designers are often credited with — or blamed for — popularizing the open-plan office trend.

At a conference several years ago, Hackett struck up a conversation with Ford’s executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., who goes by Bill. He is the great-grandson of Henry Ford, and another auto-world misfit — an outspoken environmentalist who once ruffled feathers at Ford by speaking at a Greenpeace event. The two bonded over their shared vision of “smart mobility,” a fuzzy term, more common among urbanists than businesspeople, for creating a sort of harmony among land use, technology and transportation of all forms. Hackett joined Ford’s board of directors in 2013. In 2016, Bill Ford persuaded Hackett to lead Ford’s newly created smart-mobility unit, and about a year later, he tapped him to run the entire company.

Hackett’s jockish C.V. — he played football at Michigan and briefly ran the school’s athletic department — masks his high-minded streak, which can make talking to him feel like taking a college philosophy seminar after a few bong rips. In the early 2000s, he began traveling to the Santa Fe Institute, a research group started by prominent scientists who wanted to study “complex adaptive systems” — a branch of theoretical physics that imagines the world as a series of complicated networks that are governed by universal laws and patterns, the same way biology is guided by Darwinian evolution. The rules that explained how anthills formed, they believed, might also explain urbanization trends in Southeast Asia or predict economic cycles. It was a formative experience for Hackett, who began to believe that businesses were governed by universal laws, too.

Hackett also became obsessed with “design thinking,” a new-agey management philosophy that has become trendy in recent years. Adherents believe that instead of optimizing for profit, organizations should put human emotion at the center of every strategy decision and begin by empathizing with their customers. “No technology ever evolves without the human interpreting and altering it,” Hackett says. “Every new technology, the science and the engineering of it, has to give way to human understanding and use.”

Hackett is only six months into the chief-executive job, but his mannerisms have already entered Ford’s bloodstream. I arrived in Dearborn expecting to talk about drivetrains and crankshafts, but in a series of interviews with nearly a dozen executives, barely anyone mentioned cars or trucks at all. Instead, I heard the Ford Motor Company described as a “mobility solutions provider” that engages in “multimodal journey planning.” People spoke about “whiteboarding” and “blue-skying” big ideas. I watched a video that described Ford’s efforts to build a “holistic, organic, interconnected system powered by a transportation operating system.”

It is bizarre to watch an all-American manufacturing company get brain-snatched like this. Even the company’s new internal mission statement bears Hackett’s woolly imprint: “To become the world’s most trusted mobility company by designing smart vehicles for a smart world.” It’s not exactly “Built Ford Tough.” But it’s very much in keeping with Hackett’s worldview, in which everything exists in connection with everything else, and changing one piece of a system necessarily changes the whole. A car learns to drive itself, and a city’s transportation grid shifts around it.

This kind of big-picture futurism is necessary in Detroit today, where automakers are frantically reinventing themselves to stay ahead of what they fear might be coming. The average personal vehicle is driven less than an hour per day. But self-driving cars can, in theory, pick up and drop off passengers all day, which significantly reduces the number of cars a community needs. (Researchers at the University of Michigan estimate that autonomous vehicles could cause car ownership to drop by as much as 43 percent. Lyft, which has a horse in the race, cites research estimating that as many as 80 percent of cars could eventually be eliminated.) And because much of the value of self-driving cars lies in the software that runs them, companies that make only hardware — known in the business as “original equipment manufacturers,” or O.E.M.s — are likely to be squeezed, or worse.

Faced with visions of a bleak future as low-margin widget-builders for Silicon Valley, automakers have spent the past several years trying to catch up. General Motors spent $581 million to buy Cruise Automation, a self-driving-technology start-up. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles struck a deal with Waymo, in addition to partnering with BMW and Intel. Daimler and Volvo each joined with Uber, and Toyota set up a whole research institute in Silicon Valley to build its own self-driving vehicles.

Ford’s plans might be the most ambitious. It wants to have a hand in every part of the self-driving-car industry, including the software that replaces the human driver, the platform that connects and controls the cars and the services that spring up around them. To that end, Ford has spent the past several years quietly snapping up tech talent. It struck a partnership with Lyft and acquired Chariot, a San Francisco-based start-up that runs group shuttles for commuters. It set up an office in Palo Alto that now has 205 employees and created Greenfield Labs, a business incubator. It invested in Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based artificial-intelligence start-up, and several other companies, including Velodyne, which makes Lidar sensors, and a connected-car software outfit called Autonomic.

Most industry observers believe these are the right moves for Ford to be making. But it’s still tough to reconcile today’s Ford — which makes money by selling millions of combustion-engine trucks and S.U.V.s every year, along with a handful of sedans and hybrids — with the eco-tech-mobility conglomerate Hackett envisions it becoming. One lesson Hackett learned from his studies is that in order to stay competitive, businesses often have to give up the things that made them great in the first place. (He calls this the “perversity law.”) I asked him if this meant that Ford would need to stop manufacturing conventional, gas-powered vehicles to survive.

“Well, part of that statement might be right,” he said. “Right now, that doesn’t make sense.” He clarified, sort of: “I’m really just trying to say the better form of problem solving is to abstract the problems.”

So let’s try abstracting Ford’s problems, to see how they might be solved. First: Ford was born at the beginning of a now-outmoded era of industrial production, one that it arguably ushered in. Back then, companies like Ford simply manufactured goods, and customers bought them. Those transactions represented a change of ownership — a customer who bought a car from Ford was free to install 15-inch subwoofers in it, or paint it bright yellow, or use it in a demolition derby — and they were typically one-time sales. Ford’s responsibility for the car, and its opportunity to make a profit, ended the minute the warranty ran out.

The internet changed that, by allowing companies to wrap physical goods in digital services that can be sold again and again, at much higher margins. Instead of selling servers to corporate I.T. departments, Amazon sells them time shares on a centralized server farm; instead of buying pricey home solar panels, customers can lease them from a solar service, paying for only the power they use. Makers of thermostats, baby monitors and other household gadgets “extend the value chain” by charging customers a monthly fee for information about their home energy use or their babies’ sleep patterns. Even the language these new enterprises use is different. Goods-based businesses spoke in terms of revenues and profits. Service-based businesses count metrics like “churn,” “average revenue per user” and “lifetime value” — the total amount of money they can wring from a customer.

This phenomenon — which is sometimes referred to as “everything as a service,” abbreviated as XaaS and pronounced “zass,” among the kinds of people who say these things out loud — has quietly reshaped the entire economy. Trucking companies that once bought Michelin tires now rent them through a pay-per-mile service. Airlines that buy $15 million jet engines from General Electric can subscribe to OnPoint, a “power by the hour” program that includes maintenance costs and data-analysis tools. G.E. Aviation now makes the better part of its revenue from services like these.

The auto industry was slow to come to grips with this new model — in part because it long ago gave away the entire service piece of its business to gas stations, body shops, Jiffy Lubes and a hundred other barnacle industries. Thanks to old and byzantine state laws, most carmakers aren’t even allowed to sell or lease directly to their customers — every transaction has to go through an independent dealer. When it comes to data, automakers are flying blind. As Reilly P. Brennan, a venture capitalist who invests in self-driving technology, put it to me: “The urinal in the men’s bathroom knows more about its users than most carmakers in 2017.”

With self-driving cars, automakers see a chance to fix that. Ford’s executives talk hopefully about one day offering their own suite of software inside their autonomous vehicles, and building interfaces that companies like Netflix and Skype could plug into. They don’t see themselves usurping Silicon Valley, exactly, but they do see themselves playing in the same league. “Two to three years ago, the tech community was holding the auto industry at arm’s length,” said Ken Washington, Ford’s chief technology officer. “They thought we were sort of this curious industry that they could come into and disrupt.” He went on: “Now, when I go to Silicon Valley and I interact with tech companies, it’s a dynamic of much more intense interest in collaborating with us.”

Collaboration takes many forms, of course, and not all tech companies seem interested in an equal partnership. John Krafcik, the chief executive of Waymo, told me that while traditional auto companies “bring a lot to the party” in terms of hardware expertise, they’re not well equipped to solve the software-based problem of replacing a human driver, which requires huge teams of highly skilled engineers and tremendous amounts of technological infrastructure — the kinds of tools available to only a Google sibling company. “The self-driving aspect is really supercomplicated,” Krafcik said. “We’ve spent the last nine years trying to solve that puzzle. It requires a lot of skills.” It also requires focus, which is a problem for companies that still sell millions of conventional cars and trucks a year, that have thousands of employees to pay and quarterly results to deliver, that can’t exactly drop everything and become software companies.

In Detroit, cautious optimism prevails. But outside Detroit, there are real doubts that any auto company can transform itself quickly enough. “Autonomous vehicles are not an incremental shift,” said Carol Reiley, a founder of Drive.ai. “It’s a very transformative shift, almost like moving from the horse and carriage to the car.” Like many tech executives, Reiley saw Detroit’s quest to control the self-driving-car industry as tactically sound but ultimately a long shot. “I don’t know if they can make it,” she said. “There’s a lot of baggage.”

A week after my Detroit trip, I visited the Pittsburgh offices of Argo AI, the artificial-intelligence start-up that is creating the software brains for Ford’s self-driving vehicles. Ford is investing $1 billion for a majority stake and controls two of Argo’s five board seats. Which means that Argo is an independent company, but only barely — 40 of its 230 employees are transfers from Ford, and Ford is its only corporate partner.

Argo’s headquarters is in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, a formerly industrial area just outside downtown that has become a center of driverless-car activity. (Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group is down the street.) Its office is a high-ceilinged space in a modern office building with conference rooms named for famous scientists: Planck, Descartes, Hopper. When I arrived, engineers were eating catered lunch at their standing desks. Squint and ignore the smokestacks outside, and you could be in San Francisco — which is sort of the point. Ford wants Argo to look and feel like a nimble tech start-up, not a subsidiary of a century-old auto company.

I was greeted by Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander, Argo AI’s founders, both well-known figures in the small self-driving-car world. They had been special-faculty members at Carnegie Mellon’s prestigious robotics-engineering program, and Salesky competed in the 2007 Darpa Urban Challenge, a storied self-driving-vehicle race whose alumni now populate the top ranks of the autonomous-vehicle industry. Salesky went to Google to build self-driving cars; Rander went to Uber. They quit their jobs and started Argo AI in November of last year, and in February, with no real product to speak of, and hardly any employees, they announced that they had raised huge sums of money from Ford.

The day before my visit, Salesky made waves with a bombastic post on the company’s blog, in which he accused the autonomous-vehicle industry of overselling its progress. “Those who think fully self-driving vehicles will be ubiquitous on city streets months from now or even in a few years,” he wrote, “are not well connected to the state of the art or committed to the safe deployment of the technology.” It was a rare role reversal — the software engineer throwing up caution flags — and, perhaps, evidence that Ford is trying to stall for time. Officially, Argo is still aiming for Ford’s 2021 target, but Salesky waffled on the firmness of that deadline, saying there’s a chance a true Level 4 autonomous vehicle could be finished later, or possibly sooner. “It’s ready when it’s ready,” he told me.

Salesky freely admitted that he is playing catch-up. Ford won’t share statistics about its self-driving test cars, but public records from California give some sense of what it’s up against. Last year, Ford, which does most of its testing in Michigan and Arizona, logged just 590 autonomous miles in the state, while Waymo’s vehicles logged 635,867 miles. Argo is also building its code from scratch and doesn’t have access to the digital infrastructure that competitors like Waymo and Uber do. “We’re not out there trying to tell everyone we’re going to be first or beat X, Y or Z company,” Salesky said. “The goal is to get to market with something that can scale up.”

But, he reiterated, this is a hard problem. Driving is a miracle of neurobiological coordination that involves the flawless simultaneous execution of a billion tiny and subtle reflexes, and it turns out that’s a more complicated task for a computer than teaching it to play chess or compete on game shows. A self-driving car has to correctly identify and label millions of objects, understand city layouts and traffic laws and operate in a variety of road conditions. It has to be taught to handle everyday driving hazards (high-speed merges) and rarer incidents (objects in the road), as well as issues that would never affect a human driver (a chunk of debris that flies up and knocks out a sensor).

In order to work properly, a self-driving car also has to understand how humans behave. It needs to know the difference between a car that is idling in the right-hand lane (in which case the autonomous vehicle should steer around it) and one that is about to parallel park (in which case the vehicle should stay in its lane, giving the other car some room). It needs to predict that the jogger running toward the corner will stop for traffic, but that the kid running to chase a basketball might not. It needs to be able to navigate a four-way stop, which in polite parts of the country involves lots of eye contact and you-first hand gestures. “This goes beyond just seeing and understanding the world,” Salesky said. “It means understanding what each of the actors in the world is going to do.”

In other words, driving isn’t just a mechanical task — it’s a social act, and in order to coexist with human drivers, self-driving cars will need to develop a level of social awareness that approaches that of a full-fledged A.I. This is why some computer scientists think Waymo is going to be unbeatable. As an Alphabet company, Waymo has access to some of the best engineering talent in A.I., along with Google’s enormous data troves and the machine-learning systems that have been trained using that data. In other words, the vast data-harvesting powers that make Google’s consumer products so creepy could also make Waymo’s vehicles better at navigating the physical world.

But all this obsessive focus on tech elides a much more foundational question about our relationship to cars. Tech companies tend to view driving as a functional problem — get safely from Point A to Point B as quickly as possible — in which the vehicle itself is largely an extraneous variable. A car might begin its life as a Toyota or a Hyundai, but once it’s autonomous and on a ride-sharing network, it’s just an Uber. Silicon Valley believes that software, not hardware, is what matters to riders, and this will be especially true of self-driving cars — which, at least in early days, will most likely be shared among strangers.

But Detroit has spent decades and billions of advertising dollars persuading us that its mass-produced cars are anything but homogeneous metal boxes — that they carry profound talismanic qualities that transfer to their owners. You can be an F-150 woman or a Mustang man, and those choices signal tribal affiliations that extend far past the act of driving. Ford’s challenge, then, is keeping these storied brands alive for the consumers who still obsess over them, while Argo builds the software that will satisfy the car-agnostic city dwellers. It’s a tricky balancing act, made even more complicated by the politics of a 114-year-old Detroit manufacturing company lashing its fate to a one-year-old Pittsburgh tech start-up, and vice versa. “They’ve put a lot of trust in us,” Salesky said. “We’ve also put a lot of trust in them.”

The hall connecting the C-suites at Ford’s headquarters was a mess when I visited in October: exposed wiring, plastic sheeting hanging from the walls. As I made my way to Bill Ford’s office, my P.R. escorts offered an explanation. Parts of the floor were being reimagined as an open-plan creative space, and the chaos had spilled outward. When we reached the end of the hall, Ford welcomed me into his office, a midcentury wooden cavern with a fish tank built into one wall and a panoramic view of Dearborn along the other. The dreary vista stood in stark relief with the golden-era artifacts in Ford’s office: the replica of a 1956-57 Continental Mark II that was designed by his father, William Clay Ford Sr.; a desk that belonged to his grandfather, Edsel Ford.

Bill Ford has been working in the family business for 38 years and spent most of that time as an iconoclast. His interest in “smart mobility” — which amounts to an interest in reducing the number of cars on the road — was until recently considered heretical. But the past few years have vindicated his predictions. He thinks that the coming convergence of tech and transportation could turn Detroit and Silicon Valley into permanent collaborators. He started Fontinalis Partners, a venture-capital fund outside Ford, to invest in mobility start-ups, and flies regularly to San Francisco to meet with entrepreneurs working on transportation-related projects.

“The narrative, probably even two years ago, would have been ‘tech companies win, autos lose,’ ” he said. “What’s happened, though, is there’s been a realization that we have a lot more intellectual property than the world realized,” by which he means celebrated lines like the F-150, along with some proprietary under-the-hood technology that I won’t pretend to understand. “Second, we really know how to integrate a lot of what the tech companies have into our vehicles, and we know how to make vehicles as well.”

I was struck by how frequently this simple point is deployed at Ford: We know how to make stuff, and making stuff isn’t easy. At first, I dismissed it as a naïve attempt to steer a conversation about Detroit’s shortcomings back toward its strengths. Apple taught suppliers halfway across the world how to make iPhones with micron-level precision — how hard could it be to slap some metal together and put it on wheels?

But making cars isn’t like making other things. It’s a dizzying logistical ballet that involves heavy machinery, grueling labor and countless opportunities for error. It’s wrangling union contracts while keeping the line moving. It’s paying people enough to ensure that they won’t miss a loose bolt and kill someone. It’s designing objects that not only work well but also fill a psychological need for buyers. In the end, maybe the self-driving-car race will be decided not purely on technological achievement, but also on these much more prosaic questions — who can make good things and persuade people to use them? After all, the Model T wasn’t the first car invented, or the best at the time. But it was accessible and functional and spoke to people’s needs in a simple way during a time of confusing technological change. That conversation is about to begin again.",Can Ford Turn Itself Into a Tech Company?,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/09/magazine/tech-design-autonomous-future-cars-detroit-ford.html

Sheet pans

These are Thanksgiving Day workhorses. Line quarter-size trays with paper towels and use them to dry freshly washed herbs. (Once the herbs dry, place the herbs stem-first in a glass of water and cover the top with a plastic bag. You can store these covered herbs in the fridge until you are ready to use them.)

Heat the half-size pan in the oven before you bake your pie, and the hot pan will help cook the bottom of the crust. Pair a cooling rack with a sheet pan, and you can dry out bread cubes in the oven for stuffing. The rack allows better air circulation underneath the bread, and the pan will catch the crumbs.

Wirecutter named this baker’s sheet from Nordic Ware as the best pick for most people.

A serrated knife

It’s not just for bread! Slice delicate fruits and vegetables, cut root vegetables, carve meat and more. (But do not use this knife, or any serrated knife, for raw meat. Use a chef’s knife instead.)

The oppressively hot afternoons in the Delta and the cool, quiet country nights of the rural woodlands inspired many of the greatest American storytellers, including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and Shelby Foote, and the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Son House.

This year, to honor the bicentennial of Mississippi’s statehood, residents throughout the state are following that tradition, telling the stories of their own communities with photographs employing the 21st-century technology of smartphones. The project, “Celebrating Storytellers,” was created by Chandler Griffin and Alison Fast, partners in Blue Magnolia Films and Barefoot Workshops, and will culminate next month with an exhibit of 200 five-foot-wide images in storefront windows in Jackson, Miss. Similar exhibits have already been held in five other cities.

“We didn’t want to just have big parties for the bicentennial with nothing that’s lasting afterwards,” Mr. Griffin said. “We really wanted to engage with communities. We wanted to go from town to town, and create spaces where people could have conversation about their community and what revitalization means.”

He and Ms. Fast went to a dozen towns and cities in Mississippi asking community leaders to help identify people who understood the fabric of their communities and invited them to a free, weeklong workshop and to begin documenting where they live with iPhones. The stories were chosen by the participants, who received guidance from the workshop team that included Aaron Phillips, a photographer who started out as a student at the Barefoot Workshops, and Natalie Irby, the executive producer.

There will be 100 participants in all ranging in age from 14 to 91.

In Mound Bayou, a small economically-depressed Delta city that was founded by former slaves in 1887, Myrna Smith-Thompson documented the rundown home of Isaiah Montgomery, a former slave of Jefferson Davis, who helped found the community. Ms. Smith-Thompson, who was born and raised in Mound Bayou, leads the Knights of Tabor, a benevolent community organization that is restoring local historic sites. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather led the organization before her.

“It’s not just a house,” she wrote for the project. “It’s the home of a man who in 1887 had a dream of turning a swampy piece of land filled with wild animals and mosquitoes and unimaginable obstacles into a negro self-governing community in Mississippi, for the people. He had the audacity to ask newly freed slaves to clear this land and make a nice place to live with all the amenities afforded to others. He had the nerve to attempt to influence free slaves to become self sufficient to create a safe haven for blacks amidst a climate of fear and hostility.”

At the start of the project last year, the emphasis was on Mississippi’s revitalization, not “race and reconciliation,” Mr. Griffin said. But the subject came up in every single workshop they held. In Clarksdale, an group of high school students from the mostly-black public school and an almost all-white private school made race the focus of their projects. Before meeting at the workshop they had rarely mixed, but they got together afterward for dinners and attended each other’s graduations. These experiences, Mr. Griffin said, “lead to change in communities.”

Mr. Griffin is a fifth-generation Mississippian, and attended Jackson Prep, a private institution that was started as a segregated school in 1970 in response to the federally mandated integration of the public schools. When he graduated in year 1994 he felt like he “had blinders on and was not exposed to anything.”

He attended art school in Savannah, Ga. and taught photography at the Maine Workshop in Rockport, M.E. before moving to New York City to “make his mark.” He rarely told anyone he was from Mississippi.

After a while, he realized that he didn’t really know Mississippi outside of where he grew up, so he returned to start Barefoot Workshops in Clarksdale and to learn more about his home.

“I fell in love with Mississippi in 2005 when I ran that first workshop, and ever since then I’ve just been trying to figure out ways to help tell the story and talk about the awesome things in Mississippi, as well as the problems, and look at the people working on solutions.”

Looking back at the experience, Ms. Smith-Thompson said the project taught her “to see things differently and how to tell stories with pictures” and made her “feel like a younger person.” For Christmas, she is buying a new iPhone to continue documenting her community.

“Storytelling helps us to share our different perspectives of our community with someone else, in a non-threatening way,” she explained. “The harsher the situation, the more impactful storytelling may be.”

He worked two full-time jobs until the end. Each morning at 7, he would arrive at Bronx Criminal Court, where he worked for almost two decades. He finished there at 5 p.m. and would drive straight to his second job with Delta Air Lines at La Guardia Airport, where he worked through the evening, returning home at 1 a.m. He would sleep four hours, then start again.

Ms. Rivera said her brother’s work ethic came from a desire to provide for his son, Andrew. Although Mr. Rivera never finished college, she said, he was determined to give his son more opportunities, including putting him through college.

“He gave his son everything,” Ms. Rivera recalled. “He had such a big heart.”

But Mr. Rivera had not told his family that he had an enlarged heart. And his on-the-go lifestyle, like eating fast food between shifts, complicated the problem.

Right after his death, Ms. Rivera was too distraught to focus on her own health and tried to ignore the tightness in her chest. At the urging of a friend, she sought medical attention and learned she had had a minor heart attack.

She stayed at the hospital about a week, leaving in time for her brother’s funeral. But she would soon return: She was hospitalized three more times over the spring.

During a sonogram, doctors found fluid behind her heart and performed a pericardiocentesis, a painful procedure that drains the fluid and relieves the pressure. When she woke up, she screamed for her brother. “That was the first thing I remembered, was my brother,” she said.

Doctors put Ms. Rivera on bed rest, and she was not permitted to work for nine weeks. For Ms. Rivera, who has spent almost 30 years as a dental assistant at a Manhattan practice, being away from work was difficult.

And she couldn’t afford not to work. Her financial situation had become tenuous after her partner of eight years died in 2015. Unable to manage the rent on her own, she moved out of the home they had shared; she lived with her brother for a while before finding a new apartment nearby.

Being out of work only made matters worse. She quickly fell further behind on bills and faced eviction. She contacted Mosholu Montefiore Community Center, a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. In April, the agency used $3,925 from the fund to cover $900 for one month’s rent and help pay off her rent arrears.

“God knows where I would be if it wasn’t for them,” she said, shaking her head. “If it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t be here in this apartment right now.”

Ms. Rivera returned to work on June 23. Her boss threw a pizza party but got a grilled chicken salad for her, now that she is being more careful about her diet.

She has cut down on sugar and frozen foods, studies nutrition labels in the supermarket and often juices fresh produce. Her dietary choices have helped her get off four of the five medications doctors prescribed after her heart attack.

What’s in place now:

If you’re single, the current standard deduction is $6,350. Add in exemptions and you’re up to $10,400.

Married without children? That’s $12,700 for the deduction and $20,700 with exemptions.

If you’re married with two kids, the deduction-plus-exemptions figure goes up to $28,700. There is also a $1,000 tax credit per child.

What the House proposed:

The House bill calls for simplification: If you’re single with no children, your standard deduction would be $12,000. If you’re married, it would be $24,000 no matter how many kids you have. The child tax credit, however, would rise to $1,600 per child. There is also an additional $300 credit for each parent and nonchild dependent, though that would expire after 2022.

What the Senate proposed:

The same $12,000/$24,000 standard deductions as the House. Single parents would see their deductions go to $18,000 from $9,300. The child tax credit would rise to $1,650.

State and Local Tax Deductions, and Mortgage Interest

What’s in place now:

You can generally deduct the amount you pay for state and local tax income taxes, including property taxes, on your federal income tax return. You can also deduct the interest you pay each year on mortgage debt up to $1 million, a cap that can cover multiple homes. Plus, you can generally deduct up to $100,000 in interest you pay on a home-equity loan or line of credit.

What the House proposed:

No more state and local tax deductions, though you could continue to deduct up to $10,000 each year in property tax. For people buying in the future (which the bill defines as Nov. 2, 2017, or later), mortgage interest deductions would be allowed only on loans up to $500,000. Moreover, only debt from primary residences would count toward that limit, and you could not include any interest from home equity loans or lines of credit that you took out on that new home.

What the Senate proposed:

No more state and local tax deductions and no exception for property taxes, either. The mortgage interest deduction, however, would survive in its current form.

Medical Expenses

What’s in place now:

For the moment, you can deduct out-of-pocket medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of your adjusted gross income (but not the expenses that amount to the first 10 percent). This is particularly useful for elderly people and others with lower incomes who need regular assistance and care.

What the House proposed:

The House wants to do away with the deduction in 2018.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate would keep the deduction.

Student Loan Interest

What’s in place now:

Currently, people with incomes below certain thresholds can deduct up to $2,500 of student loan interest each year.

What the House proposed:

The House wants to do away with the student loan interest deduction.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate would keep things as they are now.

Estate Taxes

What’s in place now:

In general, you pay taxes on inherited property at a 40 percent rate, but current rules waive that tax for estates up to $5,490,000.

What the House proposed:

The House seeks to nearly double that exemption and repeal it altogether after 2024 — a year later than the House first proposed.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate wishes to double the exemption but has not proposed any full repeal.

Pass-Through Businesses

What’s in place now:

People who own small businesses of various sorts generally pay income taxes based on the normal rate for individual taxes. Often, they are involved in or run partnerships, sole proprietorships, limited liability companies and S corporations.

What the House proposed:

The House bill would create a new 25 percent tax rate for what it refers to as “pass-through” businesses, for a portion of the business net income that passes through to the owners. The proposed rules around this are complicated; see Section 1004 of the House bill summary for more information.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate’s offering would not leave quite as much money in taxpayers’ pockets as the House bill would, as it gives taxpayers the opportunity to deduct 17.4 percent of domestic qualified business income from a partnership, S corporation or sole proprietorship. See page 17 of the Senate bill summary for more detail.

Adoption Credits

What’s in place now:

In 2017, when an employer pays for up to $13,570 in qualified adoption expenses for an employee, the employee pays no taxes on that assistance. There’s also a separate adoption credit, which generally provides taxpayers with a credit of up to $13,570 per eligible child. Under the current rules, the credit phases out for taxpayers with adjusted gross income between $203,540 and $243,540.

What the House proposed:

The bill had proposed getting rid of the adoption credit altogether, but on Thursday afternoon, the Republican leadership changed its mind and left it intact.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate would also leave it intact.

Selling Your Home

What’s in place now:

Currently, a married couple filing their taxes jointly can exclude up to $500,000 in capital gains on the sale of a home, as long as they’ve used it as a primary residence for two of the past five years.

What the House proposed:

Taxpayers would need to have lived in the home for five out of the previous eight years — and the tax break could be used only once every five years, down from once every two years. The tax break would begin to phase out for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income exceeded $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers).

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate proposes an identical formula as it relates to years in residence and frequency of use. But it allows people who fail to meet the five-year requirement because of a change in employment, health trouble or “unforeseen circumstances” to exclude a fraction of the $250,000 or $500,000 equal to the fraction of the five-year period that they were in residence.

Coverdells and 529 Plans

What’s in place now:

Your money grows tax-free (you can put in $2,000 per year with certain income limits), and then you can withdraw it tax-free to pay for private school from kindergarten through 12th grade (in addition to college). Potential changes to this maneuver were last considered in 2012.

What the House proposed:

The House wants to neuter Coverdells but let people pull up to $10,000 out of 529 plans tax-free to use for private school. (You could still use that same 529 plan to save for college the same way you always have.) Wealthy families can gain a potential tax break of up to $30,000 or so.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate did not propose any changes.

Losses for Fires and Floods

What’s in place now:

If you’re a victim of a house fire, flood, burglary or similar event, you can deduct those losses.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

What the House proposed:

The House did away with these so-called “casualty” deductions. That means you would be out of luck, unless legislators passed a one-time bill offering relief for victims of particular weather or other events that affected a lot of people.

What the Senate proposed:

Starting in 2018, you could only claim a deduction if the loss happened during an event that the president later officially declared to be a disaster.

Alimony

What’s in place now:

Alimony is a deductible expense for people paying it, and those who receive it must pay income taxes.

What the House proposed:

Divorce would become a bit more burdensome for the ex-spouse who pays alimony because it would no longer be a deductible expense. But the party receiving the payments would no longer need to pay tax on the income received. The change would take effect for divorce and separation agreements (and any changes to current agreements) executed after 2017.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate bill would make no changes to alimony rules.

Moving Expenses

What’s in place now:

As it stands, taxpayers can deduct moving expenses — even if they do not itemize their tax returns — as long as the new workplace is at least 50 miles farther from the old home than the old job location was from the old home. (If you had no workplace, the new job must be at least 50 miles from your old home.)

What the House proposed:

Relocating for a new job? Moving costs would no longer be a deductible expense in 2018.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate’s bill is similar to the House’s, though it allows some exceptions for members of the military.

Tax Preparation

What’s in place now:

You can usually deduct the amount your tax preparation specialist billed you or any similar tax-related expenses, like software you purchase and the fee you pay to file your forms electronically.

What the House proposed:

Taxpayers would no longer be able to take this deduction. Since the bill aims to reduce the number of taxpayers who itemize (and all the complexity that goes with that), in theory fewer people should require professional tax help (with the exception of wealthier people, who can afford to lose this break).

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate’s proposal is similar to that of the House.

Electric Cars

What’s in place now:

Buyers of qualifying plug-in electric vehicles, like the Chevrolet Bolt or Volt and Tesla’s cars, can sometimes get a tax credit for up to $7,500.

What the House proposed:

The House would do away with the credit.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate proposed no change.

Riding a Bicycle to Work

What’s in place now:

You can exclude up to $20 each month from your income for expenses related to regular bicycle commuting, as long as you are not receiving other pretax commuting benefits from your employer.

What the House proposed:

The House bill did not propose any changes.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate would take away this tax break.

Reduced and Waived Tuition

What’s in place now:

Employees of educational institutions who receive reduced tuition — or a waiver — for themselves, spouses or dependents are generally not taxed on that income. This is particularly helpful for certain graduate students; their tuition is waived as part of arrangements in which they teach or perform research at their university.

What the House proposed:

The House bill would treat reduced or waived tuition as income.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate would keep things as they are now.

Employer-Paid Tuition

At the moment, when employers pay your tuition for continuing education, the amount they pay is not taxable income for you as long as it meets certain conditions and amounts to no more than $5,250 per year.

What the House proposed:

The House would make these tuition payments count as taxable income starting in 2018.

The Senate would keep things as they are now.",How Could a Tax Change Affect You? This Is What the Senate and House Propose,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/your-money/how-could-a-tax-change-affect-you.html

In 2016, Egypt ranked 146th out of 150 countries for fixed broadband download speeds, according to Speedtest. The only worse country in North Africa was war-torn Libya. It’s surprising given that a major data cable, linking hundreds of millions of users, passes through one sleepy Egyptian village. The problem stems from a lack of investment in telecommunications infrastructure locally since the Arab Spring in 2011 and stifling state monopolies.

We get around this with dongles connected to the 4G cellphone network, which is better, if not perfect. In conflict zones like Libya, where I covered an offensive against the Islamic State last year, I turn to my BGAN satellite data terminal and a Thuraya satellite phone.

But increasingly there is at least patchy cellphone coverage in even the more dangerous places, such as during the battle for Aleppo, Syria, last year. That brings an immediacy that I once found jarring: the power to FaceTime with your mom, for instance, from a battlefront. But now that feels normal, and choices are dictated less by technology than by what simply feels right.

Are Egyptians joined at the hip with their smartphones?

Egyptians adore their smartphones. People have crazy-looking cases and a range of dramatic ringtones — Quranic verses for conservatives, melodramatic pop tunes for everyone else. Lionel Richie’s “Hello” and anything by Celine Dion are very popular.

The flip side to the smartphone mania is that it also inspires deep paranoia among the police and some ordinary citizens, known popularly here as “honorable citizens.” I know people who’ve been threatened with arrest for taking a photo of the Suez Canal (after the pyramids, one of Egypt’s most famous features). A photographer friend was admonished by an “honorable citizen” for trying to take a photo of the Nile with her phone. He accused her of being a spy.

What are the favorite apps or gadgets in Egypt? Are people on Facebook and using Google and Uber?

Egypt has the largest community of Facebook users in the Arab world. It’s a huge part of many people’s lives, at a time when the public square is dramatically shrinking. Since President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in 2013, protest has been outlawed and the news media is largely in thrall to the government. So people turn to social media to talk politics, mock their leaders and hunt for independent news. If Mr. Sisi makes a slip-up on television, there will unfailingly be a flurry of mocking memes flying about on Facebook within hours. It can be funny, dark or both — jokes about the country’s pitiful human rights record, for instance.

It’s not just Western apps. Anghami is the Arab version of Spotify, Souq.com is the big online retailer (and was bought by Amazon this year), and there’s a host of apps that tell pious Muslims when to pray or that help them to read the Quran.

On the streets of Cairo, Uber and Careem, a ride-sharing app that concentrates on the Middle East, are slugging it out for market share. As a result, cab rides can be ridiculously cheap — just a few dollars to cross town.

How does the Egyptian government treat tech like social media and Western apps?

With wariness and frequent hostility.

Egyptian officials closely monitor Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites, and posting an irreverent comment can land a user in court or in jail. A young army conscript is serving a three-year sentence for posting a photo of Mr. Sisi with a pair of Mickey Mouse ears. Since May, the government has banned over 400 websites, including Human Rights Watch, the Egyptian news site Mada Masr and, bizarrely, Medium. Earlier this year, I discovered the security services were seeking access to real-time information about ride-sharing customers — once known inside Uber as “God View” — through the Uber and Careem apps.

All told, it’s a pretty grim picture.

The potential conflicts extend from the cabinet to the West Wing. Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, an adviser whose portfolio ranges from Middle Eastern peace to government technology, revealed over the summer that he had failed to disclose dozens of assets on his initial government ethics forms.

“It is precisely because we have extraordinarily wealthy individuals running the government that we have no way of knowing what the conflicts of interest really are,” said Gary Kalman, executive director of the FACT Coalition, a network of anti-corruption groups. “They use complex structures to hide their money, both domestically and abroad.”

Among the investments Mr. Kushner initially failed to publicly disclose was a real estate technology start-up called Cadre. After beginning his job at the White House, Mr. Kushner identified for ethics officials the assets that he believed he would need to sell in order to avoid conflicts, including investments in a group of funds that hold stakes in various technology companies. Like other appointees, Mr. Kushner sought a certification that would let him defer capital gains taxes on those assets.

Virginia Canter, a former White Ethics lawyer now at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a left-leaning watchdog group, said that officials were typically required to sell off all similar assets in order to win the tax benefit. But Mr. Kushner did not include Cadre among the investments to be sold. Instead, he moved his Cadre stake into a holding company, BFPS Ventures, that his disclosure form described as containing only “real estate in New York.”

He later revealed his continued Cadre stake to the public in an updated disclosure. By then, the company had received a new round of investments that pushed its value to $800 million.

Mr. Kushner’s team has maintained that the original omission was accidental, but that Kushner is entitled to keep his Cadre stake because he could easily recuse himself from any conflicts surrounding the company.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

“Mr. Kushner’s interest in Cadre was disclosed to and discussed with the Office of Government Ethics prior to inauguration and is addressed in his ethics agreement with the White House,” Jamie S. Gorelick, a lawyer for Mr. Kushner, said in a statement.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But Ms. Canter said it wasn’t clear whether ethics officials were given complete information about Cadre before granting Mr. Kushner the tax deferral on his other assets, and she questioned his decision to keep it.

“The nature of the entity is that real estate is being bought and sold on a technology platform,” Ms. Canter said. “Who is buying and selling on that platform — we have no visibility into it.”

She added, “There should have been much greater scrutiny.”

Mr. Trump’s wealthy appointees have divested from a broad range of assets, and in some cases have made clean breaks: Rex W. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil chief, shed a small fortune in company shares to become secretary of state.

But some appointees, like Mr. Ross, have taken advantage of the ambiguities of current rules to retain assets that could be impacted by administration policy. Under her agreement with ethics officials, for example, Betsy DeVos, the billionaire education secretary, divested a swath of assets. But she retained many others in family trusts of which she remains a trustee. There is no way to know which of those assets may conflict with her duties as secretary of education: Ms. DeVos chose not to publicly disclose what investments are contained in two of them.

“What we are seeing in these new leaks is that even when people are acting in a legal fashion, the laws allow them to cover the tracks of things they think would be embarrassing or problematic,” Mr. Kalman said.

Mr. Ross’s Russia ties are a case study in how layers of offshore secrecy can hide potential conflicts. Before Mr. Trump named him to the Commerce Department, Mr. Ross was a major shareholder in a shipping firm that did brisk business transporting gas for a Russian company, Sibur, whose owners include not only an oligarch hit with sanctions but the son-in-law of Russian President Vladimir V. Putin.

Navigator was listed on an initial disclosure filed by Mr. Ross that covered his holdings through the end of last year. But an ethics and divestment agreement he filed in January, which listed assets he intended to keep, did not mention Navigator, leaving unclear whether he had sold it.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said he had voted to advance Mr. Ross’s nomination out of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, of which he is a member, because Mr. Ross had pledged to divest any assets that would pose a conflict.

Unbeknownst to Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Ross in fact retained much of his stake in Navigator after taking office. But it was hidden within one of the disclosed partnerships, behind layers of shell companies in the Cayman Islands. In an interview with Bloomberg News on Monday, Mr. Ross said that he would probably sell his stake in the company.

James Rockas, a spokesman for Mr. Ross, noted that Mr. Ross’s decision to retain the Navigator investment had been approved by the government ethics office.

But Mr. Blumenthal now says he felt misled. This week, he called for a review of Mr. Ross’s financial conflicts by the Commerce Department’s inspector general.

“The complexity and lack of transparency of Cayman Islands-based holding companies made them very much like a Russian nesting doll,” Mr. Blumenthal said. “If we knew then what we know now, it would have been a very, very different confirmation process.”","Trump Appointees, Richest Ever, Elude Scrutiny With Hidden Investments",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/us/politics/trump-appointees-conflicts-of-interest.html

That’s close to 20 percent of the corporate tax revenue that is collected each year. This is legal.

These figures represent a huge loss of resources that, if collected, could be used to cut taxes on the rest of us, or spent on social programs to help people in our societies.

How do they do it?

For an example, look no further than your search bar. In 2003, a year before it went public, Google (now a multinational conglomerate known as Alphabet) began a series of moves that would allow it to obtain favorable tax treatment in the future.

(now Alphabet) Google Ireland Holdings bermuda “Managed” (now Alphabet) Google Ireland Holdings bermuda “Managed” (now Alphabet) Google Ireland Holdings bermuda “Managed” Google Ireland Limited IRELAND (now Alphabet) Google Ireland Holdings bermuda “Managed” Google Ireland Limited IRELAND Google Affiliate Google Affiliate Google Affiliate Africa europe Middle east (now Alphabet) Google Ireland Holdings bermuda “Managed” Google Ireland Limited IRELAND IRELAND $$$ Google Affiliate France (now Alphabet) Google Ireland Holdings $$$ bermuda “Managed” Google Ireland Limited IRELAND IRELAND $$$ Google Affiliate France First, it transferred ownership of intellectual property related to its all-important search and advertising technologies to an entity named Google Ireland Holdings. Why Ireland? Because not only did it have favorable corporate tax rates, its regulations also allowed Google Ireland Holdings to incorporate there but be “managed” in Bermuda. Google Ireland Holdings then created another Irish subsidiary, Google Ireland Limited, and granted it a license to use the technology now owned by the Irish parent company. Under this arrangement, which as far as we know is still in place, it is Google Ireland Limited that actually licenses the tech of Google’s main business to all the Google affiliates in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. (Google has a similar offshoot in Singapore that covers business in Asia). Google France, for example, pays royalties to Google Ireland Limited. That entity in turn moves its profits to Bermuda via a royalty payment to the Google Ireland Holdings.

See where this is going? In 2015, $15.5 billion in profits made their way to Google Ireland Holdings in Bermuda even though Google employs only a handful of people there. It’s as if each inhabitant of the island nation had made the company $240,000.

The corporate tax rate there?

Zero

In doing this, Google didn’t break the law. Corporations like Google are simply shifting profits to places where corporate taxes are low. It’s not just Internet companies with valuable intellectual property that do this. A car manufacturer, for instance, might shift profits by manipulating export and import prices – exporting car components from America to Ireland at artificially low prices, and importing them back at prices that are artificially high.

According to the latest available figures, 63 percent of all the profits made outside of the United States by American multinationals are now reported in six low- or zero-tax countries: the Netherlands, Bermuda, Luxembourg, Ireland, Singapore and Switzerland. These countries, but above all the shareholders of these corporations, benefit while others lose.

My colleagues Thomas Torslov and Ludvig Wier and I combined the data published by tax havens all over the world to estimate the scale of these losses. The $70 billion a year in revenue that the United States is deprived of is nearly equal to all of America’s spending on food stamps. The European Union suffers similar losses.

So what can be done?

Thankfully, Ireland has announced it will close the “double Irish” loophole that Google used, and arrangements that take advantage of that loophole must be terminated by 2020. But similar strategies will be used as long as we let companies choose the location of their profits.

Just look at what Apple did in 2014 — it’s one of the most spectacular revelations from the newly released Paradise Papers. After learning Irish authorities were going to close loopholes it had used, Apple asked a Bermuda-based law firm, Appleby, to design a similar tax shelter on the English Channel island of Jersey, which typically does not tax corporate income. Appleby duly obliged, and Jersey became the new home of the (previously Irish) companies Apple Sales International and Apple Operations International.

A potential fix would be to allocate the taxable profits made by multinationals proportionally to the amount of sales they make in each country.

Say Google’s parent company Alphabet makes $100 billion in profits globally, and 50 percent of its sales in the United States (a relatively similar scenario to the first quarter of this year, in which that figure was 48 percent). In that case, $50 billion would be taxable in the United States, irrespective of where Google’s intangible assets are or where its workers are employed. A system similar to this already governs state corporate taxes in America.

Such a reform would quash artificial profit-shifting. Corporations may be able to shift around profits, assets, and subsidiaries, but they cannot move all their customers to Bermuda.

This system is not perfect, but it’s orders of magnitude better than both the laws that now govern the taxation of international profits and the tax package being proposed by congressional Republicans. Under the proposed plan some international profits would be taxed at 10 percent, but there are many likely exemptions.

One advantage of allocating taxable profits as I suggest is that this reform can be adopted unilaterally. There is no need for the United States (or any other nation that wants to cut down on tax avoidance) to obtain permission from anybody.

But we’d still face an equally daunting problem, the far more shadowy – and ultimately illegal – tax evasion of ultrawealthy individuals, many of them with net worths already bolstered by the proceeds of corporate tax avoidance. Here’s an example.

Meet Michael. Michael is the (fictional) chief executive and owner of an American company, Michael & Company. Like many people, he would like to pay as little in taxes as possible. But unlike most people, he can take some steps that will allow him to do just that.

Michael & Co. America Anonymous Shell Co. Inc. Cayman Islands Michael & Co. America Anonymous Shell Co. Inc. Bank Cyprus Cayman Islands Michael & Co. America Anonymous Shell Co. Inc. Bank Cyprus Cayman Islands Michael & Co. America Anonymous Shell Co. Inc. Bank Cyprus Cayman Islands First, he creates an anonymous shell company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, which has lax regulations on disclosing the identities of company owners. He then opens an account under the shell company’s name in Cyprus (or one of many other tax havens, such as Switzerland, Hong Kong and Panama, whose banks cater to the wealthy and aren't reliable about cooperating with foreign tax authorities). Finally, Michael & Company buys fictitious services from the Cayman shell company (“consulting,” for example) ... … and, to pay for these services, wires money to the shell company’s Cyprus account.

The transaction generates a paper trail that can appear legitimate at first glance. But the reality is more insidious. By paying for fictitious consulting, Michael fraudulently reduces the taxable profits of Michael & Company, and thus the amount of corporate income tax he pays.

And once the money has arrived in Cyprus, it is invested in global financial markets and generates income that the Internal Revenue Service can tax only if Michael reports it or if his Cypriot bank informs the I.R.S.

It’s supposed to, but many offshore banks have routinely violated their obligations in the past, by pretending they didn’t have American customers or hiding them behind shell companies. So this way, Michael can evade American federal income tax as well as paying fewer corporate taxes through his company.

And meanwhile, in America, if he wants to use any of the money stashed in Cyprus, he can simply go to an ATM and make a withdrawal from his offshore account.

How do we know all this?

Until recently, we did not have a good sense of who owns the wealth held offshore, but with my colleagues Annette Alstadsaeter and Niels Johannesen, we have been able to make progress thanks to leaks over the last few years. In 2015, the Swiss Leaks revealed the owners of bank accounts at HSBC Switzerland, and in 2016 the Panama Papers revealed those of the shell companies created by the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. These showed that 50 percent of the wealth held in tax havens belongs to households with more than $50 million in net wealth, a minuscule number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals who avoid paying their fair share. In the Paradise Papers, we see that these are not only Russian oligarchs or Belgian dentists who use tax havens, but rich Americans too.

As I mentioned above, about 11.5 percent of world G.D.P. is held offshore by households. For a long time, the bulk of it was held in Switzerland, but a fast-growing fraction is now in Hong Kong, Singapore and other emerging havens.

We can stop offshore tax evasion by shining some light on darker corners of the global banking industry. The most compelling way to do this would be to create comprehensive registries recording the true individual owners of real estate and financial securities, including equities, bonds and mutual fund shares.

One common objection to financial registries is that they would impinge on privacy. Yet countries have maintained property records for land and real estate for decades. These records are public, and epidemics of abuse are hard to come by.

The notion that a register of financial wealth would be a radical departure is wrong. And the benefits would be enormous, as comprehensive registries would make it possible to not only reduce tax evasion, but also curb money laundering, monitor international capital flows, fight the financing of terrorism and better measure inequality.",How Corporations and the Wealthy Avoid Taxes (and How to Stop Them),https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/10/opinion/gabriel-zucman-paradise-papers-tax-evasion.html

We still don’t know if the relationship is causal, but let’s accept that there’s at least an association. For breast cancer — which is the cancer that seems to be garnering the most headlines — light drinking was associated with a relative risk of 1.04 in the announcement. Relative risk refers to the percentage change in one’s absolute (overall) risk as a result of some change in behavior. (And 1.04 is a 4 percent change from 1.0, which represents a baseline of no difference in risk between an experimental group and a control group.)

A 40-year-old woman has an absolute risk of 1.45 percent of developing breast cancer in the next 10 years. This announcement would argue that if she’s a light drinker, that risk would become 1.51 percent. This is an absolute risk increase of 0.06 percent. Using what’s known as the Number Needed to Harm, this could be interpreted such that if 1,667 40-year-old women became light drinkers, one additional person might develop breast cancer. The other 1,666 would see no difference.

Of course, moderate or heavy drinking might increase the risks further. The absolute risks for that 40-year-old would go to 1.78 percent from 1.45 percent for the moderate drinker, and to 2.33 percent for the heavy drinker. Those numbers are still not that scary.

But maybe any increase in risk is too much for you. That’s fine. If you’re one of those people, though, you have to acknowledge that you can’t look at any one cancer in a vacuum. A person can get almost any cancer.

The large meta-analysis upon which this announcement was based looked at 23 types of cancer with respect to alcohol consumption. It found a harmful relationship between three of them and light drinking. But it also found protective relationships — meaning a decreased risk of cancer — between six of them and light drinking.

I’m not arguing that you should engage in light drinking to avoid those six cancers. I’m merely pointing out that cherry-picking allows you to come to different conclusions. With respect to moderate drinking, there were harmful relationships with seven cancers and protective relationships with three. The announcement focused on the former, not the latter.

A 2013 meta-analysis in the Annals of Oncology that looked at all cancers found that, over all, light drinking was protective; moderate drinking had no effect; and heavy drinking was detrimental.

It’s even cherry-picking to focus only on cancer, though. A person can get any number of diseases, and this fact makes the dangers of light and moderate drinking even muddier.

If you accept the methodology of case-control and cohort studies, from which many of the links between alcohol and cancer arise, you have to accept the results of similar studies of other diseases. For instance, a cohort study of about 6,000 people found that those who drank at least once a week had better cognitive function in middle age than those who didn’t. A 2004 systematic review found that moderate drinkers had lower rates of diabetes (up to 56 percent lower, although that’s a relative risk reduction).

Randomized controlled trials of alcohol (they do exist) show that light to moderate drinking can lead to a reduction in risk factors for heart disease, diabetes and stroke. These protective factors may be greater than all the other negative risk factors (even cancer) that might be associated with light or moderate drinking. More women die in the United States of heart disease than cancer. So do more men.

Moreover, dire warnings have consequences. I know far too many people who now throw up their hands at every news story because it seems as if “everything” causes cancer. These stories rarely acknowledge an alternative point of view. The absolute risks of light and moderate drinking are small, while many people derive pleasure from the occasional cocktail or glass of wine. It’s perfectly reasonable even if a risk exists — and the overall risk is debatable — to decide that the quality of life gained from that drink is greater than the potential harms it entails.

This is true for many, many foods, not just alcohol.

What can we do about this? We could make simple changes to have a better understanding of risk so that each new proclamation doesn’t send us into a tizzy:

1) Consider the absolute risks. A 30 percent increase in risk sounds scary, but an increase from 1 percent to 1.3 percent absolute risk does not, though these are the same things. Likewise, we should be more concerned about a 5 percent risk increase to 21 percent from 20 percent than about a 30 percent increase to 1.3 percent from 1 percent.

2) Don’t give too much weight to observational data. This is especially true when causal data are available.

3) Don’t focus on any one disease while ignoring others. Something may be harmful regarding one disease while beneficial regarding another.

4) Don’t cherry-pick. That is, don’t focus only on some studies, or only on some results. Review all the evidence for the most holistic picture possible.

5) Acknowledge the harms, as well as the benefits, of recommendations. Consider both cost and joy.

These rules may not make for exciting headlines. They may, however, lead to happier, and perhaps healthier, lives.",A Link Between Alcohol and Cancer? It’s Not Nearly as Scary as It Seems,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/upshot/health-alcohol-cancer-research.html

Unsurprisingly, the city’s newest apartments, dominated by luxury condos, got top dollar, with a median sales price of $3.05 million, almost twice that of units in buildings constructed during the previous decade. The best bargains, however, weren’t found in the oldest apartments, but in the 1950s stock, which sold for a median $737,500, the lowest of any decade. Time was kinder to apartments built before World War II, which reached a sales peak of $1.5 million for apartments in buildings from the early 1900s.

The midcentury price drop is not just a matter of taste, but also of substance. “By postwar, the size of apartments were shrinking, the ceiling heights were down, and the number of rooms declined,” said Andrew S. Dolkart, a professor of historic preservation at Columbia University.

After World War II, a surge in housing demand and the development of previously underused land around the city’s elevated train lines, especially on the East Side, brought a wave of new rental buildings, he said.

One of the early successes was Manhattan House, built in 1951: a sleek, light-brick building in Lenox Hill, set back from the street with a large green space and private balconies for some residents. Now a condo, the building frequently has $3 million-plus listings.

The model was perhaps too successful, as developers cashed in on the white-brick look with derivative designs on the cheap. “It’s second-class architecture,” said Andrew Alpern, an architectural historian and author, of the era that eschewed the structural hallmarks of prewar design, like double masonry walls for sound insulation and windows in bathrooms and kitchens.

“For a while, they were despised by people who thought they had the right to despise them,” said Carol Herselle Krinsky, a professor of art history at New York University, about the early reception of postwar brick buildings. Even now, she added, “things haven’t changed much.”

As the New York Times lamented in a 1979 article, “Tower after tower of white or brown or red brick is the norm, with cramped rooms that are not so much well laid out as they are squeezed in for maximum profit.”

But these buildings, by and large, were not meant for the elite, historians said. Built mostly as rentals to meet pent-up demand, they catered to the middle class — or at least what passes for middle class in Manhattan.

And they remain some of the most affordable apartments in the city. More than two-thirds of sales in 1960s buildings over the past year were for less than $1 million — more in that price range than in buildings from any decade. Apartments from the 1960s were also among the most popular with the past year’s buyers, accounting for more than 14 percent of the analyzed sales, second only to those from the 1920s (16.3 percent of sales).

Many of the postwar buildings that were built as rentals were converted to co-ops in the 1980s, and they deserve recognition in their own right, said Jonathan J. Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, which analyzed the data.

“We could talk all day about the cranes dotting the sky today, but it pales in comparison to the conversion and new-development frenzy of the 1980s,” he said. Because most of the buildings being converted were originally rental, the units tended to be smaller and more affordable — especially compared to the luxury condos being sold today.

That combination of factors is why midcentury apartments remain one of the cheaper ways to get into hip neighborhoods, said Jaclyn B. Treinkman, an associate broker with Compass who recently listed an apartment in a stout 1959 building in Greenwich Village for $550,000. Similar but newer apartments in the area might list in the $700,000 range, she said.

“It was homey-slash-ugly,” said Devon Talbott, 30, an actor who owns the apartment with his family. The unit was configured as a studio, with red walls and dated finishes, when Mr. Talbott and his family bought it in 2007 for $465,000. But the comparatively low price, he said, allowed them to transform the roughly 500-square-foot space into a one-bedroom with two Murphy beds, a sliding partition wall and a small recording booth for Mr. Talbott, a voice actor for the Japanese animated series “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.”

The renovation, designed by Elise Kodish of Anne Zuckerberg Associates, incorporated 1960s and 1970s motifs like painted glass cabinets and a modernist chandelier hung above Macassar ebony wood cabinets with a tiger-stripe pattern. Mr. Talbott, who is now working on a horror web series called “Fear,” is selling because his family is moving to Brooklyn. But their fondness for postwar redos remains: They plan to keep a smaller studio that Ms. Kodish also revamped in a white-brick 1960s building across the street.

The postwar pedigree is a lure for others as well. The Sovereign, a 47-story tower in Sutton Place built in 1974, was designed by Emery Roth & Sons, an architecture firm known for prewar developments like the San Remo towers. Its International-style lobby — complete with Venini crystal chandeliers, iron-mesh curtains and rosewood paneling — remains largely unchanged.

In the building’s heyday, celebrities like Freddie Mercury and Calvin Klein lived there, said Jessica G. Ushan, an associate broker with Brown Harris Stevens who has sold more than 200 apartments in the Sovereign since the 1990s. The rock-star edge has dulled a bit in recent years, with more empty nesters than pop artists calling it home. But the building’s staying power is in its design.

Half the units have floor plans resembling the Classic Six or Classic Seven layouts of prewar apartments, with distinct living and dining areas and a maid’s room, Ms. Ushan said, while the other half are L-shaped, with a more modern, open floor plan. The under-nine-foot ceilings may be lower than those in most new development, but they are offset in part by the private balconies — and by the prices. As Ms. Ushan said, “It’s about half the price of a new condo.”

H.R. Vanoosten Morris, 52, a retired asset fund manager, is selling a two-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath unit in the building for $2.295 million. His husband, Neal Prince, who died in April and was an architect known for his interior design of the InterContinental Hotels, bought the unit in 1978. Mr. Prince kept the original Classic Six floor plan intact because he thought the formal dining and living rooms were ideal for entertaining. The space still has the designer’s antique-green marble flooring, mirrored walls and custom-built glass-and-metal dining table that seats at least 12, which will stay with the apartment.

Ms. Ushan said the buyer will likely want to renovate the kitchen, which is dated by today’s standards, and possibly open the adjacent pantry and maid’s room to create a larger open space. But she is not discounting the vintage appeal.

“Some things get so old, they get new again,” she said, noting that some buyers seek out retro décor with an eye to giving it a modern spin.

For other buyers of postwar apartments — particularly those built later — age is just a number.

“I guess the ’80s is a long time ago now, but it doesn’t seem like it,” said Sander Ross, a retired tax attorney. In 2014, he bought an apartment with his wife, Carol, the general counsel for a publishing company, at the Dag Hammarskjold, a concrete-and-glass condo built in 1984, for $1.775 million.

The 43-story tower in Turtle Bay, near the United Nations, was one of the first luxury condos built in the 1980s, said Richard Balzano, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman who sold the couple the two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath apartment.

“It was very much ahead of its time,” Mr. Balzano said, with features like nine-foot ceilings and building amenities like a children’s playroom and an indoor pool on the top floor — unheard of today, because developers now put the most expensive units at the top of the building.

The apartment needed work. Mr. Ross and his wife raised the ceilings, which had been lowered by a previous owner to house lighting, installed taller doors and gutted most of the space, at a cost of about $400,000. “I don’t think a co-op would have allowed us to do this kind of thing,” he said.

For their effort, they got a condo with some of the amenities of a newer building at a fraction of the price. (The median cost of a 1980s apartment last year was $1.19 million, compared to $3.05 million for new construction.) The unit has a balcony that overlooks several parks, and the master bedroom has a dead-on view of the Pepsi-Cola sign in Long Island City. They’re not planning to sell.

For Ms. Chwals, the serial home buyer in the 1960s West Village co-op, living in a midcentury building also meant a break from new-condo monotony.

“I liked that it wasn’t the sleek, post-Carrie Bradshaw version of New York,” she said, referring to the television series “Sex and the City,” which aired in the late 1990s and early 2000s. More to the point, she thought the prewar stock in her price range was tiny and overpriced.

Over the years, she has learned to appreciate the plainness of her building, the way an artist sees a canvas. “Because it’s a box, there’s no loyalty to preserving someone’s architectural vision,” she said of the renovations that she and her husband, Walter Lee, have done.

Ms. Chwals, 37, who works for an arts education nonprofit, made her first purchase there: a studio apartment, in 2004. In 2010, she and Mr. Lee, who is also 37 and works in financial services, bought a two-bedroom. Then they bought an adjacent studio to create a combined three-bedroom home with room for their two young daughters. Now they’re selling that three-bedroom apartment, which is listed for $3.795 million with James Morgan of Compass, to move into a larger duplex in the building.

In the three-bedroom, the couple took down interior walls to create a largely open floor plan. Working with the design firm Studio g & a, they used bright wallpaper, big art and colorful carpets to decorate the unadorned space. The living and dining areas flow together, and a sliding walnut door closes off a dressing room. The windows are not floor to ceiling, as in newer buildings, but Ms. Chwals sees that as a plus: “You’d end up living with your shades drawn, anyway.”

There is also something comforting about not living in the “it” building on the block. Over the years she has become friendly with her neighbors, who range in age from young parents to retirees.

“There’s a real sense of community that I don’t think we’d get if we were in a shinier new building,” she said.",The Plight of the Postwar Apartment,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/realestate/plight-of-postwar-apartment.html

Another performer, Abby Schachner, said her own inappropriate run-in with Louis C.K.","That tradition lives on today. Recently, the New Yorker film critic Richard Brody responded to sexual assault accusations against Mr. Weinstein by suggesting that while outside information about filmmakers “can be illuminating,” the “better a film is, the likelier that the biography only fills in details regarding what should already have been apparent to a cleareyed viewing.” That’s a bizarre calculation that dismisses discussions of bad deeds based on the talent of the person performing them. The journalist Gay Talese was blunter in his dismissal of Anthony Rapp, the “Rent” star who accused Kevin Spacey of preying on him when he was 14. “I hate that actor that ruined that guy’s career,” he said.

Directors, meanwhile, have justified the mistreatment or plain resentment of women as a gritty artistic choice. Bernardo Bertolucci, the director of “Last Tango in Paris,” boasted that he chose not to fully inform his lead actress, Maria Schneider, of all the details of the film’s infamous butter scene because he “wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress.” (“I felt humiliated and to be honest, I felt a little raped,” she said of the experience.) The director Lars von Trier has whipped misogyny into a persona, delighting in riling actresses and selling the stories to magazines as kicky evidence of his transgressive brilliance. The auteur, celebrated for tightly controlling all aspects of the filmmaking, seems only to enhance his reputation by flaunting his control of women.

Meanwhile, the entertainment industry seems quite interested in conflating the art and the artist as long as it helps sell movie tickets. (If Hollywood weren’t invested in selling the people behind the art, the Oscars wouldn’t be televised.) Stars and power brokers are reflexively praised for their societal contributions. Even as they’ve been accused of harassment, Hollywood men have attempted to fend off the charges by trotting out such good deeds. Mr. Spacey cynically chose this moment to announce that he is gay in a bid to spin a harrowing assault tale into a heartwarming coming-out one. Mr. Weinstein countered accusations by dozens of women by mentioning his generous contributions to a scholarship fund for female directors. And Bill Cosby was more than happy to confuse his art with his personal life when he bellowed his old Fat Albert catchphrase — “Hey, hey hey!” — as he exited a courtroom this past summer during his trial for sexual assault.

Louis C.K., one of the most respected and celebrated comedians today, has built a public persona that simultaneously capitalizes on the praise afforded to the provocative auteur and to the Hollywood do-gooder. He’s been hailed as a thoughtful feminist figure, a comic capable of landing unexpected jokes while navigating politically correct positions on the issues of the day. In a memorable bit in his 2013 HBO comedy special, “Oh My God,” he asks: “How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We’re the No. 1 threat to women!” His stand-up routine is obsessed with masturbation but also infused with insights into power and consent, situating him as a kind of ethical pervert, the schlubby male-ally version of the fashionable sex-positive feminist.

At the same time, he’s built alternative-world versions of himself — as in the FX show “Louie” — where he’s tried on the identities of aging creep, attempted rapist and exhibitionist masturbator. He’s also made his character the victim of similar crimes: Louie has been forced to perform oral sex on a date and been anally penetrated by his friend Pamela as he screams in protest. In each case, he recovers easily from the violation — just as Pamela shrugs it off after Louie tries to drag her, kicking and screaming, to bed with him. These episodes garnered acclaim as canny twists on gender politics, and their critical reception was clearly vaulted by their engagement with current debates around consent.

These scenes now play differently. What once looked like creative provocations now read like justifications of a moral universe where women are as complicit in sexual violation as men are, and where sex that begins with force easily gives way to mutual desire.

Men like Louis C.K. may be creators of art, but they are also destroyers of it. They have crushed the ambition of women and, in some cases, young men — boys — in the industry, robbing them of their own opportunities. The comedians Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov said that after Louis C.K. cornered them and masturbated in front of them at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in 2002, they feared that speaking out about the incident could risk their careers. While Louis C.K. felt free to flaunt the behavior throughout his comedy — in one scene of “Louie,” Pamela begs him not to start masturbating in front of her — the women were silenced. He took advantage of them, then took ownership of the experience.

Another performer, Abby Schachner, said her own inappropriate run-in with Louis C.K. discouraged her from pursuing comedy altogether. (As he himself put it in an apology released on Friday: “The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly.”) Our assessments of men’s contributions to an art form ought to be informed by the avenues they have closed off for other artists.

Photo

Perhaps, instead of considering the possibility of separating the art from the artist, it’s instructive to think of the impossibility of separating the artist from his industry. Louis C.K. is not just a comedian and director but also a gatekeeper and tastemaker, whose reach has stretched far beyond his idiosyncratic projects. Film is an art and also a business, though one that can lack the human-resources infrastructure of corporate America. No one makes that clearer than Mr. Weinstein, who stands accused of corrupting the artistic process to take advantage of women even as he has strong-armed his films to Oscar gold.

Those offended by the opportunities artists have lost in recent weeks should know that casting choices that feel like artistic decisions have almost always been economic ones. After Ridley Scott chose to cut Mr. Spacey from his already completed film “All the Money in the World” and reshoot his scenes with Christopher Plummer, The Associated Press reported that Mr. Plummer was actually Mr. Scott’s first choice for the role. The studio, however, had demanded a bigger name — until that big name became a big liability.

The habit of treating artists as transcendent creators rather than as players in an economic system serves to protect them from typical workplace expectations. And in the same way that a sneaker or technology company tries to distract the consumer from vile production processes by churning out covetable products, Hollywood serves up spectacles that seek to conceal the conditions under which they’re made.

Photo

Many of these works make the consumer complicit in the perspective of the abuser. Even the casual objectification of, say, Brett Ratner’s “Rush Hour” series — so often written off as harmless fantasy — is constructed to elevate men’s desires over women’s lives. And some such scenes are leveraged by directors and producers looking for opportunities to place actresses in vulnerable positions, as when James Toback — director of such psychosexual films as “Two Guys and a Girl” — instructed Selma Blair to undress alone in his hotel room on the pretext that she was auditioning for a role.

What do we do with these people? It seems uncontroversial that offenders who remain in positions of power ought to be unseated to prevent further abuses. As for the art, we can begin to consider how the work is made in our assessment of it.

This conversation is often framed, unhelpfully, as an either-or: Whose work do we support, and whose do we discard forever? HBO cut ties with Louis C.K. on Thursday, dropping him from a coming benefit show and removing his comedy specials from its on-demand service. The first move seems wise, but the second feels perhaps counterproductive. Louis C.K.’s comedy specials are artifacts of both his comedic artistry and his self-justifying persona. Some viewers may not want to see Louis C.K.’s face again, but others could find illumination in watching his work with a new eye.

None of this is to say that it’s never valuable to consider a piece of art on its own terms, or that biographical details necessarily make for illuminating connections. Many personal lives are simply boring, and works with well-meaning politics can be very bad. (See: Keith Urban’s new male-ally anthem, “Female.”) But the insistence that the two always be separated feels suspect. Some who advocate this worry that too much biography can spoil our appreciation of the art. But women and other marginalized audiences are already accustomed to managing the cognitive dissonance of finding meaning in art that ignores us, or worse.

Drawing connections between art and abuse can actually help us see the works more clearly, to understand them in all of their complexity, and to connect them to our real lives and experiences — even if those experiences are negative. In this light, some aspects of the work can seem more impressive. The knowledge that Ms. Blair or Lupita Nyong’o weathered harassment in their careers only makes their performances even more extraordinary. If a piece of art is truly spoiled by an understanding of the conditions under which it is made, then perhaps the artist was not quite as exceptional as we had thought.",How the Myth of the Artistic Genius Excuses the Abuse of Women,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/arts/sexual-harassment-art-hollywood.html

Editors’ Choice 9 New Books We Recommend This Week Image Credit

Revolution is in the air this week — at least, it’s in a handful of new books set in Revolutionary times. Three founding fathers feature in two of our recommended titles: “Friends Divided: John Adams and Thomas Jefferson,” by Gordon S. Wood, and “The Three Lives of James Madison,” by Noah Feldman. Russell Shorto brings to life half a dozen players from the era of American independence in “Revolution Song,” including the first American president. Much has changed since the Washington Administration, however; Jeremi Suri argues in “The Impossible Presidency” that as the nation has grown, the job of leading it may be too unwieldy for one person to manage. Perhaps it’s time to overhaul the Oval Office, and not just replace the drapes.

VIVIAN MAIER: A Photographer’s Life and Afterlife , by Pamela Bannos. (The University of Chicago Press, $35.) The photographer Vivian Maier’s work was only discovered when more than 100,000 negatives turned up after her death, at 83, in 2009. She was immediately heralded as one of the 20th century’s great photographers, but myths built up around her and controversy over the control of her work have kept us from seeing her clear. Pamela Bannos attempts to dislodge the portrayal of Maier as a mysterious, freakish figure. Our critic Parul Sehgal says she succeeds. “The achievement of Bannos’s intelligent, irritable self-reflexive study is in its restraint,” Sehgal writes. “She unseats the ghost and restores to us the woman.”

REVOLUTION SONG: A Story of American Freedom , by Russell Shorto. (Norton, $28.95.) George Washington is the hub of Shorto’s book, which artfully weaves together the stories of six individuals from the Revolutionary period — including a shoemaker, a Seneca chief, a freed slave and a memoirist who faked her own death — to give a sense of how far-reaching a phenomenon the War of Independence was.

SCHLESINGER: The Imperial Historian , by Richard Aldous. (Norton, $25.95.) Through the middle of the 20th century, the speechwriter and Kennedy aide Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. could reliably be found at the epicenter of Democratic debate and governance. Now he has found in Aldous an agreeably judicious biographer who gracefully balances an appreciation for his subject’s talents as a writer of narratives and speeches with an acknowledgment of his shortcomings as a political analyst and aide.

SMILE , by Roddy Doyle. (Viking, $25.) Doyle’s 11th novel is the closest thing he’s written to a psychological thriller: The protagonist’s life goes off track after a stranger from his past shows up, reminding him of their Catholic school days amid signs of a deeper darkness the narrator refuses to confront.

THE IMPOSSIBLE PRESIDENCY: The Rise and Fall of America’s Highest Office , by Jeremi Suri. (Basic, $32.) In this succinct and original volume, a historian traces the changing role of the presidency from Washington onward, arguing that as the job has become increasingly complex it now involves more than a single person can handle.

SCALIA SPEAKS: Reflections on Law, Faith, and Life Well Lived , by Antonin Scalia. Edited by Christopher J. Scalia and Edward Whelan. (Crown Forum, $30.) This collection of speeches and writings by the famously argumentative Supreme Court justice, who died in February 2016, offers a clear picture of his originalist interpretation of the Constitution. His words are provocations to argue, disagree and think.

THE THREE LIVES OF JAMES MADISON: Genius, Partisan, President , by Noah Feldman. (Random House, $35.) America’s fourth president shifted his political orientation at least three times in his life. Feldman marks the changes in his nuanced portrait of the founding father, who effectively mirrored the evolving identity of the American republic in its most formative phase.

THESE POSSIBLE LIVES , by Fleur Jaeggy. Translated by Minna Zallmann Proctor. (New Directions, paper, $12.95.) A Swiss-Italian writer presents short impressionistic takes on Thomas De Quincey, John Keats and the French Symbolist Marcel Schwob. Brilliant and associative, these biographical essays have the beauty and economy of poems but the souls of portraits.

FRIENDS DIVIDED: John Adams and Thomas Jefferson , by Gordon S. Wood. (Penguin Press, $35.) Their friendship lasted (with interruptions) for 51 years, from their meeting at the Continental Congress in 1775 to their deaths on the same day, July 4, 1826. Wood traces the long, fraught ties between the second and third presidents, and sides almost reluctantly with Jefferson in their philosophical smack-down.

The New Health Care Don’t Nudge Me: The Limits of Behavioral Economics in Medicine

Whenever I talk to physicians about outcomes that are worse than you’d expect, they are quick to point out that noncompliance — when a patient does not follow a course of treatment — is a major problem.

Sometimes prescriptions aren’t filled. Other times they are, but patients don’t take the drugs as prescribed. All of this can lead to more than 100,000 deaths a year .

A thorough review published in The New England Journal of Medicine about a decade ago estimated that up to two-thirds of medication-related hospital admissions in the United States were because of noncompliance, at a cost of about $100 billion a year. These included treatments for H.I.V., high blood pressure, mental health and childhood illnesses (it can be difficult to get children to take their medicine, too).

To address the issue, researchers have been trying various strategies, including those rooted in behavioral economics . So far, there hasn’t been much progress. A systematic review published five years ago in Annals of Internal Medicine looked at all kinds of trials that tried to improve patient compliance. It found some limited successes in improving patient compliance in different disorders, but most of the trials were small and not easily generalized outside the research setting.

A more recent Cochrane review concluded that “current methods of improving medication adherence for chronic health problems are mostly complex and not very effective.”

At first glance, behavioral economics — the basis of Richard Thaler’s recent Nobel Prize in Economics — seems like a rich field of potential solutions. People tend to do things, like donate organs , when it’s the default option as opposed to something they need to request. They tend to be less likely to miss appointments if you tell them how many other patients show up for theirs. They tend to be more likely to engage in preventive behaviors like using sunscreen if you focus on the benefits, not the harms. Many are turning to ideas like these to improve medication adherence.

But those excited about the potential of behavioral economics should keep in mind the results of a recent study . It pulled out all the stops in trying to get patients who had a heart attack to be more compliant in taking their medication. (Patients’ adherence at such a time is surprisingly low, even though it makes a big difference in outcomes , so this is a major problem.)

Researchers randomly assigned more than 1,500 people to one of two groups. All had recently had heart attacks. One group received the usual care. The other received special electronic pill bottles that monitored patients’ use of medication. Those patients who took their drugs were entered into a lottery in which they had a 20 percent chance to receive $5 and a 1 percent chance to win $50 every day for a year.

That’s not all. The lottery group members could also sign up to have a friend or family member automatically be notified if they didn’t take their pills so that they could receive social support. They were given access to special social work resources. There was even a staff engagement adviser whose specific duty was providing close monitoring and feedback, and who would remind patients about the importance of adherence.

This was a kitchen-sink approach. It involved direct financial incentives, social support nudges, health care system resources and significant clinical management. It failed.

The time to first hospitalization for a cardiovascular problem or death was the same between the two groups. The time to any hospitalization and the total number of hospitalizations were the same. So were the medical costs. Even medication adherence — the process measure that might influence these outcomes — was no different between the two groups.

The researchers in this trial deserve praise for their frank assessment of their results, as well as for trying to brainstorm ways in which they might achieve success in the future. Getting patients to change their behavior is very hard. In the past, we’ve tried making drugs free to patients to get them to adhere to their medications and improve outcomes. That failed. We’ve tried lotteries (as in the study above) to nudge people to achieve better compliance. That failed.

Maybe financial incentives, and behavioral economics in general, work better in public health than in more direct health care. There have been successes, after all, with respect to weight loss — although these seemed to disappear over time. We’ve also seen promise with respect to smoking cessation , although these come with caveats as well.

Experts caution that the interventions that achieve success are often very intensive. They demand a great deal of attention, and can be quite expensive. Moreover, they are very focused, usually on a single issue or condition.

The problem is that health has so many moving parts. The health care system has even more. Trying to improve any one aspect can make others worse. Behavioral economics may offer us some fascinating theories to test in controlled trials, but we have a long way to go before we can assume it’s a cure for what ails Americans.

The oppressively hot afternoons in the Delta and the cool, quiet country nights of the rural woodlands inspired many of the greatest American storytellers, including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and Shelby Foote, and the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Son House.

This year, to honor the bicentennial of Mississippi’s statehood, residents throughout the state are following that tradition, telling the stories of their own communities with photographs employing the 21st-century technology of smartphones. The project, “Celebrating Storytellers,” was created by Chandler Griffin and Alison Fast, partners in Blue Magnolia Films and Barefoot Workshops, and will culminate next month with an exhibit of 200 five-foot-wide images in storefront windows in Jackson, Miss. Similar exhibits have already been held in five other cities.

“We didn’t want to just have big parties for the bicentennial with nothing that’s lasting afterwards,” Mr. Griffin said. “We really wanted to engage with communities. We wanted to go from town to town, and create spaces where people could have conversation about their community and what revitalization means.”

He and Ms. Fast went to a dozen towns and cities in Mississippi asking community leaders to help identify people who understood the fabric of their communities and invited them to a free, weeklong workshop and to begin documenting where they live with iPhones. The stories were chosen by the participants, who received guidance from the workshop team that included Aaron Phillips, a photographer who started out as a student at the Barefoot Workshops, and Natalie Irby, the executive producer.

There will be 100 participants in all ranging in age from 14 to 91.

In Mound Bayou, a small economically-depressed Delta city that was founded by former slaves in 1887, Myrna Smith-Thompson documented the rundown home of Isaiah Montgomery, a former slave of Jefferson Davis, who helped found the community. Ms. Smith-Thompson, who was born and raised in Mound Bayou, leads the Knights of Tabor, a benevolent community organization that is restoring local historic sites. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather led the organization before her.

“It’s not just a house,” she wrote for the project. “It’s the home of a man who in 1887 had a dream of turning a swampy piece of land filled with wild animals and mosquitoes and unimaginable obstacles into a negro self-governing community in Mississippi, for the people. He had the audacity to ask newly freed slaves to clear this land and make a nice place to live with all the amenities afforded to others. He had the nerve to attempt to influence free slaves to become self sufficient to create a safe haven for blacks amidst a climate of fear and hostility.”

At the start of the project last year, the emphasis was on Mississippi’s revitalization, not “race and reconciliation,” Mr. Griffin said. But the subject came up in every single workshop they held. In Clarksdale, an group of high school students from the mostly-black public school and an almost all-white private school made race the focus of their projects. Before meeting at the workshop they had rarely mixed, but they got together afterward for dinners and attended each other’s graduations. These experiences, Mr. Griffin said, “lead to change in communities.”

Mr. Griffin is a fifth-generation Mississippian, and attended Jackson Prep, a private institution that was started as a segregated school in 1970 in response to the federally mandated integration of the public schools. When he graduated in year 1994 he felt like he “had blinders on and was not exposed to anything.”

He attended art school in Savannah, Ga. and taught photography at the Maine Workshop in Rockport, M.E. before moving to New York City to “make his mark.” He rarely told anyone he was from Mississippi.

After a while, he realized that he didn’t really know Mississippi outside of where he grew up, so he returned to start Barefoot Workshops in Clarksdale and to learn more about his home.

“I fell in love with Mississippi in 2005 when I ran that first workshop, and ever since then I’ve just been trying to figure out ways to help tell the story and talk about the awesome things in Mississippi, as well as the problems, and look at the people working on solutions.”

Looking back at the experience, Ms. Smith-Thompson said the project taught her “to see things differently and how to tell stories with pictures” and made her “feel like a younger person.” For Christmas, she is buying a new iPhone to continue documenting her community.

“Storytelling helps us to share our different perspectives of our community with someone else, in a non-threatening way,” she explained. “The harsher the situation, the more impactful storytelling may be.”

I was a typical beginner, even if I didn’t live in your typical neighborhood: This was the South Bronx during the era when arson and abandonment fueled by government dysfunction turned it into a globally-infamous and desolate urban landscape.

My spirit sometimes felt as broken as the sidewalks and buildings of my neighborhood on Fox Street, since I had grown disillusioned with art school and was floundering with my identity. I was a Puerto Rican and a New Yorker, but it was hard to reconcile those two identities. I struggled in New York because I wasn’t recognized as American. And when I moved to the island for a while, I wasn’t recognized as Puerto Rican, either.

Even in art school I sometimes wasn’t recognized as the one thing I had set out to be – a photographer. Luckily, one of my teachers who was familiar with my work suggested I meet a friend of hers, Mel Rosenthal, who taught photography at Empire State College.

Photo

Mel instantly liked what I was shooting, and it was fitting that we met at that time. While I was photographing the Longwood section of South Bronx, Mel was out making pictures on the streets of his youth a few miles north in the Bathgate neighborhood for images that would later be published as “In the South Bronx of America.”

Mel let me into his life, and I was alongside him when he took many of the pictures in his book. We made the connections between his youth as a Jewish man who returned to where he had grown up on the streets of the South Bronx and seeing how its current residents – my family and friends – had been disenfranchised. Mel introduced me to politics and taught me who the players were and how they were being exposed. There was the catalyst that got me thinking how I could use photography to change and document that.

Mel’s approach to documentary photography was shaped by his own strong belief in social justice, which led him back to his old neighborhood to document how its beleaguered residents confronted its decline, the impact of city policies of official neglect, or the guerilla ingenuity of Puerto Rico’s Villa Sin Miedo, a land rescue effort to provide affordable housing.

What was central in his work – and what he taught us – was that when people let you into their lives, your photographs can amplify their voices on the issues that mattered to them, despite the silence and indifference of the rest of the city and its power brokers. Under his guidance, I started making those connections between my neighborhood’s decline and the larger forces buffeting it, from political neglect and corruption to the greed of landlords who cut services and then abandoned their properties or hired people to torch them for insurance.

Photo

My work from that era was influenced by Mel’s lessons and his own example as a compassionate photographer on a mission. Sure, I took pictures of the fires, the abandoned buildings or skeletal cars dumped on the streets. But I also caught early B-Boys dancing at the Hunts Point Palace, kids playing on the streets and the other rhythms of life. And, sadly, I also have portraits of friends who would not survive much past their teenage years, their lives cut short by drugs, AIDS or guns.

I am but one of many young, socially aware photographers fortunate to have attended Mel’s seminal workshops where he introduced us to the world of documentary photography and photojournalism. The summer workshops were a six-week intensive course where some of the best photojournalists in the world shared their images of the issues of the time, from covering the wars in Central America to poverty in the middle America and around the world.

The students who attended those workshops fanned out throughout New York City covering the rise of AIDS and the birth of political activism in the gay and lesbian community, as well as protests against racism and police brutality that turned the streets of black and Latino communities into raging battlegrounds. There wasn’t a single week where there wasn’t a demonstration taking place and that was the real classroom where Mel’s students learned their craft.

Mel came into his own as a photographer during the social unrest of the 1960s. Maybe it’s not a coincidence that his former students are now photojournalists documenting very similar deep divisions that are consuming our country.

Mel died last week from the effects of Alzheimer’s, a disease that slowly and painfully took him from us. The best memorial we can give him is to continue the practice as he taught it.

Dinosaurs reigned supreme for more than 160 million years. Their dynasty came to a cataclysmic close 66 million years ago when an asteroid crashed into the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico at a site now known as the Chicxulub crater, paving the way for mammals — and eventually humans — to inherit the Earth.

But had the extraterrestrial impact happened nearly anywhere else, like in the ocean or in the middle of most continents, some scientists now say it is possible dinosaurs could have survived annihilation. Only 13 percent of the Earth’s surface harbored the ingredients necessary to turn the cosmic collision into this specific mass extinction event, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.

“I think dinosaurs could still be alive today,” if the asteroid had landed elsewhere, Kunio Kaiho, a paleontologist from Tohoku University in Japan and lead author on the study, said in an email.

Other researchers questioned their findings.

When the asteroid, which had a diameter about half the length of Manhattan, struck the coast of Mexico, it found a rich source of sulfur and hydrocarbons, or organic deposits like fossil fuels, according to the researchers. Scorching hot temperatures at the impact crater would have ignited the fuel. The combustion would have spewed soot and sulfur into the stratosphere in sufficient quantities to blot out the sun and change the climate, setting into motion the collapse of entire ecosystems and the extinction of three-quarters of all species on Earth.

The Chicxulub impact spewed an extraordinary amount of black carbon, or soot, from the rocks, the researchers said. That in turn launched nearly 60 Hoover Dams worth of soot into the upper atmosphere, cooling the Earth’s surface by as much as 18 degrees Fahrenheit, they said.

John Benedict Hillerman was born on Dec. 20, 1932, in Denison, Tex., about 60 miles north of Dallas, to Christopher and Lenora Hillerman. He was the middle child of three and the only boy. He is survived by his sister Jo Ann Tritico.

He displayed independence at a young age. By age 12 he was driving by himself, and within a few years he was traveling to Dallas to see operas and staying alone in hotels.

But he did not at first see himself onstage. It was not until he was stationed in Fort Worth with the Air Force that he decided to audition for a community theater production of “Death of a Salesman.”

“When I stepped onstage, I experienced the greatest high I’ve ever had in my life,” he recounted in a 1987 interview. “And I said to myself, ‘Hillerman, until this moment, you have been bored.’ ”

He had found his passion. Before he left the Air Force, he had appeared in nearly two dozen plays. He moved to the East Coast and, during 11 years in New York and then four in Washington, he had more than 100 stage roles. But after all those years, he had only $700 in the bank and decided to move to Los Angeles to find better-paying work.

He instantly landed a role in a TV movie but struggled for two years after that to find something else. He eventually reconnected with a friend from New York, the director Peter Bogdanovich, who cast Mr. Hillerman in a number of his films, including “The Last Picture Show” (1971) and “Paper Moon” (1973).

He played Simon Brimmer, a rival sleuth to the title character, on “Ellery Queen,” and John Elliot, the sarcastic ex-husband of Betty White’s character, on “The Betty White Show.” He also played the boss of Ann Romano (played by Bonnie Franklin) on “One Day at a Time.’’

The detainment of more than 100,000 Japanese-Americans during World War II was aimed at citizens on the West Coast. New Yorkers were exempt, but the sculptor Isamu Noguchi, then 37, went anyway. This exhibition, through Jan. 7, features documents and works made from driftwood dating from the seven months Noguchi spent in a camp near the Arizona-California border, where he tried, and failed, to improve living conditions for his fellow Japanese-Americans.

From Light Animation to Adolescent Angst

My First Film Fest 2 at the Walter Reade Theater

Don’t be fooled by the title. While the second annual edition of this cinematic weekend from the Film Society of Lincoln Center offers plenty of fare for 6-year-olds, its Friday-through-Sunday screenings include four features, like the 1997 Hayao Miyazaki classic, “ Princess Mononoke ,” geared strictly to teenagers. Anders Walter’s “ I Kill Giants ,” based on a comic-book series by Joe Kelly, explores the turbulent inner life of a bullied adolescent girl; Bruce McDonald’s “ Weirdos ,” set in 1976, follows the odyssey of a hitchhiking, Warhol-besotted 15-year-old and his girlfriend; and “ Polina ,” by Valérie Müller and Angelin Preljocaj, focuses on a driven Russian dancer. Younger viewers can gain new perspectives from the documentary “ Miss Kiet’s Children ,” by Peter Lataster and Petra Lataster-Czisch, which goes inside a Dutch elementary school classroom filled with Middle Eastern immigrants. And one unusual opportunity involves a not-yet-finished film: Carlos Saldanha will show footage from his comedy “ Ferdinand ” and then lead audience members in an animation workshop.

Roswell Rudd Birthday Celebration at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola

Mr. Rudd is a trombonist of bulbous tone and lively, free-ranging attack. He started in New York’s 1960s jazz avant-garde, but today tends toward a gentler beauty. His new album, “Embrace,” features the vocalist Fay Victor, the pianist Lafayette Harris and the bassist Ken Filiano. Mr. Rudd recently received a diagnosis of cancer and will not be at these shows, at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. on Thursday. But the “Embrace” band will, along with the vocalist Sheila Jordan and other all-stars. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

CLASSICAL MUSIC

Standing Tall Among Giants

Benjamin Grosvenor at the 92nd Street Y

Other young pianists may garner more headlines, but Benjamin Grosvenor may well be the most cultivated member of a generation overflowing with talent. This program, which takes place at 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday, is characteristically thoughtful: Bach’s French Suite No. 5; Brahms’s Op. 119 pieces, interspersed with Brett Dean’s “Hommage à Brahms”; an arrangement of Debussy’s “Prelude à l’Après-Midi d’Un Faune”; Berg’s Piano Sonata; and, as if all that were not challenge enough, Ravel’s “Gaspard de la Nuit.” DAVID ALLEN

FILM SERIES

Slices of Life and History From Multiple Perspectives

DOC NYC at various locations

The weeklong DOC NYC, through Nov. 16, offers any kind of documentary you might imagine. A mystery? In “Wormwood” (Friday), Errol Morris finds a riveting subject in Eric Olson, a psychologist who has spent his life figuring out what happened to his father, who died in 1953 under suspicious circumstances. In Barbara Kopple’s “A Murder in Mansfield” (Sunday), a man — who as a child testified against his father in the murder of his mother — seeks closure. Other highlights: “EuroTrump” (Friday), a portrait of the far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders, and “12th and Clairmount” (Thursday), which constructs an account of the 1967 Detroit uprising from archival footage and audio testimony.

Sugarplum Burlesque

Company XIV at Théâtre XIV, Brooklyn

“Nutcracker Rouge” is what happens when a holiday tradition about a journey through a land of sweets gets a dose of spice and a shot of sexuality. Put the kids to bed, then indulge in this adults-only burlesque fairy tale featuring a mix of song, dance and circus with visual decadence and a coquettish vibe. This year, at various times through Jan. 14, the party transfers to Company XIV’s new, permanent home in Bushwick. BRIAN SCHAEFER

It’d been awhile. Regular Cheerios are more my thing. But sometimes I finish my box faster than my kids do and find myself straying to their side of the cupboard.

Honey Nut is America’s best-selling breakfast cereal, and by a comfortable margin. Roughly 151 million boxes and other containers of various sizes were sold over the past year, well ahead of the second best-selling breakfast cereal, Frosted Flakes, according to IRI, a Chicago based market research firm.

I had no idea. The only thing I could think about when I ate it again for the first time in years was how incredibly sweet it is. I looked at the back of the box and could see why. Three of the top six ingredients are sweeteners: sugar, brown sugar and honey.

Previously, I assumed Honey Nut Cheerios was a slightly sweeter Cheerios, but you learn things when you finally get around to reading the back of the box. It actually has about nine times as much sugar as plain Cheerios, per serving. An Environmental Working Group analysis of a number of popular cereals — a report that linked sugary cereals to the “nation’s childhood obesity epidemic” — put Honey Nut Cheerios’s sugar content second only to Fruity Pebbles. The same group found that one cup of the cereal had more sugar than three Chips Ahoy! cookies.

Mr. Sharkey is pointing to one possible solution with less evident downsides.
As Mr. Sharkey publishes his findings, crime rates are now diverging after a generation in which violence fell reliably year after year nearly everywhere.
It’s not clear yet whether the great crime decline he writes about will continue.
“The model that we’ve relied on to control violence for a long time has broken down,” Mr. Sharkey said.","This long-term trend has fundamentally altered city life. It has transformed fear-inducing parks and subways into vibrant public spaces. It has lured wealthier whites back into cities. It has raised the life expectancies of black men. And even in an age of widening urban inequality, it has meant that the daily lives of the most disadvantaged are less dangerous now than they were a generation ago. These poor neighborhoods, Mr. Sharkey has found, have been the greatest beneficiaries of this tectonic change in safety.

The same communities were participating in another big shift that started in the 1990s: The number of nonprofits began to rise sharply across the country, particularly those addressing neighborhood and youth development.

Mr. Sharkey and the doctoral students Gerard Torrats-Espinosa and Delaram Takyar used data from the National Center for Charitable Statistics to track the rise of nonprofits in 264 cities across more than 20 years. Nonprofits were more likely to form in the communities with the gravest problems. But they also sprang up for reasons that had little to do with local crime trends, such as an expansion in philanthropic funding. A spike in nonprofits addressing subjects like the arts and medical research occurred in this same era.

Comparing the growth of other kinds of nonprofits, the researchers believe they were able to identify the causal effect of these community groups: Every 10 additional organizations in a city with 100,000 residents, they estimate, led to a 9 percent drop in the murder rate and a 6 percent drop in violent crime.

In a criminology field that has produced some eyebrow-raising ideas, this one is actually not so surprising. That national finding echoes local studies of some individual programs, like one run by the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society that converts abandoned lots into green spaces and that has been linked in Philadelphia to reduced gun violence.

The research also affirms some of the tenets of community policing: that neighborhoods are vital to policing themselves, and that they can address the complex roots of violence in ways that fall beyond traditional police work.

“It’s absolutely consistent with what I would argue is probably the prevalent theory of policing among the major cities today,” Richard Myers, the executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, said of the new research.

Local organizations also say Mr. Sharkey’s results validate what they have already witnessed.

“Any time people’s basic needs are met, violence goes down — that’s not new,” said Noreen McClendon, who directs the nonprofit Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles.

The group, led by Ms. McClendon’s mother for many years, was formed in the 1980s to fight a proposed waste incinerator in the neighborhood. It evolved in the 1990s to address many of the neighborhood’s other challenges. The group created dozens of block clubs to care for individual streets. It cleaned alleys and repaired potholes, and hired local ex-offenders to do that work. It established a credit union, sponsored a jazz festival and developed hundreds of units of affordable housing.

During a time of major disinvestment in cities, and severe cuts in federal support for urban programs, residents of the neighborhood believed no one else was coming to help. “Nobody,” Ms. McClendon said. And if the group had not done this work itself? “There would have been a lot more death,” she said, “between violence amongst people, violence from police brutality, just drugs.”

Many similar groups did not explicitly think of what they were doing as violence prevention. But in creating playgrounds, they enabled parents to better monitor their children. In connecting neighbors, they improved the capacity of residents to control their streets. In forming after-school programs, they offered alternatives to crime.

In the East Lake neighborhood of Atlanta, the crime rate in the mid 1990s was 18 times the national average. The drug market in the neighborhood was estimated to be doing $35 million in business a year. There hadn’t been a new building permit issued in the neighborhood in nearly three decades, a sign of how little anyone had invested in the community other than to buy drugs there.

Then the newly formed East Lake Foundation developed new mixed-income housing to replace a decaying public housing project. It started a golf program for neighborhood children on a nearby but long-deteriorating golf course. The foundation eventually opened a charter school, where the first class of seniors had a 100 percent graduation rate in May.

“We knew we wanted to see violence and crime go down in the community,” said Carol Naughton, who led the foundation for years and today is the president of a national group, Purpose Built Communities, that is trying to teach East Lake’s model in other cities. “But we’ve never had a crime-prevention program.”

Today violent crime in East Lake is down 90 percent from 1995. But Ms. Naughton is momentarily perplexed by the question of whether she believes groups like hers have gotten enough credit for contributing to that outcome.

“We’re not part of the crime-reduction world, or the public safety world, in the same way that we’re part of the health and education and housing world,” she said. “It never occurred to us that we’re not getting the credit, because we don’t even know that world is out there.”

The lesson in that response, and in Mr. Sharkey’s work — that effective crime prevention doesn’t necessarily look like stop-and-frisk, or hot-spot policing, or mass incarceration — is particularly relevant today as cities rethink policing.

“A lot of these communities were in despair because they needed resources,” said Robert Sampson, a sociologist at Harvard who has studied Chicago neighborhoods damaged by violence. “And what did they get? Well, they mainly got crime control. They got increases in incarceration.”

Those tactics may have contributed to the decline in crime as well. But they’ve come with costs that have become clearer over time, in antagonizing communities and disrupting families.

Mr. Sharkey is pointing to one possible solution with less evident downsides. And he’s suggesting that communities can effectively take on the very roles that the police say have strained them as they’ve increasingly been asked to perform jobs they weren’t trained for, as guidance counselors or marriage therapists or substance-abuse experts.

“They are taking that burden away from the police that probably never should have been there, but by default has kind of landed there,” said Mr. Myers of the chiefs association, who is also a former longtime police chief himself, in Michigan, Virginia, Colorado and elsewhere.

As Mr. Sharkey publishes his findings, crime rates are now diverging after a generation in which violence fell reliably year after year nearly everywhere. It’s not clear yet whether the great crime decline he writes about will continue. But he argues that it’s time for a new model of violence prevention, one that relies more heavily on the kind of work that these community groups have been quietly doing than on the aggressive police tactics and tough sentencing that the Trump administration now advocates.

“The model that we’ve relied on to control violence for a long time has broken down,” Mr. Sharkey said. If communities want police to step back, he is pointing to some of the people who can step in. “This gives us a model. It gives us another set of actors who can play a larger role.”",The Unsung Role That Ordinary Citizens Played in the Great Crime Decline,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/upshot/the-unsung-role-that-ordinary-citizens-played-in-the-great-crime-decline.html

SÃO PAULO, Brazil — When I was 7, I joined the Brazilian Girl Guides. One of the basic laws of the guides was that a girl should be “courteous and delicate.” (These days they only emphasize the “courteous” part.) I remember being taught to abide by the following requirements to earn one of the guides’ coveted badges: A girl needs to know how to treat authorities, how to show deference to people, how to listen and speak at the right time and — my favorite — how to address people without yelling.

In September, I took my first classes in women’s self-defense. They definitely left some marks on me (besides the bruises). I could finally understand, in my body, the full extent of the violence and humiliation that we women in Brazil are meant to swallow during our lives, always with meekness and grace. Lowered head, slumped shoulders, stiff neck, dropped gaze: Our whole body is often shrunken and pointed inward, as if we are trying to be as small a target as possible.

For a long time, showing obedience and good manners were considered the most important things for a girl to learn. Even now, especially in developing countries like mine, this has barely changed: The worst thing a woman can do is speak up for herself and spread ideas that are not “appropriate,” like saying that misogyny exists in her professional field or denouncing a sexual crime committed by a powerful man. It’s always better to stay quiet and just let the abuser have his way. If the woman could also manage to say “thank you” after that, it would be even better. (For the record: Women should also refrain from using irony.)

But I don’t need to go very far to prove that we have good reasons to yell. Just look at a few random acts of gender-based violence in Brazil in the past few months: A male detainee strangled his girlfriend to death inside a prison cell because she restated her desire to end their relationship during the visit. A young man pushed his ex-girlfriend in front of a bus because she told him she was pregnant and he had already planned an exchange trip to Canada. A woman who told the police that her ex-partner was spying on her with a secret camera was stabbed to death by him — in a police vehicle on their way to a police station.

These are extreme manifestations of the unequal power relations between men and women — real-life, concrete expressions of a social dynamic that forces women to stay in a subordinate position, always speaking at a low volume and cowering. The full spectrum of gender-based violence also encompasses but is not limited to sexual harassment, domestic battering, sexual exploitation, violation of reproductive rights, “honor” killings and rape. Not to mention all kinds of threats and abuses of power that hurt women physically, sexually, economically and psychologically.

And what is the only unanimously acceptable response to these acts of violence? Showing deference to the aggressors and keeping one’s mouth shut, of course.

It has also occasioned a suite of exhibitions in this region, under the umbrella title “1917: Total War in Flanders,” that explore how the Great War intensified 100 years ago into an unprecedented catastrophe.

These shows, in museums and at battle sites, examine a wide range of topics: the use of photography in the war effort, the provision of medical care, the participation of colonial forces and the ecological impact of the fighting. All of them complement the region’s already substantial collection of museums and heritage sites, including large Commonwealth, German and Belgian cemeteries and monuments at almost every intersection. Free of the nationalism that can divert military anniversaries — consider “Blood Swept Land and Seas of Red,” the grossly jingoistic installation of ceramic poppies that festered around the Tower of London in 2014 — these Belgian exhibitions are models of sincerity and sobriety.

I traveled here to see them in part to consider whether museums can make sense of war, and in part because, like most Americans, I felt I knew too little about World War I. Passchendaele may be a byword for suffering in Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but in America it is hardly known, and the larger war, which killed more Americans than Korea and Vietnam combined, has long been overshadowed by subsequent conflicts.

Washington still has no World War I memorial; if it ever gets one, it will not be on the National Mall. New exhibitions and displays at several Smithsonian museums have elicited almost no media coverage. Even the commission set up by Congress in 2013 to commemorate this year’s centenary calls World War I America’s “most forgotten war.” But there are Flemish answers for some urgent American questions — not least, how to memorialize the dead of a conflict with no nobility.

The In Flanders Fields Museum, the region’s most important, is housed in the rebuilt Cloth Hall that sits on Ypres’s pleasant town square. (Ypres is the French name for this city of 35,000; these days it goes by the Dutch name Ieper, though Commonwealth soldiers, struggling with the French monosyllable, pronounced it “Wipers.”)

The museum’s permanent exhibition, which opened in 2012, tells a harrowing story of the war in Flanders from 1914 onward, and mixes archival materials with some uncommonly sensitive multimedia features. Shovels and water pumps evoke the trenches, and gas masks recall that earlier battles around Ypres, in 1915, saw the first use of chemical weapons in warfare.

In 1916, buoyed by the French prime minister Georges Clemenceau’s call for a “total war,” in which industry and civil society joined with the military for an all-out onslaught, British generals ordered troops to make excruciating, pointless sallies that gained a few meters of territory at the expense of thousands of lives.

A battle meant to last 72 hours slogged on for five months. Yet generals and grand strategy are largely absent in this museum; instead, at intervals, screens show actors reading the diaries of ordinary troops, Allied and German alike, who see the carnage up close. One panoramic screen features Harvey Cushing, the American doctor in Mr. Englund’s “The Beauty and the Sorrow,” who with two nurses recounts the daily casualties, and how their early delusions of the grandeur of war gave way to the ire and fatalism that would become the hallmarks of European modernism.",How to Remember a War Without Glory?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/arts/design/ypres-exhibitions-world-war-i.html

“Your social alliances affect how you weight information,” said Dr. Seifert.","Agents with links to the Russian government set up an endless array of fake accounts and websites and purchased a slew of advertisements on Google and Facebook, spreading dubious claims that seemed intended to sow division all along the political spectrum — “a cultural hack,” in the words of one expert.

Yet the psychology behind social media platforms — the dynamics that make them such powerful vectors of misinformation in the first place — is at least as important, experts say, especially for those who think they’re immune to being duped. For all the suspicions about social media companies’ motives and ethics, it is the interaction of the technology with our common, often subconscious psychological biases that makes so many of us vulnerable to misinformation, and this has largely escaped notice.

Skepticism of online “news” serves as a decent filter much of the time, but our innate biases allow it to be bypassed, researchers have found — especially when presented with the right kind of algorithmically selected “meme.”

At a time when political misinformation is in ready supply, and in demand, “Facebook, Google, and Twitter function as a distribution mechanism, a platform for circulating false information and helping find receptive audiences,” said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College (and occasional contributor to The Times’s Upshot column).

For starters, said Colleen Seifert, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, “People have a benevolent view of Facebook, for instance, as a curator, but in fact it does have a motive of its own. What it’s actually doing is keeping your eyes on the site. It’s curating news and information that will keep you watching.”

That kind of curating acts as a fertile host for falsehoods by simultaneously engaging two predigital social-science standbys: the urban myth as “meme,” or viral idea; and individual biases, the automatic, subconscious presumptions that color belief.

The first process is largely data-driven, experts said, and built into social media algorithms. The wide circulation of bizarre, easily debunked rumors — so-called Pizzagate, for example, the canard that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex ring from a Washington-area pizza parlor — is not entirely dependent on partisan fever (though that was its origin).

For one, the common wisdom that these rumors gain circulation because most people conduct their digital lives in echo chambers or “information cocoons” is exaggerated, Dr. Nyhan said.

In a forthcoming paper, Dr. Nyhan and colleagues review the relevant research, including analyses of partisan online news sites and Nielsen data, and find the opposite. Most people are more omnivorous than presumed; they are not confined in warm bubbles containing only agreeable outrage.

But they don’t have to be for fake news to spread fast, research also suggests. Social media algorithms function at one level like evolutionary selection: Most lies and false rumors go nowhere, but the rare ones with appealing urban-myth “mutations” find psychological traction, then go viral.

There is no precise formula for such digital catnip. The point, experts said, is that the very absurdity of the Pizzagate lie could have boosted its early prominence, no matter the politics of those who shared it.

“My experience is that once this stuff gets going, people just pass these stories on without even necessarily stopping to read them,” Mr. McKinney said. “They’re just participating in the conversation without stopping to look hard” at the source.

Digital social networks are “dangerously effective at identifying memes that are well adapted to surviving, and these also tend to be the rumors and conspiracy theories that are hardest to correct,” Dr. Nyhan said.

One reason is the raw pace of digital information sharing, he said: “The networks make information run so fast that it outruns fact-checkers’ ability to check it. Misinformation spreads widely before it can be downgraded in the algorithms.”

The extent to which Facebook and other platforms function as “marketers” of misinformation, similar to the way they market shoes and makeup, is contentious. In 2015, a trio of behavior scientists working at Facebook inflamed the debate in a paper published in the prominent journal Science.

The authors analyzed the news feeds of some 10 million users in the United States who posted their political views, and concluded that “individuals’ choices played a stronger role in limiting exposure” to contrary news and commentary than Facebook’s own algorithmic ranking — which gauges how interesting stories are likely to be to individual users, based on data they have provided.

Outside critics lashed the study as self-serving, while other researchers said the analysis was solid and without apparent bias.

The other dynamic that works in favor of proliferating misinformation is not embedded in the software but in the biological hardware: the cognitive biases of the human brain.

Purely from a psychological point of view, subtle individual biases are at least as important as rankings and choice when it comes to spreading bogus news or Russian hoaxes — like a false report of Muslim men in Michigan collecting welfare for multiple wives.

Merely understanding what a news report or commentary is saying requires a temporary suspension of disbelief. Mentally, the reader must temporarily accept the stated “facts” as possibly true. A cognitive connection is made automatically: Clinton-sex offender, Trump-Nazi, Muslim men-welfare.

And refuting those false claims requires a person to first mentally articulate them, reinforcing a subconscious connection that lingers far longer than people presume.

Over time, for many people, it is that false initial connection that stays the strongest, not the retractions or corrections: “Was Obama a Muslim? I seem to remember that....”

In a recent analysis of the biases that help spread misinformation, Dr. Seifert and co-authors named this and several other automatic cognitive connections that can buttress false information.

Another is repetition: Merely seeing a news headline multiple times in a news feed makes it seem more credible before it is ever read carefully, even if it’s a fake item being whipped around by friends as a joke.

And, as salespeople have known forever, people tend to value the information and judgments offered by good friends over all other sources. It’s a psychological tendency with significant consequences now that nearly two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news from social media.

“Your social alliances affect how you weight information,” said Dr. Seifert. “We overweight information from people we know.”

The casual, social, wisecracking nature of thumbing through and participating in the digital exchanges allows these biases to operate all but unchecked, Dr. Seifert said.

Stopping to drill down and determine the true source of a foul-smelling story can be tricky, even for the motivated skeptic, and mentally it’s hard work. Ideological leanings and viewing choices are conscious, downstream factors that come into play only after automatic cognitive biases have already had their way, abetted by the algorithms and social nature of digital interactions.

“If I didn’t have direct evidence that all these theories were wrong” from the scanner, Mr. McKinney said, “I might have taken them a little more seriously.”",How Fiction Becomes Fact on Social Media,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/health/social-media-fake-news.html

The things they value are there, they don’t really have the skills to pack up and be an Anywhere, and they love Trump because he sticks his finger in the eyes of the Anywheres who have made their world worse.

The thing about this new set of battle lines is this: It redraws the political map. The cities are dominated by Anywheres. The rural areas are dominated by Somewheres. But the growing suburbs are no longer divided. They are Anywhere all the way through. Last Tuesday, exurban Loudoun County went Democratic 60 to 40 percent. That’s nearly the same as inner-ring Fairfax County, which went Democratic 67 to 31 percent.

Trump’s party is not at home on this ground and can’t play on it. Trumpians just want to wall it off. “DC should annex NOVA and return the governance of Virginia to Virginians!” Jerry Fallwell Jr. tweeted, referring to Northern Virginia, after the election results.

Populism has made the Republicans a rural party and given the Democrats everything else. In Virginia, Democrats won by a landslide among anybody who grew up in the age of globalization. Among voters 18-29, they won by an astounding 69 to 30 percent. Among voters 30-44, they won by 61 percent to 37 percent.

We could be seeing the creation of a new Democratic heartland, exurbia, and this alignment could hang around for a while. The stain Trump leaves on the G.O.P. will take some time to wash away. But this is bigger than Trump; it’s an alignment caused by the fundamental reality of the populist movement.

But does this mean Democratic dominance is baked in the cake? Here I would say, not so fast. It’s worth remembering that the Democrats don’t quite deserve this victory. It didn’t come about because of some masterly Democratic strategy. The Democrats won because the Republicans decided to shrink their coalition.

And it’s worth looking around the world and noting that center-left parties are in decline across Europe and beyond. These parties have lost touch with working class voters and are finding they can’t simply replace them with a mixture of identity politics and faculty lounge populism. What we’re seeing around the world is not the rise of left-wing dominance but the decline of major parties and the fragmentation of political parties across the board.

The crucial question going forward is what will the Democrats do? Will they make places like Loudon County their heartland, or will they amputate themselves the way the Republicans did, and retreat back to the cities?

Here’s how you can tell which way the Democrats are going. If they talk mostly about oligarchy and rich financiers, they are retreating to their base.

What a great idea for a theme! Given the word-nerdy kinship between neologism watchers and crossword lovers, I’m surprised it’s the first time this theme has been attempted.

The American Dialect Society has been awarding Word of the Year honors since 1990, but maybe it took this long for the stars to align just right — after all, the last two WOTY winners, SINGULAR THEY (2015) and DUMPSTER FIRE (2016), are nicely symmetrical (12 letters, with the same 8-4 enumeration).

Deb asked me to comment on each of the WOTY honorees featured in the grid. Though a couple of them are before my time — I didn’t really get active in the WOTY proceedings until 2005 (the year of “truthiness”) — I’m happy to kibitz in my capacity as Chair of the New Words Committee for the ADS.

MILLENNIUM BUG (1997): This was a very forward-looking choice at the time, given that we were still a couple of years away from the Y2K doomsday scenario foretold by software unequipped to handle the calendrical change from Dec. 31, 1999 to Jan. 1, 2000. “Y2K” itself would go on to win WOTY honors for 1999, but thankfully the Cassandras were wrong and we weren’t all forced off the grid when the millennium arrived.

WMD (2002): Both “weapons of mass destruction” and its shortened form “WMD” received WOTY recognition for a year in which headlines were dominated by news of the Iraq War — and what turned out to be the shaky rationale for it. The U.S. never did find the WMDs that Saddam Hussein was thought to possess, but the abbreviation lives on (including the plural form “WMDs,” with the “-s” attached to the end like “RBIs”).

PLUTOED (2006): History hasn’t been kind to the 2006 selection. When the International Astronomical Union took away Pluto’s planetary status, it was such big news that “pluto” itself briefly became a verb — getting “plutoed” meant getting demoted or devalued as Pluto was. But the word quickly faded away, making this the most forgettable WOTY choice since 1990’s “bushlips” (a word for insincere political rhetoric, based on George H.W. Bush’s broken promise, “Read my lips, no new taxes”).

BAILOUT (2008): “Bailout” wasn’t exactly a new word in 2008 — it’s been used in the financial sense since the 1930s. But it was the prohibitive frontrunner in the WOTY race, since government bailouts were all the rage in the final months of the year, as we came to grips with the Great Recession. It beat out terms that had come to prominence in the ‘08 presidential race, like “maverick,” “lipstick on a pig,” and “hockey mom.”

APP (2010): The choice of “app” (short for “application”) reflected tech trends of the day, particularly Apple’s rollout of the App Store with the memorable slogan, “There’s an app for that.” Apple, in fact, tried to trademark the phrase “app store” after Microsoft, Amazon, and Google launched their own equivalents. A few days after the WOTY vote, the ADS press release about “app” was even quoted by Microsoft in its legal proceedings against Apple!

SINGULAR THEY (2015): The ADS picked a pronoun for the 2015 WOTY, but not just any pronoun. The selection of “they” as a gender-neutral third-person singular pronoun was a long time coming — singular “they” has been in use for centuries by everyone from Chaucer to Shakespeare to Jane Austen. But in 2015 it gained momentum, thanks to recognition by style books and its growing popularity among those seeking a pronoun that could transcend the gender binary of “he” and “she.”

DUMPSTER FIRE (2016): First of all, yes, like “millennium bug” above, “dumpster fire” is technically two words. Word of the Year voting recognizes any lexical item — something that could serve as an entry in a dictionary, or, indeed, a crossword. People gripe about this every time a phrase gets WOTY recognition. It happened all over again last week when Collins Dictionary announced “fake news” as its choice for 2017. “Dumpster fire” was a popular way to describe the mess that was 2016, or particular messes like the presidential election or the Brexit vote. It looks like it has legs for 2017, too: Pawel Fludzinki was the first to memorialize it in a Times crossword back in March.

The ADS will be gathering to anoint a new Word of the Year on Jan. 5, 2018 at our annual meeting, held this time at the Grand America Hotel in Salt Lake City (in conjunction with the Linguistic Society of America). The WOTY vote is open to all, so you’re welcome to join us — or if you can’t make it, feel free to submit your nominations by email to woty@americandialect.org or on Twitter to @americandialect.

Tricky Clues

34A: The start of the season, other than the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade, is TIS, as is “Tis the season.”

26D: “April Fools sign?” is not looking for sign of a prank, but of the astrological sign for April 1. That would be ARIES.

Constructor Notes

This puzzle came about as a result of a minor philosophical crisis. I’d read a blog post where the author was complaining about a puzzle that he felt “lacked fresh fill.” This complaint surprised me, because I’d personally found the puzzle in question to be quite lively. It got me wondering: what do we mean when we talk about “fresh fill”? What separates perfectly O.K., workhorse words from gnarly crosswordese? Can clever cluing turn a stale word fresh? And when does a word go from “fresh” to faddish, twee, or just plain annoying? I soon began to doubt everything I knew about cruciverbalism and, indeed, language itself. Around the same time, I read on Language Log (a blog run by an international supergroup of academic linguists) that the American Dialect Society had recently announced “DUMPSTER FIRE” as their 2016 Word of the Year. It struck me that if there were one word everyone could agree on as “fresh,” surely it’d be the A.D.S. Word of the Year. So I made a puzzle based on that idea. My initial plan was to seed the past several years’ winners anywhere I could fit them into a grid. But when I looked at the WotY list, I realized the word lengths might allow for symmetric placement. Luckily, I was able to pull it off. I’m super-duper thrilled for this to be my debut puzzle in The Times. Thanks to my friends and family (especially Cliff, Nick, and the Daves Madden and Sheppard) for their support and feedback. Thanks also to Mr. Shortz for actually accepting this thing, and editing the clues to be better and more consistent overall. My only regret is that UHF is no longer clued as “1989 ‘Weird Al’ film set at a low-budget TV station.”

Maybe this will make you feel better, Mr. Poulos. If nothing else, it will bring back the 1980s for you in a big way:

On Stephen Shore, and Looking for America

Later this month, the 70-year-old photographer Stephen Shore will have his most comprehensive retrospective yet at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. On view will be hundreds of Shore’s photographs, from his early black-and-whites taken when he was a teenager, around the time he sold his first photos to MoMA’s then-photography-director Edward Steichen, to his cross-country color photographs collected in the 1982 book “ Uncommon Places. ” In his obsessive and restless chronicling of the ordinary and mundane, Shore has single-handedly created a visual vocabulary that defines the iconography of America — beautiful, haunting images that evoke more than just a time and a place, but lives lived, desires lost and dreams unfulfilled. We selected four quintessentially American writers to create short fictions based on four of Shore’s most iconic photographs, all of which will appear in the show — and another author, Annie Proulx, to discuss an image of Shore’s that made a lasting impression on her.

Wild Beauty

Inspired by “U. S. 97, South of Klamath Falls, Oregon, July 21, 1973” (1973)

By Annie Proulx

Shore’s “Klamath Falls” photograph brims with information and disturbance. There, in high desert rangeland fringed with invasive mullein, a billboard stands with Shorean centrality. The powerful image of an incongruous snowy mountain drains all the juice out of the local greasewood. Because this is a weighted photograph within a photograph, the discordant image enclosed versus the dominant image enclosing, it is disorienting and intensely memorable.

The iconic mountain image represents natural beauty at its most sublime, according to aesthetic tastes of the period. Even the real clouds above the billboard — stratocumulus and rayed-out cirrus — emphasize the idyllic Sierra Club-type scene. We look again at the billboard and notice that some words across the illustrated sky (perhaps spoiling pictorial serenity with a command to “See America First”) have been painted out in nonmatching blue by an unknown but careful hand.

In the early 1970s there was a growing sense that we were losing the natural beauty of America to blind-eyed and greedy commercial interests. Approach roads into cities were often a hideous jam-up of unregulated and uncountable billboards almost layered upon each other. The rural roadways were not exempt, and many regional sites of exceptional beauty were framed with hectoring billboardia. Some states, including Maine and Vermont, recognized that billboards marred their identification as places of iconic regional character and passed legislation forbidding the big signs. Angry citizens, too, got fired up — often women, they were referred to by advertisers as the “scenic sisters” — and ardent groups such as the Billboard Bandits of Michigan denounced or destroyed billboards. The structures were built at the time with wooden support posts, and the Bandits, armed with chain saws, took down dozens of roadside advertising signs. When the billboard companies switched to steel posts, the saws were mute. The New York architect Peter Blake’s “ God’s Own Junkyard ,” published in 1964, appalled readers with its illustrations of crass examples of uglification. But the billboard in this photograph was likely in no danger of chain-saw attack, because to the unknowing eye the image was more lovely than the weedy, arid background.

Many still believed in 1973 that single photographs told stories. But Shore’s photograph tells no story; instead it provokes unanswerable questions. What did those painted-out words really say and who obliterated them and why? One of Oregon’s most photographed landscape features is Mount Hood. Does the billboard show Mount Hood with Trillium Lake in the foreground? Or is it some other mountain? The viewer’s eye searches the photograph beyond the billboard for clues. In the distance, ranch buildings are visible. We look at the fence. It is unusually strong and well built, seven strands of barbed wire and massive 8-by-8 posts. Such a strong fence indicates that the animals on this range are probably American bison. We can conjecture that the rancher is proud of his fence, proud of running bison instead of cows, and likely proud to have his own private Cascadian stratovolcanic mountain. But how wonderfully American it would be to have the real Mount Hood, not 250 miles to the north, but right behind the billboard — a triumph of the simulacrum.

Proulx’s most recent novel, “ Barkskins ” (Scribner), was published in 2016.

The girl wants a new pair of sunglasses. She knows how to get them. She tells him her plan. He will enter the shop ahead of her. They will pretend to be strangers. It’s all part of the plan. While the shop clerk trails him, scowling, the girl will do the stealing. She says, smiling slightly, You look like trouble.

He is an actor. He’s been a thug in a prison drama, a nameless friend on “Good Times.” Tomorrow he is up for a part in a slavery-era mini-series. Every actor he knows is going to be there, wearing his most downtrodden face. It’s the chance of a lifetime.

Inside the store, he sifts through a rack of clothes, pulls out a shirt, holds it up, pretends to admire its silky pattern. The sales clerk watches from a few feet away.

The girl has entered the shop. She is standing by the sunglasses, unobserved. She looks somewhere between Marcia Brady and a Manson girl. He goes into a dressing room and tries on the shirt. By the time he comes out, she is already gone.

Outside on La Brea the light has shifted. Whoever said there were no seasons here was wrong. He can smell the beginning of summer. He searches the street for the girl, walks up past the Chevron station, to the block where they parked the car. She’s there, in the passenger’s seat, wearing the stolen sunglasses.

When he was a kid, 6 years old, his father drove him to New York for a weekend visit. He has never forgotten his first sight of that city, the way it rose up before him, a heap of glory and trash.

He tries now to remember the first time he saw Los Angeles. He remembers the bus ride, the dirt on the glass, the gum wrappers at his feet, but he cannot remember arriving, his first glimpse of this place. It sneaked up on him, a thing he didn’t notice until he was already inside it, or it was inside of him, a clutter of road signs and candy-colored cars.

He gets in beside her. She says she’s hungry, can they go to Pink’s. He starts up the engine, thinking about tomorrow, the audition. It’s a million to one, the chance they will pick him as a slave.

DON McLEAN ON FM radio, windows rolled all the way down. In an old car in a new country. Midday’s brutal, blue.

He kills the engine, gets out for some air. Opens the door and the potential energy of the fight quickly dissipates, carried away from them along with their voices, words spoken a minute ago propagating waveforms of fear, of love, tumbling down into the canyon, the historical event of their first argument now traveling outward in all directions to the ends of the universe, sounds they made halving themselves again and again, until somewhere, hundreds of feet below, they break against the rocks in a wash of ambient vibration.

He walks to the guardrail, peers over the edge. Wonders if she’s worried he might do something dumb. On cue, her door opens now. She steps out and quietly finds a place beside him.

The guy in line was a jerk.

Little late for that.

I’m sorry. I was … afraid he’d hit you.

You married a man with a chip on his shoulder.

I married a good man.

I have to be smarter than that. Back there. I can’t let them see my anger. They don’t like us here.

You’re just figuring that out now?

He unfolds the map, flattens it against the hood, fingers their route south by southeast, the thick straight line of the interstate branching off into thinner lanes, and then those breaking into medium or even small dots off the state roads. They are in the place between dots.

Where’d you go for your honeymoon? Oh, my husband took me nowhere. He laughs. She brings her hand to the back of his neck, squeezes gently, absorbing tension from him. She’ll do this countless times in the coming years. She’ll do it at the hospital, 53 years from now, her hand amid all of the tubes and beeping and machines, slipping along the pillow to cradle the back of his head, trying to give him a moment of comfort.

This is a long song — with each verse teasing them, the answers to the test, the key to a map of this new land. They’ll spend the next half-century trying to get back to this moment, the bridge and then the chorus lifting them up just high enough to get a glimpse of the terrain below. Seven years from now, he’ll play the song for his firstborn, a son who has his face, his small frame. Twenty-seven years from now, his son will listen to it on his own drive up the interstate, with a girlfriend born in a cow town a dozen exits back. Forty-five years from now, an old man, he’ll hear this song, for the thousandth time, and recognize in its undertones, a secret melody, that was hidden, that he should have heard all along.

They get back in the car. She kisses him, and he starts the engine.

Owning It

All the stuff that got broke was put in the front yard under the tarp. Technically there is no backyard but we call the space on the street the front yard all the same. It wasn’t garbage under there, it was just stuff that got broke and where was that supposed to go? It went under the tarp. My grandpa won’t take it to the dump. He says: “Why should I engage Rosie in such a hopeless enterprise?”

He calls his vehicle Rosie from a song — she ain’t exactly pretty ain’t exactly small da da da da da …

My mother would plant a garden if the stuff was gone. Tomatoes, squash, corn, maybe pretty flowers too. Maybe even roses. The tarp would be removed and the yard would be wondrous.

“Where you going to put the tarp then?” my grandpa says. “There’d be no place to put it when it’s unnecessary.”

Whenever my mother brings up the garden that she still manages to describe quite beautifully, the logic of the tarp always manages to confound her. The tarp’s been there as long as I can remember and it’s a strong one, tied down good. When the wind and dust storms rip through here the tarp does not succumb. It has never succumbed. After a storm, the first thing we do is see if the tarp has held and it always has. My mother wraps our little flag in a plastic bag so it won’t get shorn by the wind but it gets shorn regardless. They are putting off buying a new one.

“I think there are snakes under the tarp,” I say.

“They don’t come to me or nothing though.”

“There better not be,” my mother says.

“Sometimes there are,” I say.

“They sure better not be,” she says.

The snakes are smart. They know the road’s no home for them.

The land outside the town always looks empty and it is. It’s not that I’m just not seeing something that’s there. My mother worries about my imagination. She believes I should have one and worries that I don’t.

“An imagination tides you children over until you’re grown,” she says. “It gets you through the day.”

“I don’t need a babysitter,” I say.

“Of course not,” she says. “I’m talking about imagination, more of a friend.”

But my mind feels webby and hard.

Even grandpa and Rosie don’t bother going into that barren land anymore.

“Was there something out there once?” I ask.

Oh yes, she says. So many lovely things.

Past Midnight

Inspired by “1:35 a.m., in Chinatown Restaurant, New York, New York” (1965-67)

By Yiyun Li

I MET THE WOMAN at a noodle shop on Mulberry Street, between a hostel and a funeral home. Outside a procession of men and women in black passed by. An old man had died — I could tell from the banners in Chinese.

A friend’s friend had asked if I could meet the woman, who was dying of cancer and wanted someone to hear her story. I didn’t say no because I didn’t know how. This was not the first time I’d done this. It didn’t make me a sympathetic person. Nor a good person. But a nice person, yes, I was certain of that. The world is not often nice to people, dying or not dying.

The woman told her life backward. Cancer, divorce, a lost cat, a childless marriage, working after school at the takeout her father had managed until he bought it from the owner, and her mother, who had walked out when the woman had been 6 months old and had never been seen again. Our time was limited so she skipped the inessential.

Some relatives thought my mother killed herself, the woman said. Others thought she’d eloped with a man. I’d always believed that she’d died until I saw this.

I studied the picture she showed me, terrified for those innocent bystanders, frozen by one artist’s attention toward another artist. I wasn’t an Andy Warhol fan and I wasn’t sure the woman even knew who he was. She found it on a website that collected images of Chinatown, she explained. She’d grown up in Chinatown.

She pointed to the edge of the photograph. Look, when I saw this I searched my father’s old album. He had a picture of my mother in that exact coat and hat. 1965. She was four months pregnant with me.

I tried not to sigh. Imagination, I wanted to say, is a rubber duck. A dime a piece. Anyone can afford it.

You don’t believe me? the woman asked.

Her mother bought the hat at a consignment shop prior to her affair. She had nothing to hide then, but she liked to envision her shadowed face — so much to withhold from the world. The man with her regretted the decision to have a late dinner before leaving town, when an intruder with a camera turned their favorite eatery against them, and him against her. Their love is written on a banner now, like a dead man’s name. Nothing good happens after midnight. And nothing good ever happens to a man like him, who has stolen another man’s wife and already has stopped desiring her.

I could go on telling their stories until death or fate parted them.

You don’t believe me, the woman said again, this time with a terrifying force. You’ve read more books than I do, and I want you to tell me. If my mother is only an absence, why can’t any woman in any restaurant be her? Where else can I find her in the world?

Li’s first memoir, “ Dear Friend, From My Life I Write to You in Your Life ” (Random House), was published this February.

“I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay.
In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.
The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat.
“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said.","It seems fitting that during Walker Evans’s one-month stay in Havana in 1933 he would befriend Ernest Hemingway. The two shared an appreciation of a spare style that would influence countless others in photography and literature. In fact, Evans entrusted Hemingway with a trove of original prints to ensure they would not be confiscated by the authorities who were violently suppressing popular outrage against the dictator Gerardo Machado.

Now, 46 of those vintage prints are being sold by DeWolfe and Wood Rare Books of Alfred, Me., and Michael Brown Rare Books of Philadelphia, and are featured in a catalog whose comprehensive introductory essay was written by Mr. Brown. The collection is owned by Benjamin Bruce, known as Dink. His father, Telly Otto Bruce, known as Toby, was Hemingway’s friend and factotum and had safeguarded the images for decades in Key West, Fla., where Hemingway had lived.

Evans had gone to Cuba to make pictures for “The Crime of Cuba,” a book by Carleton Beals that was a fierce critique of American adventurism. “The Beals book is an expose of our misgovernment in Cuba, and the disgraceful part we have played in her tragic history past and present, economic, social, political,” read the review in Kirkus. “Sins of omission perhaps even more than sins of commission. The story of Cuba is the story of tyranny-Spain, the United States, Wall Street, and now, closely linked with the immediate past, the dictatorship of Machado, which makes Mussolini look like a Sunday School picnic.”

Evans got a taste of that supercharged political climate in his earliest days there, according to Mr. Brown’s essay, where a bus ride could turn into a journey of intrigue as who-knows-who was tailing him as he tried to meet with opposition figures. At the same time, the city thrilled him.

“When you are still bewildered,” Evans wrote in his diary, “you notice more things, as in a drunk. I was drunk with a new city for days.”

That feeling became literal when he met Hemingway, likely through an introduction by one of Beals’s newspaper contacts on the island. “I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay. “Drinking every night. He was at loose ends … and he needed a drinking companion, and I filled that role for two weeks.”

Photo

But as the essay also noted, Hemingway’s prose style may have had an influence on Evans, whose vision had been influenced earlier by a stay in Paris, where he came to appreciate the work of Eugène Atget. The images — out of a total of 400 taken during his one-month sojourn, betray that influence in photos of facades and streets. Some of them show more isolated, intimate scenes in public, from a haggard looking country family to beggars. In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.

The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat. Once there, the images ended up in storage either behind, or next to, Sloppy Joe’s, the famous Key West saloon.

“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said. “What is fascinating is I think Evans was printing these where he was able to. Unlike later prints, most of these are uncropped, and slightly different. One print has Evans’s thumbprint. It’s as close to a first generation print you could possibly find.”

It was as if someone aimed a fire hose at everything inside, and left it running for hours, she said; two weeks later, Maria turned the hose on again.

They have replaced or boarded over the openings, but the walls inside are “still wet to the touch,” she said. “The bathroom roof is falling apart. There’s a lot of mold, greenish and bluish, coming out of the walls.”

Nearly everything they owned was ruined. An outer wall of their apartment, in a building in the Tutu High Rise Community, shifted in one of the storms, so the rooms flood anew with each rainfall. Their only way to cook was on a campfire, and with no refrigeration, they had to be careful to buy only as much food as they could prepare and eat each day. Across the islands, mosquitoes and flies proliferate in the standing water and rotting garbage, and like many people, Ms. Mahoney, unable to close her home to the elements, worries about a disease outbreak.

Now, she has an added worry, an infant to care for — Trinity Luisa Mathurin, born in a hospital on Oct. 19.

The baby’s arrival helped convince the parents that they had to move, Ms. Mahoney said, “because it’s not sanitary.”

But she is acutely aware that others are less fortunate. She and Mr. Mathurin have been sheltering neighbors whose apartment lost entire walls, so that their furniture literally blew away.

With many homes destroyed, their family is not high on the list to get a more intact unit in the Tutu complex, a public housing project — but that is as it should be, Ms. Mahoney said. The storms left their 2011 Toyota Yaris with shattered windows and soaked upholstery, but to her surprise, it runs.

She used to work at a hotel, but the storms put it out of business. After a few weeks, roads were cleared and some cell service returned, so her husband, a painter, was able to reach his boss and return to work on repair projects.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Solvers are naturally curious when entries appear frequently or on the same day in different puzzles. Do constructors and editors really get together in secret, Oreo-fueled meetings to compare notes? Are repetitions committed deliberately, to send messages to puzzle solvers?

The answer is no, there aren’t enough Oreos in the world to make them do that. Any commonalities between puzzles, be they entries like OWIE or even an entire theme, are purely coincidental.

I bring this up because Damon Gulczynski, the constructor of today’s puzzle, explains in his notes below that a theme very similar to his own ran in The Wall Street Journal recently, and the truth is, these things happen all the time. It’s not because of laziness on the part of the constructor. More than one person can have the same great idea, and because editors work at different companies and don’t consult each other, sometimes identical entries or themes run close together.

Today’s puzzle by Mr. Gulczynski is a fresh, three dimensional take on an interesting topic.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.
The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said.
Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq.
“One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.","A serpentine river gently cuts through a mountain plateau. Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Photo

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Photo

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

That’s not always true, and sanctimonious hypocrites inhabit the left as well as the right: Harvey Weinstein participated in a “women’s march.” But we’re at a watershed moment in the aftermath of the Weinstein case, trying to end impunity for sexual assault, and allegations against our leaders are even more serious than those against our entertainers.

The Alabama state auditor, a Republican named Jim Ziegler, defended Moore as “clean as a hound’s tooth” and offered a bizarre defense of child abuse: He asserted that the Virgin Mary was a teenager when Joseph married her (in fact, the Bible does not indicate her age), adding: “They became parents of Jesus.”

Sigh. When Christians cite the Bible to defend child molestation, Jesus should sue for defamation.

Meanwhile, an Alabama Republican legislator, Ed Henry, went even further: He said that the women accusing Moore should be prosecuted for waiting to make their allegations.

Looking back, some of the grossest immorality of the late 20th century had nothing to do with gay bath houses, as preachers sometimes suggested, but rather with the blowhard televangelists who suggested that AIDS was God’s punishment of gay men. This smirking moralizing slowed the response to AIDS and arguably resulted in millions dying unnecessarily all over the world.

In my columns, I’ve repeatedly defended evangelical Christians, and protested that they are one of the few groups that it’s socially acceptable for liberals to mock, stereotype and discriminate against. Some liberals still haven’t forgiven me for my “Hug an Evangelical” column 13 years ago. But I find it infuriating to see some evangelicals now downplaying child molestation or our president’s boasts of sexual assault.

We all make compromises — I supported Bill Clinton in 1992 over George H.W. Bush, whom I thought was personally more moral — but that doesn’t require downplaying the inexcusable. I used to complain that conservatives believe that morality is about only personal behavior, while liberals believe it is only about policy positions, while actually it’s about both. Sadly, some of the “family values” conservatives now don’t seem to care about either private or public morality.

If evangelical Christians want to engage in activism, they needn’t support hypocrites and bigots; they can support lifesaving organizations like World Vision or African Mission Healthcare Foundation, or fight human trafficking by supporting International Justice Mission, or reduce abortions by backing the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.

As it happened, just before the revelations about Moore became public, I visited leaders of an inspiring tri-faith project in Omaha, where a church, a synagogue and a mosque are partnering on a shared site to build empathy and understanding. I asked the pastor involved, Rev. Eric Elnes, for his reaction to Moore.

“Blazing with self-righteous indignation toward others is often what people use to hide their own sins in the shadows,” Elnes said. “This is probably why Jesus’ biggest problem — by far — was with the self-righteous. When it came to those whom society cast away as ‘sinners,’ Jesus was repeatedly gentle, gracious, encouraging, and forgiving, but he continually castigated the self-righteous.”

Elnes added: “I’ve never understood why certain Christians are so eager to turn the United States into a Christian country when their time would be so much better spent turning their churches into Christian churches.”

Baltimore County Public Schools has pursued one of the most ambitious classroom technology makeovers in the United States. Now, some of its relationships with technology vendors are coming under intensified scrutiny.

A Maryland state legislator said Thursday that the state needed to investigate whether industry perks played a role in the awarding of the district’s technology contracts. The lawmaker, Senator James Brochin, called on the Maryland State Board of Education to conduct an audit of the contracts.

In 2014, the district committed $205 million for laptops for students and staff, and millions more since for math and language software. The audit would cover the device contract, which was awarded to a vendor whose laptop came in third place in the district’s hardware evaluations.

Last week, an article in The New York Times examined Baltimore County, the nation’s 25th-largest public school district, as a case study in how tech companies court and cultivate school leaders. The Baltimore Sun has recently written about the former district superintendent’s travels to out-of-state events.

The Times found that tech vendors or industry-funded groups paid for meals and rooms at fancy hotels for school leaders, as well as travel to conferences to promote the district’s tech initiative. And in February, the district’s former superintendent participated in confidential meetings with school tech vendors — companies whose contracts were later increased.

“Evidence offered in the recent articles indicates digital education companies having unrestricted access to key decision makers in Baltimore County Public Schools and, in turn, the awarding of contracts to those companies,” Senator Brochin, a Baltimore County Democrat, said in a letter sent to state officials. “This has created the illusion of impropriety, thereby eroding public trust.”",Legislator Targets Tech Perks in Baltimore County District,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/technology/legislator-targets-tech-perks-in-baltimore-county-district.html

His talk echoed his statements in China earlier this week that blamed weak American leadership for trade imbalances that he said had stripped jobs, factories and entire industries from the United States.

“What we will no longer do is enter into large agreements that tie our hands, surrender our sovereignty and make meaningful enforcement practically impossible,” Mr. Trump said.

He also spoke witheringly about an approach he said had led the United States to lower its own trade barriers, only to have other countries refuse to do so, and he accused the World Trade Organization of treating the United States unfairly.

Many of the president’s toughest lines — his vow to fight the “audacious theft” of intellectual property from American companies and the forced transfer of technology to foreign firms — were aimed at China.

But Mr. Trump avoided criticizing Mr. Xi personally. And he repeated his contention that he did not blame China, or any other country, for taking advantage of what he called weak American trade laws.

“If their representatives are able to get away with it, they are just doing their jobs,” the president said. “I wish previous administrations in my country saw what was happening and did something about it. They did not, but I will.”

White House officials had framed Mr. Trump’s speech as a chance to articulate the idea of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” region, which the Trump administration has adopted as its answer to former President Barack Obama’s pivot to Asia. First proposed by the Japanese, it envisions the United States strengthening ties with three other democracies in the region — Australia, India and Japan — in part to counter a rising China. But the president offered few details about that approach.

He spoke of the need for freedom of navigation — a reference to the South China Sea, which Vietnam, Malaysia and other countries complain Beijing is turning into a private waterway. But the president stopped short of calling out China by name.

He also did not fault China or his host, Vietnam, for their checkered human rights records, even as he offered a general endorsement of the rule of law and individual rights.

As in his speech to the United Nations in September, Mr. Trump emphasized the idea of sovereignty, a concept that is often seen as being at odds with global cooperation and that is sometimes used by countries to fend off interference by outside powers.

He closed the speech with an inward-looking paean to the virtues of home, declaring, “In all of the world, there is no place like home,” adding that nations should “protect your home, defend your home, and love your home today and for all time.”

Mr. Xi, in contrast, argued for pursuing the kinds of global initiatives that Mr. Trump had shunned. The Chinese leader touted the Paris climate accord, called globalization an “irreversible historical trend” and said China would continue to pursue a free trade area in the Asia-Pacific region.

American and Russian officials had been working to arrange a meeting between President Vladimir V. Putin and Mr. Trump on the sidelines of the meeting, in part to ask for Moscow’s assistance in countering the threat from North Korea. But as Mr. Trump arrived in Danang, the White House announced that he would not hold formal talks with Mr. Putin.

Officials cited scheduling issues as the reason the two leaders would not meet. But on Thursday, Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, had said that a conversation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin was “still under consideration,” and that a final decision would hinge on whether there was “sufficient substance” to warrant face-to-face talks.

Mr. Trump’s last encounter with Mr. Putin — on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany — posed political challenges for the White House, which faced questions about whether and how sharply Mr. Trump would rebuke his Russian counterpart for meddling in the 2016 elections.

Mr. Trump was later criticized for not having pressed Mr. Putin more strongly in an hourslong meeting on the election interference, and for revelations that the two had a second, undisclosed discussion at a leaders’ dinner that night. Diplomats described being stunned to see the two presidents chatting intimately with only a Kremlin interpreter present.

The optics of a meeting this week would have been particularly tricky, given new revelations about the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russians, brought to light by the investigations into Moscow’s efforts to sway the American election in Mr. Trump’s favor.

The two presidents did end up shaking hands and exchanging greetings before posing for a photograph at the APEC gala dinner Friday evening.

Still, the change in plans appeared to have left the Kremlin exasperated. Asked about the absence of a meeting, Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, told a Russian TV reporter: “Ask the Americans. We are not speaking on this matter at all.”

Mr. Lavrov noted that Mr. Trump himself had said last week that he would most likely meet with Mr. Putin during his trip to Asia. But, Mr. Lavrov added, “I don’t know what his bureaucrats are saying.”",Trump Pitches ‘America First’ Trade Policy at Asia-Pacific Gathering,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/world/asia/trump-apec-asia-trade.html

“You’ll never believe who my Uber driver was!” I said.","The divorce shattered me. My husband and I had met near the end of college and shared a huge circle of friends. I was attracted to his fancy suburban background, a step up from my scrappier family where I was the first to graduate from college. We lived in Hong Kong, saw Angkor Wat and Easter Island.

At first, our opposite natures felt complementary — my curiosity, his need for the familiar. The biggest difference, or so we thought, was that I wanted children and he didn’t. And if we weren’t going to have them, I wanted more of everything else: spontaneity and adventure. Yet he was ready to settle down. In suburbia, no less.

We started unraveling. If we’d had children, we would have had a reason to fight for the marriage. At the time, I said the child issue was our undoing, but we knew it was more than that. We couldn’t make it past 10 years, when initial attraction often starts sliding into other kinds of marital love. And we both had turned to others for emotional support.

Time really is the only thing that heals a wound like divorce. I can’t remember when I stopped thinking about my ex every day, but I realized — as my Uber driver wound his way through traffic toward me — that it had been ages since that whole mess had ruled my life. I can conjure up my ex’s face but not his smell or his voice. I don’t recall what it felt like to wake up next to his body.

Over the past 12 years, I had barely thought of the guy whose face was now on my phone. He had emailed me after we each separated, looking for commiseration or help in his divorce case. I was too consumed by my own pain to reply.

When his car pulled up, I saw a big, familiar smile through the windshield. He sprang out and said, “I had a feeling it was you!”

After a long embrace, we got into the car, with me in the passenger seat instead of the back. It was oddly comfortable sitting next to him. He canceled the ride share passenger and we went to a cafe, where we sat for nearly two hours, chattering.

We whipped out our phones to share photos. Weddings. Homes. Trips. A new wife and gaggle of stepchildren for him. A new husband and French bulldog for me. Full, happy lives. Or at least that’s what the photos suggested.

It made me wonder what photos from our previous marriages would have suggested about those lives. Did we feel as contented then as we both appeared to feel now? Would others have been able to see something shattering behind the smiles?

And that’s when we turned to a subject that once cut deeply for us both, though I can’t remember who asked first: Had our exes been physically involved before our splits? He didn’t know, and neither did I, though we didn’t think they had, at least not “technically.”

Most startling, though, was how it no longer mattered — to either of us. That once-scalding question had lost its potency. But it took seeing him and talking about it to make me realize that.

We quickly moved on. He knew my mother and best friend and wanted updates. I was thrilled to hear that his children were now promising young adults, details I could have gotten through my ex had I ever thought to ask in the occasional emails we trade. Boys who would remember me as their stepfather’s ex-wife.

“He’s been a standup guy as a stepfather,” my Uber driver said.

I assumed he was, even though it caused me terrible pain that he hadn’t wanted children in our marriage.

“They were meant for each other,” we said nearly in unison, before rattling off the quirks that made them compatible and agreeing that we are all better off in our new couplings.

I have been with my new love for 12 years, almost exactly as long as I had been with my ex. Two years ago we traveled to Italy. As we packed, I couldn’t help remembering another trip to Italy in my previous life, a trip for a 10th anniversary that marked the beginning of the end. On our first night in Positano, I lost my footing on the cobblestone streets and knew I had broken something.

A local doctor confirmed it and gave me a shot of something alcoholic. The next day we flew home, cutting our trip short. The marriage never felt the same. That foot never felt the same either. Until recently, when I noticed my toes don’t feel numb anymore.

When I met the man who is now my husband, I was 39 and he was 46; our window for having children was nearly closed. I knew he didn’t want them, yet I couldn’t pull away. I started to admit that maybe there was a reason I chose men who were skittish about fatherhood. It was easy to assign the decision to someone else.

I still mourn that loss, but increasingly I’m at peace with it. Rather than going deep into a few key relationships, I have an ever-expanding collection of people in my life — extended family, younger friends, mentors of all ages. I have gratifying work, volunteering and time to read, travel, learn. None of this came out in the wave of photos, but looking at them made me see it.

My Uber driver, whose tie to me still yearns for a name — perhaps my ex-once-removed? — wanted to make sure I didn’t miss my flight. So we returned to the car and headed to the airport, where we hugged again and promised to keep in touch.

I immediately called my husband. We rarely talk when I travel, preferring to text and email. I come home to flowers and some little surprise near the mail. If I have taken a red-eye, I jump into bed with the man and pooch I have gotten a real chance to miss.

This time I couldn’t hold it in. “You’ll never believe who my Uber driver was!” I said. And then I spilled the whole story. We were on so long, I nearly missed my flight.

My husband was rapt, wanting every detail, even though he would see me in a few hours. And I was glad because, for years, he hadn’t wanted to hear about my first marriage, studiously avoiding the subject. But this had changed for him too, now that it was so far away.

“That could have been a scene in a movie,” he said.

In the movie version, though, I would have had a fling with the ex-once-removed. In real life, I got closure from the most unexpected source. I realized that connections at a distance, along with the passage of time, can offer telling reflections and a reminder that marriages can unravel in an instant. How could I ensure this new life wouldn’t break apart the way my last one had?

Months later, to protest Uber’s business practices, I deleted the app, but with a twinge of regret. In a strange way, Uber had helped me sort out my feelings about the most significant men in my life and moved my current relationship into a more honest place. Who knew there was an app for that?",When Your Uber Driver Brings a Time Machine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/style/modern-love-when-your-uber-driver-brings-a-time-machine.html

The president’s approval rating is stuck in the mid-to-high 30s. The Democrats hold nearly a double-digit lead on the generic congressional ballot. The president’s party nearly always struggles in midterm elections.

These conditions have been in place all year. They just haven’t yielded Democratic victories until now because the high-profile races have been fought in reliably Republican areas — districts that voted for either Mr. Trump or Mitt Romney by at least 15 points.

But Virginia voted for Hillary Clinton by five points in 2016, and it backed Barack Obama twice as well. New Jersey, Washington State’s 45th Senate district, New York’s Westchester and Nassau Counties and Maine are generally even more Democratic-leaning.

The big surprise of the night was the huge Democratic surge in Virginia’s House of Delegates, but that also came in Clinton Country. Of the 16 districts where Democrats currently lead in Virginia, Mrs. Clinton won 15 of them and received 49.7 percent of the vote in the other, according to data from the Virginia Public Access Project and Daily Kos Elections. Twelve of those 15 districts voted for Mrs. Clinton by at least five points.

Just because Tuesday’s victories came in states or districts won by Mrs. Clinton doesn’t mean they can be dismissed, however. College-educated white voters, paired with nonwhite voters, could profoundly endanger the G.O.P. in traditionally Republican, upscale districts.

Up until the polls closed in Virginia, it was reasonable to suppose that Mrs. Clinton’s performance represented something of a ceiling for Democrats in well-educated areas. It would be easy, the theory went, for Republican voters to distinguish their longtime Republican representatives from Mr. Trump. Jon Ossoff’s failure to outdo Mrs. Clinton in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District seemed fully consistent with that possibility.

But well-educated voters in Virginia didn’t appear to make any distinction between Mr. Trump and their incumbent representatives. Ed Gillespie, who was thought to have run a pretty strong campaign for governor against Ralph S. Northam, wound up running well behind Mr. Trump in many well-educated suburbs, a possibility that few imagined heading into the contest.

The catch, though, is that the overwhelming Democratic strength in well-educated areas did not cross the political divides of the 2016 election and reach into white working-class areas. In fact, Mr. Northam, a Virginia Military Institute graduate with a strong Southern pedigree, didn’t even come close to matching Gov. Terry McAuliffe, Mr. Obama or Senator Tim Kaine in rural western Virginia. Democratic State Assembly candidates didn’t run well ahead of Mrs. Clinton, either.

Yes, the political divisions of the 2016 presidential election wound up working pretty well for Democrats in Virginia, a highly educated state. But that might not be the case for Democrats in a lot of the rest of the country. There are only 11 Republican-held congressional districts in the United States where Mrs. Clinton won by five points or more. Even if Democrats swept those 11 districts, it wouldn’t get them that far toward the 24 seats they need to flip the House.

To my surprise, it’s not obvious that a rerun of the Virginia House of Delegates election on a national scale would yield Democratic control of the House. Without greater strength in areas that supported Mr. Trump, it would still be a tossup.

The good news for Democrats is that they did run well ahead of Mrs. Clinton in white working-class areas during this spring’s special congressional elections. And on Tuesday, Mr. Northam ran ahead of her in some of those areas, too, even if he landed short of prior Democratic benchmarks.

The big question in 2018 might prove to be whether Democrats can have it all: Will it be possible to combine a Virginia-like near sweep of Republicans in Clinton districts with a broad Democratic overperformance in white working-class districts? If they can do both, they will be favored to retake the House. One or the other would probably make the fight for House control a tossup. The fact that they’ve done both at various points this year might be an early clue.","Democrats Cheer, but They May Have to Do Better in ’18",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/upshot/the-other-virginia-elections-and-what-they-mean-for-2018.html

This relationship held even when he excluded the United States, indicating that it could not be explained by some other factor particular to his home country. And it held when he controlled for homicide rates, suggesting that mass shootings were better explained by a society’s access to guns than by its baseline level of violence.

Factors That Don’t Correlate

If mental health made the difference, then data would show that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other countries with fewer mass shootings. But the mental health care spending rate in the United States, the number of mental health professionals per capita and the rate of severe mental disorders are all in line with those of other wealthy countries.

A 2015 study estimated that only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to mental health issues. And Mr. Lankford, in an email, said countries with high suicide rates tended to have low rates of mass shootings — the opposite of what you would expect if mental health problems correlated with mass shootings.

Whether a population plays more or fewer video games also appears to have no impact. Americans are no more likely to play video games than people in any other developed country.

Racial diversity or other factors associated with social cohesion also show little correlation with gun deaths. Among European countries, there is little association between immigration or other diversity metrics and the rates of gun murders or mass shootings.

A Violent Country

America’s gun homicide rate was 33 per million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership.

Americans sometimes see this as an expression of deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley.

Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process.

They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns.

More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across virtually every axis: among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities and when controlling for crime rates. And gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders, according to a recent analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries.

This suggests that the guns themselves cause the violence.

Comparisons in Other Societies

Skeptics of gun control sometimes point to a 2016 study. From 2000 and 2014, it found, the United States death rate by mass shooting was 1.5 per one million people. The rate was 1.7 in Switzerland and 3.4 in Finland, suggesting American mass shootings were not actually so common.

But the same study found that the United States had 133 mass shootings. Finland had only two, which killed 18 people, and Switzerland had one, which killed 14. In short, isolated incidents. So while mass shootings can happen anywhere, they are only a matter of routine in the United States.

As with any crime, the underlying risk is impossible to fully erase. Any individual can snap or become entranced by a violent ideology. What is different is the likelihood that this will lead to mass murder.

In China, about a dozen seemingly random attacks on schoolchildren killed 25 people between 2010 and 2012. Most used knives; none used a gun.

By contrast, in this same window, the United States experienced five of its deadliest mass shootings, which killed 78 people. Scaled by population, the American attacks were 12 times as deadly.

Beyond the Statistics

In 2013, American gun-related deaths included 21,175 suicides, 11,208 homicides and 505 deaths caused by an accidental discharge. That same year in Japan, a country with one-third America’s population, guns were involved in only 13 deaths.

This means an American is about 300 times more likely to die by gun homicide or accident than a Japanese person. America’s gun ownership rate is 150 times as high as Japan’s. That gap between 150 and 300 shows that gun ownership statistics alone do not explain what makes America different.

The United States also has some of the weakest controls over who may buy a gun and what sorts of guns may be owned.

Switzerland has the second-highest gun ownership rate of any developed country, about half that of the United States. Its gun homicide rate in 2004 was 7.7 per million people — unusually high, in keeping with the relationship between gun ownership and murders, but still a fraction of the rate in the United States.

Swiss gun laws are more stringent, setting a higher bar for securing and keeping a license, for selling guns and for the types of guns that can be owned. Such laws reflect more than just tighter restrictions. They imply a different way of thinking about guns, as something that citizens must affirmatively earn the right to own.

The Difference Is Culture

The United States is one of only three countries, along with Mexico and Guatemala, that begin with the opposite assumption: that people have an inherent right to own guns.

The main reason American regulation of gun ownership is so weak may be the fact that the trade-offs are simply given a different weight in the United States than they are anywhere else.

After Britain had a mass shooting in 1987, the country instituted strict gun control laws. So did Australia after a 1996 shooting. But the United States has repeatedly faced the same calculus and determined that relatively unregulated gun ownership is worth the cost to society.

That choice, more than any statistic or regulation, is what most sets the United States apart.

“In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate,” Dan Hodges, a British journalist, wrote in a post on Twitter two years ago, referring to the 2012 attack that killed 20 young students at an elementary school in Connecticut. “Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.”",What Explains U.S. Mass Shootings?

All new comics need the same thing: huge amounts of stage time. There are no shortcuts in standup comedy. The quest to become a good comedian is brutal. It takes at least 10 years of performing, almost every night. You get that performing time in at open mics, where you have to line up during the day for a spot that night, at open mics that run until 1 or 2 a.m., at shows where you have to talk two, or 10, friends into coming just so that you can have a chance to perform.

Both male and female comics have to do these things. But if you also have to maneuver around a problematic guy, you’ll miss some opportunities. If you perform 10 times a week and your male counterpart performs 12 times a week, he will get better faster. And because you won’t get paid work until you’re good, your quest will take longer.

Often when I am part of a predominantly male lineup, I will watch the women in the crowd. After the third or fourth man in a row, some of them look tired. I see them thinking, “Another one?”

When a female comic takes the stage on such a night, there is often palpable joy from the women in the audience. For a few minutes, they don’t have to look at the world through male eyes. It’s a relief, an end to dude fatigue. I have never understood why male comics put up with all-male or mostly male lineups, why they aren’t demanding to follow a female comic. The audience will be so much more excited about you if you’re not the sixth man in a row.

In the terror-struck and vertiginous days after Donald Trump’s election a year ago, as I tried to make sense of America’s new reality, I called people who lived, or had lived, under authoritarianism to ask what to expect. I wasn’t looking for concrete predictions — one of the disorienting things about that moment was that no one, no matter how learned, had any idea what was happening — but for insights into how the texture of life changes when an autocratic demagogue is in charge.

A secular Turkish journalist told me, her voice sad and weary, that while people might at first pour into the streets to oppose Trump, eventually the protests would probably die out as a sense of stunned emergency gave way to the slog of sustained opposition. The Russian dissident writer Masha Gessen warned that there’s no way, with a leader who lays siege to the fabric of reality, to fully hold on to a sense of what’s normal. “You drift, and you get warped,” she told me.

They were both right. The country has changed in the past year, and many of us have grown numb after unrelenting shocks. What now passes for ordinary would have once been inconceivable. The government is under the control of an erratic racist who engages in nuclear brinkmanship on Twitter. He is dismantling the State Department, defending the hollowing out of the diplomatic corps by saying, on Fox News, “I’m the only one that matters.”

He publicly pressures the Justice Department to investigate his political opponents. He’s called for reporters to be jailed, and his administration demanded that a sportscaster who criticized him be fired. Official government statements promote his hotels. You can’t protest it all; you’d never do anything else. After the election, many liberals pledged not to “normalize” Trump. But one lesson of this year is that we don’t get to decide what normal looks like.

Last month Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, took an unannounced trip to Saudi Arabia, where he met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who later had a number of his rivals, including a Trump critic, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, put under arrest. In The Washington Post, David Ignatius described Kushner’s talks with Prince Mohammed this way: “The two princes are said to have stayed up until nearly 4 a.m. several nights, swapping stories and planning strategy.” A year ago, that sentence would have been unintelligible as a description of American diplomacy, even as a wry joke.

It was such a painful and shocking turn of events — the play came on fourth down with the Falcons (4-4) trailing by 10 points — that Kurt Coleman, a defensive back for the Panthers, walked over to console Jones. Such is life for Atlanta a year after a magical run to the Super Bowl ended with a brutal collapse. There is some intrigue in this game still, as neither team knows if Ezekiel Elliott will be allowed to play, but with the recent improvement the Cowboys (5-3) have shown on both sides of the ball, Dallas should be in line for a road win regardless of what happens in Thursday’s court hearing. Pick: Cowboys

Patriots at Broncos, 8:30 p.m., NBC

Line: Patriots by 7.5

Before anyone gets too excited about the Patriots (6-2) drastically cutting down the number of passing yards the team allowed in its last two games, it is worth noting that they gave up an average of 138.5 rushing yards a game in the two wins. New England’s defense might just not have that higher gear, but it is not as if the Broncos (3-5) and Brock Osweiler present much of a challenge. Add in C. J. Anderson working his way through an ankle injury and Denver does not seem to have the personnel to keep up with New England, no matter how bad the Patriots’ defense is. Pick: Patriots

Vikings at Redskins, 1 p.m., Fox

Line: Vikings by 1

The error margin for Case Keenum has been reduced to zero. If Keenum, a career backup, wants to remain at starting quarterback for the Vikings (6-2), he will need to keep winning. Teddy Bridgewater has been cleared to play, and unless his knee injury has turned him into an entirely different quarterback, he represents an enormous upgrade for Minnesota. With that in mind, the Redskins (4-4) could be a problem for Keenum because they are far more talented than their 4-4 record indicates. Their four losses have come against the Eagles (twice), the Chiefs (when that team looked unbeatable) and the Cowboys. Last week’s win over Seattle showed that they are resilient and that Kirk Cousins continues to be fearless. Taking too many chances against Minnesota’s secondary could be dangerous, but a Redskins win, and Bridgewater’s return to the field a week later, seem well within the realm of possibilities. Pick: Redskins

Saints at Bills, 1 p.m., Fox

Line: Saints by 2.5

The Saints (6-2) are a passing team that loves playing indoors, so a trip to Buffalo on a chilly Sunday afternoon should present an interesting test. A huge factor in how they fare, though, will come in which version of the Bills (5-3) shows up. Two weeks ago, Buffalo looked great and easily beat the Raiders, but last week, they were hardly competitive against the Jets, allowing 194 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns. It is that rushing success by the Jets that the Saints may want to pay attention to: In Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara, they have the running backs to exploit the same weakness. Another win would be seven in a row for New Orleans. More important, it would improve the team’s road record to 4-1. Pick: Saints

Steelers at Colts, 1 p.m., CBS

Line: Steelers by 10.5

The Steelers (6-2) have settled into a groove. Their defense shuts things down, keeping the score nice and low, and their offense, despite the presence of three of the N.F.L.’s biggest stars, does just enough to win. Whether it is the aging of Ben Roethlisberger, tension among players or their opponents adjusting to a unit that has been together for several seasons, they just don’t run up the score the way they used to. Going on the road against the Colts (3-6) does not present a true upset opportunity: The Steelers are extremely likely to win, but a spread of 10.5 points seems high considering Pittsburgh’s track record. Pick: Colts

Seahawks at Cardinals, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday), NBC

Line: Seahawks by 6

The Seahawks (5-3) are one game removed from a four-game winning streak, but the defense has taken a huge step back in the last few weeks: Both the Texans and the Redskins showed no fear in throwing directly into Seattle’s secondary. Injuries are a factor, with Earl Thomas out and Richard Sherman playing through injuries, but it is still shocking to see teams have so much success throwing the ball against them. Drew Stanton of the Cardinals (4-4) is not an aggressive passer like Deshaun Watson or Kirk Cousins, so the same level of exploitation should not be expected. Arizona will probably try to make up for that by running early and often with the veteran back Adrian Peterson, and while he has performed well since coming over from New Orleans, he may not find as much room to run this week. Thursday games are messy, but Seattle has had success in Arizona, and if it wants to avoid falling way behind the Rams in the N.F.C. West, this game needs to be something of a statement. Pick: Seahawks

Chargers at Jaguars, 1 p.m., CBS

Line: Jaguars by 4

The Jaguars (5-3) had a nearly perfect defense with one glaring flaw: It could not stop the run. A trade for Marcell Dareus, a run-stopping defensive tackle who was a known quantity to Coach Doug Marrone, may not deserve all the credit for last week’s effort (29 rushing yards allowed), but if he has whipped the unit into shape, Jacksonville will be hard to score upon.

The Chargers (3-5) are an interesting test for that theory, as Melvin Gordon, their star running back, is the type of player who would have torched the Jaguars in previous weeks. If Dareus stops him, then Jacksonville’s run of losing in even-numbered weeks of the season may finally end.

On offense, the Jaguars should get a nice boost from Leonard Fournette, who showed up to practice on time during the week, which will get him back on the field after he was held out for a violation of team rules. Pick: Jaguars

Browns at Lions, 1 p.m., CBS

Line: Lions by 12.5

The Lions (4-4) may not look like a playoff contender, with a .500 record and several frustrating losses, but they have been considerably better than their record, and last week’s win at Green Bay opened the door for them to go on a winning streak ahead of their Week 12 showdown with division-leading Minnesota. The Browns (0-8) are a speed bump on that path. Detroit will probably not cover the 12.5-point spread, but if it cares about its playoff hopes it will win the game. Pick: Browns

Jets at Buccaneers, 1 p.m., CBS

Line: Jets by 2.5

With Jameis Winston having been shut down for at least two weeks, the Buccaneers (2-6) will turn to Ryan Fitzpatrick at quarterback. It is a downgrade from Winston at full strength, but probably an upgrade from the way Winston had played since injuring his shoulder. Add the revenge factor of Fitzpatrick’s playing against the Jets (4-5), who discarded him a season after he set the franchise single-season record for passing touchdowns, and this could turn into a mild upset. Pick: Buccaneers

Packers at Bears, 1 p.m., Fox

Line: Bears by 5

The statistics for Mitchell Trubisky are not that much better than those for Brett Hundley, but the difference between them is that Trubisky, the rookie quarterback for the Bears (3-5), is trying to overcome his subpar wide receivers, while Hundley, a third-year backup for the Packers (4-4), has teammates on offense that made Green Bay a Super Bowl contender until Hundley replaced the injured Aaron Rodgers. Hundley’s lack of production has partially been a result of an ultraconservative game plan, but an opportunistic Bears defense may make him pay if he tries to be aggressive in his third career start. Pick: Bears

Bengals at Titans, 1 p.m., Fox

Line: Titans by 4.5

The Bengals (3-5) got a huge boost for this matchup when the N.F.L. chose not to suspend A. J. Green over his fight during a loss to Jacksonville last week. His presence gives Cincinnati enough offense to compete, and while the Titans (5-3) have won back-to-back games, they have put little distance between themselves and their lowly opponents (Baltimore and Cleveland). This will probably be another close game. Pick: Bengals

Giants at 49ers, 4:25 p.m., Fox

Line: Giants by 1

With how poorly the 49ers (0-9) have played in almost every facet of the game, having a reason for optimism is a welcome change. Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, acquired in a recent trade with New England, represents that optimism, but San Francisco has yet to make any commitment about when, or if, he will play. If the young and talent-deprived team insists on sticking with C. J. Beathard for another week, the Giants (1-7) are destined for their second win. Pick: Giants

Monday’s Matchup

Dolphins at Panthers, 8:30 p.m., ESPN

Line: Panthers by 9

For a second consecutive week, a prime-time audience will be forced to endure the atrocious offense of the Dolphins (4-4). It was supposed to be a breakout season for Miami, with quarterback Ryan Tannehill leading several star-level wide receivers and a young Pro Bowler at running back in Jay Ajayi. Instead, Tannehill is out for the season, Ajayi was traded to Philadelphia and the Dolphins’ wide receivers are left shuffling along for a team that often struggles to score in double digits. The Panthers (6-3) are inconsistent and frustrating, but their defense may look to prove a point by making this game a laugher. Pick: Panthers.",N.F.L.

At the request of the Trump administration, NASA examined the possibility of putting astronauts aboard the rocket’s first flight. But that would have further pushed back the launch date and added as much as $900 million to the program’s price tag. NASA and the administration decided to stick with the original plan.

A crewless flight also allows more thorough testing, closer to the edge of the capabilities of the Orion capsule, the separate spacecraft carried by the rocket where astronauts will eventually be seated.

Mr. Gerstenmaier told Congress that the additional delay for the first flight adds less than 15 percent to the cost of the rocket and slightly more than that for ground systems.

The delays have been caused in part by technological hiccups as well as factors out of NASA’s control, like a tornado striking the Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana, where parts of the rocket are being built, in February.

He said that NASA is still on track for the first flight with astronauts in 2023. The rocket could also be used in the early 2020s to propel a robotic probe to Jupiter to study Europa, a moon with a vast ocean under its icy crust that is thought to be one of the most promising places in the solar system to look for life.

Some said they planned to be a lot more careful in interacting with women because they felt that the line between friendliness and sexual harassment was too easy to cross. Others are struggling to reconcile how these behaviors could happen even among men who believe in equal rights.

Joel Milton, 30, an entrepreneur in Denver with Baker Technologies, a platform for cannabis dispensaries, said he had recently decided to be more careful about corporate offsites after hearing seeing the swell of #MeToo claims.

“When I hear someone on my team is having a pool party, now I’ll say, ‘Hey, maybe no managers should be there,’” Mr. Milton said, relaying the type of information likely to be covered in many companies’ employment manuals.

He added that harassment was not something he had thought much about before, but that he was considering his own behavior more. “Like, did I ever do anything?” he said.

Many companies have long mandated anti-harassment training to educate men and women about the issue. But in a report last year, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that much of that training was ineffective and that workplace harassment was widely underreported.

Jonathan Segal, a lawyer who was on the commission’s harassment task force, said he was now fielding odd questions from men about how to behave at work. At a fund-raiser last month in Palm Beach, Fla., some men asked him if it was permissible to hug a woman and where the boundaries should be drawn.

Mr. Segal said he had explained to the men that the context mattered and that pretending there was a gray zone between collegial friendliness and sexual assault was absurd. For instance, he told them, hugging an old friend is very different from going up behind a co-worker while she was at a desk typing.

“If someone can’t understand that, then maybe they just shouldn’t be hugging,” he said.

Mr. Segal, who runs anti-harassment training, is now expanding part of the program called Safe Mentoring, which teaches men how to mentor younger women without harassing them. At a recent session, a male supervisor talked about having an extra ticket to a sporting event and feeling he could invite only a male colleague; Mr. Segal went over how to invite a female colleague without sexually harassing her.

“The answer to harassment cannot be avoiding women,” he said.

Still, some workers said they were starting to follow “the Pence rule,” which was formerly known as the Billy Graham rule, after the evangelical preacher, but is now named for Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Pence has said he does not eat alone with women who are not his wife or attend an event without her if alcohol will be served.

A conservative writer, Sean Davis, wrote that a lot of men in media should have effectively been heeding the Pence rule all along. He said he had always followed it and that coastal, liberal America was finally waking up to how useful avoiding private meetings with women could be. The former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka also made this argument.

“What we’re seeing now is men are backing away from the role that we try to encourage them to play, which is actively mentoring and sponsoring women in the workplace,” said Al Harris, who has been running workplace equality programs and writing on the topic from Chicago with his partner, Andie Kramer, for many years. “There’s apprehension on the part of men that they’re going to be falsely accused of sexual harassment.”

Not everyone is practicing avoidance. Some men said the best route is to ask female co-workers directly if they feel harassed. Pat Lencioni, the founder of the Table Group in Lafayette, Calif., which does executive coaching for companies around issues like diversity, said he was doing just that and had asked the women at his office if they worried about harassment.

“I came into the office and said, ‘Hey, guys, I’ve got a question for you: This sexual harassment stuff, all these things, do you guys ever worry it’s going to happen here?’” Mr. Lencioni, 52, recalled. “And they were like: ‘No, because we know you. We know who you are.’”

He said he thought this approach could be adopted more broadly.

Other men said they had not talked about workplace harassment with anyone because they already knew what they needed to know. “This is a liberal town,” said Philip Rontell, a real estate agent in Walnut Creek, Calif., who added that he supported the #MeToo campaign. “We all already know this stuff.”

When men do want to talk about workplace harassment, some said, they don’t know where to go. “I just don’t know where those conversations are allowed to be had,” said Ryan Ellis, 33, a sales manager for an e-commerce company in Santa Monica, Calif.

Austin Gilbert, a recruiter in San Francisco for the company Gametime, said his industry had also had to deal with men talking in online chat rooms at work, which he said could “bury” and hide toxic comments. His company has closed several “high school in-group” type of exclusionary work chats over the years, but he worries about more.

“We have a policy of telling employees that we’re free to review all electronic communications,” Mr. Gilbert, 31, said. “But that’s typically not anyone’s job responsibility in a small company.”

With women empowered to call out inappropriate behavior, some companies predict that boozy after-work events for the holidays could be combustible this year. While many companies used to have the parties on Thursday or Friday evenings, some are moving them to late Monday or Tuesday afternoons, said Sarah Freedman, the vice president of operations for 23 Layers, an event planner in New York whose clients include Google and West Elm.

Open bars are being replaced with game zones. One client recently asked for an extremely watered-down “John Daly” to be the party’s signature drink, which Ms. Freeman found strange but probably wise.

After-work events are “the front line” when it comes to harassment, and companies want “more safety precautions” now, she said.","Men at Work Wonder if They Overstepped With Women, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/business/men-at-work-wonder-sexual-harassment.html

“Those seats are designed to make the best possible use of the space,” an American spokesman, Josh Freed, said.

“While it’s only 28 inches in pitch, it actually feels like it’s about 30 inches,” he said.
One group, Flyers Rights, is petitioning the Federal Aviation Administration to set minimum dimensions for airline seat width and pitch.","While low-cost airlines like Spirit have narrowed the distance between rows of seats to as little as 28 inches, most of the big American airlines have kept the distance — what’s known in the business as seat pitch — at 30 inches. Anything less, the major airlines have found, pushes already beleaguered travelers to their limits.

This year, the news leaked that American Airlines was considering a cabin redesign that would leave a few rows in its new Boeing 737 Max fleet with just 29 inches of pitch, plans the carrier quickly dropped after a rash of complaints.

“We got a lot of pushback from our customers and, most notably, from our team members,” the airline’s chief executive, Doug Parker, told investors on a conference call in July. “While we could convince ourselves that that might be able to produce somewhat higher revenues on the aircraft, what it was doing to our perception with our team wasn’t worth it.”

The push to shrink the space between rows of seats comes as major carriers are squeezing 10 abreast in more long-haul jets, so that the middle section has four seats — and, by definition, two middle seats — rather than three.

But customers will be spared this experience on most flights within the United States, Mr. Aboulafia said, because there just isn’t enough space. “The good news is that pretty much every domestic flight you’re going to take is going to be in a 737 or A320 — no way can you do four-three,” he said.

Traditional airline seats were fashioned out of rigid aluminum frames, then wrapped in thick foam padding. But that approach, said Alex Pozzi, vice president for research and development in interior systems for Rockwell Collins, a manufacturer of aircraft seats, is no longer used, with the availability of more sophisticated, high-tech materials.

“We’ve been using a lot of advanced materials, a lot of composite materials, to allow the actual physical structure to get smaller,” he said. “We’ve also removed a lot of the hard points in the seat and gone to fabric suspension systems,” leading, he said, to seats more akin to ergonomic desk chairs.

“The less size that the seat structure itself takes up, the more space that’s left over for the passenger,” Mr. Pozzi said.

Or, as the case may be, for more passengers. “Over the last five years, as slimline seats become more common and were adopted by more airlines, airlines took the opportunity to basically take the space they were saving and, depending on the airline, most of the airlines took that space and added in an extra row or two,” said Jami Counter, vice president of TripAdvisor Flights, which owns the site SeatGuru.com. “The actual pitch would shrink, but theoretically, your leg room wouldn’t.”

“Now,” he added, “you’re cramming another person in there so you still have more people in that exact same space. It becomes a much more unpleasant flying experience.”

On American Airlines’ new 737s, which will be put into service beginning soon, seats have a minimum 30-inch pitch, although American says most seats have 31 inches. Seatback TV screens were eliminated and replaced with brackets that passengers can use to mount their own devices to watch video, and power sources to keep those devices running. The magazine holder is now closer to the top of the seatback to free up more knee room.

“Those seats are designed to make the best possible use of the space,” an American spokesman, Josh Freed, said.

Airlines contend that improved ergonomics and, in some cases, slightly wider seats make up for a tighter pitch. A spokesman for Spirit Airlines, Paul Berry, said the emphasis on pitch was an inaccurate way to assess today’s newer seat designs.

“If you just go by inches, it’s kind of an old measure. We’re kind of basing it on comfort level and the way we’ve engineered our seats,” he said. “While it’s only 28 inches in pitch, it actually feels like it’s about 30 inches,” he said.

But some consumer advocates say the issue goes beyond comfort. One group, Flyers Rights, is petitioning the Federal Aviation Administration to set minimum dimensions for airline seat width and pitch. The group won a round in its court battle with the F.A.A. in July, when a Federal District Court told the agency to address what it referred to as “the incredible shrinking airline seat.”

Paul Hudson, president of Flyers Rights, said the need for seat regulation is driven by safety concerns. Passengers have been getting taller and wider, even as airlines push for slimmer seats, but regulations still stipulate that planes have to be able to be evacuated in just a minute and a half.

“Obviously, if you’re squeezed into a very confined space, it’s going to be harder to get up and get out in an emergency,” Mr. Hudson said.

“The seats were originally designed for people, for men who averaged about 5 foot 10 inches and 170 pounds,” he said. “Right now, the average man is just under 200 pounds.”

The airline industry contends that further regulation is unnecessary. Carriers referred questions to the trade group Airlines for America, which responded with an emailed statement that read, in part, “All U.S. carriers meet or exceed federal safety standards and we continue to believe that there is no need for government to interfere.”

But some air travel professionals contend that advocates like Flyers Rights may have a point in arguing that tightly packed seats may be an impediment to evacuations.

“It won’t be necessarily a passenger comfort regulation, but more around safety,” Mr. Counter said.

Mr. Harteveldt agreed. “There may be a legitimate issue around safety,” he said. “That’s why we’re now starting to see this topic bubble up.”",Air Travelers Resisting the ‘Incredible Shrinking Airline Seat’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/business/airline-seat.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Facebook’s current initiatives to crack down on fake news can, theoretically, be applicable to misinformation on other issues. However, there are several human and technical barriers that prevent misinformation about reproductive rights from being identified, checked and removed at the same — already slow — rate as other misleading stories.

First, the question of what’s considered a “fake news” site is not always black and white. Facebook says it has been tackling the sources of fake news by eliminating the ability to “spoof” domains and by deleting Facebook pages linked to spam activity. For example, this year Facebook identified and deleted more than 30 pages owned by Macedonian publishers, who used them to push out fake stories about United States politics, after alarms had been sounded about sites in the country spreading misinformation about the 2016 campaign. (Facebook says some of the sites may have been taken down for other terms-of-service violations.) But anti-abortion sites are different. They do not mimic real publications, and they publish pieces on real events alongside factually incorrect or thinly sourced stories, which helps blur the line between what’s considered a news blog and “fake news.”

Second, Facebook says one of its key aims in tackling fake news is to remove the profit incentive, because it says “most false news is financially motivated.” It says it hopes to do that by making it more difficult for the people behind the fake news sites to buy ads on its platform and by detecting and deleting spam accounts, which it says are a major force behind the spread of misinformation.

However, the incentive for the people who write content for anti-abortion news sites and Facebook pages is ideological, not financial. Anti-abortion, anti-science content isn’t being written by spammers hoping to make money, but by ordinary people who are driven by religious or political beliefs. Their aim isn’t to profit from ads. It’s to convince readers of their viewpoint: that abortion is morally wrong, that autism is caused by vaccines or that climate change isn’t real.

Finally, public pressure influences where Facebook directs its attention. Facebook may be focused on fake news and the United States election now, but its efforts to prevent the spread of misinformation in the buildup to the election were practically nonexistent. It took action only after intense scrutiny.

Now Facebook and its fact-checking partners say its focus is “on the worst of the worst, on the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain.” Simply put, without increased pressure, Facebook’s technical efforts and its human efforts, like fact-checkers’ trawling through flagged content, make it likely that the company, in the months to come, will be seeking out only the “obvious” flags of fake news stories and not the misinformation that is fueled by real people with no financial incentive. That is why those of us who are concerned by the misinformation around reproductive rights need to make ourselves heard.

The Irish government says it will hold a referendum next year on whether to relax the country’s strict ban on abortion. Some abortion-rights campaigners have expressed concern over the role of misinformation on social media platforms like Facebook in the lead-up to the vote, but it’s far from clear whether those concerns are being listened to.

Curbing the spread of fake news is no easy task, and Facebook says it cannot “become arbiters of truth” in the fight against fake news. But at the very least, the company can address its continuing role in inadvertently spreading false information about issues that go beyond the United States election and Russia.",Facebook Is Ignoring Anti-Abortion Fake News,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/opinion/facebook-fake-news-abortion.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

In February 2010, in southeastern Idaho, I buried my eldest son: Chief Warrant Officer 4 Gary Marc Farwell, who was killed in a U.S. Army helicopter crash in Germany. Among the guests at the funeral were a couple from central Idaho named Bob and Jani Bergdahl. The Bergdahls didn’t know me or my son, but they still drove two and a half hours to pay their respects, a gesture I never forgot. The Bergdahls wanted to show their support for other military families in the midst of their own tragedy. The previous June, their own eldest son, Bowe Robert Bergdahl, had disappeared from his outpost near Yaya Kheyl, a village in Paktika Province, a remote area near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.

After nearly five years of captivity, Bergdahl was released to Army forces on May 31, 2014, in a controversial prisoner exchange that was accompanied by reports that Bergdahl had deserted his post, and that as many as eight soldiers died in the efforts to recover him. Since then the family has been subject to a great deal of ridicule within the military and the media. Last month, Bowe Bergdahl finally pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, and during the last week of October, I drove to Fort Bragg, N.C., for his sentencing hearings, to repay the Bergdahls’ gesture in a way.

On the Monday morning the hearings began, I was the first person in the courtroom. Whatever my intentions had been, it felt a bit ghoulish to be there, to watch a person sitting within earshot of a roomful of soldiers and civilians revisiting in great detail the worst decision of his life. In the courtroom, Bergdahl stood visibly tense, flanked by his military and civilian lawyers, his eyebrows deeply furrowed. When the judge asked if he wished to withdraw his guilty plea, Bergdahl said “no” so softly I could barely hear it.

After a motion from the defense to dismiss the case was considered — along with President Trump’s comments about Bergdahl, and whether they would affect the fairness of his treatment by the courts — the judge recessed the hearings until Wednesday at 10 a.m. That morning I was waiting in the courtroom once again for the proceedings to begin, when a man who looked to be in his 70s or 80s, dressed in a fresh digital camouflage uniform and with insignia indicating that he was a colonel, sat down right next to me. He wore a green beret and a gold Special Forces ring and had Ranger and Special Forces tabs along with airborne wings and a combat infantryman’s badge with one star on top, which meant he’d fought in at least two wars for this country. “I’ll be glad when this crap is over,” he told me. “I got my firing squad standing by.” The country and the army were “going to pot,” he complained, lacking discipline and values. I nodded.

On the witness stand, Bergdahl’s squad leader, Sergeant Evan Beautow, was describing how he and his soldiers would drive in Humvees out to their outpost from Forward Operating Base Sharana for five-day rotations. “That’s the problem,” the colonel whispered. “Not there long enough to know what the [expletive] they are doing.” At the outpost, Beautow went on, there was a bunker in the middle of an old graveyard, with bones sticking out of the ground. After Bergdahl walked off, Beautow and two other soldiers spent 10 miserable days guarding the bunker as the rest of the squad looked for him. “My guy was gone,” Beautow said. He started crying on the witness stand.

“Unbelievable!” the colonel hissed. “What kind of soldiers do we have now?”

I found myself wondering the same thing at times during the hearings — even if I was less quick to judge than the colonel. During Vietnam, I avoided being drafted into the Army by joining the Navy and served almost four years on a submarine. After graduating from college and veterinary school, I accepted a commission in the Air Force as an officer in their veterinary corps, and then again years later as a public health officer in Turkey and Germany. Those adventures, I think, helped inspire two of my sons to join the Army — first Marc, who enlisted and became a helicopter pilot after we came back from Germany, then a few years later Matthew, my youngest son, who left college to join the Army as a combat infantryman, against my reservations. He was assigned to a unit with the 10th Mountain Division and was sent to Afghanistan, serving in the same general area as Bowe Bergdahl, although two years earlier.",Why I Felt I Had to Go to Bowe Bergdahl’s Hearing,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/magazine/why-i-felt-i-had-to-go-to-bowe-bergdahls-hearing.html

In 2016, Egypt ranked 146th out of 150 countries for fixed broadband download speeds, according to Speedtest. The only worse country in North Africa was war-torn Libya. It’s surprising given that a major data cable, linking hundreds of millions of users, passes through one sleepy Egyptian village. The problem stems from a lack of investment in telecommunications infrastructure locally since the Arab Spring in 2011 and stifling state monopolies.

We get around this with dongles connected to the 4G cellphone network, which is better, if not perfect. In conflict zones like Libya, where I covered an offensive against the Islamic State last year, I turn to my BGAN satellite data terminal and a Thuraya satellite phone.

But increasingly there is at least patchy cellphone coverage in even the more dangerous places, such as during the battle for Aleppo, Syria, last year. That brings an immediacy that I once found jarring: the power to FaceTime with your mom, for instance, from a battlefront. But now that feels normal, and choices are dictated less by technology than by what simply feels right.

Are Egyptians joined at the hip with their smartphones?

Egyptians adore their smartphones. People have crazy-looking cases and a range of dramatic ringtones — Quranic verses for conservatives, melodramatic pop tunes for everyone else. Lionel Richie’s “Hello” and anything by Celine Dion are very popular.

The flip side to the smartphone mania is that it also inspires deep paranoia among the police and some ordinary citizens, known popularly here as “honorable citizens.” I know people who’ve been threatened with arrest for taking a photo of the Suez Canal (after the pyramids, one of Egypt’s most famous features). A photographer friend was admonished by an “honorable citizen” for trying to take a photo of the Nile with her phone. He accused her of being a spy.

What are the favorite apps or gadgets in Egypt? Are people on Facebook and using Google and Uber?

Egypt has the largest community of Facebook users in the Arab world. It’s a huge part of many people’s lives, at a time when the public square is dramatically shrinking. Since President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in 2013, protest has been outlawed and the news media is largely in thrall to the government. So people turn to social media to talk politics, mock their leaders and hunt for independent news. If Mr. Sisi makes a slip-up on television, there will unfailingly be a flurry of mocking memes flying about on Facebook within hours. It can be funny, dark or both — jokes about the country’s pitiful human rights record, for instance.

It’s not just Western apps. Anghami is the Arab version of Spotify, Souq.com is the big online retailer (and was bought by Amazon this year), and there’s a host of apps that tell pious Muslims when to pray or that help them to read the Quran.

On the streets of Cairo, Uber and Careem, a ride-sharing app that concentrates on the Middle East, are slugging it out for market share. As a result, cab rides can be ridiculously cheap — just a few dollars to cross town.

How does the Egyptian government treat tech like social media and Western apps?

With wariness and frequent hostility.

Egyptian officials closely monitor Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites, and posting an irreverent comment can land a user in court or in jail. A young army conscript is serving a three-year sentence for posting a photo of Mr. Sisi with a pair of Mickey Mouse ears. Since May, the government has banned over 400 websites, including Human Rights Watch, the Egyptian news site Mada Masr and, bizarrely, Medium. Earlier this year, I discovered the security services were seeking access to real-time information about ride-sharing customers — once known inside Uber as “God View” — through the Uber and Careem apps.

All told, it’s a pretty grim picture.

The potential conflicts extend from the cabinet to the West Wing. Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, an adviser whose portfolio ranges from Middle Eastern peace to government technology, revealed over the summer that he had failed to disclose dozens of assets on his initial government ethics forms.

“It is precisely because we have extraordinarily wealthy individuals running the government that we have no way of knowing what the conflicts of interest really are,” said Gary Kalman, executive director of the FACT Coalition, a network of anti-corruption groups. “They use complex structures to hide their money, both domestically and abroad.”

Among the investments Mr. Kushner initially failed to publicly disclose was a real estate technology start-up called Cadre. After beginning his job at the White House, Mr. Kushner identified for ethics officials the assets that he believed he would need to sell in order to avoid conflicts, including investments in a group of funds that hold stakes in various technology companies. Like other appointees, Mr. Kushner sought a certification that would let him defer capital gains taxes on those assets.

Virginia Canter, a former White Ethics lawyer now at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a left-leaning watchdog group, said that officials were typically required to sell off all similar assets in order to win the tax benefit. But Mr. Kushner did not include Cadre among the investments to be sold. Instead, he moved his Cadre stake into a holding company, BFPS Ventures, that his disclosure form described as containing only “real estate in New York.”

He later revealed his continued Cadre stake to the public in an updated disclosure. By then, the company had received a new round of investments that pushed its value to $800 million.

Mr. Kushner’s team has maintained that the original omission was accidental, but that Kushner is entitled to keep his Cadre stake because he could easily recuse himself from any conflicts surrounding the company.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

“Mr. Kushner’s interest in Cadre was disclosed to and discussed with the Office of Government Ethics prior to inauguration and is addressed in his ethics agreement with the White House,” Jamie S. Gorelick, a lawyer for Mr. Kushner, said in a statement.

But Ms. Canter said it wasn’t clear whether ethics officials were given complete information about Cadre before granting Mr. Kushner the tax deferral on his other assets, and she questioned his decision to keep it.

“The nature of the entity is that real estate is being bought and sold on a technology platform,” Ms. Canter said. “Who is buying and selling on that platform — we have no visibility into it.”

She added, “There should have been much greater scrutiny.”

Mr. Trump’s wealthy appointees have divested from a broad range of assets, and in some cases have made clean breaks: Rex W. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil chief, shed a small fortune in company shares to become secretary of state.

But some appointees, like Mr. Ross, have taken advantage of the ambiguities of current rules to retain assets that could be impacted by administration policy. Under her agreement with ethics officials, for example, Betsy DeVos, the billionaire education secretary, divested a swath of assets. But she retained many others in family trusts of which she remains a trustee. There is no way to know which of those assets may conflict with her duties as secretary of education: Ms. DeVos chose not to publicly disclose what investments are contained in two of them.

“What we are seeing in these new leaks is that even when people are acting in a legal fashion, the laws allow them to cover the tracks of things they think would be embarrassing or problematic,” Mr. Kalman said.

Mr. Ross’s Russia ties are a case study in how layers of offshore secrecy can hide potential conflicts. Before Mr. Trump named him to the Commerce Department, Mr. Ross was a major shareholder in a shipping firm that did brisk business transporting gas for a Russian company, Sibur, whose owners include not only an oligarch hit with sanctions but the son-in-law of Russian President Vladimir V. Putin.

Navigator was listed on an initial disclosure filed by Mr. Ross that covered his holdings through the end of last year. But an ethics and divestment agreement he filed in January, which listed assets he intended to keep, did not mention Navigator, leaving unclear whether he had sold it.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said he had voted to advance Mr. Ross’s nomination out of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, of which he is a member, because Mr. Ross had pledged to divest any assets that would pose a conflict.

Unbeknownst to Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Ross in fact retained much of his stake in Navigator after taking office. But it was hidden within one of the disclosed partnerships, behind layers of shell companies in the Cayman Islands. In an interview with Bloomberg News on Monday, Mr. Ross said that he would probably sell his stake in the company.

James Rockas, a spokesman for Mr. Ross, noted that Mr. Ross’s decision to retain the Navigator investment had been approved by the government ethics office.

But Mr. Blumenthal now says he felt misled. This week, he called for a review of Mr. Ross’s financial conflicts by the Commerce Department’s inspector general.

“The complexity and lack of transparency of Cayman Islands-based holding companies made them very much like a Russian nesting doll,” Mr. Blumenthal said. “If we knew then what we know now, it would have been a very, very different confirmation process.”","Trump Appointees, Richest Ever, Elude Scrutiny With Hidden Investments",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/us/politics/trump-appointees-conflicts-of-interest.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Dave Mercer used to keep his turned off unless he needed news about road conditions.","In his 31-year career delivering frozen patties, ketchup packets, ice cream and such to McDonald’s, Baskin-Robbins and other restaurants across the country, Dave Mercer logged more than three million miles, many of them in rigs he termed “bad news”: boxy, twin-stick-shift trucks that belched smoke and had no heating, air conditioning or radio. But they were sleek compared with the 18-wheelers his father drove before he was born. His father used to say that going uphill he could walk faster than his load; sometimes he would stand out on the running board to cool off and steer one-handed through his open door. “You’re not going to stop technology,” Mercer told me, when I asked him why he had decided to finish his professional life by test-driving trucks full time for a four-year-old Silicon Valley start-up. We were standing on the side of I-280 in Mountain View, Calif.; Mercer, wearing a Hawaiian shirt and dark glasses, had just finished demonstrating a system that a company called Peloton Technology plans to introduce in commercial fleets next year. “I wanted to come over and be a part of this before I retired,” he said. “I can tell some of the younger drivers. ... ” In lieu of finishing his thought, he punched his co-pilot, a quiet computer engineer, in the shoulder. Hundreds of hours riding shotgun with Mercer — panoramic views of the horizon, cars flowing streamlike down below — had inspired him and several of the company’s other engineers to get a commercial driver’s license. “I want to be part of that, too,” Mercer said.

Someday cars will drive themselves and coordinate with one another and smart cities and roadways to eliminate traffic jams and accidents — including the fatal one that happens in the United States every 15 minutes — while reducing fuel consumption and effectively giving back to Americans an annual per-capita average of 335 hours in which, for better or worse, they can use their hands and eyeballs in other ways. When and in what shape this utopian future will arrive, though, remains a persistent mystery. What is certain is that those who play the largest roles in solving it will be in a position to dictate — as those who control infrastructure always have been — which people and places they will empower and which they will upend.

An intelligent automated future, however, depends on the maturation of two entirely separate sets of technologies. The first — and the one that has drawn most of the investment and media attention in the last five years — will allow vehicles to drive themselves without any input from their surroundings. The other set of technologies will connect vehicles to their surroundings and to one another, in order to optimize the functioning of the vehicular ecosystem as a whole. Ultimately, these two types of systems will have to complement each other, yet neither can be implemented all at once. In the meantime, the process of developing and deploying them often puts them at odds. Indeed, the two systems are, in a sense, philosophically opposed: libertarian self-reliance in a race with socialist collectivity to be the first to improve traffic flow.

In Silicon Valley and elsewhere, where numerous start-ups are competing with software giants like Google and Uber in the “self-driving” category, Peloton has left high-level automation out of its immediate business plan. Rather, it has staked its early success — and the money of investors like UPS, Volvo and Intel — on a cooperative technology known as “vehicle-to-vehicle communication,” or V2V, which makes use of a shortwave portion of the radio spectrum that the Federal Communications Commission set aside in 1999 primarily for traffic-safety messaging. A signal can zip through this bandwidth thousands of times faster than the second or two it might typically take a driver to react. This valuable swath of ether (worth billions to the telecommunications industry, which is currently lobbying the F.C.C. to “share” it) facilitates unlimited potential applications, not just for sending data among vehicles but also for syncing them with traffic lights and other features of the environment. Currently, vehicles using it — the vast majority belonging to research pilot projects — broadcast encrypted information 10 times per second to any receivers within 1,000 feet that can decode it. This means that, unlike vehicles that are automated but not connected, they can “see” beyond their actual field of view: an accident just over the crest of a hill, an oncoming car around the corner. “It will save lives, and everybody knows that,” says Harry Lightsey, the executive director for emerging-technologies policy at General Motors, maker of the 2017 Cadillac CTS, the first commercially available car in the United States to carry the technology. “A delay in rolling out V2V will cost lives, and that’s a tragedy.”

It has been nearly two decades since the F.C.C. allocated bandwidth to be used primarily by V2V. So why does talk about the future of transportation tend to be dominated by fully automated vehicles? One reason is that most people simply assume automation includes connectivity to others on the road. It is also hard to explain what V2V is: Like the internet, it describes a medium with many possible uses, not a stand-alone product. Nor is there a single definition in play, really; though V2V typically refers to systems that operate in the F.C.C.-dedicated bandwidth, it can technically mean any type of connection among vehicles, or between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I) or “everything” (V2X). Like the telephone’s, too, its value is contingent upon its dissemination — early customers, with no one to “call,” must buy into an abstraction.

Peloton believes that trucking companies are the natural place to start: They can outfit entire fleets at once and reap significant benefits from small improvements. Moreover, most of the 279 billion annual miles trucks travel are on highways, which are far more predictable than city streets and therefore an easier environment in which to usher in new driving features. Thus, the trucking industry is poised to be among the first to adopt both V2V and automated technologies on a grand scale, possibly becoming the arena in which they will compete with each other most ferociously for initial relevance and public acceptance.

On the day I met Mercer, he and Jake Gregory, a veteran F.B.I. agent who drove trucks in college and directed safety operations for a small fleet after leaving the bureau, were demonstrating Peloton’s first V2V application, called “platooning,” in a pair of 18-wheelers. (“Peloton,” the French word for “platoon,” also designates the main pack of cyclists in a road race.) They eased out onto I-280 with Mercer in the lead. I rode with Gregory, whose cab had been retrofitted with theater-style seats where a bunk bed used to be. These were occupied by Steve Boyd, a Peloton founder, who oversees external affairs; Oliver Bayley, the head of user experience design; and Rod McLane, the company’s marketing manager.

The specialties of these — user experience and public relations — were reminders of the “social problem” (as Bayley put it) that nags at Peloton. Their product is ready, and they expect to outfit hundreds of commercial trucks with it in 2018. But legislators, the general public and, crucially, truck drivers still fear it, often confusing it with automation, which many see as a threat to drivers’ jobs. (Even companies about to put it in their fleets decline to be named.) This unease is reflected in the rejection of the terms “self-driving” and “autonomous” in recent recommendations from SAE International, which publishes industry standards. Boyd, a former assistant press secretary for the White House, explained: “ ‘Autonomous’ is: You get into the truck and say, ‘I want to go to the office,’ and the truck says, ‘I want to go to the beach.’ ”

Gregory flipped a switch on the dash, and a screen — mounted where a car’s rearview mirror usually is — blinked on. “Platooning not authorized in this area,” it said. The system, Gregory said, was calculating the weight of Mercer’s truck ahead: “It takes a few minutes for it to establish mass.” The software also used a cellular signal to check with a cloud-based server run by Peloton engineers to see if Gregory was in an appropriate location: a divided highway accessible by only on-off ramps, more easily negotiated than crossings.

The system chimed, and the message changed: “Ready to platoon.” Gregory pressed a button that allowed Mercer’s truck to take control of his throttle and braking systems over the V2V bandwidth. It began to reel Gregory’s truck in until they were exactly 66 feet apart. By maintaining that gap, it created a slipstream that reduced carbon emissions and saved fuel by an average of 7 percent: 10 percent for the follower and 5 percent for the leader. (A team led by researchers at Purdue University, with a grant from the United States Department of Energy, believes it can help Peloton increase the average to 20 percent, which the team estimates would be worth up to $20 billion a year to the trucking industry.)

While continuing to steer, Gregory removed both feet from the pedals and planted them on the floorboard. Mercer slowed at an exit ramp, and Gregory’s truck automatically did, too, beeping at him to resume control. When I first heard about platooning, I imagined it would feel more death-defying, but though the size of the gap had initially unsettled Mercer and Gregory, it attracted little notice on the highway; oblivious passenger-car drivers frequently cut in, dissolving the platoon. In practice, the exercise felt more like an elaborate cruise-control upgrade than the opening bell in a transportation revolution. Bayley agreed: “It’s disappointing!”

Critics of V2V, especially those who are solely invested in full automation, dismiss platooning as mere high-speed tailgating. The major added safety benefits, they point out, come from the fact that, in order to platoon, trucks must be equipped with advanced safety features. Peloton readily agrees that its application, whose requirements include air disc brakes and state-of-the-art collision-avoidance, is an incentive for fleets to upgrade. V2V proponents, on the other hand, hope to leverage renewed federal interest in their systems to expand projects that have been gestating for decades. The Department of Transportation, under the outgoing Obama administration, proposed requiring that all new passenger vehicles be equipped with V2V — at least symbolically moving toward the realization of those goals. Earlier this month, however, reports suggested that the Trump administration might be inclined to shelve the proposal. “It’s important to get our government leaders to commit to this,” says Larry Head, an engineering professor at the University of Arizona, who is collaborating on V2I applications with Peloton. “We can’t wait five years. We’re ready now.”

To connect in any way is to cede control and reconfigure vulnerability. The history of civilization is one of trading pure independence — living alone in a cave, say — for comfort of one kind or another: companionship, enhanced productivity, protection. On balance, it is hard to argue that this exchange has not worked out in our favor. But the benefits of communing also exact steep prices — war, climate change, economic inequality — that are suffered individually. Since the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in 1869 transformed the American landscape and economy, public transportation and infrastructure have given physical shape to moral questions that arise when we are forced to choose between self-interest and the greater good. In 1967, the British philosopher Philippa Foot posed a thought experiment that became known as the “trolley problem.” A runaway trolley is headed for five people tied to its track. You are standing next to a lever that can divert the trolley to another track, where it will kill a single person. Is it more ethical to pull the lever or not?

As a society, we routinely make comparable decisions: when we let football players give one another brain damage in the interests of public entertainment; when a surgeon refrains from killing one terminal patient and transplanting his organs into five patients whom they might save. The trolley problem heightens individual culpability by bestowing absolute decision-making power on one person and demanding that she select not between actions but consequences, which in real life are rarely inevitable. Arguably, in doing so, the dilemma tends to reveal our natural inclination to accept fate over premeditation in situations with no happy outcomes, even if planning might partly mitigate an otherwise inevitable tragedy.

In recent years, the trolley problem has frequently been adapted to discussions about entirely automated cars, which respond to contingencies with binary logic. Suppose a distracted mother pushes a stroller with her baby in it out in front of such a vehicle — should the car be programmed to hit them or swerve into a tree? Azim Shariff, the director of the Culture and Morality Lab at the University of California, Irvine, was an author of a 2016 report in Science that described a series of surveys he and colleagues conducted in which participants overwhelmingly approved of autonomous vehicles, as the study terms them, that would “sacrifice their passengers for the greater good” and “would like others to buy them.” Unsurprisingly, however, they expressed a preference to ride themselves in autonomous vehicles that protect their passengers “at all costs.”

Engineers tend to scoff at the trolley exercise. (“I think the vehicle’s going to stop,” Larry Head told me.) But Shariff says this response takes the problem too literally. “That particular scenario may never come up, but the fundamental ethical trade-off that it’s revealing, apportioning risks among people on the road, is going to happen all the time,” he said. “It already does.” Inching closer to a cyclist in the right lane to move farther from a semi on the left, for instance, prioritizes your safety over the cyclist’s. Leaving that “decision” up to your subconscious becomes its own ethical choice, he added, once “the luxury of deliberation” embodied by the preprogrammed car exists. Human error contributes to an estimated 95 percent of crashes; in theory, automated and connected cars can eliminate our mistakes. “If you recognize that one option is safer,” Shariff says, “and you choose the other option, that’s a moral decision.”

At the moment, V2V merely transfers information without dictating how it is used. But as its reach expands, potentially linking drivers, carmakers and telecommunications companies with state, city and local governments and other private and public interests in a vast network orchestrating the use of what are essentially lethal weapons, questions of responsibility become more complicated. V2V-enabled vehicles would broadcast their size, speed, acceleration and braking activity and location (down to the lane), according to the latest standards. Who will be allowed to access that data? Will it remain anonymous, as automakers currently intend? Who will defend the network against hackers and keep up-to-date the critical software that collects, analyzes and translates that data into best practices for each of its users? Do drivers have the ultimate right to control their cars — even if they want to speed, say — or should the network be programmed to prevent them from doing so? Should it matter whether they’re flooring it because they’re drunk or delivering a pregnant woman in labor to the hospital?

Of course, governments and standards organizations already confront similar utilitarian questions. Early airbags were designed to protect men of average height and weight at the expense of those outside the bell curve; when ambulances run red lights to save a dying patient, they increase the risk of death for everyone around them; a turn-only lane might be safer for bicyclists but worsen vehicle congestion or put a store out of business. Still, each of these decisions can be modified on the micro level by human behavior. The ambulance driver’s experience and his reactions to traffic conditions might mitigate his accident risk. An algorithm applies norms uniformly. Those presets would need to function nationwide, which would require countless entities with conflicting interests and values to submit to a single interpretation of what is best for most people. (Until a majority of cars are fully automated and connected, such a network would most likely behave as the Waze navigation app does, delivering information to human or automated drivers for them to interpret.)

Unfortunately, as a species, humans are notoriously inept at acting in our own long-term interest. Imagine an algorithm for hurricane evacuation that moves cars faster than human drivers would — “balancing the risk of a more-damaging accident from the higher speed against the benefit of getting people out of the evacuation zone faster,” William Whyte, a prominent automotive cybersecurity consultant, wrote to me in an email. “That would be an algorithm that on average worked better than current practice but, when it failed, would fail worse. I think that people would probably feel uncomfortable with that in the same way that they feel uncomfortable on planes — there’s a combination of lack of control plus the fact that if things go wrong, they go very wrong, which triggers all the ways that people are very bad at risk assessment.”

Automation thrives in the absence of regulation; V2V depends on it. The United States Department of Transportation has long helped sponsor V2V research projects: Among the largest is a collaboration between the University of Michigan and the city of Ann Arbor that plans to have 3,150 V2V-equipped cars and 70 connected traffic lights operating there by January. Tampa, New York and the state of Wyoming have won more than $40 million from the agency to implement V2V and other connected-vehicle projects within the next year. At least 41 states have considered legislation surrounding the deployment of automated or V2V technology; at least nine have changed their following-distance laws to permit platooning.

Without federal help, however, the upfront cost of connected infrastructure can be prohibitive for small towns and cities. Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina and an affiliate scholar at Stanford’s Center for Internet and Society, recently challenged a group of students to come up with ways to secure public funding for vehicle-to-infrastructure technology that would enable more governments to afford it. One idea was to use the technology at intersections to collect traffic data and sell it to the developers of automated systems to improve their algorithms; another was to use the dedicated bandwidth in cars to create a meshlike internet network for rural areas, eliminating the need to put down expensive fiber cable.

Perhaps the most provocative idea, Smith told me, was a “crash bounty.” He explained: “We’ve posited that V2I can improve safety — what if you could come up with a scheme for monetizing that? If you could prove you had prevented a crash, you could bill the people who otherwise would have been injured or killed: ‘Good news, we’re 80 percent sure that we saved you from an injury that would have cost you tens of thousands of dollars, so, insurance company, pay up $40,000 and be happy with that.’ ”

To get a sense of how V2V stands to improve the system as a whole, it helps to understand how cities cope without it. To that end, on a recent Monday morning, just after rush hour, I joined Wilson Aleman and Al Vilar, who have been engineers at the Boston Transportation Department for a cumulative five decades, in the Traffic Management Center on the seventh floor of City Hall. Aleman wore a Red Sox cap. Vilar wore glasses with small eyepieces and thick lenses that gave him the look of a jeweler examining a precious stone.

In front of them, a bank of screens displayed live video of various intersections: cars double-parking on narrow, curving roads; pedestrians disregarding stoplights. Aleman could remember when the video screens used to be a board with a real-time LED map on it — and when the department received postmarked letters of complaint instead of tweets, emails and phone calls. Over the last two decades, Boston has connected 68 percent of its lighted intersections to the Traffic Management Center, allowing engineers to adjust the signaling patterns in real time. The department estimates this has reduced travel times by about 15 percent and emissions and crashes by 8 percent each; it also yields economic benefits of approximately $14 million each year, compared with the $318,000 it cost to implement. Still, much of the traffic data — which helps to determine optimal signal timing as well as the city’s future investments — comes from people logging car movements by hand. Widespread V2V would give traffic departments like Boston’s a wealth of detailed information about key locations. (If all cars had V2V, they could blaze through complex intersections without stopping at all, modifying their speeds and headings to slide into gaps.) Maintenance, however, would be a significant challenge.

Aleman showed me his computer monitor, where the connected lights were represented on a city map as red or green dots. The red dots were ones that weather, construction or local hardware issues had taken offline. He pointed to two reds very close together on Commonwealth Avenue that could strand cars between them and block cross-traffic. “Those are the ones I like to attack,” he said. “Those are important to me.” The phone rang. It was a communications specialist who was elbow-deep in a control box on one of Aleman’s corners, working on a surge protector. “Maybe if you unplug one at a time?” Aleman suggested.

On another phone, Vilar was patiently discussing the timing of a new light on Endicott Street at Keany Square with one of the street’s residents. “We’ll get it so it’s working better; right now it’s working safer because there’s less cars coming at you.” He paused. “They’re ready to march on City Hall, I know.” One-way, residential Endicott begins as an offshoot of I-93 North and ends where the causeway and the Charlestown Bridge converge as six lanes. The light makes it slower to turn left. But, Vilar explained once he’d hung up, “we can’t make it beautiful, because then it will siphon off cars from the causeway.”

He pointed to the Endicott video feed where, sure enough, a line of cars was forming. “See, now it’s like 14 cars deep, people honking — you want it to be more serene, especially when you’re eating dinner,” he said. But say those cars weren’t there, and I-93 was backed up, and Google Maps began suggesting Endicott as a shortcut. “So now you’ve got a guy who just got off there, maybe he’s enraged, instead of going 30 he’s going 40, a kid runs out into the street because he’s not used to the traffic being there. ... ” Vilar said. “You want to make it so it’s moving. You want him to think: I’ll be O.K. I don’t want to get off this street. I’ll stay.” A V2V network could make these sorts of intricate adjustments instantly and indefatigably, but it would do so without Vilar’s empathy for the harried commuter or the family conversing over supper.

“Sometimes people call,” he said, “and they just want to rant, and you’re just a punching bag for those people, and that’s part of the job.” Vilar grew up in the North End; he, his wife and his children still live nearby. “The woman who just called, she’s almost like an aunt to me,” he said. “She has my number.”

Traffic may be impersonal, but we experience it intimately. Its smells, sounds and movements are as fundamental to our daily passages as the weather. The transition from horses to cars transformed the nature of cities, Ann Norton Greene writes in her 2008 history, “Horses at Work”: “In the name of safety and efficiency, urban Progressives moved children into supervised urban playgrounds, installed new traffic regulation devices, placed policemen on the streets and encouraged changes that turned streets from spaces in a neighborhood to spaces through a neighborhood.” Vehicles, in this milieu, served as a “protected, private space, an extension of the private home.”

More than a century later, in the context of platooning, privacy seems to be able to foster community as much as disrupt it. The dedicated channel over which one truck controls others allows the drivers to converse exclusively with one another, as opposed to using their C.B. radio, which is rife with vulgar chatter. Dave Mercer used to keep his turned off unless he needed news about road conditions. But during the test run, he and Jake Gregory exchanged frequent notes on moves they planned to make or vehicles that the other couldn’t see; Mercer described it as “Jake and I looking out for each other on the road.”

Might the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues in this way reform the macho trucking culture, increasing the diversity of drivers, only 5.1 percent of whom are women? Or might including more varied perspectives in the design process result in even more innovative applications of V2V? The homogeneity at leading technology companies is well documented. Still, it seems notable, considering how infrastructure and power reinforce each other, that of the several dozen engineers, academics and standards developers I spoke with whose thinking is shaping the future of V2V, most were white and all but one was male.

Artificial systems evolve — just as natural systems do — by applying strict rules to events that are often swayed by chance, and the results are frequently surprising. Relinquishing control of our vehicles to algorithms may ultimately transform us from drivers to passengers who tranquilly observe our surroundings from within our bubble or ignore them altogether in favor of watching a movie or checking email. Then again, by the time that sort of algorithm is ready, more and more of us may choose to depend on ride-sharing applications like Uber and Lyft for personal travel and delivery services, or even 3-D printing for goods we once needed a car to go get and pay for. “I have three daughters; they’re totally uninterested in driving,” Jack Pokrzywa, director of global ground vehicle standards for SAE International, told me. “When I got my license, I was 17. I was in seventh heaven.”

For those of us for whom a visit to the D.M.V. was a rite of passage, it’s easy to forget that, before Americans found freedom inside a motor vehicle, they found it on foot and astride horses, in covered wagons and trains, on ships, buses, planes, bicycles, roller skates. They found it in pure motion, on a journey to someplace beyond what they could imagine. Where it began and where it ended was still theirs to decide. Likewise, automated connected vehicles stand to make travel safer, maybe even boring, but somebody still has to get in and tell them where to go.",How to Make Cars Cooperate,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/09/magazine/tech-design-autonomous-future-cars-v2v-traffic-peloton.html

The typical graduate earns $2.86 million over a lifetime. When you put business graduates side by side with those who graduated with what are considered low-paying majors, you’ll see that those who are slightly above the median salary in their fields are not that far behind the business grads. For example, an English major in the 60th percentile makes $2.76 million in a lifetime, a major in psychology $2.57 million and a history major $2.64 million.

Myth 2: Women want to have it all.

Women are now the clear majority on college campuses, making up 56 percent of students enrolled this fall. They are also more likely than men to graduate.

But when it comes to selecting a major, what women choose tends to segregate them into lower paying fields, such as education and social services, according to a report that Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce will publish later this year. Just look at some of the highest paying fields and the proportion of women who major in them: business economics (31 percent), chemical engineering (28 percent), computer science (20 percent), electrical engineering (10 percent), mechanical engineering (8 percent).

“Women can’t win even as they dominate at every level of higher education,” said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown center.

Dr. Carnevale wouldn’t speculate as to why women make their choices. But he notes that if the proportion of women in fields where men dominate increased by just 10 percent, the gender pay gap would narrow considerably: from 78 cents paid to women for every dollar men receive to 90 cents for every dollar men receive.

Myth 3: Choice of major matters more than choice of college.

Not so. In seven states — Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington — students can search public databases for early earnings of graduates of institutions within the state. And those databases show that students who graduate from more selective schools tend to make more money. After all, the better the college, the better the professional network opportunities, through alumni, parents of classmates and eventually classmates themselves.

These undergraduates are more able to pursue majors in lower paying fields because their networks help them land good jobs. Arts, humanities and social science majors are more prevalent on elite campuses than at second-tier colleges, where students tend to pick vocational majors like business, education and health. In all, more than half of students at less selective schools major in career-focused subjects; at elite schools, less than a quarter do, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight of the 78 “most selective schools” in Barron’s rankings, compared with 1,800 “less selective schools.”

“Students at selective colleges are allowed to explore their intellectual curiosity as undergraduates because they will get their job training in graduate school or have access to a network that gets them top jobs, regardless of their undergraduate major,” Dr. Carnevale said.

They are also more likely to have two majors than students at second-tier colleges, who tend to be more financially needy and have to work, affording less time to double major.

One tip: Complementary majors with overlapping requirements are easier to juggle, but two unrelated majors probably yield bigger gains in the job market, said Richard N. Pitt, an associate professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University who has studied the rise of the double major. “It increases your breadth of knowledge,” he said.

Myth 4: Liberal arts majors are unemployable.

The liberal arts is a favorite target of politicians, with the latest salvo coming from the governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin. “If you’re studying interpretive dance, God bless you, but there’s not a lot of jobs right now in America looking for people with that as a skill set,” Governor Bevin said in a speech in September.

Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize — writing, synthesis, problem solving — are sought after by employers. A 2017 study by David J. Deming, an associate professor of education and economics at Harvard, found jobs requiring both the so-called soft skills and thinking skills have seen the largest growth in employment and pay in the last three decades.

One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job. But a study by Burning Glass Technologies, a Boston-based company that analyzes job-market trends, concluded that if liberal arts graduates gain proficiency in one of eight technical skills, such as social media or data analysis, their prospects of landing entry-level jobs increase substantially.

The long-held belief by parents and students that liberal arts graduates are unemployable ignores the reality of the modern economy, where jobs require a mix of skills not easily packaged in a college major, said George Anders, author of “You Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a ‘Useless’ Liberal Arts Education.” In his book, Mr. Anders profiles graduates with degrees in philosophy, sociology and linguistics in jobs as diverse as sales, finance and market research.

“Once C.E.O.s see liberal arts graduates in action,” Mr. Anders said, “they come aboard to the idea that they need more of them.”

Myth 5: It’s important to choose a major early.

Why settle on a field of study before experiencing the smorgasbord college has to offer, be it study abroad, a club activity or a surprising elective?

Of students who said they felt committed to their major when they arrived on campus, 20 percent had selected a new major by the end of their first year, according to a national survey by the University of California, Los Angeles.

Changing majors can cost you a semester or two, especially if you switch to one unrelated to your first choice. To reduce that risk, several schools, including Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Lehman College in the Bronx, have created “meta-majors,” which group majors under a larger academic umbrella.

“We have moved away from trying to get students to choose their majors as they enter,” said Timothy Renick, Georgia State’s vice provost and vice president for enrollment management and student success.

Instead, all incoming students choose from one of seven meta-majors, representing large academic and work force fields, such as business, education and STEM. First semester, students gather in learning communities and register for a block of general-education courses within that meta-major. Programming is designed so that students get to know the differences between majors within the field.

“Students in our business meta-major get to understand the difference between finance, accounting, management and marketing so they can choose their major from an informed perspective,” Dr. Renick said. They usually do by the end of their first year.

Myth 6: You need a major.

A handful of colleges, including Indiana University and the Evergreen State College, offer the option to ignore the official list of majors and design a course of study. Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The Times, designed his at Indiana — enigmatology.

“Majors are artificial and restrictive,” said Christine Ortiz, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on leave to design a new nonprofit university that will have no majors, and also no lectures or classrooms.

“Majors result from the academic structure of the university, tied to the classic academic disciplines. There is no reason they need to be boxed up like that. They don’t take into account emerging fields that cross disciplines.”

Majors tend to lag behind changes in the workplace. No wonder fewer than a third of college graduates work in jobs related to their majors. And picking one based on today’s in-demand jobs is risky, said Dr. Webber of Temple, especially if the occupation is threatened by automation.

“I would argue against majoring in accounting,” he said, “or anything that a computer can be programmed to do.”",Six Myths About Choosing a College Major,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/education/edlife/choosing-a-college-major.html

To spur local decision-making, the A.C.C.E. has also adopted model legislation pushing for more open bidding for water pipes.

“We’re just trying to take up policies that limit the size of government, that keep it from growing exponentially,” said Jon Russell, national director of the A.C.C.E. and a councilman from the town of Culpeper, Va.

Plastics are an obvious replacement for the country’s aging pipes. Lightweight, easy to install, corrosion-free and up to 50 percent cheaper than iron, plastic pipes have already taken the place of copper as the preferred material for service lines that connect homes to municipal mains, as well as water pipes inside the home.

Still, some scientists warn that the rapid replacement of America’s water infrastructure with plastic could bring its own health concerns.

Scientists are just starting to understand the effect of plastic on the quality and safety of drinking water, including what sort of chemicals can leach into the water from the pipes themselves, or from surrounding groundwater contamination. Studies have shown that toxic pollutants like benzene and toluene from spills and contaminated soil can permeate certain types of plastic pipes as they age. A 2013 review of research on leaching from plastic pipe identified more than 150 contaminants migrating from plastic pipes into drinking water.

“Plastics are being installed without any real understanding of what they’re doing to our drinking water,” said Andrew J. Whelton, assistant professor of civil engineering at Purdue University, and an author of the 2013 study. “We don’t know what chemicals we’re being exposed to.”

Sensing an opening, the iron pipe industry has started a public relations push of its own, voicing concerns over plastic, wooing President Trump with accolades for his infrastructure drive and setting up a war between the two industries.

“Iron is just more durable. It’s a more proven material,” said Patrick Hogan, president of the Ductile Iron Pipe Research Association, the industry’s main lobby group. “Iron’s been in the ground for 100 years.”

Plastic groups have criticized the studies, saying they focus on older generations of plastic piping and conflate different types of plastics. They also stress that their pipes are independently tested by the third-party organization.

“It’s not a new material. It’s a safe material. It’s independently tested,” said Mr. Hollands, executive director of the Uni-Bell plastic pipes group.

The industry outreach, at times, has been more overt.

At the height of Flint’s water crisis, the chief executive of one of the nation’s largest manufacturers of plastic pipes, JM Eagle, traveled to the beleaguered city and offered to replace the city’s lead pipes at no cost.

Pipes from JM Eagle would last 100 years and are a long-lasting and safe solution, the company’s chief executive, Walter Wang, told the City Council last February. “This water crisis, this contamination issue,” he said, “it’s hurting children and making them sick.”

JM Eagle, however, has faced recent legal problems. In 2013, a federal jury in California found that the Los Angeles-based company had defrauded states and municipalities for more than a decade by knowingly selling defective water pipes. In some places, PVC pipes that were supposed to last 50 years exploded in their first year, causing injuries and flooding.

JM Eagle declined to comment but has previously said the litigation was based on “scurrilous allegations” by a disgruntled former employee. Formosa Plastics, a Taiwanese industrial conglomerate that was its parent company at the time, agreed to pay $22.5 million in a settlement with municipalities and other government agencies in California.

The uncertainty over potable water pipes of all kinds is exacerbated by a lack of regulation over their safety. There is no federal oversight of the materials or processes used to manufacture plastic water pipes; instead, water pipes are certified and tested by an organization paid for by industry.

That organization, NSF International, displays a picture of the Capitol building on its regulatory resources web page and runs a hotline for questions on regulations and product safety. Yet it has never received regulatory authority from the federal government. Nor does it disclose test results for the pipes it certifies.

NSF International called its testing robust. “If a product does not meet the requirements of a standard, it will not pass,” said Dave Purkiss, the organization’s general manager of water systems.

For now, Flint is fitting the city with service lines made with another material: copper, at an expected cost of more than $140 million. Officials discussed creating a pilot area using plastic to replace the service lines to houses on several city blocks, according to Plastics News, though a Flint spokeswoman, Kristin Moore, said plastic pipes were not currently under consideration.

“When you take that inherent issue that we needed to rebuild trust of the citizens in the water system, we felt that copper was the way to go,” Michael McDaniel, a retired Michigan National Guard brigadier general put in charge of replacing Flint’s water pipes, said at a conference this year.

In Burton, just next door to Flint, budget realities have made plastics the realistic choice.

The small city of 29,000 saved $2.2 million by using plastic to replace its own 1930s-era water system after state regulators alerted the city to critically needed fixes. For a municipality struggling with a dwindling tax base, those savings were huge.

“We needed safe water, and we needed it fast. We needed to replace the system, and PVC was a good choice for us,” said Burton’s mayor, Paula Zelenko. “I’ve got to get the best bang for the buck, because bucks are hard to come by these days.”",$300 Billion War Beneath the Street: Fighting to Replace America’s Water Pipes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/climate/water-pipes-plastic-lead.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

It begins in the 18th century, with Shakespeare forgers and travel liars; makes its way through the 19th, with P. T. Barnum as a kind of ringmaster/hoaxmaster (among whose incredible acts was Joice Heth, a black woman whom he purported had been George Washington’s nursemaid — which would have made her, in Barnum’s time, 161 years old); and wends through the false memoirs and fake personae of the 20th and 21st. (In Mr. Young’s taxonomy the hoax, unlike a lie, a conspiracy theory or an urban legend, flirts with and delights in the possibility of discovery, at least in its early iterations.)

What the hoax returns to, both underpinning and undermining, Mr. Young found, is race. “I had a hunch that they would often deal with race,” Mr. Young said, but he was struck how often the hoaxes he found came back to the subject.” The hoax lays bare both prejudice (as did Barnum’s exhibiting of a black man as “What Is It?,” the missing link) and pilfering (as in the case of Rachel Dolezal, the former N.A.A.C.P. chapter president who had been living as a black woman until she was outed, in 2015, as white).

Mr. Young’s earlier book, “The Grey Album,” looked at the generative power of storytelling, but “Bunk” takes a bleaker view. The progression of the hoax, as Mr. Young describes it, is one from honor to horror. Early hoaxes validated: a young poet tracing a false genealogy between himself and the greats; Joice Heth providing a direct line between her 19th-century spectators and the father of the country. By the late 20th century, the hoax had turned grim: Mr. Young points to hoaxes like false Holocaust or Benghazi memoirs or even, in his view, Dylann Roof, the Charleston, S.C., shooter, whom Mr. Young sees as acting out in the service of a hoax — the hoax that is racism, in Mr. Young’s view — that perceives blackness, and black people, as a threat.

In its proximity to violence and its ever-more-accessible transmission via the internet, the hoax has metastasized, the stakes raised ever higher in what Mr. Young calls our “Age of Euphemism,” when “fake news” is a rallying cry for any unwelcome report. “In a way, the book is a prehistory to Trump,” said David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker. “Donald Trump didn’t invent —” he used a word he acknowledged would be unpublishable in The Times — “but he has certainly upped the ante.”

The more Mr. Young researched, the more dire today’s hoaxers and hoaxes seem. The modern hoax’s tragic qualities “have overcome whatever triumph the hoax once tried for,” Mr. Young said. “We have more, and worse. They’re worse in their damage and in their intent now. And to see that, and be proven right, or prescient, is a kind of hollow victory.”

The book ends on a raw note: “The half-hoax world seems in no danger of ending — unless it’s to give way to the complete-hoax one.” But asked if he felt any compulsion to begin Volume II, Mr. Young was succinct: “I don’t.”

He has, in any case, other responsibilities at the moment. There is the Schomburg, fresh from a two-year, $22.3 million renovation; he arrived there last fall from Atlanta, where he had been a professor and curator at Emory University. (He retains a visiting post at the school.) There is his next poetry collection, “Brown,” which arrives in April. And now there is The New Yorker, one of the rare mainstream publications that still publishes poetry, where he will be tasked with selecting and editing the poems that appear each week.

The poetry world can be insular, Balkanized and obscure — name three star poets — and The New Yorker is one of the largest conduits between its various inlets and a wider world than most of the poetry journals can hope to attract. “People who are not habitual poetry readers happening to read things that are magical is one of the great happy accidents that can occur reading The New Yorker,” said Mr. Remnick. “Kevin will be a master of those happy accidents.”

As it happens, The New Yorker had some hand in Mr. Young’s development as a poet. As a young teenager in Topeka, Kan., where he spent part of his youth, Mr. Young discovered the yellow-covered paperback “The New Yorker Book of Poems.”

“I carried that thing around with me,” he said. “I recently found my edition — it has little checks next to poems I liked.” (One of them, James Dickey’s “Falling,” introduced Mr. Young to the idea that his own state could have a place in poetry.)

Mr. Young wrote poems of his own from the age of 13, through high school and Harvard, where friends remembered him as an ambitious and driven writer, collecting prizes, the Stegner Fellowship and praise. He published his first book, “Most Way Home,” after it was selected by Lucille Clifton for the National Poetry Series. (He would later edit her collected poems.)

“He always knew what he wanted to do,” said Mr. Whitehead, a friend since college. “When most people were dabbling, he was working. He was well on his way when most of us were listening to Nirvana and wearing dirty clothes.”

Mr. Remnick praised Mr. Young’s “catholic with a small c” taste, something he said he shared with the magazine’s outgoing poetry editor, Paul Muldoon. And Mr. Young, whose first poem in the magazine, “Langston Hughes,” was published in 1999, said he would work to spotlight the wide breadth of American poetry, from its establishment lions to emerging voices. (Of recent note, he said, were Tiana Clark and Kaveh Akbar, both published in the magazine by Mr. Muldoon.)

“It’s an exciting moment, in black poetry and poetry in general,” he said.“I’m really looking forward to that being in the pages.”

O.K., but what kind of poems speak to you?

“I mean, good ones,” Mr. Young said, and chuckled. “I think I go with the Duke Ellington view on music. He said, ‘There’s two kinds of music — there’s good music, and then there’s the other kind.’”

Mr. Young is held to be a champion of the good kind.

“I can’t think of a better person to be the curator of what poetry people should be reading than Kevin,” said Ms. Trethewey, who first met him 20-some years ago as fellow members of the Dark Room Collective, a community of black poets. “I call him ‘The Kevin Young.’ I started calling him that when we first met. He’s certainly grown into it.”","In an Age of Fake News, a Historian of the Hoax",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/books/kevin-young-new-yorker-bunk.html

But three works the Crossing will perform this weekend are different, Mr. Lang said, in particular because of their subtlety and deeply personal nature.

The text for Mr. Hearne’s piece “Consent,” for example, quotes old love letters he has written, as well as text messages that were used in the Steubenville rape case of 2013. An unsettling suite by Mr. Lang, “the national anthems,” repurposes anthem lyrics to reveal how, he said, “our civilization is very fragile, and we are terrified of losing it.”

And Ms. Shaw’s work “To the Hands” contains a movement of spoken numerical figures — data about displaced people around the world — over a solo instrument’s arpeggios that oscillate between beautiful order and unnerving dissonance.

“It’s just a sort of gentle smearing of something that is otherwise comfortable, and over time the repetition is really insidious and potent,” said Ms. Shaw, who made the piece’s parts available for free online with the note that any performance should come with “rigorous solicitation of donations for those without homes (locally and globally).”

In a round-table interview, the composers discussed how they approach political music, and whether musicians even have the right to engage in hot-button issues of the day. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

You write a piece of political music, then it’s performed. What comes next?

DAVID LANG I have my piece “the little match girl passion,” which is about whether people pay attention to homelessness and the suffering of those around us. People frequently use this piece to raise money. One of our jobs is to raise these issues and make these pieces be useful, but the truth is that the amount of money someone can make off a piece of contemporary music is probably pretty tiny compared to the problems of the world. A real point of these pieces is for us to figure out how to be better citizens. An entire community of people may have their minds on this issue, and then go out and change their communities.

TED HEARNE I totally agree. Using that particular piece to raise money is almost beside the point, I think.

What right do composers have to write about things like consent and the refugee crisis?

LANG I think all three of our pieces are about us examining how we feel about these topics. This authenticity question is a really interesting question for me. I think a lot of these issues of people figuring out who has the right to speak are important, and I agree there are some issues where the right to speak is really central to the issue of who actually gets to speak. But the other side of that problem, for me, is that some of these problems are so pervasive in our society that they’re going to need every single person to commit themselves to solving them in order to get addressed.

CAROLINE SHAW I’m not sure I can say that I should or that I can present work that’s meaningful and deeply engages with issues. But I want to try, and I have to keep trying. And I think there’s something about engaging with political issues specifically in choral music because it’s a very community-oriented art. There is, or at least there used to be, a really great tradition of community choirs around the world. You can write something that people sing together and talk about with each other, and that’s where the conversations have to start.

HEARNE I would never try to pretend that I’m not a white man. That’s a part of my identity, so examining that through my work is something that is necessary for me to do to try to get a better understanding of how to live in the world. I think that anybody doing that is valuable. Pretending to speak for somebody who had a completely different experience from you is a different thing.

What makes political music successful?

LANG It’s very hard to have a kind of music that changes someone’s mind without really noticing it. A really incredible piece of art about politics is “The Threepenny Opera.” No one is a good character, and no one tells you what to think. It’s this disturbing situation that’s also really enjoyable with music. The social message is something you have to decode, maybe weeks later as you think about it or sing the songs to yourself.

HEARNE I love “Threepenny Opera.” It’s very inspirational to me. It also has me thinking about ways an artist can use their work to create something that you couldn’t imagine. That’s a metaphor for what you can do in the world. When some formal idea is obliterated or when somebody samples a piece of music that has nothing to do with the genre, it creates this kind of chaos of reference or this juxtaposition that nobody could imagine. That is a political act.

Are there any common mistakes in writing political music?

LANG I never want anyone to think I am ordering them to do or feel something. There’s a lot of music that we listen to in our lives that is very good at making us feel something whether we want to or not, like film music. But when I write a piece of music where I want to cry, I don’t care where anybody else cries, and I don’t want to order anyone to cry at a specific moment. I feel like that’s a problem with political music.

SHAW But there are artists where it is extremely important to be clear exactly what they think and they want you to think that way, like a lot of political hip-hop music. It’s just not how I operate.

John Benedict Hillerman was born on Dec. 20, 1932, in Denison, Tex., about 60 miles north of Dallas, to Christopher and Lenora Hillerman. He was the middle child of three and the only boy. He is survived by his sister Jo Ann Tritico.

He displayed independence at a young age. By age 12 he was driving by himself, and within a few years he was traveling to Dallas to see operas and staying alone in hotels.

But he did not at first see himself onstage. It was not until he was stationed in Fort Worth with the Air Force that he decided to audition for a community theater production of “Death of a Salesman.”

“When I stepped onstage, I experienced the greatest high I’ve ever had in my life,” he recounted in a 1987 interview. “And I said to myself, ‘Hillerman, until this moment, you have been bored.’ ”

He had found his passion. Before he left the Air Force, he had appeared in nearly two dozen plays. He moved to the East Coast and, during 11 years in New York and then four in Washington, he had more than 100 stage roles. But after all those years, he had only $700 in the bank and decided to move to Los Angeles to find better-paying work.

He instantly landed a role in a TV movie but struggled for two years after that to find something else. He eventually reconnected with a friend from New York, the director Peter Bogdanovich, who cast Mr. Hillerman in a number of his films, including “The Last Picture Show” (1971) and “Paper Moon” (1973).

Through the late 1970s, Mr. Hillerman appeared frequently on TV. He played Simon Brimmer, a rival sleuth to the title character, on “Ellery Queen,” and John Elliot, the sarcastic ex-husband of Betty White’s character, on “The Betty White Show.” He also played the boss of Ann Romano (played by Bonnie Franklin) on “One Day at a Time.’’

The role that changed his life came shortly after that. Mr. Selleck had been cast in “Magnum, P.I.,” but CBS was not impressed with the English actors who auditioned for the role of Higgins. As Mr. Hillerman recounted in 1984, Mr. Selleck’s agent recommended him, and he was offered the role two hours after the audition.

What did they think of Mr. Trump, he asked?","Even within Fox News, which fills Mr. Trump’s DVR with hours of daily pep talks, he chooses cozier digs. He dropped by the first week of Fox’s “The Ingraham Angle,” with Laura Ingraham, who spoke at his nominating convention. But he’s been scarce on the more straight-news-oriented shows of Bret Baier and Chris Wallace.

The last time Mr. Trump sat for a TV interview outside his comfort zone was in May, with NBC’s Lester Holt. That was when he volunteered his mind-set in deciding to fire the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who was then leading the probe into Russian election interference. The president said to himself, he recounted, “‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia was a made-up story.’”

There is no such danger in Mr. Trump’s safe space. But it also means he’s not reaching anyone beyond his base — a strategy that, the Republican drubbing in the off-year elections suggests, has its limits.

For his die-hard fans, Mr. Trump sticks to his greatest hits: the media is “fake” (“one of the greatest terms of all I’ve come up with,” he told Mr. Huckabee); we’re going to build the wall; they said we couldn’t get to 270 electoral votes, but we got 306. (Ultimately 304.) He’s speaking to an audience that isn’t watching to see news made or questions answered but to hear, again: We won.

Indeed, Mr. Trump’s interviews with his boosters hardly make news except by accident, as when he defended a lag in diplomatic hiring to Ms. Ingraham by saying, “I’m the only one that matters.”

To understand Mr. Trump as a president, you have to remember that he was a celebrity first, and he still uses the media like a celebrity does. His first remark to Ms. Ingraham about the Republican tax bill was “We’ve gotten really great reviews,” as if he were plugging a new movie on “The Tonight Show.” He repeatedly gave Mr. Hannity his highest honor: praising his Nielsen ratings.

In Mr. Trump’s first celebrity phase, as a brass-plated capitalist cartoon in the ’80s and ’90s, he was a media gadfly. He chased the cameras, planted his name in the tabloids and exchanged locker-room talk with Howard Stern. The point, then, was to be outrageous, to stir the pot. There was no such thing as bad attention.

This was the approach that the candidate Trump used, keeping CNN and “Morning Joe” on speed dial, taking advantage of billions of dollars of free media to ensure that he was the protagonist of the election. For a while, in 2015 and 2016, he was freely available on TV, proving that he could shoot off his mouth in a Fifth Avenue studio and still not lose his voters.

Mr. Trump’s second celebrity era was as the host, star and grand prize of “The Apprentice.” There, editors imposed a linear arc on his vagabond sentences, gave coherence to his impulsive decisions. “The Apprentice” had a vested interest in plumping him up — to be the best show, it needed to make him into the best businessman. It styled him to appear successful, decisive, wise, desired and obeyed.

Now, as president, Mr. Trump has delegated the job of reality producer to friendly media outlets. Where other interviewers would challenge or press for details, his chosen hosts do the clarifying for him and offer him talking points couched as questions. “Are you getting the credit for this economic revival?” Ms. Ingraham asked.

Above all, they offer affirmation, and Mr. Trump basks in it like the first warming light of creation. At the Pennsylvania interview on Oct. 11, Mr. Hannity engaged the home-team crowd as if hosting a live “Apprentice” finale. What did they think of Mr. Trump, he asked? (Yay!) What about Congress? (Boo!) And what about the media? (Booooo!)

It’s that cheering crowd, one suspects, that is really driving the dynamic here. The point of all the delicate meringue questions is not simply to avoid challenging the president. It’s to avoid challenging the audience.

These interviews are a reciprocal exchange for a closed circle. The base gets to cheer its leader and boo the haters. The interviewers get to prove their loyalty, presenting themselves as official Trump-endorsed products.

And the president gets to end the exchange nodding and smiling, like someone who knows he has gotten the better part of the deal.",President Trump Finds His TV Niche in Softball Interviews,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/arts/television/president-trump-finds-his-tv-niche-in-softball-interviews.html

The antidoping regulator seized the opportunity on Friday to restate another request: that Russia accept the findings of McLaren’s inquiry, which confirmed that top government officials and Russia’s Federal Security Service had assisted with coordinated cheating.

“This new intelligence serves to reinforce our requirement of Russian authorities that they too publicly accept the outcomes,” of last year’s investigation, the global antidoping agency’s president, Craig Reedie, said in a statement.

Through Mr. McLaren’s inquiry, the antidoping watchdog deconstructed Russia’s cheating schemes and determined that some 1,000 athletes had been tied up in them over three and a half years. Still, officials determined that many individual cases would be hard or impossible to prosecute, in part because of Russia’s lack of cooperation in providing certain evidence, including stored urine samples and the electronic lab records on past tests.

Antidoping officials from several countries who have urged Olympics leaders to take a harder stance against Russia in the wake of Mr. McLaren’s investigation — even calling for the nation to be barred from the Pyeongchang Games — have pointed to Russia’s refusal to turn over the electronic data.

The World Anti-Doping Agency had ordered Russia to share the database before the watchdog would agree to restore Russia to good standing and certify its compliance with the global antidoping code. The agency is due to evaluate Russia’s cooperation and decide whether to recertify the nation at a meeting next week in Seoul.

Investigators who have studied how Russia corrupted several Olympics — most notably the 2014 Sochi Games, where the country controlled the antidoping laboratory and dominated the medal standings — have coveted the electronic files from Moscow.

Known as laboratory information management system data, the records reflect the results of lab tests run on the machines in Russia’s national antidoping lab, a nondescript five-story building a few miles from the Kremlin. They also reveal the identity of the athlete to whom each lab analysis corresponded.

Outside of international competitions, nations are responsible for drug-testing their own athletes and for reporting the results of those tests to a global database. In Russia, however, the national antidoping laboratory alerted the nation’s sports ministry when athletes tested positive, and they often followed a deputy sports minister’s directive to falsely report positive drug tests as clean results to international authorities, according to both Mr. McLaren and the former longtime director of Russia’s lab, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov.

In an inquiry report published last December, Mr. McLaren said that he had uncovered records that more than 500 such incriminating tests were falsely recorded from 2011 to 2015.

“Well-known and elite level athletes had their initial results automatically falsified,” he wrote, noting that, without access to Russia’s lab data and forensic analysis of it, the extent of similar discrepancies and the full scope of cheating could not possibly be known.

But if the database now in the regulator’s possession reveals new inconsistencies in the testing histories of Russian athletes, sports officials could mount strong disciplinary cases.

Without a positive drug test, it can be challenging to build a case against an athlete that will withstand a legal challenge. To date, Olympics officials have issued sanctions against six Russian Olympians who competed in Sochi and exonerated another; investigations into scores of others are continuing.

Global officials from each sport have separately been asked to review allegations against hundreds of athletes. The antidoping regulator itself has agreed to close at least 95 such suspicious cases identified by Mr. McLaren based on a lack of evidence.

The International Olympic Committee is expected to announced its decision regarding Russia’s participation in the 2018 Winter Games in early December.

Louis C.K. on Friday released a statement in response to a report published Thursday in The New York Times about several women who stepped forward to discuss experiences with him in which he committed acts of sexual misconduct. In his statement, Louis C.K. said, “These stories are true.”

[Louis C.K. Admits to Misconduct as Media Companies Cut Ties]

The complete statement from Louis C.K. appears below:

I want to address the stories told to The New York Times by five women named Abby, Rebecca, Dana, Julia who felt able to name themselves and one who did not.

These stories are true. At the time, I said to myself that what I did was O.K. because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true. But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn’t a question. It’s a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly. I have been remorseful of my actions. And I’ve tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I’m aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men who would never have put them in that position. I also took advantage of the fact that I was widely admired in my and their community, which disabled them from sharing their story and brought hardship to them when they tried because people who look up to me didn’t want to hear it. I didn’t think that I was doing any of that because my position allowed me not to think about it. There is nothing about this that I forgive myself for. And I have to reconcile it with who I am. Which is nothing compared to the task I left them with. I wish I had reacted to their admiration of me by being a good example to them as a man and given them some guidance as a comedian, including because I admired their work.

The hardest regret to live with is what you’ve done to hurt someone else. And I can hardly wrap my head around the scope of hurt I brought on them. I’d be remiss to exclude the hurt that I’ve brought on people who I work with and have worked with who’s professional and personal lives have been impacted by all of this, including projects currently in production: the cast and crew of Better Things, Baskets, The Cops, One Mississippi, and I Love You, Daddy. I deeply regret that this has brought negative attention to my manager Dave Becky who only tried to mediate a situation that I caused. I’ve brought anguish and hardship to the people at FX who have given me so much The Orchard who took a chance on my movie. and every other entity that has bet on me through the years. I’ve brought pain to my family, my friends, my children and their mother.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — Today’s constructor, Natan Last, has taken the road less traveled, at least in his career.

“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I —

I took the one less traveled by,

And that has made all the difference.” — Robert Frost

Mr. Last’s puzzle not only uses the title of Robert Frost’s 1916 poem “THE ROAD NOT TAKEN” as a seed entry, but he shows us how to (almost) effortlessly make that detour when necessary.

Today’s Theme

Five phrases take a masterful detour as we make our way from left to right in today’s puzzle. One of things I liked about today’s theme is that the entire puzzle is solvable even if you don’t take those detours.

For example, Mr. Last’s seed entry, THE ROAD NOT TAKEN is clued as “1916 Frost verse … or, diverged: Start of a saying about meaning well.” It’s a central Across entry, but once you get to the “N” in NOT, the road diverges into shaded/circled squares and becomes THE ROAD TO HELL. That’s the start to the saying, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.”

But so far, those pledges have proved inadequate. Most industrialized countries — from Europe to Japan to the United States — aren’t on track to meet their emissions goals. And even if they were, the current pledges put the world on course to heat up 3 degrees Celsius or more, an outcome with a far greater risk of destabilizing ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, drastic sea-level rise and more destructive heat waves and droughts. To stay well below 2 degrees, countries would need to cut back fossil-fuel emissions far more rapidly than they’ve promised so far.

In 2018, leaders plan to assess their efforts to date and discuss what further action could help lessen the odds of drastic global warming — with the goal of crafting newer, stronger national pledges by 2020. But before they can do any of that, they need to agree to formal ground rules for that exercise. That “rule book” will be a focus at Bonn.

How do countries plan to make progress on climate change?

One widely recognized problem with the current Paris pledges is that they’re fairly vague.

China promised that its emissions would peak around 2030, but the country’s energy data is notoriously murky, so it’s hard to tell how much progress it’s actually making. Similarly, the European Union vowed to cut emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, but offered few specifics on how to achieve that goal — making it hard to gauge whether European policymakers could realistically be doing much more.

At Bonn, negotiators will be discussing how to make these pledges more rigorous and transparent, so that countries can more readily be held accountable for their actions. That means tackling questions like: What’s the best way to track nations’ progress, to see if they’re doing what they said they would do? Is there a way to tell if a country’s pledge could be made more ambitious? Which specific policies are working well and which aren’t?

Because the Paris pledges are largely voluntary — world leaders would have never agreed to a deal otherwise — no one can force governments to take additional action. But, the idea goes, if pledges and policies are made more transparent, world leaders will be better able to pressure and help each other to do more.

The final draft of this “rule book” is not due until next year, and it may not actually get finished at Bonn, but negotiators are hoping to make significant progress on a long list of items at these talks. As always, diplomacy tends to proceed fitfully.

What role will the United States play?

Even though the Trump administration has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement, the United States can’t formally exit the climate talks until 2020. So the State Department is sending a small team of negotiators to discuss some of the details of the pact.

The United States and China will still preside over a working group on transparency, though it remains to be seen how much influence American officials can wield.

The administration will also hold an event in Bonn with representatives from energy companies to promote coal, natural gas and nuclear power as solutions to global warming. Other countries are expected to view the American push to promote fossil fuels with a wary eye.

In the meantime, a coalition of pro-Paris governors and other officials plan to attend the conference to tout efforts that states, cities and businesses are making to reduce emissions despite the Trump administration’s stance — highlighting the country’s deep divide over climate policy.

What big disagreements might arise in Bonn?

Discussions around the “rule book” for assessing and ratcheting up pledges could prove contentious. In the past, for instance, the United States has insisted that developing countries be held to the same strict monitoring standards as wealthy countries, while China and India have pushed for a bifurcated system.

Developing countries have also argued that they need financial aid from wealthier nations to expand clean energy and adapt to the ravages of climate change.

The government of Fiji is presiding over the Bonn conference, which will put the spotlight on issues like “loss and damage” — that is, whether wealthy nations should compensate island nations and other poorer countries for the droughts, storms and rising sea levels that their emissions are causing. The Paris agreement broached this issue only briefly, and industrialized nations have resisted calls to be held legally liable for their role in warming the planet.

What’s the best-case scenario from Bonn? What’s the worst?

Some climate advocates are hoping for a relatively low-key conference that makes modest progress on issues like transparency and climate finance. In this scenario, American officials would play a quietly constructive role in helping craft the rule book for ratcheting up pledges. And nonstate actors, including cities and businesses, would continue to press forward on efforts to tackle climate change outside of the formal United Nations process.

Conversely, it’s entirely possible that the Trump administration’s rejection of the Paris deal could lead other countries to disengage from global efforts to address climate change. Or the talks could get bogged down by the traditional rifts between richer and poorer nations. That, in turn, could stall momentum right before the next big round of climate talks in 2018 — when countries are supposed to get down to the details of what’s needed to step up their climate policies going forward.",What’s at Stake in the Bonn Climate Talks?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/climate/bonn-climate-change-conference.html
215,"['company', 'turn', 'tech', 'selfdriving', 'companies', 'car', 'detroit', 'fords', 'ford', 'cars', 'autonomous', 'vehicles']","Silicon Valley futurists, in typically sanguine fashion, predict that we are months, not years, away from a Cambrian explosion of autonomous cars.
Despite its pragmatic restraint, Ford has invested hundreds of millions in self-driving cars and is making surprising progress.
Which means that Argo is an independent company, but only barely — 40 of its 230 employees are transfers from Ford, and Ford is its only corporate partner.
Ford wants Argo to look and feel like a nimble tech start-up, not a subsidiary of a century-old auto company.
“The narrative, probably even two years ago, would have been ‘tech companies win, autos lose,’ ” he said.","On a sunny afternoon in early October, I drove across a parking lot in Ann Arbor, Mich., and down a sloping road to a second, private lot. A fence lining the lot’s perimeter was covered in black fabric, as if to deter snoops. Behind it was a 32-acre Potemkin village. There were paved roads with names and signs: Liberty Street, Main Street, Wolverine Avenue. There was a traffic roundabout, a covered underpass and a railroad crossing. There were cosmetic props, too — newspaper boxes, sidewalk benches, a row of fake storefronts.

Mcity, as the facility is known, was built by the University of Michigan as a testing ground for automakers, including Ford, which has been experimenting with self-driving cars here for about two years. I parked my rental and climbed into the back of a white Ford Fusion with four spinning Lidar sensors on the roof, each roughly the size of a water glass, and a rack of high-performance computers in the trunk. Next to me sat Randy Visintainer, Ford’s director of autonomous vehicle development. Jakob Hoellerbauer, a young Ford engineer, took the driver’s seat. Wayne Williams, a Ford research scientist, sat beside him in the passenger seat typing on a laptop. We put on our seatbelts, and Hoellerbauer hit the ignition and pulled into the road. A beep came from the dashboard, indicating that the car was ready to engage self-driving mode. Hoellerbauer pushed a button on the steering wheel and took his hands away.

“We are now autonomous,” Williams announced.

The car glided along Main Street to a four-way stop, waited for another car (driven by a researcher) to clear the intersection, then made a gentle right turn. Autonomous cars are programmed to drive conservatively, and any time our Fusion sensed an approaching object — like a Ford employee, role-playing an oblivious pedestrian — it slowed down until it was sure the path was clear, then proceeded cautiously. It felt like being chauffeured by an elderly ghost.

Two minutes into the drive, the car pulled around a traffic circle and up to a blinking red light at an empty intersection. It stopped. A few seconds passed. Perhaps, I thought, it was just being characteristically risk-averse. Then a few more seconds passed, and the engineers started to look nervous. Williams squinted at his laptop.

“So right now, we’re not sure if the intersection is clear, so we’re being very cautious,” Williams said, speaking for the car. “It’s expecting ...” He trailed off and turned to Hoellerbauer. “Why don’t you just overtake it?” Hoellerbauer grabbed the wheel and tapped the gas pedal, overriding the self-driving system and manually steering us through the intersection.

“We didn’t see that happen this morning,” Williams explained, by way of an apology. We took another lap around Mcity, and when we reached the intersection again, the car did the exact same thing.

Self-driving cars raise the specter of horrific malfunctions — a code glitch that sends a car careering off a cliff, a remote hack that disables the brakes — but perfectly innocuous problems like the one we experienced will be far more common, and no less an impediment to road-readiness. There are dozens of autonomous vehicles being tested all over the world — 43 companies are testing 295 different self-driving vehicles in California alone — and not one of them has a clean record. A self-driving Uber vehicle zoomed through a red light in San Francisco last year. The sensors on cars used by Waymo, the self-driving-car division of Alphabet, Google’s corporate parent, have struggled in heavy rain and snow. I’ve had half a dozen self-driving-car experiences in my life, including a white-knuckle trip down Manhattan’s West Side Highway in a Tesla Model X whose owner had set it to “autopilot” mode, and I wouldn’t describe any of them as relaxing.

How quickly these rides will improve depends on whom you ask. Silicon Valley futurists, in typically sanguine fashion, predict that we are months, not years, away from a Cambrian explosion of autonomous cars. Waymo has a pilot program for its self-driving vehicles already underway in Arizona and says it’s “really close” to being fully operational. Lyft, which has partnered with a start-up called Drive.ai, is aiming to have a fleet of self-driving cars operating in the Bay Area by the end of the year. And Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, which has offered semiautonomous features since 2015, has suggested that its cars could be fully autonomous as soon as 2019.

But that’s California, where optimism is the coin of the realm. In Detroit, the timeline looks slower and more incremental. Ford, in particular, believes that the first generation of driverless cars will be limited, capable of traveling only in commercial fleets inside carefully plotted urban areas. Other cars will simply get smarter without being autonomous, with features like collision prevention and self-parking becoming more common. Self-driving technology will eventually be more sophisticated and will one day be capable of full door-to-door autonomy in every possible area and condition, but as Ford sees it, that’s not going to happen overnight, or even very soon.

Despite its pragmatic restraint, Ford has invested hundreds of millions in self-driving cars and is making surprising progress. In a report earlier this year, Navigant Research placed Ford at the top of its leader board, ahead of tech companies like Waymo and Uber as well as auto rivals like GM and Toyota, based on Ford’s advanced manufacturing capabilities coupled with its strides in software development. The report generated headlines like, “Detroit Is Kicking Silicon Valley’s Ass in the Race to Build Self-Driving Cars,” and delivered a morale boost to Ford, which showed up late but finally felt as if it had a chance.

Ford’s big, blinking target is 2021 — the year it hopes to release a vehicle that meets the Society of Automotive Engineers International’s definition of Level 4 autonomy (no human operator required in the area and conditions it’s programmed for). It’s a tough deadline for a company whose culture might be the exact opposite of Silicon Valley’s, where companies release half-finished “minimum viable products” and abide by maxims like “move fast and break things.” Before Ford — or any conventional automaker — produces anything, each part has to pass a grueling battery of tests and certifications. There is a reason “automotive grade” has become a synonym for “reliable.” “Our vehicles have to be a trusted product,” Chris Brewer, Ford’s chief engineer for autonomous vehicles, told me. “That is a little more important than ‘Did my phone freeze or not?’ ”

Americans are wary of driverless cars — 56 percent, according to the Pew Research Center, would prefer not to ride in one — and when I talked to Brewer, it occurred to me that some part of that hesitation might stem from who we assume will be producing them: Silicon Valley tech giants, the same stateless behemoths that have spent the last few decades barging into old-line industries like the Kool-Aid Man, destroying working-class jobs and leaving behind cold, modern efficiency. But maybe these skeptics could be persuaded to trust Detroit. After all, Brewer is right — self-driving cars aren’t smartphones. They’re two-ton projectiles that take your parents to the grocery store and your kids to soccer practice, that will need to make billions of computational decisions per second while moving at 65 miles per hour, that contain within them the power to extinguish human life. You kind of want them to take a while.

Leading Ford into this weird new era is Jim Hackett, who was named chief executive in May. Hackett, 62, is an oddity by Detroit standards. A design-minded aesthete in an industry dominated by gearheads and number crunchers, he spent two decades running Steelcase, a Michigan-based office-furniture company whose designers are often credited with — or blamed for — popularizing the open-plan office trend.

At a conference several years ago, Hackett struck up a conversation with Ford’s executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., who goes by Bill. He is the great-grandson of Henry Ford, and another auto-world misfit — an outspoken environmentalist who once ruffled feathers at Ford by speaking at a Greenpeace event. The two bonded over their shared vision of “smart mobility,” a fuzzy term, more common among urbanists than businesspeople, for creating a sort of harmony among land use, technology and transportation of all forms. Hackett joined Ford’s board of directors in 2013. In 2016, Bill Ford persuaded Hackett to lead Ford’s newly created smart-mobility unit, and about a year later, he tapped him to run the entire company.

Hackett’s jockish C.V. — he played football at Michigan and briefly ran the school’s athletic department — masks his high-minded streak, which can make talking to him feel like taking a college philosophy seminar after a few bong rips. In the early 2000s, he began traveling to the Santa Fe Institute, a research group started by prominent scientists who wanted to study “complex adaptive systems” — a branch of theoretical physics that imagines the world as a series of complicated networks that are governed by universal laws and patterns, the same way biology is guided by Darwinian evolution. The rules that explained how anthills formed, they believed, might also explain urbanization trends in Southeast Asia or predict economic cycles. It was a formative experience for Hackett, who began to believe that businesses were governed by universal laws, too.

Hackett also became obsessed with “design thinking,” a new-agey management philosophy that has become trendy in recent years. Adherents believe that instead of optimizing for profit, organizations should put human emotion at the center of every strategy decision and begin by empathizing with their customers. “No technology ever evolves without the human interpreting and altering it,” Hackett says. “Every new technology, the science and the engineering of it, has to give way to human understanding and use.”

Hackett is only six months into the chief-executive job, but his mannerisms have already entered Ford’s bloodstream. I arrived in Dearborn expecting to talk about drivetrains and crankshafts, but in a series of interviews with nearly a dozen executives, barely anyone mentioned cars or trucks at all. Instead, I heard the Ford Motor Company described as a “mobility solutions provider” that engages in “multimodal journey planning.” People spoke about “whiteboarding” and “blue-skying” big ideas. I watched a video that described Ford’s efforts to build a “holistic, organic, interconnected system powered by a transportation operating system.”

It is bizarre to watch an all-American manufacturing company get brain-snatched like this. Even the company’s new internal mission statement bears Hackett’s woolly imprint: “To become the world’s most trusted mobility company by designing smart vehicles for a smart world.” It’s not exactly “Built Ford Tough.” But it’s very much in keeping with Hackett’s worldview, in which everything exists in connection with everything else, and changing one piece of a system necessarily changes the whole. A car learns to drive itself, and a city’s transportation grid shifts around it.

This kind of big-picture futurism is necessary in Detroit today, where automakers are frantically reinventing themselves to stay ahead of what they fear might be coming. The average personal vehicle is driven less than an hour per day. But self-driving cars can, in theory, pick up and drop off passengers all day, which significantly reduces the number of cars a community needs. (Researchers at the University of Michigan estimate that autonomous vehicles could cause car ownership to drop by as much as 43 percent. Lyft, which has a horse in the race, cites research estimating that as many as 80 percent of cars could eventually be eliminated.) And because much of the value of self-driving cars lies in the software that runs them, companies that make only hardware — known in the business as “original equipment manufacturers,” or O.E.M.s — are likely to be squeezed, or worse.

Faced with visions of a bleak future as low-margin widget-builders for Silicon Valley, automakers have spent the past several years trying to catch up. General Motors spent $581 million to buy Cruise Automation, a self-driving-technology start-up. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles struck a deal with Waymo, in addition to partnering with BMW and Intel. Daimler and Volvo each joined with Uber, and Toyota set up a whole research institute in Silicon Valley to build its own self-driving vehicles.

Ford’s plans might be the most ambitious. It wants to have a hand in every part of the self-driving-car industry, including the software that replaces the human driver, the platform that connects and controls the cars and the services that spring up around them. To that end, Ford has spent the past several years quietly snapping up tech talent. It struck a partnership with Lyft and acquired Chariot, a San Francisco-based start-up that runs group shuttles for commuters. It set up an office in Palo Alto that now has 205 employees and created Greenfield Labs, a business incubator. It invested in Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based artificial-intelligence start-up, and several other companies, including Velodyne, which makes Lidar sensors, and a connected-car software outfit called Autonomic.

Most industry observers believe these are the right moves for Ford to be making. But it’s still tough to reconcile today’s Ford — which makes money by selling millions of combustion-engine trucks and S.U.V.s every year, along with a handful of sedans and hybrids — with the eco-tech-mobility conglomerate Hackett envisions it becoming. One lesson Hackett learned from his studies is that in order to stay competitive, businesses often have to give up the things that made them great in the first place. (He calls this the “perversity law.”) I asked him if this meant that Ford would need to stop manufacturing conventional, gas-powered vehicles to survive.

“Well, part of that statement might be right,” he said. “Right now, that doesn’t make sense.” He clarified, sort of: “I’m really just trying to say the better form of problem solving is to abstract the problems.”

So let’s try abstracting Ford’s problems, to see how they might be solved. First: Ford was born at the beginning of a now-outmoded era of industrial production, one that it arguably ushered in. Back then, companies like Ford simply manufactured goods, and customers bought them. Those transactions represented a change of ownership — a customer who bought a car from Ford was free to install 15-inch subwoofers in it, or paint it bright yellow, or use it in a demolition derby — and they were typically one-time sales. Ford’s responsibility for the car, and its opportunity to make a profit, ended the minute the warranty ran out.

The internet changed that, by allowing companies to wrap physical goods in digital services that can be sold again and again, at much higher margins. Instead of selling servers to corporate I.T. departments, Amazon sells them time shares on a centralized server farm; instead of buying pricey home solar panels, customers can lease them from a solar service, paying for only the power they use. Makers of thermostats, baby monitors and other household gadgets “extend the value chain” by charging customers a monthly fee for information about their home energy use or their babies’ sleep patterns. Even the language these new enterprises use is different. Goods-based businesses spoke in terms of revenues and profits. Service-based businesses count metrics like “churn,” “average revenue per user” and “lifetime value” — the total amount of money they can wring from a customer.

This phenomenon — which is sometimes referred to as “everything as a service,” abbreviated as XaaS and pronounced “zass,” among the kinds of people who say these things out loud — has quietly reshaped the entire economy. Trucking companies that once bought Michelin tires now rent them through a pay-per-mile service. Airlines that buy $15 million jet engines from General Electric can subscribe to OnPoint, a “power by the hour” program that includes maintenance costs and data-analysis tools. G.E. Aviation now makes the better part of its revenue from services like these.

The auto industry was slow to come to grips with this new model — in part because it long ago gave away the entire service piece of its business to gas stations, body shops, Jiffy Lubes and a hundred other barnacle industries. Thanks to old and byzantine state laws, most carmakers aren’t even allowed to sell or lease directly to their customers — every transaction has to go through an independent dealer. When it comes to data, automakers are flying blind. As Reilly P. Brennan, a venture capitalist who invests in self-driving technology, put it to me: “The urinal in the men’s bathroom knows more about its users than most carmakers in 2017.”

With self-driving cars, automakers see a chance to fix that. Ford’s executives talk hopefully about one day offering their own suite of software inside their autonomous vehicles, and building interfaces that companies like Netflix and Skype could plug into. They don’t see themselves usurping Silicon Valley, exactly, but they do see themselves playing in the same league. “Two to three years ago, the tech community was holding the auto industry at arm’s length,” said Ken Washington, Ford’s chief technology officer. “They thought we were sort of this curious industry that they could come into and disrupt.” He went on: “Now, when I go to Silicon Valley and I interact with tech companies, it’s a dynamic of much more intense interest in collaborating with us.”

Collaboration takes many forms, of course, and not all tech companies seem interested in an equal partnership. John Krafcik, the chief executive of Waymo, told me that while traditional auto companies “bring a lot to the party” in terms of hardware expertise, they’re not well equipped to solve the software-based problem of replacing a human driver, which requires huge teams of highly skilled engineers and tremendous amounts of technological infrastructure — the kinds of tools available to only a Google sibling company. “The self-driving aspect is really supercomplicated,” Krafcik said. “We’ve spent the last nine years trying to solve that puzzle. It requires a lot of skills.” It also requires focus, which is a problem for companies that still sell millions of conventional cars and trucks a year, that have thousands of employees to pay and quarterly results to deliver, that can’t exactly drop everything and become software companies.

In Detroit, cautious optimism prevails. But outside Detroit, there are real doubts that any auto company can transform itself quickly enough. “Autonomous vehicles are not an incremental shift,” said Carol Reiley, a founder of Drive.ai. “It’s a very transformative shift, almost like moving from the horse and carriage to the car.” Like many tech executives, Reiley saw Detroit’s quest to control the self-driving-car industry as tactically sound but ultimately a long shot. “I don’t know if they can make it,” she said. “There’s a lot of baggage.”

A week after my Detroit trip, I visited the Pittsburgh offices of Argo AI, the artificial-intelligence start-up that is creating the software brains for Ford’s self-driving vehicles. Ford is investing $1 billion for a majority stake and controls two of Argo’s five board seats. Which means that Argo is an independent company, but only barely — 40 of its 230 employees are transfers from Ford, and Ford is its only corporate partner.

Argo’s headquarters is in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, a formerly industrial area just outside downtown that has become a center of driverless-car activity. (Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group is down the street.) Its office is a high-ceilinged space in a modern office building with conference rooms named for famous scientists: Planck, Descartes, Hopper. When I arrived, engineers were eating catered lunch at their standing desks. Squint and ignore the smokestacks outside, and you could be in San Francisco — which is sort of the point. Ford wants Argo to look and feel like a nimble tech start-up, not a subsidiary of a century-old auto company.

I was greeted by Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander, Argo AI’s founders, both well-known figures in the small self-driving-car world. They had been special-faculty members at Carnegie Mellon’s prestigious robotics-engineering program, and Salesky competed in the 2007 Darpa Urban Challenge, a storied self-driving-vehicle race whose alumni now populate the top ranks of the autonomous-vehicle industry. Salesky went to Google to build self-driving cars; Rander went to Uber. They quit their jobs and started Argo AI in November of last year, and in February, with no real product to speak of, and hardly any employees, they announced that they had raised huge sums of money from Ford.

The day before my visit, Salesky made waves with a bombastic post on the company’s blog, in which he accused the autonomous-vehicle industry of overselling its progress. “Those who think fully self-driving vehicles will be ubiquitous on city streets months from now or even in a few years,” he wrote, “are not well connected to the state of the art or committed to the safe deployment of the technology.” It was a rare role reversal — the software engineer throwing up caution flags — and, perhaps, evidence that Ford is trying to stall for time. Officially, Argo is still aiming for Ford’s 2021 target, but Salesky waffled on the firmness of that deadline, saying there’s a chance a true Level 4 autonomous vehicle could be finished later, or possibly sooner. “It’s ready when it’s ready,” he told me.

Salesky freely admitted that he is playing catch-up. Ford won’t share statistics about its self-driving test cars, but public records from California give some sense of what it’s up against. Last year, Ford, which does most of its testing in Michigan and Arizona, logged just 590 autonomous miles in the state, while Waymo’s vehicles logged 635,867 miles. Argo is also building its code from scratch and doesn’t have access to the digital infrastructure that competitors like Waymo and Uber do. “We’re not out there trying to tell everyone we’re going to be first or beat X, Y or Z company,” Salesky said. “The goal is to get to market with something that can scale up.”

But, he reiterated, this is a hard problem. Driving is a miracle of neurobiological coordination that involves the flawless simultaneous execution of a billion tiny and subtle reflexes, and it turns out that’s a more complicated task for a computer than teaching it to play chess or compete on game shows. A self-driving car has to correctly identify and label millions of objects, understand city layouts and traffic laws and operate in a variety of road conditions. It has to be taught to handle everyday driving hazards (high-speed merges) and rarer incidents (objects in the road), as well as issues that would never affect a human driver (a chunk of debris that flies up and knocks out a sensor).

In order to work properly, a self-driving car also has to understand how humans behave. It needs to know the difference between a car that is idling in the right-hand lane (in which case the autonomous vehicle should steer around it) and one that is about to parallel park (in which case the vehicle should stay in its lane, giving the other car some room). It needs to predict that the jogger running toward the corner will stop for traffic, but that the kid running to chase a basketball might not. It needs to be able to navigate a four-way stop, which in polite parts of the country involves lots of eye contact and you-first hand gestures. “This goes beyond just seeing and understanding the world,” Salesky said. “It means understanding what each of the actors in the world is going to do.”

In other words, driving isn’t just a mechanical task — it’s a social act, and in order to coexist with human drivers, self-driving cars will need to develop a level of social awareness that approaches that of a full-fledged A.I. This is why some computer scientists think Waymo is going to be unbeatable. As an Alphabet company, Waymo has access to some of the best engineering talent in A.I., along with Google’s enormous data troves and the machine-learning systems that have been trained using that data. In other words, the vast data-harvesting powers that make Google’s consumer products so creepy could also make Waymo’s vehicles better at navigating the physical world.

But all this obsessive focus on tech elides a much more foundational question about our relationship to cars. Tech companies tend to view driving as a functional problem — get safely from Point A to Point B as quickly as possible — in which the vehicle itself is largely an extraneous variable. A car might begin its life as a Toyota or a Hyundai, but once it’s autonomous and on a ride-sharing network, it’s just an Uber. Silicon Valley believes that software, not hardware, is what matters to riders, and this will be especially true of self-driving cars — which, at least in early days, will most likely be shared among strangers.

But Detroit has spent decades and billions of advertising dollars persuading us that its mass-produced cars are anything but homogeneous metal boxes — that they carry profound talismanic qualities that transfer to their owners. You can be an F-150 woman or a Mustang man, and those choices signal tribal affiliations that extend far past the act of driving. Ford’s challenge, then, is keeping these storied brands alive for the consumers who still obsess over them, while Argo builds the software that will satisfy the car-agnostic city dwellers. It’s a tricky balancing act, made even more complicated by the politics of a 114-year-old Detroit manufacturing company lashing its fate to a one-year-old Pittsburgh tech start-up, and vice versa. “They’ve put a lot of trust in us,” Salesky said. “We’ve also put a lot of trust in them.”

The hall connecting the C-suites at Ford’s headquarters was a mess when I visited in October: exposed wiring, plastic sheeting hanging from the walls. As I made my way to Bill Ford’s office, my P.R. escorts offered an explanation. Parts of the floor were being reimagined as an open-plan creative space, and the chaos had spilled outward. When we reached the end of the hall, Ford welcomed me into his office, a midcentury wooden cavern with a fish tank built into one wall and a panoramic view of Dearborn along the other. The dreary vista stood in stark relief with the golden-era artifacts in Ford’s office: the replica of a 1956-57 Continental Mark II that was designed by his father, William Clay Ford Sr.; a desk that belonged to his grandfather, Edsel Ford.

Bill Ford has been working in the family business for 38 years and spent most of that time as an iconoclast. His interest in “smart mobility” — which amounts to an interest in reducing the number of cars on the road — was until recently considered heretical. But the past few years have vindicated his predictions. He thinks that the coming convergence of tech and transportation could turn Detroit and Silicon Valley into permanent collaborators. He started Fontinalis Partners, a venture-capital fund outside Ford, to invest in mobility start-ups, and flies regularly to San Francisco to meet with entrepreneurs working on transportation-related projects.

“The narrative, probably even two years ago, would have been ‘tech companies win, autos lose,’ ” he said. “What’s happened, though, is there’s been a realization that we have a lot more intellectual property than the world realized,” by which he means celebrated lines like the F-150, along with some proprietary under-the-hood technology that I won’t pretend to understand. “Second, we really know how to integrate a lot of what the tech companies have into our vehicles, and we know how to make vehicles as well.”

I was struck by how frequently this simple point is deployed at Ford: We know how to make stuff, and making stuff isn’t easy. At first, I dismissed it as a naïve attempt to steer a conversation about Detroit’s shortcomings back toward its strengths. Apple taught suppliers halfway across the world how to make iPhones with micron-level precision — how hard could it be to slap some metal together and put it on wheels?

But making cars isn’t like making other things. It’s a dizzying logistical ballet that involves heavy machinery, grueling labor and countless opportunities for error. It’s wrangling union contracts while keeping the line moving. It’s paying people enough to ensure that they won’t miss a loose bolt and kill someone. It’s designing objects that not only work well but also fill a psychological need for buyers. In the end, maybe the self-driving-car race will be decided not purely on technological achievement, but also on these much more prosaic questions — who can make good things and persuade people to use them?

Three Asian-American Chefs Share Recipes for Meaningful Dishes T asked three chefs to reflect on meals that speak to their experience growing up with two cultures.

American chefs of Asian descent are changing the way we eat, reclaiming the ingredients and flavors of their childhoods and making of them a new cuisine. We asked three to share recipes that speak to their experience of growing up in two cultures: Angela Dimayuga, the daughter of Filipino immigrants and, until recently, executive chef of the eclectic Mission Chinese Food in New York; Diep Tran, the owner of Good Girl Dinette , a Vietnamese diner in Highland Park, Los Angeles, whose family came to the U.S. as refugees from Saigon; and the Korean-born Deuki Hong, who spent his childhood in Texas, Alabama and New Jersey and now runs the Korean fried-chicken pop-up Sunday Bird in the back of a bubble-tea shop in San Francisco.

Video The former chef of Mission Chinese Food in New York describes her take on garlic fried rice, a traditional Filipino breakfast staple.

Shiso Fried Rice

Angela Dimayuga, formerly of Mission Chinese Food

In this vivid and deceptively simple dish, Dimayuga finds unexpected kinship between the Filipino breakfast tradition of fried rice with smashed garlic; a memory of umeshiso hand rolls at the end of a Japanese omakase; purple sweet potatoes in a temple meal by the Korean Buddhist nun Jeong Kwan; and, for the regal plating, a book of 17th-century banquets in honor of Queen Christina of Sweden.

“An herb-forward garlic fried rice with pops of sour notes from umeboshi, or pickled Japanese plums. Using a garlic butter, quickly fry jasmine rice with purple sweet potatoes, and garnish with lots of shiso, umeboshi and cucumber. The base of this dish is inspired by Filipino garlic fried rice which is usually a breakfast staple using day-old rice. It is also inspired by two favorites: the shiso fried rice at En Brasserie in New York, and umeshiso hand rolls which are typically something I order at the end of a sushi omakase meal.” — Angela Dimayuga

∙ 2 tablespoons butter

∙ 1 piece garlic, smashed

∙ ½ purple sweet potato, steamed, and crumbled into chunks

∙ 1 quart steamed jasmine rice

∙ 1 teaspoon grapeseed oil

∙ 6 pieces umeboshi, pitted and chopped into a coarse paste

∙ 12 shiso leaves, finely julienned into hairs

∙ ¼ cucumber, julienned

∙ 1 tablespoon fried garlic

∙ Salt to taste

1. In a small saucepan, melt the butter with the garlic. Cook on low until softened, about 5 minutes.

2. In a hot wok or large sauté pan, add grapeseed oil and butter and soften garlic. Add rice and sweet potato and salt to season. Gently mix to incorporate thoroughly.

3. Transfer the rice to a large plate and garnish with fried garlic, followed by cucumber (first so you don’t brown your herbs too quickly) and shiso. Scatter small amounts of the umeboshi over the rice. Serve as is, and stir thoroughly right before eating!

Video The chef and owner of Good Girl Dinette in Los Angeles recalls her mother's favorite midnight snack in Saigon – a Banh Mi.

B.L.T. Banh Mi

Diep Tran, Good Girl Dinette

Diep Tran’s B.L.T. banh mi is a homage to her mother’s resilience. She recalls a night in Saigon when, with the children finally coaxed to sleep, her mother settled down to a blissfully quiet dinner on her own — only to have the children creep from their beds at the alluring sound of a crunchy baguette, begging to share.

Cilantro-Maggi mayo

∙ 2 cups cilantro stems, roughly chopped. (If you can get the cilantro with the root, that’s ideal. Reserve the leaves for finishing the banh mi.)

∙ 1 small shallot, roughly chopped

∙ ½ small serrano, roughly chopped

∙ ¼ cup Maggi sauce

∙ 2 tablespoons white vinegar

∙ 2 egg yolks, room temperature

∙ 4 cups oil

1. In a food processor, add the chopped cilantro stems, shallot and serrano. Process until the mixture becomes a paste. Add Maggi sauce and vinegar and process for another 2 minutes. What you’re looking for is a smooth paste in which there are no discernible bits of serrano or shallots.

2. Add the egg yolks and process until the yolks emulsify with the cilantro-Maggi paste, about 2 minutes. With the processor still on, add the oil in batches, ½ a cup at a time.

3. Keep processing 2 minutes after the last batch of oil, to make sure all the oil is incorporated and the emulsion is stable.

4. Taste and adjust by adding more Maggi or vinegar. Mayo can last for 3 days in the fridge.

Pickled Green Tomatoes

∙ 1 cup white wine vinegar

∙ 1 cup water

∙ 1 tablespoon kosher salt

∙ ¼ cup brown sugar

∙ 1 tablespoon serrano chile, sliced

∙ ½ small onion, sliced

∙ ¼ cup rau ram/hot mint

∙ 2 pounds medium green tomatoes, sliced ¼-inch thick (beefsteaks are best for pickling)

1. Combine in a pot white wine vinegar, water, kosher salt and brown sugar. Bring brine to a simmer, stirring to dissolve sugar and salt. Set aside.

2. In a Mason jar, or any high-walled container with a lid, pack in sliced green tomatoes, then add serrano chiles, onions and hot mint. Add brine, leaving an inch of head space.

3. Place a small shallow ramekin inside the jar to depress the contents in the brine. If necessary, add more brine, leaving just ½ inch of head space. Fasten the lid and let pickle for at least 3 days.

Pickled Daikon and Carrots

∙ 4 pounds carrots, julienne

∙ 5 pounds daikon, julienne

∙ 1 cup onions, thin slices

∙ 2 cups granulated sugar

∙ 1 cup white vinegar

∙ 1 cup hot water

∙ 2 tablespoons salt

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine sugar and salt with hot water, stir until the sugar and salt is dissolved. Add vinegar, stir to combine.

2. Add sliced onions and julienned carrots and daikon. Gently mix, taking care not to break the pretty matchsticks of daikon and carrots. Let the vegetables sit in brine for at least 2 hours. The pickle can last a week in the fridge.

Bacon With Red Boat Fish Salt Rub

∙ 2 teaspoons black pepper, ground

∙ ½ teaspoon star anise, ground

∙ ¾ teaspoon cinnamon, ground

∙ 1 tablespoon coriander, ground

∙ ⅓ cup brown sugar, tightly packed

∙ 1 ½ teaspoons Red Boat fish salt

∙ 1 pound bacon

1. Combine all dry ingredients, then add 1 lb of bacon. Toss to coat.

2. Lay bacon strips onto wire rack and pan to catch drippings.

3. Bake at 400 degrees until bacon is crisp.

Image Credit Anthony Cotsifas

Final Assembly:

∙ fresh cilantro leaves

∙ baguettes

∙ lettuce leaves — a crisp variety, for a bit of a crunch, like romaine

Split the baguette and spread bottom half with cilantro-Maggi mayo. Add a layer of daikon and carrot pickles. (Make sure to drain and squeeze pickle to get rid of as much moisture as possible. you don’t want soggy pickles.) Add a few lettuce leaves. Add about 4-5 slices of pickled green tomatoes. Add 2-4 slices of bacon. Add a good layer of cilantro leaves. Close it up with the top half of the baguette.

As the play opens, she has just tricked him by putting Weber’s name on a design of her own, then asking Stu to explain what makes it so good. After he fell for it, she said it was hers.

“This is what we’re up against,” Stu grouses, retelling the tale.

Perhaps best known now as the deposed creator of “Smash,” Ms. Rebeck has long made her way through the man’s world of both theater and television. I remember hearing a male theater director, years ago, disparage her in glaringly misogynistic language — a tipoff that his judgment reflected him more than her. So she understands this terrain from the inside.

As sitcomish as it sometimes feels, “What We’re Up Against” has a complex view of its characters and their dynamics. Janice (Marg Helgenberger) has been at the firm for years, and before Eliza’s arrival she was its only woman architect. (The unseen support staff is, she notes, all female.)

Janice recognizes the structural flaws in the office culture, but like a lot of people who find themselves the sole representative of a demographic group, she opts not to dwell on them. She gets along by not threatening the men — keeping her expectations low, her comments flattering and her work mediocre. Also, she dresses like a librarian. (The costumes, which don’t always nail the era, are by Tilly Grimes.)

Eliza hopes that Janice will be an ally. Janice, halfheartedly gaslighting her, hopes that Eliza will tone it down. She doesn’t, and that’s the fun of Ms. Rebeck’s revenge fantasy, which lets no one off the hook for their bad behavior.

The cast is an impressive assemblage of talent, and Ms. Rodriguez and Ms. Helgenberger both do fine. Oddly, though, the flashiest roles belong to men: the showboating worm Weber and, especially, the toxic Stu — hardly the only villain here, but the one with the most power, and he relishes abusing it.

Playing Stu is a tricky challenge that Mr. Young expertly meets, giving a comic performance with just enough bite that we can’t dismiss Stu as a buffoon. His body language — the way he cringes in not-so-mock fear when he talks about Eliza — is like a cry straight from his psyche.

But Ben (Jim Parrack), a project leader at the firm, is more insidiously harmful. A casual sexist, he’s also a pragmatist, and good work is his principal concern. He knows Eliza could help with that, but he’s not the kind of guy to make waves. Instead he goes along.

In the production’s bi-level set, by Narelle Sissons, we get a cross-section view of the office. With lumber and metal seams exposed at the edges, we see how this structure was built. It’s a metaphor for what Ms. Rebeck’s play does: rips away the smooth surfaces and lays bare the skeleton, where it’s plain that the rot is in the bones.","Review: ‘What We’re Up Against,’ a Sexism Story More Timely Than Ever",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/theater/review-what-were-up-against-theresa-rebeck-marg-helgenberger.html

“When I was growing up, I knew some of these people through my father, who was a novelist,” Mr. Olafsson said.
“And then we were like, ‘What are we going to do on the fifth and the sixth floor?’” Mr. Olafsson recalled.","With the approval of the owner, who has become a good friend, the Olafssons broke through ceilings and built floating wood staircases to connect the units. Along the way, they added a laundry room and did away with one bathroom and three kitchens, moving their own kitchen one flight up to capture as much sunlight as possible.

Name: Olaf Olafsson Age 55 Occupation Media executive and novelist Housing Works “I like writing here. You know how it is: If something works with your writing, you don’t want to change it.”

“One of the problems with townhouses is that the kitchen is usually on the ground floor, and that’s always the darkest place in the building,” said Mr. Olafsson, who, like his wife, was born and raised in Reykjavik, Iceland.

Granted, there is duplication of space: Each floor has a sitting room. The third-floor sitting room is the spot for doing puzzles and, thanks to the recent acquisition of a turntable, for listening to music. The fourth-floor sitting room is for watching television. The fifth-floor sitting room with the piano is the place for making music. But the family tends to do most of its sitting in the kitchen, which is outfitted with one of Mr. Olafsson’s favorite possessions, a Viking stove. Of course.

Do the Olafssons ever ask themselves if it was crazy to do expensive renovations on an ever-expanding place they don’t own? Yes, they do. Often.

“I wouldn’t call this a perfect situation,” Mr. Olafsson acknowledged. “You probably wouldn’t design it this way if you were starting from scratch. And it may not have been the wisest financial move. But we don’t think about that much.”

He needn’t add that hope springs eternal. The owner has promised the Olafssons first dibs on the building should he ever decide to sell.

Midcentury modern is the dominant theme, as represented by the kitchen table, by the desk and the Eames chair in Mr. Olafsson’s study, and by a Scandinavian side table, a bright-red Saarinen womb chair and an Eames lounge chair. But this is design without dogmatism. Deeming the effect too stark and off-putting, the Olafssons got rid of two very nice white midcentury sofas in the third-floor sitting room, replacing them with a pair of simple loden-green ones from Crate and Barrel.

Books are everywhere. So is Icelandic art, which the couple avidly collects. Among the paintings are works by Kristjan Davidsson, Jon Engilberts, Georg Gudni and Hordur Agustsson. “When I was growing up, I knew some of these people through my father, who was a novelist,” Mr. Olafsson said. “It’s always fun, in addition to having art you really like, to know the artist. You can still sort of relate to them through their work, though many of them have passed away.”

Four years ago, the Olafssons almost bought a six-story townhouse on the Upper West Side. What a prize: 7,000 square feet for them to divide and arrange as they pleased. “We were thinking we could finally have everything exactly the way we wanted,” Mr. Olafsson said.

The contract was to be signed on a Monday. The preceding Friday, the couple’s architect gave them a floor plan of their future home along with, quite literally, a homework assignment: Figure out what rooms you want to put where.

“We sat down at the kitchen table, and we were so excited,” Mrs. Olafsson said. “We were like, ‘Oh, the kitchen will be here and the living room will be here.’ We would have the perfect little entryway for guests, the bedrooms up here, a little office for Olaf up there. And I was thinking, ‘Maybe I’ll get a nice laundry room and maybe an exercise room because I like to exercise.’”

Things were moving along nicely. “And then we were like, ‘What are we going to do on the fifth and the sixth floor?’” Mr. Olafsson recalled. “‘We’re going to be talking to each other through an intercom. We’re going to be searching for each other.’ And our two sons were old enough that they were going to be out of the house soon.”

The couple looked across the table at each other, then looked again at the floor plan and the paperwork: 7,000 square feet; two years of construction. What were they thinking? They decided to stay put.

“We’re creatures of habit, I guess, but we like it here,” Mr. Olafsson said. “It’s home.”",The Ever-Expanding Rental,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/realestate/olaf-olafsson-ever-expanding-rental.html

A mix of fresh ambition and the familiar has come to define this diverse neighborhood, where less than 10 percent of the population traces its ancestry to Australia or England. It is visible at places like the Usual Cafe, a modern coffee shop near John Street where baristas in denim pull shots against a background of lush plants and white tiles.

Corey Nguyen, 28, who grew up in Australia and owns the Usual with his partner, Jenny Ngo, said they wanted to introduce Cabramatta, which is dominated by traditional cafes selling Vietnamese-style coffee, to a more artisanal cafe culture.

“For us it’s never been a competition,” he said. “They do their thing, we do ours. I wish them all the best.”

It’s a good thing, said Andrew Nguyen, 24, who waited with a friend for his coffee after a traditional Vietnamese lunch. “All your Asian fixes are here,” he said. “It’s home to us.”

For many of Cabramatta’s first Vietnamese residents, it felt like anything but.

Before their arrival, the population was mostly working-class Australians and European migrants. A German-Austrian society center near the train station is one of a few remaining signs of that past.

During the ’70s, primarily American servicemen brought heroin to Sydney from Southeast Asia, said Andrew Jakubowicz, a professor of sociology at the University of Technology Sydney. Cabramatta, with its links to Italian criminal groups and a new connection to Southeast Asia, would soon become a distribution point for the rest of the city.

For the Vietnamese, harboring the lingering trauma of war, the lack of an established Asian community in Cabramatta made it “a fairly desperate time,” Professor Jakubowicz said. “There was no history and structure available to respond to, and Australia was still very racist.”

One of those former refugees, Hue Kim, 75, now spends her weekends selling Kaffir lime leaves, rosemary and other herbs on the sidewalk just a few feet from Ms. Nguyen’s bubble tea shop.

She remembers attending her first English class shortly after arriving, pregnant, in Sydney 37 years ago. Her teachers, she said, noticed that her shirt was stained with milk. “They told me to nurse my newborn before coming back,” she said in Vietnamese. “So I didn’t go back.”

Many of the Vietnamese children who came during this time were unaccompanied. Others were left to their own devices while their parents worked long hours. Isolated culturally and economically, some of the young Vietnamese arrivals banded together, tapping into the drug trade and preying on the members of their own community.

Tony Hoang, 35, a pastor who spent his teenage years dealing heroin as part of a gang, recalled the time as marked with instability, anger and a need to belong. “It was attractive to be a part of a group that loved each other,” he said.

The violence took a shocking turn in 1994 with the assassination of John Newman, who represented Cabramatta in the State Parliament. A rival local politician who had immigrated from Vietnam was later convicted of the crime.

It was Australia’s first political assassination, and one that would further feed notions of a wave of ethnic migrant violence in Cabramatta.

Frustration over the area’s lawless reputation eventually prompted a parliamentary inquiry. The 2001 report led to the creation of drug treatment and intervention programs and the hiring of more police officers with wider powers to tackle drug crimes. Today, crime levels compare with those in other parts of metropolitan Sydney.

Not all of Cabramatta’s problems have been solved. Housing prices, like elsewhere in Sydney, have risen into the millions of dollars.

And a new wave of migrants, including refugees from Syria and the Middle East, are raising the same kinds of tensions that confronted Vietnamese migrants in the 1970s.

According to the 2016 census, Vietnamese is still the predominant ethnic group in Cabramatta, making up 33 percent of its roughly 22,000 residents. Chinese make up 24 percent, and Cambodians account for 8 percent. At least 40 other ethnic groups are also represented.

Frank Carbone, the mayor of Fairfield City, the western Sydney district surrounding Cabramatta, said that while 7,000 new refugees had been resettled in the region since January 2016, the federal government had not provided any financial support.

Today, though, the children of the initial wave of Vietnamese migrants are seeing a return on their parents’ persistence and creating their own legacy.

On a quieter stretch of John Street, patrons lined up outside Pho Tau Bay, a popular restaurant. Inside, Chi Giang, 36, a placid man in glasses, worked the register as waiters ferried bowls of steaming broth.

Born in an Indonesian refugee camp to Vietnamese parents waiting for Australian visas, Mr. Giang manages the restaurant, which his mother began in the kitchen of their home in 1980. Her closely guarded beef noodle soup recipe often tops critics’ lists of the best Vietnamese food in Sydney, and the profits from the restaurant are enough to sustain Mr. Giang’s entire extended family.

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

But the report unquestionably introduced new waves of uncertainty and turmoil into a race for the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, the attorney general.

The women cited in The Washington Post article said that Mr. Moore had pursued them in the 1970s and 1980s when he was a lawyer in his early 30s.

Mr. Moore was defiant, denying the charges and attacking the news media.

“These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and The Washington Post on this campaign,” he said in a statement. He later attributed the news to “The Obama-Clinton Machine’s liberal media lap dogs.”

Brett Doster, an adviser to Mr. Moore, said the candidate would “absolutely not” drop out of the race, calling the charges “a fabricated November surprise.”

Others in Alabama shrugged at the allegations. “There’s nothing to see here,” said Jim Zeigler, the state auditor and a longtime supporter of Mr. Moore. “Single man, early 30s, never been married, dating teenage girls. Never been married and he liked younger girls. According to The Washington Post account he never had sexual intercourse with any of them.”

But Mr. Moore’s candidacy appears to be in grave danger. Senate Republicans moved en masse to distance themselves from their nominee almost as soon as the news article was posted.

A statement from Vice President Mike Pence said: “The Vice President found the allegations in the story disturbing and believes, if true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office.”

That statement was repeated by numerous Republicans, including the president who was traveling in Asia.

“Like most Americans the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a person’s life,” Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in statement from Danang, Vietnam, where the president is attending an economic summit meeting. “However, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.”

“If these allegations are true, his candidacy is not sustainable,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Republican. Mr. Cornyn said he wanted to know more before withdrawing his endorsement of Mr. Moore.

The party, already reeling from the election losses they suffered on Tuesday, is defending a two-seat majority in the Senate and faces a handful of difficult elections next year.

Mr. Moore’s candidacy had already worried party leaders who had embraced Mr. Moore despite his long record of incendiary comments about gays, Muslims and African-Americans.

Alabama election law indicates, with little ambiguity, that the deadline has passed for candidates to be replaced on the ballot. The state election code says a candidate who wishes to withdraw from a race must do so 76 days before Election Day. The Alabama vote is in little more than a month.

“It’s too late to substitute a candidate,” said John Merrill, the Alabama secretary of state, a Republican. “Judge Moore will be the candidate on the ballot with this election cycle remaining on the schedule it’s currently on.”

Republican lawyers and strategists in Washington were engaged in a furious search on Thursday for creative ways around that restriction, seeking a loophole that would allow the party’s leadership in the state to anoint a new candidate. The prospect of a write-in candidacy, for a third candidate, was also under consideration, according to party aides.

Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who ran her own successful write-in campaign in 2010, said: “If in fact what I just read is true, he needs to get out of this race immediately. I think it’s pretty clear cut.”

She called for Senator Luther Strange, who was appointed to fill Mr. Sessions’s seat but lost to Mr. Moore in a bitterly contested Republican runoff in September, to run as a write-in.

One of the women, Leigh Corfman, told The Washington Post that she was 14 when Mr. Moore, 32 at the time, drove her to his home in Gadsden, Ala. He took off her shirt and touched her bra and underwear while also guiding her hand over his pants, Ms. Corfman told The Post.

“I wanted it over with — I wanted out,” she told the newspaper.

CNN reported that it had spoken with Ms. Corfman’s stepfather, who said the family “stands by” what was reported in The Post.

Republican leaders are in a politically perilous situation, saddled with an embattled nominee unwilling to step aside in one of the country’s most conservative states. The charges reignited hostilities between Mr. McConnell’s political allies, who poured millions of dollars into the campaign to stop Mr. Moore, and President Trump’s former chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who rallied support for the former justice.

“This is what happens when you let reckless, incompetent idiots like Steve Bannon go out and recruit candidates who have absolutely no business running for the U.S. Senate,” said Josh Holmes, a former McConnell aide.

Mr. Bannon did not immediately reply to text messages or phone calls, but Breitbart posted an article with Mr. Moore’s statement shortly before The Post published its report.

Steven Law, the head of a McConnell-aligned “super PAC” that led an onslaught against Mr. Moore in the Republican runoff, did not wait for a guilty verdict before he excoriated Breitbart for “defending ‘consensual’ sex between a 32-year-old and a 16-year-old.”

Private polling by both parties has shown that while Mr. Moore retains a passionate following among conservatives, he is a deeply divisive figure among more moderate Republicans, and some party officials now worry that the charges will convince moderates to stay home or vote for the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, a former United States attorney.

The Jones campaign said in a statement that “Roy Moore needs to answer these serious charges.”

Cleveland Poole, the chairman of the Republican Party in rural Butler County, said those most likely to defect were not ardent Moore supporters but voters who already have doubts. “They are going to be put off by it and might well stay home,” he said.

In a statement, Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, called the allegations “deeply disturbing,” and said she would withhold judgment until “we know the facts.” Senator Richard Shelby, the dean of the state’s congressional delegation, told reporters in Washington that if the charges were accurate “he wouldn’t belong in the Senate.”

Mr. Doster, the adviser to Mr. Moore, said the candidate’s campaign chairman, Bill Armistead, had talked to members of Alabama’s congressional delegation after the report broke. “Everybody has been supportive,” Mr. Doster said.

But a Republican familiar with the conversation said the House members on the call had told Mr. Armistead it was imperative that they aggressively respond to the article or risk losing support from the party’s elected officials.

Randy Brinson, president of the Christian Coalition of Alabama, said he expected voters would mostly give Mr. Moore the benefit of the doubt.

“Until I see something different, I would support Roy Moore because of what he says he’s going to do and who he is as a person,” Mr. Brinson said.

Mr. Zeigler said the account given by Ms. Corfman was “the only part that is concerning.” As Mr. Zeigler described it: “He went a little too far and he stopped.”

Had the girl been 16 at the time and not 14, he added, “it would have been perfectly acceptable.”

For Democrats, the prospect of a wounded Mr. Moore was a gift.

“This is revolting and the Republican Party and everybody’s who endorsed Roy Moore needs to disavow his candidacy right now and ask him to withdraw,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who leads the Senate Democratic campaign arm.

Until recently, few Democratic officials believed that Mr. Jones could topple Mr. Moore in a state that has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1992, and Democrats have debated fiercely whether to commit resources to the race.

I stood up and, with camera bulbs flashing, asked Mr. Xi two questions: Did he view Mr. Obama’s Asia pivot as a threat to China? And would China ease its refusal to give visas to correspondents in light of a broader visa agreement it had just signed with the United States?

I also asked Mr. Obama a somewhat long-winded question about the rise of anti-American sentiment in China, which prompted him to say, “Come on, Mark,” and joke, after I was finished, that he had forgotten my question (I assumed that was for the benefit of his host).

At first, President Xi looked as if he was going to simply ignore the impudent foreigner. He instructed the moderator to move on, taking a scripted question from a Chinese state-owned paper. Mr. Obama, who was clearly eager to hear Mr. Xi’s answer, shot me a glance and a theatrical shrug, the presidential equivalent of “nice try, buddy.”

It turned out that Mr. Xi was merely biding his time. After he answered the Chinese journalist, he circled back to me and delivered a curt lecture. No, he said, the pivot was not about containment. And the visa problems of The Times were of our own making.

China protected freedom of expression, he said, but “media outlets need to obey China’s laws and regulations. When a car breaks down on the road, perhaps we need to get off the car to see where the problem lies. And when a certain issue is raised as a problem, there must be a reason.”

“In Chinese, we have a saying,” he concluded. “The party which has created a problem should be the one to help resolve it.”

As the White House press corps filed out of the room, one of my colleagues joked that he hoped the Chinese would allow me to leave the country. The Chinese media reported that I had violated the ground rules by directing a question to Mr. Xi, rather than only to Mr. Obama. (The White House did not instruct me to address only the American president.)

The whole negotiation was somewhat opaque, Mr. Earnest recalled this week. Even as he stood next to the leaders in the Great Hall that day, he said he was not sure the Chinese would follow through on the agreement.

The episode apparently did not sit well with the Chinese. On Thursday, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said, “It was at the Chinese insistence there were no questions.”

Former aides to Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush criticized the Trump White House for not trying harder.

“They always insist, Sarah,” Susan E. Rice, who served as Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, said in a tweet. “The trick is to use diplomacy to extract that concession as a matter of principle, despite their resistence.”

Brad Dayspring, deputy director of press advance for Mr. Bush, tweeted, “Never got everything we pushed for, but always expanded access from Chinese demands & ensured questions were taken alongside Chinese President. It’s an important demonstration of American press freedoms.”

In Tokyo and Seoul, Mr. Trump took questions with the leaders of Japan and South Korea. But striking a blow for press freedom did not seem high on his list of priorities in Beijing. He did not say whether he had pressed Mr. Xi behind closed doors on human rights issues.

Mr. Obama, by contrast, got mileage out of the episode. Two days later, he was standing next to Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese pro-democracy leader, in the garden of her lakeside house in Yangon, and brought up the tense Q. and A. in the Great Hall of the People.

“When I am traveling, it is important as the president of the United States to not just talk about our interests, but also to talk about our values,” Mr. Obama said. “Sometimes it has an impact; sometimes it doesn’t.”

“Although I was impressed that Mark Landler got an answer to his question from President Xi,” he added. “It might not have been the one he was expecting, but he did end up taking the question.

And Mr. Brady said explicitly that the revision would preserve the carried interest provision for real estate interests.
But as a symbol, the carried interest loophole looms large, calling into question the fairness of the entire proposed tax code.
Republicans seem to be gambling that most Americans won’t care about a few rich private equity managers if their own taxes go down, their stock portfolio goes up and economic growth accelerates.
“I don’t think most Republicans really care about carried interest,” he said.","The former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was excoriated for taking advantage of the loophole in 2012, and as a candidate Mr. Trump repeatedly promised to close it.

“The hedge fund guys didn’t build this country,” Mr. Trump said in 2015. “These are guys that shift paper around, and they get lucky.”

“They are energetic,” he added. “They are very smart. But a lot of them — it’s like, they are paper pushers. They make a fortune. They pay no tax. It’s ridiculous, O.K.?”

Yet in the House plan unveiled last week, and in the Senate plan released Thursday, the carried interest loophole emerged unscathed.

The proposed legislation “is a home run for private equity investors,” said Victor Fleischer, a law professor at the University of San Diego who has spent years arguing (persuasively, in my view) that the loophole should be closed. “If you were designing something that perfectly avoids hitting private equity, venture capital and real estate, this would be it.” (Mr. Fleischer is also a contributor to The New York Times.)

This week, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, said he would address concerns about the loophole by seeking to extend the holding period for assets that qualified for the tax break from one year to three years. That’s better than doing nothing, and might affect some hedge funds. But they could easily qualify simply by holding the assets for more than three years.

Mr. Brady’s tweak would have no impact at all on most private equity managers, who typically buy companies, restructure and refinance them, and then sell them, usually after seven to 10 years. Most real estate partnerships have similar holding periods. And Mr. Brady said explicitly that the revision would preserve the carried interest provision for real estate interests.

“The amendment will encourage and reward long-term investment while also applying equally to all sources of growth capital — no matter if that investment is provided by hedge funds, private equity, venture capital or otherwise,” Shane McDonald, a spokesman for Mr. Brady, told me. “By providing a three-year holding period on certain assets, this amendment strikes the right balance for economic growth and fairness without stifling investment in American entrepreneurship.”

But the primary argument against the carried interest loophole isn’t that those who benefit from it don’t hold their assets long enough.

“The real issue is that carried interest is compensation for services performed for the investment fund,” Mr. Fleischer said. “The theory behind the Republican plan is that somehow, holding something for a longer period of time makes it more like a financial investment. But why would that be the case?

“If you write a book, and it takes three or four years before you earn a royalty, that doesn’t make the income a capital gain,” he continued. “If a movie takes three years to generate a return, that doesn’t make it a capital gain. There’s no reason why financial services should be any different.”

Proponents of the loophole, most of whom benefit from it one way or another, have long argued that the lower tax rate encourages risk taking and hence economic growth, an argument that Republican lawmakers appear to have embraced.

But there’s little empirical support for the position.

Mr. Fleischer argues that the proposed tax bill — by slashing the corporate and pass-through tax rates and preserving the lower rate for capital gains — already heavily favors risk taking and investment.

“We don’t need to further subsidize people who go to work in this sector by giving them a lower tax rate,” he said. “There’s no shortage of people who want to go into private equity and earn millions or billions of dollars.”

The rationale, he said, “is absurd.”

That the carried interest provision survived, despite Mr. Trump’s campaign statements and populist hostility to it, appears to be a testament to the enduring influence that Wall Street and wealthy investors exert over both the White House and Congress.

Some of Mr. Trump’s most prominent backers and donors come from the world of private equity, hedge funds and real estate partnerships, among them Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the powerhouse firm Blackstone; Wilbur Ross, the former private equity executive who is now secretary of commerce; Thomas J. Barrack, Jr., executive chairman of Colony Northstar, a real estate investment trust, and chairman of the president’s inauguration committee; Betsy DeVos, a co-founder of the Windquest Group and now secretary of education; and Stephen A. Feinberg, a co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management and a Trump donor and adviser. And Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, are prominent alumni of Goldman Sachs, which has a range of hedge fund and private equity clients.

More broadly, preserving the break for carried interest fits into the overarching theme of the Republican tax plan: that what is good for investors is good for economic growth, which in turn is good for everyone, including the working poor. That’s why the proposed code is tilted so heavily toward investors rather than people who earn salaries or compensation for services rendered.

That’s also why it’s imprecise to say the proposed code benefits the “rich.” While most rich people are also investors, and thus will benefit disproportionately, not all rich people will benefit. People with high incomes generated primarily by their own labor or services may actually see their federal tax increase, especially if they lose their deductions for state and local taxes. The proposed code specifically names lawyers, doctors, athletes and performers — all of whom work for a living — as ineligible for the lower pass-through rate.

The plan “is a tax increase on the working upper middle class and the rich in states like California, New York and New Jersey in order to benefit the people who own pass-through entities and are shareholders,” Mr. Fleischer said.

Tax reform advocates generally agree that a fair code shouldn’t single out certain groups for favorable treatment at the expense of others. There is already widespread resentment that ultrarich investment managers pay such low rates — nowhere near the top 39.6 percent rate.

Closing the loophole may promote fairness, but it wouldn’t do much to help the overall budget deficit. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that eliminating it would generate $17 billion over 10 years, a drop in the bucket given that Republicans have been trying to close a budget gap in the trillions. Mr. Fleischer contends that the figure is much higher, more like $180 billion over 10 years. Even that is a modest down payment on the larger cuts the tax plan calls for.

But as a symbol, the carried interest loophole looms large, calling into question the fairness of the entire proposed tax code. That’s a shame, since large elements of the proposal have widespread bipartisan support. (Even former President Barack Obama agreed that the corporate tax rate needed to be lowered for the United States to be competitive.)

There’s still a chance that lawmakers will eliminate the loophole as the bill moves through Congress.

Mr. Rosenthal said he wasn’t holding his breath. Republicans seem to be gambling that most Americans won’t care about a few rich private equity managers if their own taxes go down, their stock portfolio goes up and economic growth accelerates. “I don’t think most Republicans really care about carried interest,” he said.",A Tax Loophole for the Rich That Just Won’t Die,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/business/carried-interest-tax-loophole.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

In your home, it’s hard to read the demands of stone-faced herps evolved for wild living. They need proper temperature, humidity, food, lighting and exercise, and have other species-specific psychological and social requirements.

If you meet these needs, you must accept that your pet could grow quite big and live a couple decades. If you don’t, yours will probably die in its first year, like 75 percent of pet reptiles and amphibians brought home as pets.

Reptiles and amphibians don’t make good pets “and should not be part of the pet trade,” said Lorelei Tibbetts, a vet technician and manager at The Center for Avian and Exotic Medicine in New York. Most of the time, animal patients come to her with metabolic or reproductive issues related to improper nutrition, husbandry and life in captivity.

“It’s really not possible for us to care for these animals in order for them to thrive and live a decent life,” she said.

People may neglect pet reptiles and amphibians no more than common pets. But even the best environments “will result in ‘controlled deprivation’,” as is also the case with caged birds and rabbits, or fish in tanks, wrote Dr. Pasmans in his review.

Just as many pet owners provide a high standard of care for dogs, cats, birds or fish, it is possible, with a lot of effort, to properly look after some reptiles and amphibians in homes, he adds. For instance, bearded dragons adapt rather well to captivity.

Clifford Warwick, a consulting biologist on exotic animal welfare and lead author of a viewpoint in the journal, said we can’t provide proper care because we don’t know what many species need. Even when we do, misinformation on the internet leads pet owners astray.

It’s easy to buy a cute pet on impulse, but “when people find out how much trouble they are, they turn them loose,” said Ms. Leahy.

Generally, the limited options for dealing with unwanted exotic pets means many owners just release them. Discarded pets can wreak havoc on nonnative ecosystems. That red-eared slider in my cart from Mississippi is a huge problem in Europe and Asia.

And Florida is dealing with the biggest invasive species problem on the planet, mostly because of the pet trade. There, iguanas have destroyed concrete infrastructure and Burmese pythons have eaten protected and common species, setting off a disease-spreading chain reaction.

Despite all these concerns, reptile and amphibian owners aren’t going to disappear any sooner than dog, cat or bird owners.

In the past, people have summoned emotional arguments to single out slick-skinned exotic pets with bad reputations. But the animals aren’t as harmful as the harm inherent in trading them.

Republicans seem to be gambling that most Americans won’t care about a few rich private equity managers if their own taxes go down, their stock portfolio goes up and economic growth accelerates.
“I don’t think most Republicans really care about carried interest,” he said.","The former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was excoriated for taking advantage of the loophole in 2012, and as a candidate Mr. Trump repeatedly promised to close it.

“The hedge fund guys didn’t build this country,” Mr. Trump said in 2015. “These are guys that shift paper around, and they get lucky.”

“They are energetic,” he added. “They are very smart. But a lot of them — it’s like, they are paper pushers. They make a fortune. They pay no tax. It’s ridiculous, O.K.?”

Yet in the House plan unveiled last week, and in the Senate plan released Thursday, the carried interest loophole emerged unscathed.

The proposed legislation “is a home run for private equity investors,” said Victor Fleischer, a law professor at the University of San Diego who has spent years arguing (persuasively, in my view) that the loophole should be closed. “If you were designing something that perfectly avoids hitting private equity, venture capital and real estate, this would be it.” (Mr. Fleischer is also a contributor to The New York Times.)

This week, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, said he would address concerns about the loophole by seeking to extend the holding period for assets that qualified for the tax break from one year to three years. That’s better than doing nothing, and might affect some hedge funds. But they could easily qualify simply by holding the assets for more than three years.

Mr. Brady’s tweak would have no impact at all on most private equity managers, who typically buy companies, restructure and refinance them, and then sell them, usually after seven to 10 years. Most real estate partnerships have similar holding periods. And Mr. Brady said explicitly that the revision would preserve the carried interest provision for real estate interests.

“The amendment will encourage and reward long-term investment while also applying equally to all sources of growth capital — no matter if that investment is provided by hedge funds, private equity, venture capital or otherwise,” Shane McDonald, a spokesman for Mr. Brady, told me. “By providing a three-year holding period on certain assets, this amendment strikes the right balance for economic growth and fairness without stifling investment in American entrepreneurship.”

But the primary argument against the carried interest loophole isn’t that those who benefit from it don’t hold their assets long enough. It’s that the “carry” — the percentage of an investment’s gains that the manager takes as compensation — should be treated as a payment for services and taxed like regular income, and not be viewed as a return on invested capital, in which the manager has put assets at risk.

The Justice Department declined to comment on Thursday.

Pushing AT&T to unload a big part of its business to get the deal approved goes against Mr. Delrahim’s history, antitrust experts say. His past comments have largely been in line with more free-market-oriented Republican views, and he was widely expected to be more lenient on mergers than predecessors in the Obama administration.

“This is bold,” said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, a nonprofit that generally favors stronger antitrust enforcement. “It signals they are willing to consider the anticompetitive effects of big deals, and on the remedy side they would use structural remedies, which would signal a potential change in policy.”

In an interview late last month, Mr. Delrahim strongly rejected the idea that the White House had tried to or could influence his thinking. At the time, he would not discuss AT&T’s bid for Time Warner or any other pending mergers.

“All enforcement decisions will be based on the facts and the law. Not on politics,” Mr. Delrahim said. “That would be antithetical to everything I’ve stood for.”

Mr. Delrahim, 48, was born in Tehran, but his family moved to Los Angeles when he was almost 10, around the time of the Islamic Revolution. He attended the University of California, Los Angeles, as an undergraduate and then went to law school at George Washington University.

After a few years in corporate law, he spent time as an aide on Capitol Hill, working on some technology and antitrust issues. President George W. Bush later nominated him to be a top official at the Justice Department, where he focused on international antitrust enforcement. After his time there, he returned to corporate law in Los Angeles, representing numerous large technology, health and telecommunications companies.

In his recent interview, he said that the Justice Department did not need to intervene just because a company was big, even a monopoly. He also said the government should not startle business markets with an abrupt change in its approach to antitrust legal theory.

“There are people who think big is just bad,” he said. “They don’t understand why, but there is an instinctive reaction to big business these days.” He added that it was dangerous to go after companies without clear evidence that they were harming competitors.

Mr. Delrahim has said his comments last year about AT&T and Time Warner were taken out of context. He has told lawmakers that the deal deserved a thorough review. He said there could be antitrust concerns when a company like AT&T, which controls distribution of television content through DirecTV and internet content through its mobile and home broadband service, bought a big media company.

That view is more aligned with left-leaning consumer groups that have pushed for greater antitrust enforcement. After the news this week that the Justice Department was taking a deeper look at the deal, some Democrats, including Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, praised the tough stance.

“AT&T and Time Warner is an enormous test because we are just seeing online video disrupting the dominant cable broadband providers,” said Gene Kimmelman, president of the nonprofit organization Public Knowledge and an antitrust official during the Obama administration. “And it would be a disaster for consumers and the competitive landscape if those developments are wiped out or diminished by the approval of this deal.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

For years, though, antitrust officials have generally approved mergers of companies that do not have competing businesses. These are known as vertical mergers, and because AT&T is a telecommunications company, while Time Warner creates media content like movies, their deal would fit that category.

Problems with those mergers have generally been resolved with settlements known as consent decrees, which restrict the new company’s behavior or operations.

Mr. Delrahim is skeptical of such consent decrees, especially demands for “behavioral remedies.” The Obama administration approved Comcast’s purchase of NBC Universal in 2011 with a stack of behavioral requirements, including a requirement that Comcast make NBC content available to competing cable and streaming services.

During his interview last month, Mr. Delrahim said industries moved too fast for those remedies to be effective.

“We have major parts of our industry that are regulated by consent decrees with the Justice Department,” he said, referring to settlements with behavioral remedies.

“I don’t think I’m smart enough to figure out where the market and consumer behavior will be 10 years from now, 20 years from now, 40 years from now, 100 years from now,” he continued. The agency, he added, is still overseeing consent decrees that are a century old.

Instead, Mr. Delrahim said, he prefers so-called structural remedies, like forcing a company to sell assets before approving a merger. He said the ultimate test for healthy competition was the consumer welfare test, which looks at whether consumers are benefiting from lower prices and options.

Mr. Kimmelman said the Justice Department could be concerned about how the combined broadband, satellite and media company could hurt competitors.

The satellite service DirecTV, for example, can reach all American homes. The potential concern, Mr. Kimmelman said, is that the company may have an incentive to withhold valuable Time Warner content like HBO, TNT or CNN from rival cable and satellite providers or streaming services. The company could also make it harder for rival media companies like Starz to reach AT&T customers.

The Justice Department has proposed various options to meet Mr. Delrahim’s demands, according to multiple people close to the discussions.

In the interview last month, Mr. Delrahim defended the president’s criticism of AT&T’s bid. He said Mr. Trump was unfairly targeted for remarks about deals when other government officials were allowed to air their opinions.

“What’s interesting is that you see the president getting criticized for commenting on certain mergers and you have senators who will write with comments on the same exact merger,” Mr. Delrahim said. “I find that fascinating but maybe not new in Washington.”

And while he insisted that his decisions would be made independently, it was clear that Mr. Trump was not totally out of mind.

For solace, I love a book that opens up my perspective. The other day I realized I buy a new copy of “The Untethered Soul,” by Michael A. Singer, in every city I visit. I don’t know if it’s because I forget that I own it already or I just need it again when I’m on the road and missing home. I own at least four copies. I also love Singer’s audio lectures, even just to put on in the background. For escape, I love popcorn thrillers that you can read in a weekend, like “Sharp Objects” and “The Woman in Cabin 10.” For pure pleasure, I love a good rock ‘n’ roll/rock bio or oral history.

How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or simultaneously? Morning or night? Do you like reading on set?

I can’t read on set because I have too much to stay focused on. Often you hear about people on set living this “hurry up and wait” kind of work life. But for me, specifically on “Jessica Jones,” it’s more like “hurry up and hurry up.” I get to be fully immersed all day every day and it is crazy exciting! But it’s not a reading environment. On set, if anything, I’ll knit because it’s mechanical, a meditation and doesn’t pull focus from the work. In terms of how I read, I am hard copy all the way. I love having a book in my hand. There are already so many digital distractions in our lives and for me, reading on a screen and getting alerts and text messages totally ruins it.

On Thursday, the premiere of Louis C.K.’s new movie “I Love You, Daddy,” was abruptly canceled, and he also canceled an appearance on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”

The stories told by the women raise sharp questions about the anecdotes that Louis C.K. tells in his own comedy. He rose to fame in part by appearing to be candid about his flaws and sexual hang-ups, discussing and miming masturbation extensively in his act — an exaggerated riff that some of the women feel may have served as a cover for real misconduct. He has all but invited comparison between his private life and his onscreen work, too: In “I Love You, Daddy,” which is scheduled to be released next week, a character pretends to masturbate at length in front of other people, and other characters appear to dismiss rumors of sexual predation.

At the same time, Louis C.K. has also boosted the careers of women, and is sometimes viewed as a feminist by fans and critics. But Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov said that when they told others about the incident in the Colorado hotel room, they heard that Louis C.K.’s manager was upset that they were talking about it openly. The women feared career repercussions. Louis C.K.’s manager, Dave Becky, was adamant in an email that he “never threatened anyone.”

For comedians, the professional environment is informal: profanity and raunch that would be far out of line in most workplaces are common, and personal foibles — the weirder the better — are routinely mined for material. But Louis C.K.’s behavior was abusive, the women said.

“I think the line gets crossed when you take all your clothes off and start masturbating,” Ms. Wolov said.

‘You Want to Believe It’s Not Happening’

Ms. Corry, a comedian, writer and actress, has long felt haunted by her run-in with Louis C.K. In 2005, she was working as a performer and producer on a television pilot — a big step in her career — when Louis C.K., a guest star, approached her as she was walking to the set. “He leaned close to my face and said, ‘Can I ask you something?’ I said, ‘Yes,’” Ms. Corry said in a written statement to The New York Times. “He asked if we could go to my dressing room so he could masturbate in front of me.” Stunned and angry, Ms. Corry said she declined, and pointed out that he had a daughter and a pregnant wife. “His face got red,” she recalled, “and he told me he had issues.”

Word quickly reached the show’s executive producers, Courteney Cox and David Arquette, who both confirmed the incident. “What happened to Rebecca on that set was awful,” Ms. Cox said in an email, adding that she felt “outrage and shock.”

“My concern was to create an environment where Rebecca felt safe, protected and heard,” she said. They discussed curtailing the production. Ms. Corry decided to continue with the show.

“Things were going well for me,” Ms. Corry said in the statement, “and I had no interest in being the person who shut down a production.”

A fifth woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect her family’s privacy because she has not been publicly linked to the incident with Louis C.K., also has disturbing memories about an incident with the comedian. In the late ’90s, she was working in production at “The Chris Rock Show” when Louis C.K., a writer and producer there, repeatedly asked her to watch him masturbate, she said. She was in her early 20s and went along with his request, but later questioned his behavior.

“It was something that I knew was wrong,” said the woman, who described sitting in Louis C.K.’s office while he masturbated in his desk chair during a workday, other colleagues just outside the door. “I think the big piece of why I said yes was because of the culture,” she continued. “He abused his power.” A co-worker at “The Chris Rock Show,” who also wished to remain anonymous, confirmed that the woman told him about the experience soon after it happened.

Ms. Schachner, a writer, illustrator and performer, admired Louis C.K.’s work. They had met in the comedy scene; Ms. Schachner’s former boyfriend was a comedy writer who had worked with Louis C.K. In 2003, when she called Louis C.K. with an invitation to her show, he said he was at work in an office as a writer on the series “Cedric the Entertainer Presents,” she recalled.

Their conversation quickly moved from the personal — Louis C.K. had seen photos of her on her boyfriend’s desk, he said, and told her he thought she was cute — to “unprofessional and inappropriate,” Ms. Schachner said.

She said she heard the blinds coming down. Then he slowly started telling her his sexual fantasies, breathing heavily and talking softly. She realized he was masturbating, and was dumbfounded. The call went on for several minutes, even though, Ms. Schachner said, “I definitely wasn’t encouraging it.” But she didn’t know how to end it, either. “You want to believe it’s not happening,” she said. A friend, Stuart Harris, confirmed that Ms. Schachner had described the call to him in 2003.

Harassment Claims

For years afterward, Ms. Schachner said, she felt angry and betrayed by an artist she looked up to. And she wondered what she could have done differently. “I felt very ashamed,” she said.

A Run-In, Then Fears About Speaking Out

During Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov’s surreal visit to Louis C.K.’s Aspen hotel room, they said they were holding onto each other, screaming and laughing in shock, as Louis C.K. masturbated in a chair. “We were paralyzed,” Ms. Goodman said. After he ejaculated on his stomach, they said, they fled. He called after them: “He was like, ‘Which one is Dana and which one is Julia?’” Ms. Goodman recalled.

Afterward, they ran into Charna Halpern, the owner of influential improv theaters in Los Angeles and Chicago, where Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov performed, and relayed what had happened. “I didn’t know what to do, I didn’t know what to tell them to do,” said Ms. Halpern. Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov decided against going to the police, unsure whether what happened was criminal, but felt they had to respond in some way “because something crazy happened to us,” Ms. Goodman said.

Hoping that outrage would build against Louis C.K., and also to shame him, they began telling others about the incident the next day. But many people seemed to recoil, they said. “Guys were backing away from us,” Ms. Wolov said. Barely 24 hours after they left Louis C.K.’s hotel, “we could already feel the backlash.”

Soon after, they said they understood from their managers that Mr. Becky, Louis C.K’s manager, wanted them to stop telling people about their encounter with Louis C.K. Lee Kernis, one of the women’s managers at the time, confirmed on Thursday that he had a conversation in which he told Mr. Becky that Louis C.K.’s behavior toward the women had been offensive. Mr. Kernis also said that Mr. Becky was upset that the women were talking openly about the incident.

Mr. Becky denied making any threats toward the women. “I don’t recall the exact specifics of the conversation, but know I never threatened anyone,” he wrote by email on Thursday. Ms. Halpern and Robert Schroeder — Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov’s agent at the time — said that the pair told them that they felt they had been warned to stop talking.

Mr. Becky arguably wields even more power in comedy than Louis C.K. He represents Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari, Amy Poehler and other top performers, and his company, 3 Arts, puts together programming deals for nearly every platform.

Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov moved to Los Angeles shortly after the Aspen festival, but “we were coming here with a bunch of enemies,” Ms. Goodman said. Gren Wells, a filmmaker who befriended the comedy duo in 2002, said the incident and the warning, which they told her about soon after Aspen, hung heavily over them both. “This is something that they were freaked out about,” Ms. Wells said.

In the years since, Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov have found some success, but they remained concerned about Mr. Becky and took themselves out of the running for the many projects he was involved in. Though their humor is in line with what he produces, “we know immediately that we can never even submit our material,” Ms. Wolov said.

Private Acts, Public Jokes

Jokes about masturbation have been a regular part of Louis C.K.’s stage shows. In one bit, he complains about not being able to find a private place in his house to do it. “I’m on the streets now,” he says, “I’ve got nowhere to go.” In another bit he laments being a prisoner of his perversions. “Just the constant perverted sexual thoughts,” he says, then mimes masturbating. “It makes me into a moron.”

Tig Notaro, the comedian whose Amazon series, “One Mississippi,” lists Louis C.K. as an executive producer, is one of the few in the fiercely insular comedy world to speak out against him. Her career received a huge boost when he released her 2012 comedy album, about her cancer diagnosis. But their relationship has crumbled and she now feels “trapped” by her association with him, she wrote in an email.

Her fear is that “he released my album to cover his tracks,” she said. “He knew it was going to make him look like a good guy, supporting a woman.” Ms. Notaro said she learned of his reputation after they sold the series to Amazon, and a recent story line is a fictional treatment of the alleged masturbation episodes.

“Sadly, I’ve come to learn that Louis C.K.’s victims are not only real,” she said by email, “but many are actual friends of mine within the comedy community,” like Ms. Corry, who confided in her, she said.

In his forthcoming film, about a television writer whose teenage daughter is wooed by a Woody Allen type, one character aggressively mimics masturbating in front of others. The content has raised eyebrows. Given the rumors surrounding Louis C.K., the movie “plays like an ambiguous moral inventory of and excuse for everything that allows sexual predators to thrive: open secrets, toxic masculinity, and powerful people getting the benefit of the doubt,” Joe Berkowitz wrote in Fast Company.

Yet in an interview with The Times in September at the Toronto film festival, where “I Love You, Daddy,” was shown, Louis C.K. dismissed stories of his alleged sexual misconduct as “rumors,” and said the notion that the masturbation scenes referred to them never occurred to him. “It’s funny, I didn’t think of that, ” he said.

Apologies With Troubling Implications

In private, though, he appears to have acknowledged his behavior.

In 2009, six years after their phone call, Ms. Schachner received a Facebook message from Louis C.K., apologizing. “Last time I talked to you ended in a sordid fashion,” he wrote in the message, which was reviewed by The Times. “That was a bad time in my life and I’m sorry.” He added that he had seen some of Ms. Schachner’s comedy and thought she was funny. “I remember thinking what a repulsive person I was being by responding the way that I did,” he wrote.

Ms. Schachner accepted his apology and told him she forgave him. But the original interaction left her deeply dispirited, she said, and was one of the things that discouraged her from pursuing comedy.

In 2015, a few months before the now-defunct website Defamer circulated rumors of Louis C.K.’s alleged sexual misconduct, Ms. Corry also received an email from Louis C.K., which was obtained by The Times, saying he owed her a “very very very late apology.” When he phoned her, he said he was sorry for shoving her in a bathroom. Ms. Corry replied that he had never done that, but had instead asked to masturbate in front of her. Responding in a shaky voice, he acknowledged it and said, “I used to misread people back then,” she recalled.

The call confounded her, Ms. Corry said: not only had he misremembered the incident, which made her think there were other moments of misconduct, he also implied she had done something to invite his behavior. “It is unfair he’s put me or anyone else in this position,” Ms. Corry said.

Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov said that with other allegations swirling around the entertainment world, they could no longer stay silent. “Because of this moment, as gross as it is, we feel compelled to speak,” Ms. Goodman said.

Ms. Notaro said she was standing in support of those with the courage “to speak up against such a powerful figure,” she said, “as well as the multitude of women still out there, not quite ready to share their nightmares.”",Louis C.K.

For decades, one of the most sanctimonious moralizers in American politics has been Roy Moore, the longtime Bible-thumper in Alabama who crusaded against gays, transgender people, Islam and “sexual perversion.”

Moore suggested just this year that the 9/11 terror attacks were God’s punishment because “we legitimize sodomy.” He has said that homosexuality is “ the same thing ” as sex with a cow and should be criminalized, and argued that Representative Keith Ellison should not be allowed to serve in Congress because he is a Muslim.

All the while, Moore seems to have been the king of hypocrisy. The Washington Post published a devastating account of how he initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old schoolgirl.

The victim said that Moore, then a 32-year-old assistant district attorney, drove the girl to his house, removed her clothes and touched her sexually. Under Alabama law, that apparently constitutes sexual abuse in the second degree. If you want an example of a politician who lost support and was arrested for less egregious behavior, consider Anthony Weiner, the former Democratic member of Congress, who is now in prison for sexting a 15-year-old girl.

The Post found three other women who said that Moore pursued them when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers. The women did not contact the Post and were initially reluctant to speak.

Moore denies the accusations as “completely false” — and promptly tried to use them for fund-raising. My reaction was that Moore should have spent less time thundering about the Ten Commandments and more time reading them.

This is of course a larger pattern in American life. As one reader put it on my Facebook page: “Those who moralize most, sin most.”

That’s not always true, and sanctimonious hypocrites inhabit the left as well as the right: Harvey Weinstein participated in a “women’s march.” But we’re at a watershed moment in the aftermath of the Weinstein case, trying to end impunity for sexual assault, and allegations against our leaders are even more serious than those against our entertainers. And, frankly, it’s just staggering to see “family values” conservatives making excuses for child molestation.

The Alabama state auditor, a Republican named Jim Ziegler, defended Moore as “clean as a hound’s tooth” and offered a bizarre defense of child abuse: He asserted that the Virgin Mary was a teenager when Joseph married her (in fact, the Bible does not indicate her age), adding: “They became parents of Jesus.”

Sigh. When Christians cite the Bible to defend child molestation, Jesus should sue for defamation.

Meanwhile, an Alabama Republican legislator, Ed Henry, went even further: He said that the women accusing Moore should be prosecuted for waiting to make their allegations.

Looking back, some of the grossest immorality of the late 20th century had nothing to do with gay bath houses, as preachers sometimes suggested, but rather with the blowhard televangelists who suggested that AIDS was God’s punishment of gay men. This smirking moralizing slowed the response to AIDS and arguably resulted in millions dying unnecessarily all over the world.

In my columns, I’ve repeatedly defended evangelical Christians , and protested that they are one of the few groups that it’s socially acceptable for liberals to mock, stereotype and discriminate against . Some liberals still haven’t forgiven me for my “ Hug an Evangelical ” column 13 years ago. But I find it infuriating to see some evangelicals now downplaying child molestation or our president’s boasts of sexual assault.

We all make compromises — I supported Bill Clinton in 1992 over George H.W. Bush, whom I thought was personally more moral — but that doesn’t require downplaying the inexcusable. I used to complain that conservatives believe that morality is about only personal behavior, while liberals believe it is only about policy positions, while actually it’s about both. Sadly, some of the “family values” conservatives now don’t seem to care about either private or public morality.

If evangelical Christians want to engage in activism, they needn’t support hypocrites and bigots; they can support lifesaving organizations like World Vision or African Mission Healthcare Foundation , or fight human trafficking by supporting International Justice Mission , or reduce abortions by backing the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy .

As it happened, just before the revelations about Moore became public, I visited leaders of an inspiring tri-faith project in Omaha, where a church, a synagogue and a mosque are partnering on a shared site to build empathy and understanding. I asked the pastor involved, Rev. Eric Elnes, for his reaction to Moore.

“Blazing with self-righteous indignation toward others is often what people use to hide their own sins in the shadows,” Elnes said. “This is probably why Jesus’ biggest problem — by far — was with the self-righteous. When it came to those whom society cast away as ‘sinners,’ Jesus was repeatedly gentle, gracious, encouraging, and forgiving, but he continually castigated the self-righteous.”

Elnes added: “I’ve never understood why certain Christians are so eager to turn the United States into a Christian country when their time would be so much better spent turning their churches into Christian churches.”

Roy Moore today is a challenge for those who see themselves as good and decent people of faith: If you find yourself excusing child molestation, then you are driven not by morality or faith, but simply by the emptiest kind of tribalism.

Her career received a huge boost when he released her 2012 comedy album, about her cancer diagnosis. But their relationship has crumbled and she now feels “trapped” by her association with him, she wrote in an email.

In 2015, a few months before the now-defunct website Defamer circulated rumors of Louis C.K.’s alleged sexual misconduct, Ms. Corry also received an email from Louis C.K., which was obtained by The Times, saying he owed her a “very very very late apology.” When he phoned her, he said he was sorry for shoving her in a bathroom. Ms. Corry replied that he had never done that, but had instead asked to masturbate in front of her. Responding in a shaky voice, he acknowledged it and said, “I used to misread people back then,” she recalled.

The call confounded her, Ms. Corry said: not only had he misremembered the incident, which made her think there were other moments of misconduct, he also implied she had done something to invite his behavior. “It is unfair he’s put me or anyone else in this position,” Ms. Corry said.

When 2017 arrived she was 26 and caring for the postwar version of her best friend — an able-bodied man without a job.

She knew she was blessed that he had survived. She fought to remember what she wanted to be. “It’s been so hectic for so long I think I forgot what I was good at, and what I like,” she said.

As Justice Lavin tells it, Conner T. Lowry, one of his nephews, showed up in a Marine recruiter’s office in 2008 as a “classic South Side Irish kind of kid.” Standing six feet five inches tall and weighing 220 pounds, he was exuberance personified (“live life large,” he used to say), and determined to enlist.

The judge was against the decision. He thought the United States had bungled the wars since the terror attacks in 2001 and that the Pentagon didn’t know what it was doing — circumstances in which the risks to the enlisted ranks were exceptionally high.

Young Mr. Lowry was firm. He told him, the judge said, that “he decided to get into the Marine Corps to straighten his life out a little bit.”

Family and friends saw him off from Cork & Kerry, an Irish bar in the Beverly neighborhood of Chicago. The judge, being a judge, knew when a case was lost. He observed the rituals. He hoisted a pint of Guinness, set aside his misgivings and threw in his blessing, with a toast.

“We have to support our country, support our flag, support our men and women in uniform,” he said. “Even if we disagree with the mission.”

Then Reacher meets a private detective who is trying to find the very same small-fingered woman. And they both wind up in a remote corner of Wyoming that Child summons especially well. Not all of his books are as powerfully visual as this one. They often feature long straight roads and empty landscapes. “The Midnight Line” describes old railroad land that’s sparsely populated, etched with unmarked trails and long, rocky driveways; neighborly if your idea of a neighbor is a stranger 20 miles away, and understandable to Reacher only because the Army taught him how to read topographical maps. It’s a great place to hide. And an easy place in which to become addicted to opioids.

The pieces of the plot come together as Reacher’s military pride and the community’s illicit opioid use intersect. The bad actors are nominally the dealers, but “The Midnight Line” doesn’t demonize its villains the way Child’s books usually do. And the addicts aren’t dismissed or treated as stereotypes. The book voices strong convictions about the issues that are raised here, and it’s no stretch given Reacher’s principled military background. The last chapters have more emotional heft than anything Child has written before.

Each Reacher book has to include certain basics to keep his fans happy. There has to be fighting, so Child choreographs a ridiculous biker bashing very early. (Name of the bikers’ leader: Jimmy Rat.) Child can write these scenes on autopilot by now, because there are only so many ways Reacher can strategize, maneuver and clobber. The series’ humor and insult quotas are nicely filled. So is its educational one, as Child explains the history of heroin as an American product, and outlines another drug-related type of American tragedy that would be a spoiler here.

This book adds its share of classic moments to the Reacher canon. There’s a wonderful scene in which the big guy is staked out by some cowboys. True, he completely misunderstands what they want from him. But he still dials his classic move up to 11:

“He stood chin up, his full height, shoulders back, hands loose, not a circus freak, but a little bigger all around than a normal big guy, enough so they noticed. Plus the eyes, which he found most people liked, except he could blink and come back different, like changing the channel, from a happy show to some bleak documentary about prehistoric survival a million years ago.”

One month has passed since the sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein sent a ripple effect through Hollywood and beyond — prompting thousands of women to share their own stories using the hashtag #metoo.

Since then, allegations of sexual harassment and assault have been leveled against a number of public figures, including actors, directors, lawmakers and journalists.

We might have to wait for a corporate tax cut.

Corporate America initially reacted about as well as could have been expected when Senate Republicans proposed changing the corporate rate in 2019. (The WSJ editorial board argues that the delay is acceptable, because the Senate bill includes full expensing of business expenses.)

That’s not the only issue, of course. Republicans will have to reconcile differences in the Senate and House tax plans.

‘The most excited group out there are big C.E.O.s.’

Is Gary Cohn going to regret saying that in his interview with CNBC? He was trying to explain corporate America’s enthusiasm for a tax overhaul, but it isn’t quite the messaging that the White House has in mind. (Dealbreaker’s headline: “Gary Cohn Tacitly Reveals That He Slept Through Years Of Goldman Sachs Media Training.”)

Mr. Cohn also committed to staying in the administration, even though he was passed over for Federal Reserve chairman.

He also said this: Mr. Cohn told CNBC that he thought that Mr. Trump and Lloyd Blankfein, his former boss, have many similarities. Mr. Blankfein, a Democrat who has publicly criticized the president, later told CNBC, “I don’t mind the comparison.”

What the C.E.O.s of AT&T, Uber and more said at the conference.

Thirteen newsmakers joined us at the DealBook conference on Thursday, and many made news. Here’s what they said:

• AT&T’s C.E.O., Randall L. Stephenson, said that selling CNN to push through his company’s acquisition of Time Warner hasn’t been on the table — and never will be.

• Mark Cuban said that he was “considering” a presidential run.

Catch up on Andrew’s conversations here.

‘There is absolutely no intention that we would ever sell CNN.’

Mr. Stephenson made that clear. But also emerging is an apparent attempt to depoliticize an increasingly heated dispute with the Justice Department: The A&T chief told Andrew that the Trump administration had never asked him to sell CNN, and that he didn’t believe there was a “Trump factor” in the talks.

(To be clear: We’ve reported that AT&T was asked to sell either Turner Broadcasting, the Time Warner division that includes CNN, or DirecTV. Mr. Stephenson didn’t comment on those specific requests.)

That raises questions about what the Justice Department is really seeking. Is it, as some Trump critics suggest, an attack on a news outlet that the president has openly criticized? Or is it an attempt to break up a deal that has become a lightning rod for concerns about a rapidly consolidating media industry, perhaps rooted in the administration’s populist tendencies?

Where we go from here: “If we feel like litigation is a better outcome, then we will litigate,” Mr. Stephenson told Andrew. But the two sides are still negotiating — including in public — and a settlement could still happen.

Is it Wall Street’s chance to strike gold in China?

A government move to lift foreign ownership limits on banks and insurers in China is music to Western firms’ ears. Tied to Mr. Trump’s visit, the initiative will let finally let them gain more than a tiny foothold there. A UBS executive told Reuters, “China is a key market for UBS and, as indicated previously, we continue to work towards increasing our stake in UBS Securities Co Ltd.”

Not everyone is convinced that Wall Street firms will take over China, however, since state-run banks will remain powerful.

Goldman makes a move: The firm announced a $5 billion investment vehicle with China’s sovereign wealth fund to help it invest in American manufacturers — and to help those companies gain access to the Chinese market.

officials say the video is part of an ongoing criminal case involving Mr. Mateen’s wife.","Officials have kept videos from other mass shootings out of public view for years after the fact, including those that captured parts of the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016, the attack at Fort Hood in 2009, and the deadly shooting at a constituent event in Tucson led by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords in 2011.

The Rev. Stephen Curry, who helped preside over the first vigil for the First Baptist Church victims on Sunday night, said people were just too devastated to support the release of the video. In time, he said, it could be made public and serve historical and educational purposes, as with Abraham Zapruder’s footage of the Kennedy assassination. It could “help us learn about how to protect each other, how to protect ourselves, how to protect the congregation,” he said.

But not now. “It’s too raw,” he said.

State and federal law enforcement officials have reviewed the Texas footage but have not said whether they intend to release it. The video was seized as part of an investigation that is likely to last for months as officials unravel the life and criminal past of the gunman, Devin P. Kelley, who officials say was found dead with a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he carried out the deadliest mass shooting in the state’s history.

“You have a dead suspect, so one of the arguments will be, ‘The suspect is dead, we’re not going to court, so why not release it now?’” said Tony Leal, a former chief of the Texas Rangers, the unit leading the investigation into the attack in Sutherland Springs. “And the answer to that question is: ‘Because the investigation continues.’”

Mr. Leal, who was in charge of the Rangers when 13 people were killed in a mass shooting at Fort Hood in 2009, said that the premature release of the video could taint, even inadvertently, the memories of witnesses. Other officials raised concerns that releasing such gruesome, inflammatory images could jeopardize the trial process and influence potential jurors in other cases.

Whether Texas officials release any video images may hinge on how they apply the state’s open records law. Although state law permits the release of crime scene imagery in some circumstances, law enforcement agencies are able to withhold information when it “deals with the detection, investigation or prosecution of crime” in a matter that did not lead to a conviction.

Lawyers who are involved in public records issues in Texas said that officials have often interpreted the exemption broadly and that it would probably give the authorities enough legal cover to keep the video private.

The video is not the only remnant of the shooting at issue: It is not even clear how long the church will stand in Sutherland Springs. In conversations this week with two leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention, the pastor here, Frank Pomeroy, whose daughter died in the attack, raised the possibility of demolishing the building and erecting a memorial in its place. A new worship center would be built nearby.

Although no decision has been made, Roger S. Oldham, a spokesman for the convention, said that Mr. Pomeroy had expressed concern that the heavily damaged building was “a place of really stark memories.”

Current and former law enforcement officials described shielding images from public view as an act of respect for the victims of shootings and their families. In Orlando, Fla., the police chief, John Mina, said that his officers do not include any graphic images when they make presentations to other police departments about how they handled the Pulse nightclub shooting.

“To me, any time those things are asked for or requested, it seems like it’s just curiosity,” Chief Mina said. “I don’t see a need to release that.”

The F.B.I. is in possession of a graphic surveillance video of the massacre at Pulse that depicts Omar Mateen, the gunman, entering the club and firing for more than five minutes. At least twice, he can been seen executing wounded patrons, some of whom were writhing on the dance floor.

The video also provides the clearest look at how the police initially responded to the attack. Yet, despite the public interest, it has never been released. F.B.I. officials say the video is part of an ongoing criminal case involving Mr. Mateen’s wife.

There is precedent of releasing some video associated with mass shootings. The F.B.I., for instance, released footage after the Navy Yard killings in Washington in 2013, but it did not show the gunman opening fire.

Even when images are released in response to public records requests, media ethics experts say that journalists must weigh whether publishing such invasive, traumatic images adds substantially to the public’s understanding of a shooting, such as contradicting an official explanation.

“This is the moment of death for 26 people,” said Kelly McBride, vice president of the Poynter Institute. “How much of an invasion of privacy is it into that moment? And how do you balance that against the need to tell the story and show the story?”

Some gun control advocates say the videos should be required viewing for elected officials because they show a visceral toll of gun violence that body counts and pictures from funerals cannot convey.

A recent study in which people were shown videos of a mass execution by the Islamic State found that viewers were most affected by video clips that did not edit out the worst violence.

“People were angrier about it and more disgusted,” said Matthew Grizzard, an assistant professor of communication at the University at Buffalo, the study’s lead author. “If you don’t see it, it’s easier to ignore. Seeing consequences causes stronger emotions in us and makes us care more.”

After the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., the documentary filmmaker Michael Moore suggested that the nation’s gun control debate would end in an instant if the public saw the crime scene photos. His comments provoked a backlash among Connecticut lawmakers who moved quickly to withhold those images.

Andrea Brauer, former executive director of Texas Gun Sense, said that releasing the video from Sunday’s shooting as a deterrent to gun violence would be “very, very upsetting for the families” and that she would not make it public.

Nevertheless, she said, when she sees pictures of the 20 children killed in Newtown, “that’s reason enough for me to want to do something.”

“I’m so torn,” said Sandy Phillips, whose daughter, Jessica Ghawi, was among 12 people killed inside an Aurora, Colo., movie theater in July 2012. “This is the reality. But the other reality is, we don’t want to see that.”

She thought the images were important for investigators trying to piece together the crimes, and could also help other emergency management teams study where they and others had made mistakes, and how to improve their responses. But she said simply releasing graphic and disturbing videos served little purpose beyond offering fodder to conspiracy theorists who dismiss mass shootings as hoaxes or as staged “false flag” events.

“To know that it lives live on the internet, on YouTube and anybody can pull it up, that’s a horrible thing,” she said. “You don’t know when somebody’s going to find it and somebody’s going to send it to you in an email.”

Ms. Phillips, who with her husband founded an advocacy group for survivors and family members affected by gun violence, said she had grappled with whether to request her own daughter’s autopsy photographs, so she could show them to elected officials in meetings.

But what about owners of small businesses? Under current law, their business income is “passed through” to their personal income, and taxed accordingly. The Cut Cut Cut Act would instead allow people with such income to pay only 25 percent, a big tax break for those with high incomes. But this raises obvious possibilities for abuse, with every well-paid professional reclassifying herself or himself as a business.

To limit these abuses, the G.O.P. bill imposes rules that basically limit the 25 percent rate to “passive” income recipients. That is, you get the full tax break only if you own a business but don’t, you know, actually run it.

Finally, let’s imagine a very lucky individual — let’s arbitrarily call him Eric Trump — who stands to inherit a stake in a business he doesn’t run, plus a bunch of stock. He’ll get his inheritance tax-free, because the estate tax gets phased out in the G.O.P. bill. He’ll get to pay a low tax rate on his business income. And his stocks will pay higher dividends, because the G.O.P. bill also sharply cuts corporate tax rates, and most of the benefit of those cuts will probably flow to shareholders.

So when Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, says that the bill’s goal is “to deliver middle-class tax cuts to the hard-working families in this country,” he’s claiming that up is down and black is white. This bill does little or nothing for the middle class, and even among the affluent it’s biased against those who work hard in favor of the idle rich.

Also let’s not forget that tax increases on working Americans are only part of the story. This bill would also, according to the Congressional Budget Office, add $1.7 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. You know what that means: If this bill or anything like it passes, Republicans will immediately revert to their previous pretense of being deficit hawks and start demanding spending cuts.

And since federal spending is dominated by programs — Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid — that benefit the middle and working classes, the end result of this tax bill would be to leave most working Americans, even those who wouldn’t face direct tax increases, worse off, all for the benefit of a tiny minority, especially those who haven’t even worked for their wealth.

You might wonder how Republicans imagine that they can get away with this. But anyone who has paid attention to U.S. politics knows the answer. First, they will lie, unashamedly, about what their bill actually does. Second, they will try to distract working-class voters by stoking racial animosity. That didn’t work too well in Tuesday’s elections, but they’ll keep on trying.",Trump and Ryan Versus the Little People,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/opinion/trump-ryan-republican-taxes.html

Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov said that with other allegations swirling around the entertainment world, they could no longer stay silent.","Neither Louis C.K. nor Mr. Kay replied to follow-up emails in which the accusations were laid out in detail, or to voice messages or texts. On Thursday, the premiere of Louis C.K.’s new movie “I Love You, Daddy,” was abruptly canceled, and he also canceled an appearance on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”

The stories told by the women raise sharp questions about the anecdotes that Louis C.K. tells in his own comedy. He rose to fame in part by appearing to be candid about his flaws and sexual hang-ups, discussing and miming masturbation extensively in his act — an exaggerated riff that some of the women feel may have served as a cover for real misconduct. He has all but invited comparison between his private life and his onscreen work, too: In “I Love You, Daddy,” which is scheduled to be released next week, a character pretends to masturbate at length in front of other people, and other characters appear to dismiss rumors of sexual predation.

At the same time, Louis C.K. has also boosted the careers of women, and is sometimes viewed as a feminist by fans and critics. But Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov said that when they told others about the incident in the Colorado hotel room, they heard that Louis C.K.’s manager was upset that they were talking about it openly. The women feared career repercussions. Louis C.K.’s manager, Dave Becky, was adamant in an email that he “never threatened anyone.”

For comedians, the professional environment is informal: profanity and raunch that would be far out of line in most workplaces are common, and personal foibles — the weirder the better — are routinely mined for material. But Louis C.K.’s behavior was abusive, the women said.

“I think the line gets crossed when you take all your clothes off and start masturbating,” Ms. Wolov said.

‘You Want to Believe It’s Not Happening’

Ms. Corry, a comedian, writer and actress, has long felt haunted by her run-in with Louis C.K. In 2005, she was working as a performer and producer on a television pilot — a big step in her career — when Louis C.K., a guest star, approached her as she was walking to the set. “He leaned close to my face and said, ‘Can I ask you something?’ I said, ‘Yes,’” Ms. Corry said in a written statement to The New York Times. “He asked if we could go to my dressing room so he could masturbate in front of me.” Stunned and angry, Ms. Corry said she declined, and pointed out that he had a daughter and a pregnant wife. “His face got red,” she recalled, “and he told me he had issues.”

Word quickly reached the show’s executive producers, Courteney Cox and David Arquette, who both confirmed the incident. “What happened to Rebecca on that set was awful,” Ms. Cox said in an email, adding that she felt “outrage and shock.”

“My concern was to create an environment where Rebecca felt safe, protected and heard,” she said. They discussed curtailing the production. Ms. Corry decided to continue with the show.

“Things were going well for me,” Ms. Corry said in the statement, “and I had no interest in being the person who shut down a production.”

A fifth woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect her family’s privacy because she has not been publicly linked to the incident with Louis C.K., also has disturbing memories about an incident with the comedian. In the late ’90s, she was working in production at “The Chris Rock Show” when Louis C.K., a writer and producer there, repeatedly asked her to watch him masturbate, she said. She was in her early 20s and went along with his request, but later questioned his behavior.

“It was something that I knew was wrong,” said the woman, who described sitting in Louis C.K.’s office while he masturbated in his desk chair during a workday, other colleagues just outside the door. “I think the big piece of why I said yes was because of the culture,” she continued. “He abused his power.” A co-worker at “The Chris Rock Show,” who also wished to remain anonymous, confirmed that the woman told him about the experience soon after it happened.

Ms. Schachner, a writer, illustrator and performer, admired Louis C.K.’s work. They had met in the comedy scene; Ms. Schachner’s former boyfriend was a comedy writer who had worked with Louis C.K. In 2003, when she called Louis C.K. with an invitation to her show, he said he was at work in an office as a writer on the series “Cedric the Entertainer Presents,” she recalled.

Their conversation quickly moved from the personal — Louis C.K. had seen photos of her on her boyfriend’s desk, he said, and told her he thought she was cute — to “unprofessional and inappropriate,” Ms. Schachner said.

She said she heard the blinds coming down. Then he slowly started telling her his sexual fantasies, breathing heavily and talking softly. She realized he was masturbating, and was dumbfounded. The call went on for several minutes, even though, Ms. Schachner said, “I definitely wasn’t encouraging it.” But she didn’t know how to end it, either. “You want to believe it’s not happening,” she said. A friend, Stuart Harris, confirmed that Ms. Schachner had described the call to him in 2003.

Harassment Claims

For years afterward, Ms. Schachner said, she felt angry and betrayed by an artist she looked up to. And she wondered what she could have done differently. “I felt very ashamed,” she said.

A Run-In, Then Fears About Speaking Out

During Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov’s surreal visit to Louis C.K.’s Aspen hotel room, they said they were holding onto each other, screaming and laughing in shock, as Louis C.K. masturbated in a chair. “We were paralyzed,” Ms. Goodman said. After he ejaculated on his stomach, they said, they fled. He called after them: “He was like, ‘Which one is Dana and which one is Julia?’” Ms. Goodman recalled.

Afterward, they ran into Charna Halpern, the owner of influential improv theaters in Los Angeles and Chicago, where Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov performed, and relayed what had happened. “I didn’t know what to do, I didn’t know what to tell them to do,” said Ms. Halpern. Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov decided against going to the police, unsure whether what happened was criminal, but felt they had to respond in some way “because something crazy happened to us,” Ms. Goodman said.

Hoping that outrage would build against Louis C.K., and also to shame him, they began telling others about the incident the next day. But many people seemed to recoil, they said. “Guys were backing away from us,” Ms. Wolov said. Barely 24 hours after they left Louis C.K.’s hotel, “we could already feel the backlash.”

Soon after, they said they understood from their managers that Mr. Becky, Louis C.K’s manager, wanted them to stop telling people about their encounter with Louis C.K. Lee Kernis, one of the women’s managers at the time, confirmed on Thursday that he had a conversation in which he told Mr. Becky that Louis C.K.’s behavior toward the women had been offensive. Mr. Kernis also said that Mr. Becky was upset that the women were talking openly about the incident.

Mr. Becky denied making any threats toward the women. “I don’t recall the exact specifics of the conversation, but know I never threatened anyone,” he wrote by email on Thursday. Ms. Halpern and Robert Schroeder — Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov’s agent at the time — said that the pair told them that they felt they had been warned to stop talking.

Mr. Becky arguably wields even more power in comedy than Louis C.K. He represents Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari, Amy Poehler and other top performers, and his company, 3 Arts, puts together programming deals for nearly every platform.

Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov moved to Los Angeles shortly after the Aspen festival, but “we were coming here with a bunch of enemies,” Ms. Goodman said. Gren Wells, a filmmaker who befriended the comedy duo in 2002, said the incident and the warning, which they told her about soon after Aspen, hung heavily over them both. “This is something that they were freaked out about,” Ms. Wells said.

In the years since, Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov have found some success, but they remained concerned about Mr. Becky and took themselves out of the running for the many projects he was involved in. Though their humor is in line with what he produces, “we know immediately that we can never even submit our material,” Ms. Wolov said.

Private Acts, Public Jokes

Jokes about masturbation have been a regular part of Louis C.K.’s stage shows. In one bit, he complains about not being able to find a private place in his house to do it. “I’m on the streets now,” he says, “I’ve got nowhere to go.” In another bit he laments being a prisoner of his perversions. “Just the constant perverted sexual thoughts,” he says, then mimes masturbating. “It makes me into a moron.”

Tig Notaro, the comedian whose Amazon series, “One Mississippi,” lists Louis C.K. as an executive producer, is one of the few in the fiercely insular comedy world to speak out against him. Her career received a huge boost when he released her 2012 comedy album, about her cancer diagnosis. But their relationship has crumbled and she now feels “trapped” by her association with him, she wrote in an email.

Her fear is that “he released my album to cover his tracks,” she said. “He knew it was going to make him look like a good guy, supporting a woman.” Ms. Notaro said she learned of his reputation after they sold the series to Amazon, and a recent story line is a fictional treatment of the alleged masturbation episodes.

“Sadly, I’ve come to learn that Louis C.K.’s victims are not only real,” she said by email, “but many are actual friends of mine within the comedy community,” like Ms. Corry, who confided in her, she said.

In his forthcoming film, about a television writer whose teenage daughter is wooed by a Woody Allen type, one character aggressively mimics masturbating in front of others. The content has raised eyebrows. Given the rumors surrounding Louis C.K., the movie “plays like an ambiguous moral inventory of and excuse for everything that allows sexual predators to thrive: open secrets, toxic masculinity, and powerful people getting the benefit of the doubt,” Joe Berkowitz wrote in Fast Company.

Yet in an interview with The Times in September at the Toronto film festival, where “I Love You, Daddy,” was shown, Louis C.K. dismissed stories of his alleged sexual misconduct as “rumors,” and said the notion that the masturbation scenes referred to them never occurred to him. “It’s funny, I didn’t think of that, ” he said.

Apologies With Troubling Implications

In private, though, he appears to have acknowledged his behavior.

In 2009, six years after their phone call, Ms. Schachner received a Facebook message from Louis C.K., apologizing. “Last time I talked to you ended in a sordid fashion,” he wrote in the message, which was reviewed by The Times. “That was a bad time in my life and I’m sorry.” He added that he had seen some of Ms. Schachner’s comedy and thought she was funny. “I remember thinking what a repulsive person I was being by responding the way that I did,” he wrote.

Ms. Schachner accepted his apology and told him she forgave him. But the original interaction left her deeply dispirited, she said, and was one of the things that discouraged her from pursuing comedy.

In 2015, a few months before the now-defunct website Defamer circulated rumors of Louis C.K.’s alleged sexual misconduct, Ms. Corry also received an email from Louis C.K., which was obtained by The Times, saying he owed her a “very very very late apology.” When he phoned her, he said he was sorry for shoving her in a bathroom. Ms. Corry replied that he had never done that, but had instead asked to masturbate in front of her. Responding in a shaky voice, he acknowledged it and said, “I used to misread people back then,” she recalled.

The call confounded her, Ms. Corry said: not only had he misremembered the incident, which made her think there were other moments of misconduct, he also implied she had done something to invite his behavior. “It is unfair he’s put me or anyone else in this position,” Ms. Corry said.

Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov said that with other allegations swirling around the entertainment world, they could no longer stay silent. “Because of this moment, as gross as it is, we feel compelled to speak,” Ms. Goodman said.

Ms. Notaro said she was standing in support of those with the courage “to speak up against such a powerful figure,” she said, “as well as the multitude of women still out there, not quite ready to share their nightmares.”",Louis C.K.

Battling with McConnell

PETERS: So was that like a Fort Sumter in your civil war? You’ve got Jeff Flake on the run? BANNON: No. It’s not Fort Sumter, but we did — look, what’s happened here recently is you — is you see that those politicians that really don’t understand the Trump movement or haven’t been supportive of the president. And we had, you know, Big Luther in Alabama. We had Corker in Tennessee, and we had Flake in Arizona, and there’ll be more. There’ll be more. Don’t think that — don’t think that you know not one of these senators has run out there and said publicly and said, “I want the endorsement of Mitch McConnell.” Yet they’re all coming to us. PETERS: Do you think Mitch McConnell will be majority leader at this time next year? BANNON: I absolutely do not think he will be majority leader. PETERS: Is that your personal mission to make that not happen? BANNON: It’s not my personal mission, but it is an objective that I — I have an objective that Mitch McConnell will not be majority leader, and I believe will be done before this time next year.

Conservatives like Mr. Bannon want to make the 2018 Senate elections, in large part, a referendum on Mr. McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader. In his meetings with potential Senate candidates, Mr. Bannon has been asking them to make a pledge not to support Mr. McConnell for another term as leader.

A major factor determining whether this insurgent conservative movement succeeds will be how angry Republican voters are at incumbents. Right now, that anger is running hot. Mr. McConnell is the most unpopular national political figure, according to a recent Harvard poll. But if Republicans start looking more politically competent — by passing, for example, a tax cut — voters may be less likely to turn on them.

Forcing Republicans to take sides

BANNON: Now, who did Gillespie campaign with? He campaigned with George Bush and Marco Rubio. And I think Condi Rice. Right? He — did he have — he had George Bush standing next to him. Did he have Donald Trump standing next to him? No, he did not. People are going to have to get over their differences on the right. And I’ve said this — Breitbart was very active in this — in this campaign at the end doing lots of stories, doing lots of profiles. Breitbart radio. And the reason is — is that, hey, Gillespie’s not a guy that’s particularly, you know, excites me.

Will the Republican Party be the Bush/Rubio party or the Trump Party? That is the question that Mr. Bannon sees as defining this looming battle between conservatives. Bush/Rubio is shorthand for the establishment that Mr. Bannon loathes — the party that favors a softer, more inclusive approach toward immigration laws and a more active role for America in the global community. The Trump Party rejects those premises entirely.

The establishment wing of the party considered these debates settled. What Mr. Trump did — and what Mr. Bannon helped draw out in Mr. Trump — was to force these issues and make Republicans take sides. We know what side won 2016. We don’t know yet which will prevail in 2018 and beyond.

On the Virginia governor’s race

BANNON: And by the way, the Gillespie campaign never really coordinated, never really reached out. The whole thing on the Trump stuff was a little bit grafted on. Now, some of the issues of MS-13 and — and sanctuary cities certainly came up. I do believe that — that Gillespie was a little halfhearted. It wasn’t embracing the core parts of the Trump agenda and driving and making it every day. The Trump agenda will win, and I understand how the — PETERS: I wonder if it was something of a problem of Gillespie himself because he was seen by conservatives as a creature of the swamp, so to speak, or of the establishment. BANNON: 100 percent. But even with the Trump people, this is the thing — I — I tried in — in the — the stories of Breitbart, in the other stories that came out on the other con — far-right news services. Is that even with the Trump people — and that’s with the Corey Stewart. You — if you lose in a primary, you got to get over it. The only way this thing’s going to work is to keep this coalition together.

Even if Ed Gillespie had sold himself as a cloned Donald Trump, it still would not have been enough to win the governor’s race in Virginia, illustrating the challenges of the Bannon/Trump model in swing states like Virginia with large, highly educated suburban populations.

That model works well in rural states, in the South and central Plains. It worked — but just barely — in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, where less than 80,000 votes delivered the White House to Mr. Trump. Whether it can work there again is Mr. Bannon’s crucible.

On the white nationalist appeal

PETERS: So there’s no doubt though that that message of President Trump’s has appeal with white nationalists. Is that an unfortunate reality, an unintended consequence? BANNON: I think it’s, I think it’s, I think it’s nonsense. I think it’s nonsense. PETERS: You don’t think he appeals to them at all? BANNON: I think these guys grab on to anything they can. No, the message is one of, this guy is the least racist guy I’ve ever met. And nothing in the campaign, and nothing that he’s done to date. That’s all that’s all left wing. That’s MSNBC nonsense. And by the way, you can’t help with a couple of, these guys are marginalia to marginalia. Right? So they’ll grab onto anything — and by the way, every time they say Trump’s name, MSNBC has got a camera on it and The New York Times has an article on it, right? Because you’re obsessed with it. PETERS: You’re saying it’s a media fabrication. BANNON: Absolutely, a hundred percent it’s a hundred percent media fabrication. And, by the way, because they realize that they think the only way they can run is by smearing you to be a nativist, a misogynist, a racist, a homophobe. Just go down the line.

This is a question that will continue to dog Mr. Trump, Mr. Bannon and the politicians who wrap themselves in their agenda. Mr. Bannon has denounced and rejected white nationalism publicly, as has Mr. Trump.

Russian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment submitted to the government’s sports ministry.

The antidoping regulator seized the opportunity on Friday to restate another request: that Russia accept the findings of McLaren’s inquiry, which confirmed that top government officials and Russia’s Federal Security Service had assisted with coordinated cheating.

“This new intelligence serves to reinforce our requirement of Russian authorities that they too publicly accept the outcomes,” of last year’s investigation, the global antidoping agency’s president, Craig Reedie, said in a statement.

Through Mr. McLaren’s inquiry, the antidoping watchdog deconstructed Russia’s cheating schemes and determined that some 1,000 athletes had been tied up in them over three and a half years. Still, officials determined that many individual cases would be hard or impossible to prosecute, in part because of Russia’s lack of cooperation in providing certain evidence, including stored urine samples and the electronic lab records on past tests.

Antidoping officials from several countries who have urged Olympics leaders to take a harder stance against Russia in the wake of Mr. McLaren’s investigation — even calling for the nation to be barred from the Pyeongchang Games — have pointed to Russia’s refusal to turn over the electronic data.

The World Anti-Doping Agency had ordered Russia to share the database before the watchdog would agree to restore Russia to good standing and certify its compliance with the global antidoping code. The agency is due to evaluate Russia’s cooperation and decide whether to recertify the nation at a meeting next week in Seoul.

Investigators who have studied how Russia corrupted several Olympics — most notably the 2014 Sochi Games, where the country controlled the antidoping laboratory and dominated the medal standings — have coveted the electronic files from Moscow.

Known as laboratory information management system data, the records reflect the results of lab tests run on the machines in Russia’s national antidoping lab, a nondescript five-story building a few miles from the Kremlin. They also reveal the identity of the athlete to whom each lab analysis corresponded.

Outside of international competitions, nations are responsible for drug-testing their own athletes and for reporting the results of those tests to a global database. In Russia, however, the national antidoping laboratory alerted the nation’s sports ministry when athletes tested positive, and they often followed a deputy sports minister’s directive to falsely report positive drug tests as clean results to international authorities, according to both Mr. McLaren and the former longtime director of Russia’s lab, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov.

In an inquiry report published last December, Mr. McLaren said that he had uncovered records that more than 500 such incriminating tests were falsely recorded from 2011 to 2015.

“Well-known and elite level athletes had their initial results automatically falsified,” he wrote, noting that, without access to Russia’s lab data and forensic analysis of it, the extent of similar discrepancies and the full scope of cheating could not possibly be known.

But if the database now in the regulator’s possession reveals new inconsistencies in the testing histories of Russian athletes, sports officials could mount strong disciplinary cases.

Without a positive drug test, it can be challenging to build a case against an athlete that will withstand a legal challenge. To date, Olympics officials have issued sanctions against six Russian Olympians who competed in Sochi and exonerated another; investigations into scores of others are continuing.

Global officials from each sport have separately been asked to review allegations against hundreds of athletes. The antidoping regulator itself has agreed to close at least 95 such suspicious cases identified by Mr. McLaren based on a lack of evidence.

Olympic officials are currently deliberating how to punish Russia for its state-sponsored schemes, for which no Russian government official was allowed to attend the 2016 Rio Games. The International Olympic Committee is expected to announced its decision regarding Russia’s participation in the 2018 Winter Games in early December.

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

The city he chronicled between 1977 and 2001 explored neighborhoods that held steady when the city’s future looked grim. Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

No matter where you lived in New York, sooner or later all roads led to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue, the commercial and cultural heart of East Harlem.

Joseph Rodriguez was no exception: Though born and raised in Brooklyn — with detours at Rikers and a life-changing encounter with photography — he, as a teenager, liked to hang out at his uncle’s candy store and numbers spot where the streets were abuzz with music and life. Those early encounters led to a May 1990 National Geographic cover story and the most important project of his life after he spent the latter half of the 1980’s photographing El Barrio’s streets and residents in their homes and on the block.

Now, a revised version of that body of work will be on display at the Bronx Documentary Center, as well as in the new book, “Spanish Harlem: El Barrio in the ’80s.”

While it is “easy to make gritty pictures of poverty,” Mr. Rodriguez was looking to go deeper and connect with people whose struggles he knew intimately as the son of a single mother.

“I carried this story for a long time before I could go out and make the work,” he said. “That was an important path for me to understand patience and waiting, connecting and trust.”

His images reflect an intimacy — and long-term commitment — that marks his later work in East Los Angeles, Romania and Puerto Rico. For him, this project was deeply personal, and still is.

“We’re not garbage people, we have a presence,” he said. “One thing that was extremely important was to show our children with some dignity. You see their strength. We’ve gone through hell and back, just like now in Puerto Rico. But we get up, and we fight back.”

Hours later, on Saturday evening, a missile fired from Yemen came close to Riyadh before being shot down. Saudi Arabia later blamed Iran and Hezbollah for the missile, suggesting that they had aided the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen to fire it.

Before the world had a chance to absorb this news, the ambitious and aggressive Saudi Arabian crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the arrest of hundreds of Saudis, including members of the royal family, in what was either a crackdown on corruption, as Saudi officials put it, or a purge, as outside analysts have suggested.

It then emerged that the week before, Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, who has been sent on missions both to Israel and Saudi Arabia, had visited Riyadh on a previously undisclosed trip and met until the early morning hours with the crown prince. The White House has not announced what they discussed but officials privately said that they were meeting about the administration’s efforts to forge an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.

No one expects Saudi Arabia, which is mired in a military conflict in Yemen, to start another war itself. On Friday, Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said that Saudi Arabia had asked Israel to attack Lebanon, after essentially kidnapping Mr. Hariri.

“I’m not talking here about analysis, but information,” he said. “The Saudis asked Israel to attack Lebanon.”

He provided no evidence of his claim, but Western and regional analysts have also said that, given all the confusing and unexpected events and unpredictable players, they could not entirely rule out such a scenario.

Israeli officials, however, have been publicly predicting another war with Hezbollah, an increasingly well armed antagonist, while also vowing to do all they can to postpone it.

“There are now those in the region who would like Israel to go to war with Hezbollah and fight a Saudi war to the last Israeli,” said Ofer Zalzberg, a Jerusalem-based analyst for International Crisis Group. “There is no interest in that here.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long considered Iran to be Israel’s foremost enemy, a potential nuclear threat as well as a strategic adversary seeking to convert postwar Syria into a staging ground for attacks against Israel or into a corridor to transfer missiles and other weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon.

So Saudi Arabia’s stepped-up efforts to oppose Iranian influence in Lebanon drew measured applause in Jerusalem. But many Israelis fear that the aggressive actions by the Saudi crown prince could drag Israel into a war that it does not want.

Daniel Shapiro, a former United States ambassador to Israel, said that Israel and Saudi Arabia were pursuing similar goals at sharply different speeds and levels of proficiency.

“I’m not sure they’re aligned tactically,” he said in an interview. Prince Mohammed, he added, “seems very impatient to actually spark the confrontation.”

There are no signs of war preparations in Israel. The country is not mobilizing troops on its northern border or calling up reservists, and Mr. Netanyahu has given no indication that he sees a conflict as imminent.

Moreover, Israel’s war planners predict that the next war with Hezbollah may be catastrophic, particularly if it lasts more than a few days. Hezbollah now has more than 120,000 rockets and missiles, Israel estimates, enough to overwhelm Israeli missile defenses.

Many of them are long-range and accurate enough to bring down Tel Aviv high-rises, sink offshore gas platforms, knock out Ben-Gurion Airport or level landmark buildings across Israel.

Nor is Hezbollah necessarily hankering for battle with Israel, according to analysts who study the militant group closely. It is still fighting in Syria, where it has been backing the government of President Bashar al-Assad, and it is being drained by medical costs for wounded fighters and survivor benefits for the families of those killed, said Giora Eiland, a retired Israeli major general and former head of the country’s National Security Council.

“Hezbollah as an organization is in a very deep economic crisis today,” Mr. Eiland said. “But at the same time, the weaker they are, the more dependent they are on Iranian assistance — so they might have to comply with Iran’s instructions.”

But there have long been fears that now that the Syrian war — in which Hezbollah played a decisive role, gaining new influence, power and weapons — is almost over, Hezbollah’s enemies might seek to cut it down to size.

Mr. Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, implied Friday that its fight in Syria was nearly finished. If Saudi Arabia’s goal was to force Hezbollah to leave Syria, he said: “No problem. Our goal there has been achieved. It’s almost over anyway.”

World leaders have sought to tamp down tensions.

The American secretary of state Rex W. Tillerson warned Friday “against any party, within or outside Lebanon, using Lebanon as a venue for proxy conflicts or in any manner contributing to instability in that country,” a message apparently aimed at Hezbollah as well as Saudi Arabia.

President Emmanuel Macron of France left Saudi Arabia on Friday after a brief, last-minute meeting with the crown prince.

During the unexpected two-hour visit on Thursday, Mr. Macron “reiterated the importance France attaches to Lebanon’s stability, security, sovereignty and integrity,” his office said. He also discussed “the situation in Lebanon following the resignation of Prime Minister Hariri,” his office said, but provided no further details.

A group of countries and organizations interested in Lebanon’s stability met Friday with the Lebanese president, Michel Aoun, and issued a statement expressing “concern regarding the situation and prevailing uncertainty in Lebanon” and calling for Lebanon to be “shielded from tensions in the region.”

The members of the group, the International Support Group for Lebanon — including the United Nations, Britain, China, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States, as well as the European Union and the Arab League — are not all on the same side of the issues at stake so the statement seemed to reflect broad international concern.

At a news conference in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, before the meeting, Mr. Macron said he did not share Saudi Arabia’s “very harsh opinions” of Iran.



Analysts say a new war in the region is unlikely but some have warned that the increased tensions could provoke an economic crisis or even start a war accidentally. Miscalculations have started wars before, as in the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah.

Experts caution that Israel is often only a mistake or two from being drawn into combat.

“It’s a dangerous situation now,” said Amos Harel, the military reporter for Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper. “It only takes one provocation, another reaction, and it can get all of a sudden completely out of control. And when you add the Saudis, who evidently want to attack Iran and are looking for action, it gets even more complicated.”",Case of Missing Lebanese Prime Minister Stirs Middle East Tensions,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-lebanon-france-macron.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

His talk echoed his statements in China earlier this week that blamed weak American leadership for trade imbalances that he said had stripped jobs, factories and entire industries from the United States.

“What we will no longer do is enter into large agreements that tie our hands, surrender our sovereignty and make meaningful enforcement practically impossible,” Mr. Trump said.

He also spoke witheringly about an approach he said had led the United States to lower its own trade barriers, only to have other countries refuse to do so, and he accused the World Trade Organization of treating the United States unfairly.

Many of the president’s toughest lines — his vow to fight the “audacious theft” of intellectual property from American companies and the forced transfer of technology to foreign firms — were aimed at China.

But Mr. Trump avoided criticizing Mr. Xi personally. And he repeated his contention that he did not blame China, or any other country, for taking advantage of what he called weak American trade laws.

“If their representatives are able to get away with it, they are just doing their jobs,” the president said. “I wish previous administrations in my country saw what was happening and did something about it. They did not, but I will.”

White House officials had framed Mr. Trump’s speech as a chance to articulate the idea of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” region, which the Trump administration has adopted as its answer to former President Barack Obama’s pivot to Asia. First proposed by the Japanese, it envisions the United States strengthening ties with three other democracies in the region — Australia, India and Japan — in part to counter a rising China. But the president offered few details about that approach.

He spoke of the need for freedom of navigation — a reference to the South China Sea, which Vietnam, Malaysia and other countries complain Beijing is turning into a private waterway. But the president stopped short of calling out China by name.

He also did not fault China or his host, Vietnam, for their checkered human rights records, even as he offered a general endorsement of the rule of law and individual rights.

As in his speech to the United Nations in September, Mr. Trump emphasized the idea of sovereignty, a concept that is often seen as being at odds with global cooperation and that is sometimes used by countries to fend off interference by outside powers.

He closed the speech with an inward-looking paean to the virtues of home, declaring, “In all of the world, there is no place like home,” adding that nations should “protect your home, defend your home, and love your home today and for all time.”

Mr. Xi, in contrast, argued for pursuing the kinds of global initiatives that Mr. Trump had shunned. The Chinese leader touted the Paris climate accord, called globalization an “irreversible historical trend” and said China would continue to pursue a free trade area in the Asia-Pacific region.

American and Russian officials had been working to arrange a meeting between President Vladimir V. Putin and Mr. Trump on the sidelines of the meeting, in part to ask for Moscow’s assistance in countering the threat from North Korea. But as Mr. Trump arrived in Danang, the White House announced that he would not hold formal talks with Mr. Putin.

Officials cited scheduling issues as the reason the two leaders would not meet. But on Thursday, Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, had said that a conversation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin was “still under consideration,” and that a final decision would hinge on whether there was “sufficient substance” to warrant face-to-face talks.

Mr. Trump’s last encounter with Mr. Putin — on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany — posed political challenges for the White House, which faced questions about whether and how sharply Mr. Trump would rebuke his Russian counterpart for meddling in the 2016 elections.

Mr. Trump was later criticized for not having pressed Mr. Putin more strongly in an hourslong meeting on the election interference, and for revelations that the two had a second, undisclosed discussion at a leaders’ dinner that night. Diplomats described being stunned to see the two presidents chatting intimately with only a Kremlin interpreter present.

The optics of a meeting this week would have been particularly tricky, given new revelations about the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russians, brought to light by the investigations into Moscow’s efforts to sway the American election in Mr. Trump’s favor.

The two presidents did end up shaking hands and exchanging greetings before posing for a photograph at the APEC gala dinner Friday evening.

Still, the change in plans appeared to have left the Kremlin exasperated. Asked about the absence of a meeting, Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, told a Russian TV reporter: “Ask the Americans. We are not speaking on this matter at all.”

Mr. Lavrov noted that Mr. Trump himself had said last week that he would most likely meet with Mr. Putin during his trip to Asia.

“It just means we can’t be exploited,” he added.

The acting chief of Uber’s British operations, Tom Elvidge, said the company would appeal the decision, either to the Court of Appeal or to Britain’s Supreme Court.

The employment case here is one of several challenges that Uber faces. Although the company has expanded at a breakneck pace and grown into a behemoth valued at $70 billion, it has had to grapple with allegations that it does not do enough to vet its drivers, revelations that it used software to evade the gaze of the authorities and other issues.

Complaints about an aggressive workplace culture forced Travis Kalanick, a founder of the company, to resign as chief executive this year. He was succeeded by the former chief executive of Expedia, Dara Khosrowshahi, who has displayed a more conciliatory style.

As part of his softer approach, Mr. Khosrowshahi went on a charm offensive last month in an effort to win over the London transport authorities. Uber is appealing the London ban, which declared the company not “fit and proper” to operate in the city. Uber was allowed to continue operating in the city until a final ruling was made in the case.

Mr. Khosrowshahi’s shift in tone comes at a crucial time. Uber is aiming for an initial public offering in 2019, and working on securing a multibillion-dollar investment from the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.

As part of its push to win over customers and drivers concerned about Uber’s reputation, the company has introduced new measures and services, including allowing users to add tips to fares. Uber has also promoted its efforts, particularly in Britain, to provide drivers with benefits like access to insurance and pensions.

“Essentially, it has been outrunning employment law and legislators,” said André Spicer, a professor at City University’s Cass Business School in London. “It’s having to become more like a normal company, rather than one that was able to evade existing legal frameworks.”

Uber’s operations in London are crucial to its global expansion. The company started operating in the city in 2012, and now offers its services in dozens of cities nationwide. About 40,000 people drive for Uber in the British capital, and the company says that three million customers have used the app in London at least once in the past three months.

Uber’s arrival in London has, however, set off a clash with the city’s famous black cabs. Drivers in the centuries-old taxi system must pass an exacting test known as the Knowledge, which requires the memorization of around 25,000 streets and 100,000 landmarks. A ride in a black cab is typically far more expensive than using Uber, which cabbies complain is too lightly regulated.

Opponents of Uber argue that it is able to undercut rivals on price largely because of its employment practices, which mean it can avoid paying some of the costs and contributions required by permanent employees. But the company’s business model is facing challenges across Europe. The region’s highest court is expected to rule by year’s end in a case involving whether Uber should be regulated as a taxi service, which would make it subject to rigorous safety and employment rules, or as a digital platform that simply connects independent drivers and passengers.

Labor experts say that laws in most countries have failed to keep pace with advances in technology and the rise of the gig economy. In Britain, for example, the main piece of legislation that regulates how workers are treated was passed in 1996.

“The legislation is old,” said Susannah Kintish, a partner at the law firm Mishcon de Reya who specializes in employment law. “It came out when the Spice Girls had their first hit.

What the Senate proposed:The Senate proposes an identical formula as it relates to years in residence and frequency of use.
What the Senate proposed:The Senate did not propose any changes.

What’s in place now:

If you’re single, the current standard deduction is $6,350. Add in exemptions and you’re up to $10,400.

Married without children? That’s $12,700 for the deduction and $20,700 with exemptions.

If you’re married with two kids, the deduction-plus-exemptions figure goes up to $28,700. There is also a $1,000 tax credit per child.

What the House proposed:

The House bill calls for simplification: If you’re single with no children, your standard deduction would be $12,000. If you’re married, it would be $24,000 no matter how many kids you have. The child tax credit, however, would rise to $1,600 per child. There is also an additional $300 credit for each parent and nonchild dependent, though that would expire after 2022.

What the Senate proposed:

The same $12,000/$24,000 standard deductions as the House. Single parents would see their deductions go to $18,000 from $9,300. The child tax credit would rise to $1,650.

State and Local Tax Deductions, and Mortgage Interest

What’s in place now:

You can generally deduct the amount you pay for state and local tax income taxes, including property taxes, on your federal income tax return. You can also deduct the interest you pay each year on mortgage debt up to $1 million, a cap that can cover multiple homes. Plus, you can generally deduct up to $100,000 in interest you pay on a home-equity loan or line of credit.

What the House proposed:

No more state and local tax deductions, though you could continue to deduct up to $10,000 each year in property tax. For people buying in the future (which the bill defines as Nov. 2, 2017, or later), mortgage interest deductions would be allowed only on loans up to $500,000. Moreover, only debt from primary residences would count toward that limit, and you could not include any interest from home equity loans or lines of credit that you took out on that new home.

What the Senate proposed:

No more state and local tax deductions and no exception for property taxes, either. The mortgage interest deduction, however, would survive in its current form.

Medical Expenses

What’s in place now:

For the moment, you can deduct out-of-pocket medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of your adjusted gross income (but not the expenses that amount to the first 10 percent). This is particularly useful for elderly people and others with lower incomes who need regular assistance and care.

What the House proposed:

The House wants to do away with the deduction in 2018.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate would keep the deduction.

Student Loan Interest

What’s in place now:

Currently, people with incomes below certain thresholds can deduct up to $2,500 of student loan interest each year.

What the House proposed:

The House wants to do away with the student loan interest deduction.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate would keep things as they are now.

Estate Taxes

What’s in place now:

In general, you pay taxes on inherited property at a 40 percent rate, but current rules waive that tax for estates up to $5,490,000.

What the House proposed:

The House seeks to nearly double that exemption and repeal it altogether after 2024 — a year later than the House first proposed.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate wishes to double the exemption but has not proposed any full repeal.

Pass-Through Businesses

What’s in place now:

People who own small businesses of various sorts generally pay income taxes based on the normal rate for individual taxes. Often, they are involved in or run partnerships, sole proprietorships, limited liability companies and S corporations.

What the House proposed:

The House bill would create a new 25 percent tax rate for what it refers to as “pass-through” businesses, for a portion of the business net income that passes through to the owners. The proposed rules around this are complicated; see Section 1004 of the House bill summary for more information.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate’s offering would not leave quite as much money in taxpayers’ pockets as the House bill would, as it gives taxpayers the opportunity to deduct 17.4 percent of domestic qualified business income from a partnership, S corporation or sole proprietorship. See page 17 of the Senate bill summary for more detail.

Adoption Credits

What’s in place now:

In 2017, when an employer pays for up to $13,570 in qualified adoption expenses for an employee, the employee pays no taxes on that assistance. There’s also a separate adoption credit, which generally provides taxpayers with a credit of up to $13,570 per eligible child. Under the current rules, the credit phases out for taxpayers with adjusted gross income between $203,540 and $243,540.

What the House proposed:

The bill had proposed getting rid of the adoption credit altogether, but on Thursday afternoon, the Republican leadership changed its mind and left it intact.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate would also leave it intact.

Selling Your Home

What’s in place now:

Currently, a married couple filing their taxes jointly can exclude up to $500,000 in capital gains on the sale of a home, as long as they’ve used it as a primary residence for two of the past five years.

What the House proposed:

Taxpayers would need to have lived in the home for five out of the previous eight years — and the tax break could be used only once every five years, down from once every two years. The tax break would begin to phase out for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income exceeded $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers).

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate proposes an identical formula as it relates to years in residence and frequency of use. But it allows people who fail to meet the five-year requirement because of a change in employment, health trouble or “unforeseen circumstances” to exclude a fraction of the $250,000 or $500,000 equal to the fraction of the five-year period that they were in residence.

Coverdells and 529 Plans

What’s in place now:

Your money grows tax-free (you can put in $2,000 per year with certain income limits), and then you can withdraw it tax-free to pay for private school from kindergarten through 12th grade (in addition to college). Potential changes to this maneuver were last considered in 2012.

What the House proposed:

The House wants to neuter Coverdells but let people pull up to $10,000 out of 529 plans tax-free to use for private school. (You could still use that same 529 plan to save for college the same way you always have.) Wealthy families can gain a potential tax break of up to $30,000 or so.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate did not propose any changes.

Losses for Fires and Floods

What’s in place now:

If you’re a victim of a house fire, flood, burglary or similar event, you can deduct those losses.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

What the House proposed:

The House did away with these so-called “casualty” deductions. That means you would be out of luck, unless legislators passed a one-time bill offering relief for victims of particular weather or other events that affected a lot of people.

What the Senate proposed:

Starting in 2018, you could only claim a deduction if the loss happened during an event that the president later officially declared to be a disaster.

Alimony

What’s in place now:

Alimony is a deductible expense for people paying it, and those who receive it must pay income taxes.

What the House proposed:

Divorce would become a bit more burdensome for the ex-spouse who pays alimony because it would no longer be a deductible expense. But the party receiving the payments would no longer need to pay tax on the income received. The change would take effect for divorce and separation agreements (and any changes to current agreements) executed after 2017.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate bill would make no changes to alimony rules.

Moving Expenses

What’s in place now:

As it stands, taxpayers can deduct moving expenses — even if they do not itemize their tax returns — as long as the new workplace is at least 50 miles farther from the old home than the old job location was from the old home. (If you had no workplace, the new job must be at least 50 miles from your old home.)

What the House proposed:

Relocating for a new job? Moving costs would no longer be a deductible expense in 2018.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate’s bill is similar to the House’s, though it allows some exceptions for members of the military.

Tax Preparation

What’s in place now:

You can usually deduct the amount your tax preparation specialist billed you or any similar tax-related expenses, like software you purchase and the fee you pay to file your forms electronically.

What the House proposed:

Taxpayers would no longer be able to take this deduction. Since the bill aims to reduce the number of taxpayers who itemize (and all the complexity that goes with that), in theory fewer people should require professional tax help (with the exception of wealthier people, who can afford to lose this break).

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate’s proposal is similar to that of the House.

Electric Cars

What’s in place now:

Buyers of qualifying plug-in electric vehicles, like the Chevrolet Bolt or Volt and Tesla’s cars, can sometimes get a tax credit for up to $7,500.

What the House proposed:

The House would do away with the credit.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate proposed no change.

Riding a Bicycle to Work

What’s in place now:

You can exclude up to $20 each month from your income for expenses related to regular bicycle commuting, as long as you are not receiving other pretax commuting benefits from your employer.

What the House proposed:

The House bill did not propose any changes.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate would take away this tax break.

Reduced and Waived Tuition

What’s in place now:

Employees of educational institutions who receive reduced tuition — or a waiver — for themselves, spouses or dependents are generally not taxed on that income. This is particularly helpful for certain graduate students; their tuition is waived as part of arrangements in which they teach or perform research at their university.

What the House proposed:

The House bill would treat reduced or waived tuition as income.

What the Senate proposed:

The Senate would keep things as they are now.

Employer-Paid Tuition

At the moment, when employers pay your tuition for continuing education, the amount they pay is not taxable income for you as long as it meets certain conditions and amounts to no more than $5,250 per year.

What the House proposed:

The House would make these tuition payments count as taxable income starting in 2018.

The Senate would keep things as they are now.",How Could a Tax Change Affect You? This Is What the Senate and House Propose,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/your-money/how-could-a-tax-change-affect-you.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Then in 1996, an art historian identified it as a Michelangelo. The call was hotly debated, but the attribution has stood. And the “circa 1496-97” date now attached to the work makes it altogether possible that Michelangelo carved the figure at age 21, making him the prodigy he claimed to be.

With this sculpture, he had found what would be his favorite subject, and the one that would make his name: the heroic male body. Approximately a decade after the “Young Archer” came the colossal “David,” and with that Michelangelo was a star, a Medici darling, and on his way to becoming the new kind of public celebrity he aimed to be: not just a highly skilled maker of things, but a multitasking, miracle-working aristocrat of creativity called a genius. If Michelangelo didn’t coin the term, he (with a reluctant nod to Leonardo da Vinci) coined the type.

Prestigious commissions, in painting, sculpture and architecture, piled up. In 1504, he was asked to do a fresco for the Council Chamber of the Palazzo della Signoria, the seat of the Florentine government. Leonardo, more than 30 years his senior, and no friend, was assigned the opposite wall. The idea was that they both would paint a historic battle, Michelangelo’s being one in which a troop of 14th-century Florentine soldiers interrupted a swim in the Arno to take an enemy by surprise.

Photo

He turned the scene into a polyphonic chorale of pumped bodies: abs, pecs, lats, glutes, buns. We know the image well, though the fresco — thanks to the first of what would be endless Medici interventions — never got beyond the full-scale cartoon stage. Ink and chalk sketches on paper of the individual figures exist. So does a drawing of the whole composition, now so smudged it looks like a puff of smoke. The most vivid piece of evidence is a large 1540 oil painting here by Bastiano da Sangallo, who saw the finished cartoon before it was whitewashed out.

All of this material, now scattered among museums — the Louvre, the Uffizi, the Albertina in Vienna — has been brought together at the Met. This is how the exhibition, organized by Carmen C. Bambach, a curator in the museum’s department of drawings and prints, works. It ingeniously reconstructs Michelangelo projects by assembling related designs in dense, connect-the-dots clusters.

This is, of course, the only way to present architecturally scaled art, or long-vanished things. The show is as close as we can now get to seeing the massive sculptural tomb of Pope Julius II in its many aborted iterations; it was this “urgent” commission (years before Julius’s death) that pulled Michelangelo off the battle fresco. And a selection of plans — scribbled on paper scraps, spread across pasted-together sheets — for the facade of the Medici parish church of San Lorenzo adds up to a beguiling archive of thinking-in-progress. Rarely has architectural design felt more expressively personal, moody, painterly, calligraphic.

Part of Ms. Bambach’s goal, and one that she pursues in her labor-of-love catalog, is to revisit the original Renaissance concept of design — disegno — as a theoretical category, an aesthetic and ethical end in itself. A basic idea was that just as the physical world represented, in every shade and contour, divine labor so, on a human level, did (or could) art. Michelangelo benefited mightily from this elevation of the artist from workshop drone to deity (and brand). In his later megastar years, people actually referred to him as God. The Sistine Chapel ceiling is a work of disegno in excelsis: the story of the Creation told through superhuman craft.

Video

The exhibition’s long central gallery is given over to the ceiling, a project so complex that Michelangelo gave up organizing a production team and did most of the job himself. You can see him plugging away at it, on scaffolding just under the ceiling, in a self-caricature drawn in the margin of a handwritten sonnet. “I’ve already grown a goiter at this drudgery,” he grouses. “My brush, above me all the time, drips paint, turning my face into a perfect drop cloth.”

In the Sistine paintings — the male body — and nearly all the bodies are male — are muscle on top of muscle, Arnold Schwarzenegger circa 1975. The Classical ideal — balance, just-rightness — has been pumped out of existence. Mannerist too-muchness — the 21st century knows a lot about this — rules. Neither the ceiling, nor the later, nightmarish “Last Judgment,” is art you’re invited to love. It aims to overpower you, make you feel small, crushed by cosmic history. Some viewers find the experience a thrill. I’ve always found it off-putting.

It’s in drawings that I start to feel close to this art and its maker. One chalk-sketched titan has an oddly lumpy, imperfect, maybe-not-young body; and he’s sleeping. Clearly, he’s a studio assistant who’s been roped into posing at the end of a day. And while the mood of the “Last Judgment” fresco is full-orchestra cataclysmic, ink sketches for it can be light, almost tender. In one, the resurrected dead float in space, speck-like and weightless, like birds lifting off from a foggy lake.

And then there are drawings generated by tenderness itself. This is true of a gallery devoted to fanciful “divine heads,” including one of a doleful Cleopatra, that the middle-aged artist made as gifts for young male aristocrats — Gherardo Perini, Andrea Quaratesi, Tommaso de’ Cavalieri — on whom he had developed crushes. His black chalk portrait of Quaratesi, who was 37 years his junior, as a somber dreamboat with plush lips and faraway eyes is here and it’s an eye-stopper. So are several discretely erotic mythological drawings he gave as Valentines to Cavalieri who, whatever the sexual nature of their bond, became a lifelong friend.

All warmed up? Good, let’s see if we can achieve a personal best today.

Today we follow the path the marathoners will run on Sunday, by BOROUGH, and we are starting at the bottom of the grid. For example, the race begins on Staten Island, but that borough is no where to be seen, unless you jump down to 67A’s “Step 1: A passenger ship since 1817” and fill in FERRY. I got that through the crossings, because I wasn’t think about a small FERRY being a ship. However, we’re specifically thinking about the STATEN ISLAND FERRY from that clue, and the borough is implied.

We then lope — sorry, I mean run — into BROOKLYN, with 51A’s “Step 2: An old baseball team,” which is, of course the (BROOKLYN) DODGERS.

27A: Ha! You thought that was a political clue, didn’t you? “Trump is often involved in these” is a bridge clue today. The answer is BID.

15D: I honestly thought that “Faces With Tears of Joy” was some piece of artwork that I hadn’t learned about, but it turns out that today’s answer is the laugh-til-you-cry EMOJI.

49A: The city of Zagazig is not only in EGYPT, it’s extremely fun to say out loud.

Peter Sagal: In 2016, my friend Greg Pliska asked me to come do the “play-by-play” at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament finals in Stamford, CT. I went and had a great time, including running into some old friends in the puzzle community. That inspired me to start solving the puzzle myself, and I’ve been doing it daily since around that time. In fact, it’s become a daily ritual in the “Wait, Wait ...” offices: we solve the puzzle together after our daily editorial meeting.

So, when Mike Selinker got in touch to ask me if I’d collaborate with him as a “celebrity,” I was thrilled. I had actually begun poking around with practice grids myself, thinking how gratifying it would be to make a puzzle for The Times, and was envious of the other folk who had gotten to work on one for the anniversary project. Mike and I met on a cruise a few years ago, and he helped me create a trivia game for the entertainers.

My first idea for the puzzle was shot down and I was a bit at sea as to what to do. I wanted to do something that related to my career, as many guest constructors had done, but didn’t know how to work the idea of a “quiz show host” into the puzzle. Maybe the clues were riddles with the solution being the answer? That didn’t work. Mike pointed out that I also am known for running marathons (13 so far, and I write a bi-monthly column for Runners World) and maybe that was a theme ... so I suggested in turn a “map” of the New York Marathon, which at that time was a few months off.

Mike responded amazingly. He constructed a grid in which a series of answers suggesting the five boroughs of the race, as a map, with the themed clues indicating their order in the race (Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, and Manhattan again.) The clues are all phrases that suggest the name of the boroughs without naming them. He also managed to get in the phrase NEW YORK MARATHON and even BOROUGH.

I love the puzzle because it combines two things I enjoy when they happen to appear in the puzzle: first, the unwritten answer (i.e., you have to mentally provide the word BRONX to complete the answer CHEER) and the physical form of the puzzle; that is, it’s relevant where the answers appear in the grid.

As said, the grid was entirely Mike’s work. I contributed to the cluing as best I could, which was both difficult and a delight. As Mike pointed out to me, some words, like AGA, have appeared in the puzzle many times, and its a challenge to come up with new ways of cluing them. Of my clues that made it through the editing process, I’m most happy about 36 Across and 29 Down.

This really was great fun. It makes me want to try to construct one on my own, although it’ll be a huge leap from simply kibbitzing to doing it all myself. At any rate, I hope solving it gives puzzlers the same sense of pleased satisfaction I’ve gotten from doing the puzzle the last year.

One last important note: I couldn’t very well co-author a puzzle about the New York Marathon without running it, so I signed up with Achilles International to be a guide for a blind runner, as I’ve done three times before. I’ll be helping to guide an accomplished para-athlete named Asim Baig, and we’re raising money for Achilles and Mr. Baig.

Mike Selinker: A couple years ago on the JoCo Cruise, I helped Peter Sagal out with the clues for a game show — I know, right? — and so it seemed about time for him to return the favor. Peter was a more-than-willing collaborator, and we fleshed out a lot of ideas that didn’t really go anywhere. Eventually I posed to Peter, who runs a lot of marathons, the obvious question “What about a marathon puzzle?” Peter wanted to run the New York Marathon this week, and so he came up with this insane and stellar idea of drawing a map of the entire marathon route. To which I said, “Uh, yeah, I think I can do that,” and came up with this.

Actually, the first grid also had a 26-letter message — RUN AND RUN TILL THE RACE IS DONE — running from the second R in FERRY to the N and E at the start of NEW YORK MARATHON, with the black squares being the bridges between the boroughs. Which was great except Will went, “Okay, but why?” And he was — stop me if this sounds familiar — completely correct. I ripped that out and made a much better grid with Will and Peter’s guidance.

Once that was done, Peter clued the first pass all by himself, and he’s the best crossword cluer ever. That brain is crammed with so much trivia, he’s probably had to delete the node that tells him how to use a fork. I had no freaking idea about half the stuff he crammed into there. For me though, the best clues of his are the ones that just roll off as effortless comments, like the ones for MOO, IMHO, and ROCK ON. It was a great three-way collaboration with me, Peter, and Will. I hope we get to do it again soon. Now Peter just has to teach me how to be a radio god and we’re even.

What did they think of Mr. Trump, he asked?","Even within Fox News, which fills Mr. Trump’s DVR with hours of daily pep talks, he chooses cozier digs. He dropped by the first week of Fox’s “The Ingraham Angle,” with Laura Ingraham, who spoke at his nominating convention. But he’s been scarce on the more straight-news-oriented shows of Bret Baier and Chris Wallace.

The last time Mr. Trump sat for a TV interview outside his comfort zone was in May, with NBC’s Lester Holt. That was when he volunteered his mind-set in deciding to fire the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who was then leading the probe into Russian election interference. The president said to himself, he recounted, “‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia was a made-up story.’”

There is no such danger in Mr. Trump’s safe space. But it also means he’s not reaching anyone beyond his base — a strategy that, the Republican drubbing in the off-year elections suggests, has its limits.

For his die-hard fans, Mr. Trump sticks to his greatest hits: the media is “fake” (“one of the greatest terms of all I’ve come up with,” he told Mr. Huckabee); we’re going to build the wall; they said we couldn’t get to 270 electoral votes, but we got 306. (Ultimately 304.) He’s speaking to an audience that isn’t watching to see news made or questions answered but to hear, again: We won.

Indeed, Mr. Trump’s interviews with his boosters hardly make news except by accident, as when he defended a lag in diplomatic hiring to Ms. Ingraham by saying, “I’m the only one that matters.”

To understand Mr. Trump as a president, you have to remember that he was a celebrity first, and he still uses the media like a celebrity does. His first remark to Ms. Ingraham about the Republican tax bill was “We’ve gotten really great reviews,” as if he were plugging a new movie on “The Tonight Show.” He repeatedly gave Mr. Hannity his highest honor: praising his Nielsen ratings.

In Mr. Trump’s first celebrity phase, as a brass-plated capitalist cartoon in the ’80s and ’90s, he was a media gadfly. He chased the cameras, planted his name in the tabloids and exchanged locker-room talk with Howard Stern. The point, then, was to be outrageous, to stir the pot. There was no such thing as bad attention.

This was the approach that the candidate Trump used, keeping CNN and “Morning Joe” on speed dial, taking advantage of billions of dollars of free media to ensure that he was the protagonist of the election. For a while, in 2015 and 2016, he was freely available on TV, proving that he could shoot off his mouth in a Fifth Avenue studio and still not lose his voters.

Mr. Trump’s second celebrity era was as the host, star and grand prize of “The Apprentice.” There, editors imposed a linear arc on his vagabond sentences, gave coherence to his impulsive decisions. “The Apprentice” had a vested interest in plumping him up — to be the best show, it needed to make him into the best businessman. It styled him to appear successful, decisive, wise, desired and obeyed.

Now, as president, Mr. Trump has delegated the job of reality producer to friendly media outlets. Where other interviewers would challenge or press for details, his chosen hosts do the clarifying for him and offer him talking points couched as questions. “Are you getting the credit for this economic revival?” Ms. Ingraham asked.

Above all, they offer affirmation, and Mr. Trump basks in it like the first warming light of creation. At the Pennsylvania interview on Oct. 11, Mr. Hannity engaged the home-team crowd as if hosting a live “Apprentice” finale. What did they think of Mr. Trump, he asked? (Yay!) What about Congress? (Boo!) And what about the media? (Booooo!)

It’s that cheering crowd, one suspects, that is really driving the dynamic here. The point of all the delicate meringue questions is not simply to avoid challenging the president. It’s to avoid challenging the audience.

These interviews are a reciprocal exchange for a closed circle. The base gets to cheer its leader and boo the haters. The interviewers get to prove their loyalty, presenting themselves as official Trump-endorsed products.

And the president gets to end the exchange nodding and smiling, like someone who knows he has gotten the better part of the deal.",President Trump Finds His TV Niche in Softball Interviews,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/arts/television/president-trump-finds-his-tv-niche-in-softball-interviews.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Many have argued that President Trump’s biggest success has been Justice Neil Gorsuch’s ascension to the Supreme Court. While it was a major victory, Mr. Trump’s troubling nominations to the lower courts may be his most lasting legacy.

Every president selects judges whose legal, social and political views generally reflect his own. Conservatives complained about President Barack Obama’s choices, as did liberals about President George W. Bush’s, but most of them were accepted across the aisle as credible and qualified. Some of President Trump’s nominees, however, are so far outside the mainstream that even conservative Republicans like Senators John Kennedy of Louisiana and John Cornyn of Texas have expressed dismay.

There are 145 vacancies in the federal judiciary, with 18 of those on the Courts of Appeals, and more will surely arise. The Republican-controlled Senate has swiftly confirmed 12 nominees so far. And thanks to life tenure, most of them will serve for decades.

Consider some of the least qualified and most bizarre of his selections.

Leonard Steven Grasz, a nominee for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based in St. Louis, received a rare “not qualified” rating from the American Bar Association because his “temperament issues, particularly bias and lack of open-mindedness, were problematic.” He serves on the board of an organization that has supported the closing of clinics offering women reproductive care, has condemned Supreme Court decisions that protect women’s rights, and has asserted that abortions put women’s lives at risk.

Thomas A. Farr has been nominated to serve on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. President Bush recommended him for the same seat in 2006, but the Senate Judiciary Committee did not even advance his nomination to the full Senate, probably because of his longstanding ties to racist politicians, and because of his opposition to voting rights, workers’ rights and economic equality. Nothing has changed since then.

Those two foods have snaked their way into the Australian restaurant zeitgeist like no other in recent years, as edible Americana has become ubiquitous here. But these two giants of Southern cookery are also culinary emissaries of Korean culture. And as ambassadors go, you can’t get much more charming and irresistible than sizzling meats and crispy chicken served with plenty of beer.

There is so much more to Korean food, however, than these greasy darlings, and there are very few places in Melbourne to explore that vast deliciousness.

It was no easy feat: Joomak, opened in 2010, is in the basement of a personality-less Swanston Street office building in Melbourne’s Central Business District, with no street signage indicating that you are in the right location. You enter the building feeling wholly unsure of yourself before descending a flight of stairs that lead to a heavy wooden door. Though the name of the restaurant is above the staircase, and a note on the basement door explains that the business is cash-only, it is not until you step into the room that you are entirely sure you have found the place. It does not help that both map apps on my phone put Joomak down a nearby alley, where I encountered other bewildered would-be customers searching for an entrance between Dumpsters.

The upper Colville River and headwaters on Alaska's North Slope | Joel Sartore

Several years ago a mapping expert pinpointed the most remote place in the Lower 48 states. The spot was in the southeast corner of Yellowstone National Park, 20 miles from the nearest road. Roman Dial read the news and wasn’t much impressed. To him, 20 miles — the distance a hungry man could walk in a long day — didn’t seem very remote at all.

Mr. Dial is a professor of biology and mathematics at Alaska Pacific University in Anchorage, and a National Geographic explorer. He decided to figure out the most remote place in the entire nation. His calculations led him to the northwest corner of Alaska, where the continent tilts toward the Arctic Ocean. The spot lay on the Ipnavik River on the North Slope, 119 miles west of the Haul Road (otherwise known as the Dalton Highway), which brings supplies and roughnecks to the oil fields at Prudhoe Bay.

Judged by miles, Mr. Dial reckoned, the place was six times more isolated than that corner in Yellowstone. So he decided to walk there. On the journey he and his companion didn’t see anyone else for 24 days.

Their destination lay within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. NPR-A, as it is known, is the single largest parcel of public land in the United States. The reserve sprawls across nearly 23 million acres, which makes it larger than Maine or South Carolina or 10 other states. The reserve’s eastern border sits about 100 miles to the west of the more famous Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Separating the two like a thorn between roses lies the industrial sprawl of Prudhoe Bay.

If the reserve still doesn’t ring a bell, you’re not alone. Even Google Earth doesn’t know it, though the reserve is 10 times the size of Yellowstone. “It is the wildest place in America that you’ve never heard of,” as one conservationist recently told me.

Yet the reserve deserves attention, now more than ever. The Trump administration has declared the nation’s public lands and waters open for business, particularly to oil and gas companies. In its first six months the administration offered more onshore leases to energy companies to drill on public property than the Obama administration did in all of 2016, the secretary of interior, Ryan Zinke, boasted to the conservative Heritage Foundation in late September.

“Our goal is an America that is the strongest energy superpower that this world has ever known,” he told the group, and added, “the road to energy dominance goes through the great state of Alaska.”

Nowhere is this more evident than on the North Slope. In April, Mr. Trump signed an executive order aimed at lifting President Barack Obama’s closure of federal Arctic waters to drilling, a decision now being challenged in court. Both the administration and the Republican-held Congress are trying yet again to open the Arctic refuge for oil exploration, an effort that provoked a fierce battle a dozen years ago.

In May during a visit to Alaska, Mr. Zinke signed an order to “jump-start” energy production in the petroleum reserve, ordering officials to review the reserve’s management plan with an eye toward potentially revising it to maximize output. He ordered new estimates of how much oil and gas lay under the ground of both NPR-A and part of the Arctic refuge. Mr. Zinke stood beside the famed Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which now pumps about one-quarter of the oil it did in its heyday in the late 1980s, a reflection of years of declining output. He placed his hand to the pipeline as some place their hands to their hearts, and he pledged to help fill it.

In late October, he started to make good on his pledge, announcing that the largest offering of public lands for lease in the history of the Bureau of Land Management — 10.3 million acres — will be up for bid on Dec. 6.

All of this comes as several recent finds on state and federal lands and in the waters of the far north, including potentially the largest oil discoveries in the state in at least two decades, have spurred a surge of interest there. Alaskan Republicans are cheering these efforts, desperate for rescue from a recession caused by the cratering of oil prices. The pressure to drill the top of the world is high.

Though he is chief steward of our public heritage, Mr. Zinke has proved himself more wedded to “drill, baby, drill” than to educating himself about the public lands he oversees. He seems willfully ignorant of the reality that the National Petroleum Reserve is more than an untapped oil drum waiting for a straw. The western Arctic contains a world, wild and rich and like no place else. It must not be sacrificed.

President Warren Harding created the reserve for the United States Navy in 1923, years after Alaskan Natives first showed oil seeps to Yankee whalers. Over the decades the military and a few companies pricked the ground with exploratory wells. Nothing came of it commercially. As a result the place largely remains much as it was — nearly roadless and all but unpeopled except for the Inupiaq, whose ancestors roamed the region starting at least 13,000 years ago.

To the south, the towering Brooks Range softens to a vast, rolling plain of tundra flecked with wildflower and cotton grass called the Utukok River Uplands.

To the west, near the Bering Strait, lies Kasegaluk Lagoon, a coastal lagoon protected by barrier islands.

In the far north, hard by the Arctic Ocean, the land grows as flat and as soggy as a sponge.

Defining the southeast border is the Colville River.

In the far northeast is the shallow Teshekpuk Lake, larger in area than Lake Tahoe.

Each region supports a distinct ecosystem. The Utukok River Uplands are about four times bigger than the largest grassland in the continental United States, according to Debbie S. Miller, who spent four summers in the reserve for her book “On Arctic Ground.” She calls it our Serengeti, pulsing with the migration of the 200,000-strong western Arctic caribou herd, and the bears and wolves that follow them.

Peregrine falcons, gyrfalcons, golden eagles and rough-legged hawks perch like hood ornaments on the bluffs of the Colville River, which scientists say is one of the most important raptor nesting areas in the world.

As co-owner of the guiding outfit Arctic Wild, Michael Wald has paddled the Colville and many other rivers in NPR-A. He adores the reserve. “It’s the last place you can go and hide from the 21st century,” Mr. Wald said.

The Kasegaluk Lagoon is home to thousands of beluga whales, spotted seals and polar bears. Walruses gather in huge rookeries on Kasegaluk’s beaches as ice floes, their preferred resting and feeding places, melt away, making these shores a key substitute as climate change upends their world.

In the far north lies one of the largest complex of wetlands in all of the Arctic — an expanse of ponds, streams and marshes larger than Delaware. The centerpiece is the shallow Teshekpuk Lake, larger in area than Lake Tahoe.

Teshekpuk and the area surrounding it is vital to a rich array of birds that journey there from around the world — from ducks and geese to shorebirds, gulls and jaegers, according to a 2013 study in the journal Conservation Biology. Every spring at least 29 species of shorebirds — perhaps six million of them — land there from other continents to breed, nest and raise their young. It’s an international nursery, at the edge of the continent.

Teshekpuk also nourishes the winged flashes of color that brighten our daily lives in the Lower 48: The swan seen on a Maryland lake. The duck pursued by a hunter in Texas. The Lapland longspur that spends the harsh winter picking through the cutover wheat fields of Kansas. Birds from all four major American flyways converge here, and the central Pacific and East Asian-Australasian flyways, too.

While the Arctic refuge is deservedly famous, researchers in that 2013 study found that when it came to all the species of aquatic birds they were looking for, they found more of them, packed more densely, along the coast of the petroleum reserve, the place that almost no one knows.

In 2013, President Obama’s secretary of the interior, Ken Salazar, signed off on a sweeping management plan that earmarked 11.8 million acres, 52 percent of the petroleum reserve, for potential oil and gas development. That land was thought to hold 72 percent of the recoverable oil, according to estimates at the time.

The plan also set aside five “special areas” for wildlife and other values in the rest of the reserve, in areas that included the Utukok River Uplands, the Colville River and Teshekpuk Lake. Not every acre of these special areas is off limits to oil and gas leasing nor immune to the construction of the pipelines, gravel roads and ice roads in winter needed for resource extraction.

Even so, this hard-fought compromise won wide support from sportsmen, Native villages and major environmental groups. It had taken three years to hammer out. Amazingly, no one sued over the final result. “It did a good job of zoning this big place,” said Melanie Smith, director of conservation science for Audubon Alaska.

More than 40 years ago, Congress had recognized that the reserve had more of value than simply oil. The 1976 Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act gave the Department of the Interior a novel mandate to explore the energy resources “in a manner which will assure the maximum protection” of “surface values” such as wildlife, subsistence hunting and recreation. Congress even mentions Utukok and Teshekpuk.

The 2013 plan strikes the balance that Congress wanted. While the plan isn’t perfect, it mostly works. Wildlife gets protection, while oil companies get annual lease sales in the reserve (1.8 million acres during the Obama administration, the B.L.M. says, hardly an Obama administration lockup of public lands that Mr. Zinke has suggested). In late 2015, ConocoPhillips drew the first commercial oil from Native land within the reserve. The company is already at work on several other projects there.

Now, however, this hard-won compromise is in jeopardy. With big oil finds happening just outside the reserve, and tantalizing new ones within it, state officials want the reserve open wider.

First, Mr. Zinke announced on Oct. 25 that every available tract under the 2013 plan would be up for lease, at once. “This is unprecedented,” both in scale and approach, said Nicole Whittington-Evans, the Alaska regional director for the Wilderness Society.

“In the past, the B.L.M. has offered leases based on industry interest,” she said. “This is not based on industry interest, it’s based on a wholesale approach to selling off whatever they can in the NPR-A.”

The next step, many now fear, will be to scrap the 2013 plan entirely. “We’re viewing this as Step 1,” she said of the lease sale.

Indeed, in August, the B.L.M. invited oil companies and the public to nominate parcels they would like to see put up for bid in a future sale. Included on the map were parcels throughout the “special areas” that are now off limits to drilling. Stacie McIntosh, the B.L.M.’s Arctic district manager, said the announcement was intended to gauge future interest, and that there could be no lease sales there until after thorough environmental review.

But the writing is on the wall.

One area now off limits but posted in August for lease is a piece of soggy ground north and east of Teshekpuk Lake. Government geologists think this general zone is particularly rich in oil. It’s also some of the best bird habitat on the planet. Though the area covers just 18 percent of the reserve, it is home to more than 40 percent of all the aquatic birds that visit the North Slope, government scientists reported in the 2013 study.

North of the lake is also a protected calving area for the 41,000-animal Teshekpuk caribou herd. Caribou return time and again to the same calving grounds, where they remain for a few weeks as females give birth, Ms. McIntosh said.

The herd then moves around the lake as the caribou seek ocean breezes to gain relief from the murderous Arctic mosquitoes and botflies, and later to migrate.

“If industry is allowed to enter into some of these very sensitive habitat areas, it would change these areas permanently,” said Ms. Whittington-Evans. Roads, pipelines and drill rigs would all fragment the habitat.

The Inupiaq people live here, too, including subsistence hunters who rely on the caribou and harvest up to 4,000 annually. “We strongly urge B.L.M. to maintain the leasing prohibitions,” Vern Cleveland Sr., the chairman of the Western Arctic Caribou Herd Working Group, wrote the B.L.M. in September. The group represents subsistence hunters, hunting guides and conservationists, among others.

The push by Mr. Zinke to open up still more country seems all the more hawkish given that drilling has scarcely begun on existing leases in the reserve. “To fully develop the lands currently available for lease will take decades,” Ms. Smith of Audubon Alaska said. To take such risks to meet total American oil needs for a few months, based on the available estimates of what may be in the ground, seems madness.

Or willful blindness. Or greed. The history of America is the chronicle of a grasping people. We take, and we take still more. What has redeemed us, in part anyway, is that we aspire to be better than who we are.

The western Arctic presents us the choice again of who we want to be. Do we possess the generosity of imagination to gently handle a place still mostly untouched and pristine, one almost no one has have ever heard of, and even fewer of us will ever visit?

MONDAY PUZZLE — Jay Kaskel takes us another step closer to the most boo-tiful day of the year with a puzzle about a stereotypical witch.

First Witch: When shall we three meet again

In thunder, lightning, or in rain? Second Witch: When the hurly-burly’s done,

When the battle’s lost and won. — Macbeth, Act I, Scene 1

Today’s Theme

Four phrases are reinterpreted as things that might be in the life of a witch. For example, witches cast spells, so “Computer help for a witch?” would be SPELL CHECK. Similarly, WARTS AND ALL at 41A is “How one might be forced to accept a witch?” because a witch has at least one wart. (Practitioners of witchcraft, please do not write to me objecting to this. I know you do not have warts. We’re talking about the cartoon stereotype.)

Tricky Clues

61A: If you are knowledgeable about poetry, KEATS might have been a gimme. I had John DONNE at first, but I know enough about cooking to know that a “Stir-fry vessel” is not a WOD, it’s a WOK.

19D: We’re talking about slang for money here. “Bill worth 100 smackers” is a C SPOT, which must be very rare, since multitudes of relationship experts have written about trying to find it.

Constructor Notes

I originally set out to create a Halloween-themed puzzle that incorporated all the familiar characters associated with Halloween: witches, ghosts, skeletons, vampires and zombies. But the theme never felt tight enough. After a while, I settled on a witch/BROOM HILDA-themed puzzle and sent it off. While Will liked the idea, he felt young solvers might not be familiar with the character. So not only did I have to replace BROOM HILDA at 58-Across, I had to do some serious re-cluing (CHARM SCHOOL, for example, was clued as “Educational institution attended by 58-Across?”) Here’s where things got tricky. One of the original theme entries was WITCH HUNT, which meant I couldn’t use the word “witch” in the clues. “Educational institution attended by a Halloween broom-rider” just didn’t do the trick. It felt too forced. In the end, I simply dropped WITCH HUNT as an answer, and thankfully Will was O.K. with the puzzle having just four main fills. As always, I can’t tell you how much of a treat it is to see one of my puzzles in The New York Times.

What every modern Thanksgiving table needs is one great dish that anyone can eat. It should be satisfying and hearty enough to be a meal on its own, but appealing enough to share as a side dish.

This golden-topped casserole of wild rice, white beans and seared mushrooms fits the bill.

The white beans, some of which are puréed, give it creaminess, while the wild rice adds a robust, chewy texture. The combination of mushrooms, leeks and fennel makes it autumnal. And plenty of sautéed spinach not only helps lighten the starchiness of the beans and rice, but also adds some necessary color.

Like many casseroles, this one is adaptable so you can tailor it to your tastes and your crowd. You can use gluten-free panko for celiac friends, or leave off the Parmesan in the topping for vegans and the lactose-intolerant. If you can’t get, or don’t want to spring for, the pricey wild rice, brown rice makes an equally nubby substitute. Cilantro haters can substitute basil.

One thing to keep in mind is that canned beans vary a lot in terms of salt content. If possible, find a brand that lists sea salt as an ingredient. These tend to have a better flavor than unsalted beans. But in either case, taste as you go, adjusting the salt as you see fit.

Conveniently for Thanksgiving (or any other dinner party), you can assemble the components for this dish the day before you want to serve it. Store the filling and topping separately in the fridge. Just before baking, spread the crumbs over the casserole and bake until steaming hot inside and golden on top.

Then serve it to your loved ones, because this is a dish they all can love.

“I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay.
In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.
The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat.
“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said.","It seems fitting that during Walker Evans’s one-month stay in Havana in 1933 he would befriend Ernest Hemingway. The two shared an appreciation of a spare style that would influence countless others in photography and literature. In fact, Evans entrusted Hemingway with a trove of original prints to ensure they would not be confiscated by the authorities who were violently suppressing popular outrage against the dictator Gerardo Machado.

Now, 46 of those vintage prints are being sold by DeWolfe and Wood Rare Books of Alfred, Me., and Michael Brown Rare Books of Philadelphia, and are featured in a catalog whose comprehensive introductory essay was written by Mr. Brown. The collection is owned by Benjamin Bruce, known as Dink. His father, Telly Otto Bruce, known as Toby, was Hemingway’s friend and factotum and had safeguarded the images for decades in Key West, Fla., where Hemingway had lived.

Evans had gone to Cuba to make pictures for “The Crime of Cuba,” a book by Carleton Beals that was a fierce critique of American adventurism. “The Beals book is an expose of our misgovernment in Cuba, and the disgraceful part we have played in her tragic history past and present, economic, social, political,” read the review in Kirkus. “Sins of omission perhaps even more than sins of commission. The story of Cuba is the story of tyranny-Spain, the United States, Wall Street, and now, closely linked with the immediate past, the dictatorship of Machado, which makes Mussolini look like a Sunday School picnic.”

Evans got a taste of that supercharged political climate in his earliest days there, according to Mr. Brown’s essay, where a bus ride could turn into a journey of intrigue as who-knows-who was tailing him as he tried to meet with opposition figures. At the same time, the city thrilled him.

“When you are still bewildered,” Evans wrote in his diary, “you notice more things, as in a drunk. I was drunk with a new city for days.”

That feeling became literal when he met Hemingway, likely through an introduction by one of Beals’s newspaper contacts on the island. “I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay. “Drinking every night. He was at loose ends … and he needed a drinking companion, and I filled that role for two weeks.”

Photo

But as the essay also noted, Hemingway’s prose style may have had an influence on Evans, whose vision had been influenced earlier by a stay in Paris, where he came to appreciate the work of Eugène Atget. The images — out of a total of 400 taken during his one-month sojourn, betray that influence in photos of facades and streets. Some of them show more isolated, intimate scenes in public, from a haggard looking country family to beggars. In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.

The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat. Once there, the images ended up in storage either behind, or next to, Sloppy Joe’s, the famous Key West saloon.

“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said. “What is fascinating is I think Evans was printing these where he was able to. Unlike later prints, most of these are uncropped, and slightly different. One print has Evans’s thumbprint. It’s as close to a first generation print you could possibly find.”

His talk echoed his statements in China earlier this week that blamed weak American leadership for trade imbalances that he said had stripped jobs, factories and entire industries from the United States.

“What we will no longer do is enter into large agreements that tie our hands, surrender our sovereignty and make meaningful enforcement practically impossible,” Mr. Trump said.

He also spoke witheringly about an approach he said had led the United States to lower its own trade barriers, only to have other countries refuse to do so, and he accused the World Trade Organization of treating the United States unfairly.

Many of the president’s toughest lines — his vow to fight the “audacious theft” of intellectual property from American companies and the forced transfer of technology to foreign firms — were aimed at China.

But Mr. Trump avoided criticizing Mr. Xi personally. And he repeated his contention that he did not blame China, or any other country, for taking advantage of what he called weak American trade laws.

“If their representatives are able to get away with it, they are just doing their jobs,” the president said. “I wish previous administrations in my country saw what was happening and did something about it. They did not, but I will.”

White House officials had framed Mr. Trump’s speech as a chance to articulate the idea of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” region, which the Trump administration has adopted as its answer to former President Barack Obama’s pivot to Asia. First proposed by the Japanese, it envisions the United States strengthening ties with three other democracies in the region — Australia, India and Japan — in part to counter a rising China. But the president offered few details about that approach.

He spoke of the need for freedom of navigation — a reference to the South China Sea, which Vietnam, Malaysia and other countries complain Beijing is turning into a private waterway. But the president stopped short of calling out China by name.

He also did not fault China or his host, Vietnam, for their checkered human rights records, even as he offered a general endorsement of the rule of law and individual rights.

As in his speech to the United Nations in September, Mr. Trump emphasized the idea of sovereignty, a concept that is often seen as being at odds with global cooperation and that is sometimes used by countries to fend off interference by outside powers.

He closed the speech with an inward-looking paean to the virtues of home, declaring, “In all of the world, there is no place like home,” adding that nations should “protect your home, defend your home, and love your home today and for all time.”

Mr. Xi, in contrast, argued for pursuing the kinds of global initiatives that Mr. Trump had shunned. The Chinese leader touted the Paris climate accord, called globalization an “irreversible historical trend” and said China would continue to pursue a free trade area in the Asia-Pacific region.

American and Russian officials had been working to arrange a meeting between President Vladimir V. Putin and Mr. Trump on the sidelines of the meeting, in part to ask for Moscow’s assistance in countering the threat from North Korea. But as Mr. Trump arrived in Danang, the White House announced that he would not hold formal talks with Mr. Putin.

Officials cited scheduling issues as the reason the two leaders would not meet. But on Thursday, Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, had said that a conversation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin was “still under consideration,” and that a final decision would hinge on whether there was “sufficient substance” to warrant face-to-face talks.

Mr. Trump’s last encounter with Mr. Putin — on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany — posed political challenges for the White House, which faced questions about whether and how sharply Mr. Trump would rebuke his Russian counterpart for meddling in the 2016 elections.

Mr. Trump was later criticized for not having pressed Mr. Putin more strongly in an hourslong meeting on the election interference, and for revelations that the two had a second, undisclosed discussion at a leaders’ dinner that night. Diplomats described being stunned to see the two presidents chatting intimately with only a Kremlin interpreter present.

The optics of a meeting this week would have been particularly tricky, given new revelations about the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russians, brought to light by the investigations into Moscow’s efforts to sway the American election in Mr. Trump’s favor.

The two presidents did end up shaking hands and exchanging greetings before posing for a photograph at the APEC gala dinner Friday evening.

Still, the change in plans appeared to have left the Kremlin exasperated. Asked about the absence of a meeting, Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, told a Russian TV reporter: “Ask the Americans. We are not speaking on this matter at all.”

Mr. Lavrov noted that Mr. Trump himself had said last week that he would most likely meet with Mr. Putin during his trip to Asia.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — Do you like movie trivia? Ross Trudeau returns to test our mettle.

Today’s Theme

Four famous lines from well-known movies are offered in the grid, clued with just the titles: Your job is to match them to the actors who said them. Those entries are also part of the theme: CRUISE LINE (59A), for example, is the answer to the SHOW ME THE MONEY (42A) line from “Jerry Maguire.” It’s also a real phrase in its own right, and is clued as “Carnival, say, or a further hint to 42-Across.”

Tricky Clues

6A: Is it GIF with a hard G or a soft G? No one knows for sure, although it’s said that because the G stands for “graphics,” which has a hard G, GIF should be pronounced that way. Either way, surely we have better things to argue about.

13A: “Canine supporters” could be all the wonderful rescue organizations that abound (Like Elayne Boosler’s Tails of Joy), but today we’re talking teeth, so the answer is GUMS.

30A: Get to know your hockey moves! A DEKE, which is a fake-out on the ice, comes up every now and then and is worth knowing.

71A: Nice wordplay! “What I may turn into” is not really about Mr. Trudeau morphing into something. It’s about what the word “I” could become, and that’s the ROYAL WE.

17D: TIL that “metathesiophobia” is the fear of CHANGE. And I hope it stays that way.

Constructor Notes

A couple thoughts: 1. ""Going Off Script” includes four white actors. Moreover, the SHOW ME THE MONEY line was also spoken by Cuba Gooding Jr., a black actor who goes uncredited in this puzzle (despite upstaging Tom Cruise). 2. “Going Off Script” also comprises four male actors. The original version did include WOODLINE/I FEEL PRETTY OH SO PRETTY, which got axed because it yielded asymmetric themers. But then again, Natalie Wood, an American with Russian parents, was cast to play Maria, a Puerto Rican. Dios. Aside from Ms. Wood, I only found revealers that referenced white males (PENNLINE, CRYSTALLINE, SHORTLINE), let alone ones that matched with legitimately iconic movie quotes. So, open question: If Hollywood’s gender/race representation problem means that, after an honest effort, you only can find white male actors for your ___LINE puzzle, do you scrap it? Is doing otherwise cynical and opportunistic? Is the choice mitigated if you subsequently construct an UZI GAL GODOT puzzle? (Very interested in collaborating on that puzzle. Let’s chat.)

Food for thought, Mr. Trudeau.",Going Off Script,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2017-10-29.html

“I thought if you’re writing hateful comment towards Hillary or Trump that are really, really angry and horrible, I thought that person is going to be horrible in person as well,” Mr. Lien said.
Many of them are trolls, but many of them are just really strongly opinionated people,” Mr. Lien said.
“Just to see their homes, their decorations around them, their computers — all of those things give quite a lot of personality to the photo,” Mr. Lien said.
Mr. Lien spent weeks researching and studying commenters.","Nick Haynes didn’t seem so bad.

Sure, online he had promised civil war if Hillary Clinton were elected, but Mr. Haynes was first and foremost a family man. He’d given up his days of motorcycles and drinking to live a sober life in a sleepy Pennsylvania town with his four children, where he had a full-time job as a truck driver.

But his family life contrasted sharply with his other full-time job, that of a prolific online commenter. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he tweeted an average of 57 times a day about a corrupt system, biased media and “Killary.” He compared voting for Mrs. Clinton to killing your own children.

It was this disconnect between “normal life” and intense online debate that drove Kyrre Lien, a photographer based in Oslo, to look into the lives of the online commenting community. For a project called “The Internet Warriors,” Mr. Lien combed through tens of thousands of online comments to put together a group of 27 internet debaters from around the world, representing all sides of the political spectrum.

“They had steady jobs, they had family, they had friends and lived quite a normal life, but at the same time, you saw they had these hateful comments,” he said. “That was part of what drove me to dig into this.”

In the case of Mr. Haynes, Mr. Lien assumed that he would personify his comments.

“I thought if you’re writing hateful comment towards Hillary or Trump that are really, really angry and horrible, I thought that person is going to be horrible in person as well,” Mr. Lien said. “But many of the people were actually quite nice, made me coffee and tea and, until politics came up, it was like flipping the switch on a different personality.”

Still, Mr. Lien is hesitant to categorize them as internet trolls.

“Labeling them all as internet trolls would be too harsh. Many of them are trolls, but many of them are just really strongly opinionated people,” Mr. Lien said. “All of the people I met are really dedicated in the cause they’re fighting.”

They have full-time jobs and families, they are men and women of all ages, who feel marginalized in some way or another. Take, for example, Ashleigh Jones, 22, a psychology student in Cardiff, Wales. She’s amassed more than 180,000 tweets on various subjects including entertainment, L.G.B.T. issues and “hot guys.”

“Some people have also called me a troll, like when I said that ISIS should kill David Cameron,” Ms. Jones told Mr. Lien, referring to the former British prime minister. “I don’t think I’m a troll. I might have strong opinions, but they are just that — opinions. For me, a troll is someone who is ruining the discussion, and that’s not me.”

The photographs feature portraits of the commenters, many of them in their natural commenting habitat inside their homes. Video interviews accompany the subjects online, as well as a book.

“Just to see their homes, their decorations around them, their computers — all of those things give quite a lot of personality to the photo,” Mr. Lien said.

Mr. Lien spent weeks researching and studying commenters. One thread took him down a dark path on Kim Kardashian’s Facebook account. He spent three or four days going through all the comments on her account looking for frequent commenters with a consistent message. But in the end, that was one type of opinion he wasn’t able to capture on camera — misogynists.

Mr. Lien found that the motivation behind commenters depends on their political affiliation. On the right, it’s “because they feel threatened and society is letting them down, they’re being left by themselves,” Mr. Lien said, whereas people on the left “feel that we need to stand up for what we believe in.”

Sofia Srour, 23 and Muslim, defends her religion daily.

“There is so much ignorance and hate directed towards my religion in the comment section that I quickly become irritated. Anger drives me,” she told Mr. Lien. “I have spent more than three hours every day sharing my views on Islam. It’s a bit scary to engage in these discussions, but I feel that it’s important to balance out all the negativity that is posted.”

Mr. Lien may have spent four years trailing the lives of what he calls internet warriors, but the photographer is far from calling himself a troll.

“I’d like to be more of an internet peacekeeping force than an internet warrior,” he said.

Mr. Ziegler sought to justify Mr. Moore’s actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph, saying, “Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus.”

The United States president calls his country’s judiciary “a laughingstock.” He rails against any check on his authority, disagreeing with investigations into his associates, demanding the prosecution of political rivals. His lack of interest in the Constitution that he is sworn to uphold is breathtaking.

Socrates’ rational arguments should have easily refuted the charges against him, but to him this was secondary to the fact that he had been tried and sentenced according to the law. The process did not allow for an appeal.

“Both in war and in courts and everywhere else, one must obey the commands of one’s city and country, or persuade it as to the nature of justice,” Socrates tells his friend Crito, in a dialogue written by Plato, another of his friends and pupils.

Agreeing with laws only when they suit us is not an option. By choosing to live in Athens and to raise children there, Socrates had shown in both words and deeds that he agreed to live in accordance with its laws. Violating them now would be a rejection of all that he had said and done throughout his life. Clinging to life, in other words, would make living worthless.

Unable to best Socrates’ arguments, his friends are obliged to agree with him. All they can do is be with him in the hours before he is given the poison that will kill him. Socrates uses the time to discuss how one should live, because, as he said at his trial, “the unexamined life is not worth living.”

At the time of Socrates’ trial, Athens was a dangerous place for principled citizens. Just five years earlier, the city lost an almost three-decade war with its great rival, Sparta, and a harsh oligarchy had been imposed. During their reign of terror, the oligarchs ordered Socrates and four others to arrest a fellow citizen so that he might be executed. The philosopher refused, and escaped death only because the oligarchy collapsed when exiled democrats rebelled.

The democracy that followed was unsettled, vindictive and suspicious of new ideas. Socrates had been a figure for debate for decades. In 423 B.C., in “The Clouds,” the comic playwright Aristophanes lampooned him as making wrong appear right — inspiring the later charges that cost him his life. Furthermore, Socrates had also once taught a younger man, Critias, who became one of the oligarchy’s leaders, and some saw this as a reason to prosecute him. Socrates’ trial and execution would prove an indelible blot on democracy’s legacy, but other leading intellectuals, too, were prosecuted, including the natural philosopher Anaxagoras, who left the city after being accused of “impiety.”

Directing his most probing and provocative questions against the pompous and self-righteous, sharing his thoughts with rich and poor, Socrates was the quintessential anti-populist. This was bound to gain him enemies from all quarters. He knew the risks. But having seen no reason to bow to the oligarchs, he would not compromise with the many, either.

“No man will survive who genuinely opposes you or any other crowd and prevents the occurrence of many unjust and illegal happenings in the city,” he told his prosecutors and jury. “It is not difficult to avoid death, gentlemen; it is much more difficult to avoid wickedness, for it runs much faster than death.”

In 406 B.C., after a naval battle that was the last Athenian victory in the war with Sparta, the Athenians tried their own generals for not picking up survivors and their sailors’ corpses (a violent storm had prevented this). Socrates, who was serving on the citizens assembly presiding committee, was the only member to vote against trying all the men as a body. Of the generals, all six who had chosen to return to Athens were executed in a verdict that, along with Socrates’, was later seen as regrettable.

Mr. Trump, on the other hand, rode a wave of nationalistic populism to power. He presented himself as a man of the people not through shared struggles but in a communion of simplistic denunciations of anyone outside his supporters’ circle. His common touch was not humility, but pandering to prejudice.

Choosing death before dishonor is not unique to one person, one era or one society. But when a person responsible to no one but himself sees the law as more important than himself, even when it has been unjust, we must ask: Should not the leader of the world’s most powerful nation hold himself to a similar standard?

Ephemeral tweet storms and voracious news cycles may cause us to forget that history judges its protagonists on what they contributed to their society. Socrates’ shameful murder is eclipsed by the majesty of his devotion to the institutions of the city that sentenced him to death. This, in turn, reflects well on his city — that it should have such a citizen.

Private colleges and universities have increased their endowments spectacularly through aggressive fund-raising and these kinds of investment and tax-avoidance techniques. Stanford University, one of the schools found to use offshoring, increased its endowment to $18 billion in 2012 from $2 billion in 1977. Harvard’s endowment grew to $32 billion (in inflation-adjusted dollars) from $6 billion during the same period.

The problem with enormous endowment growth is that private institutions have not used the resource boom to provide greater benefits to the public. Stanford is a case in point. Despite having increased its endowment tenfold, Stanford still only enrolls about 1,600 new freshmen every year — approximately the same number of new freshmen it enrolled annually in the 1970s. As a result, Stanford now spends about $55,000 each year on every full-time student, just from its endowment. That’s a ninefold increase since the 1970s after adjusting for inflation.

Harvard, Princeton and Yale all spend even greater sums per student from their endowments.

It’s true that a number of these wealthy universities have begun to increase the generosity of undergraduate financial aid, essentially offering free college, room and board to the lowest-income students. That’s a good thing, but most qualified low-income students receive zero financial aid from the wealthiest colleges because they are never admitted. According to the Stanford economist Raj Chetty, the top 38 private colleges today enroll more students from the top 1 percent of the nation’s income spectrum than from the bottom 60 percent. Basically, what wealthy colleges end up spending on low-income students is a drop in the bucket compared with what they could be doing.

America’s top public universities, on the other hand, have substantially increased their enrollments since the 1970s despite shrinking state funding. They also tend to enroll low-income students at much higher rates. The University of California, Berkeley, enrolls more low-income students than the entire Ivy League.

It would be easier to turn a blind eye to the increasingly lavish exclusiveness of the Ivies if it didn’t come at such great public expense. Just three tax breaks related to endowments now come at a cost of nearly $20 billion in reduced federal tax revenue annually. If that $20 billion was captured as federal revenue instead, it would provide nearly enough funds to double the federal Pell Grant program for low-income students.

The answer is not necessarily to tax endowments, though they have only been fully tax exempt since 1984. But if wealthy private colleges want their endowments to remain tax exempt, they need to start providing much greater public benefits. The most obvious place to begin is a substantial increase in undergraduate enrollment, especially of underrepresented students.

There has been a marked increase in anxiety about the cost and value of a college degree. Wealthy colleges could help assuage that by enrolling many more students from other walks of life. They can certainly afford to do so.",How the Ivy League Hides Its Cash,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/opinion/ivy-league-offshore-tax-stanford.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize — writing, synthesis, problem solving — are sought after by employers.
One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job.","Take the median lifetime earnings of business majors, the most popular undergraduate degree. The typical graduate earns $2.86 million over a lifetime. When you put business graduates side by side with those who graduated with what are considered low-paying majors, you’ll see that those who are slightly above the median salary in their fields are not that far behind the business grads. For example, an English major in the 60th percentile makes $2.76 million in a lifetime, a major in psychology $2.57 million and a history major $2.64 million.

Myth 2: Women want to have it all.

Women are now the clear majority on college campuses, making up 56 percent of students enrolled this fall. They are also more likely than men to graduate.

But when it comes to selecting a major, what women choose tends to segregate them into lower paying fields, such as education and social services, according to a report that Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce will publish later this year. Just look at some of the highest paying fields and the proportion of women who major in them: business economics (31 percent), chemical engineering (28 percent), computer science (20 percent), electrical engineering (10 percent), mechanical engineering (8 percent).

“Women can’t win even as they dominate at every level of higher education,” said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown center.

Dr. Carnevale wouldn’t speculate as to why women make their choices. But he notes that if the proportion of women in fields where men dominate increased by just 10 percent, the gender pay gap would narrow considerably: from 78 cents paid to women for every dollar men receive to 90 cents for every dollar men receive.

Myth 3: Choice of major matters more than choice of college.

Not so. In seven states — Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington — students can search public databases for early earnings of graduates of institutions within the state. And those databases show that students who graduate from more selective schools tend to make more money. After all, the better the college, the better the professional network opportunities, through alumni, parents of classmates and eventually classmates themselves.

These undergraduates are more able to pursue majors in lower paying fields because their networks help them land good jobs. Arts, humanities and social science majors are more prevalent on elite campuses than at second-tier colleges, where students tend to pick vocational majors like business, education and health. In all, more than half of students at less selective schools major in career-focused subjects; at elite schools, less than a quarter do, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight of the 78 “most selective schools” in Barron’s rankings, compared with 1,800 “less selective schools.”

“Students at selective colleges are allowed to explore their intellectual curiosity as undergraduates because they will get their job training in graduate school or have access to a network that gets them top jobs, regardless of their undergraduate major,” Dr. Carnevale said.

They are also more likely to have two majors than students at second-tier colleges, who tend to be more financially needy and have to work, affording less time to double major.

One tip: Complementary majors with overlapping requirements are easier to juggle, but two unrelated majors probably yield bigger gains in the job market, said Richard N. Pitt, an associate professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University who has studied the rise of the double major. “It increases your breadth of knowledge,” he said.

Myth 4: Liberal arts majors are unemployable.

The liberal arts is a favorite target of politicians, with the latest salvo coming from the governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin. “If you’re studying interpretive dance, God bless you, but there’s not a lot of jobs right now in America looking for people with that as a skill set,” Governor Bevin said in a speech in September.

Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize — writing, synthesis, problem solving — are sought after by employers. A 2017 study by David J. Deming, an associate professor of education and economics at Harvard, found jobs requiring both the so-called soft skills and thinking skills have seen the largest growth in employment and pay in the last three decades.

One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job. But a study by Burning Glass Technologies, a Boston-based company that analyzes job-market trends, concluded that if liberal arts graduates gain proficiency in one of eight technical skills, such as social media or data analysis, their prospects of landing entry-level jobs increase substantially.

The long-held belief by parents and students that liberal arts graduates are unemployable ignores the reality of the modern economy, where jobs require a mix of skills not easily packaged in a college major, said George Anders, author of “You Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a ‘Useless’ Liberal Arts Education.” In his book, Mr. Anders profiles graduates with degrees in philosophy, sociology and linguistics in jobs as diverse as sales, finance and market research.

“Once C.E.O.s see liberal arts graduates in action,” Mr. Anders said, “they come aboard to the idea that they need more of them.”

Myth 5: It’s important to choose a major early.

Why settle on a field of study before experiencing the smorgasbord college has to offer, be it study abroad, a club activity or a surprising elective?

Of students who said they felt committed to their major when they arrived on campus, 20 percent had selected a new major by the end of their first year, according to a national survey by the University of California, Los Angeles.

Changing majors can cost you a semester or two, especially if you switch to one unrelated to your first choice. To reduce that risk, several schools, including Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Lehman College in the Bronx, have created “meta-majors,” which group majors under a larger academic umbrella.

“We have moved away from trying to get students to choose their majors as they enter,” said Timothy Renick, Georgia State’s vice provost and vice president for enrollment management and student success.

Instead, all incoming students choose from one of seven meta-majors, representing large academic and work force fields, such as business, education and STEM. First semester, students gather in learning communities and register for a block of general-education courses within that meta-major. Programming is designed so that students get to know the differences between majors within the field.

“Students in our business meta-major get to understand the difference between finance, accounting, management and marketing so they can choose their major from an informed perspective,” Dr. Renick said. They usually do by the end of their first year.

Myth 6: You need a major.

A handful of colleges, including Indiana University and the Evergreen State College, offer the option to ignore the official list of majors and design a course of study. Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The Times, designed his at Indiana — enigmatology.

“Majors are artificial and restrictive,” said Christine Ortiz, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on leave to design a new nonprofit university that will have no majors, and also no lectures or classrooms.

“Majors result from the academic structure of the university, tied to the classic academic disciplines. There is no reason they need to be boxed up like that. They don’t take into account emerging fields that cross disciplines.”

Majors tend to lag behind changes in the workplace. No wonder fewer than a third of college graduates work in jobs related to their majors. And picking one based on today’s in-demand jobs is risky, said Dr. Webber of Temple, especially if the occupation is threatened by automation.

“I would argue against majoring in accounting,” he said, “or anything that a computer can be programmed to do.”",Six Myths About Choosing a College Major,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/education/edlife/choosing-a-college-major.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

As Justice Lavin tells it, Conner T. Lowry, one of his nephews, showed up in a Marine recruiter’s office in 2008 as a “classic South Side Irish kind of kid.” Standing six feet five inches tall and weighing 220 pounds, he was exuberance personified (“live life large,” he used to say), and determined to enlist.

The judge was against the decision. He thought the United States had bungled the wars since the terror attacks in 2001 and that the Pentagon didn’t know what it was doing — circumstances in which the risks to the enlisted ranks were exceptionally high.

Young Mr. Lowry was firm. He told him, the judge said, that “he decided to get into the Marine Corps to straighten his life out a little bit.”

Family and friends saw him off from Cork & Kerry, an Irish bar in the Beverly neighborhood of Chicago. The judge, being a judge, knew when a case was lost. He observed the rituals. He hoisted a pint of Guinness, set aside his misgivings and threw in his blessing, with a toast.

“We have to support our country, support our flag, support our men and women in uniform,” he said. “Even if we disagree with the mission.”

The Times analysis, using the open-source software TaxBrain, found that roughly one-quarter of families in the middle class would see their taxes increase in 2018, by about $1,000 on average. By 2026, the share seeing an increase would rise slightly, to about one-third, and the average increase would rise to about $1,600. For the majority of middle-class families that receive a tax cut, the average savings would be about $1,300 in 2018 and $1,700 in 2026.

How Much Would People Save? People across income brackets would see savings from the Senate plan in 2018. But for many in the middle class, the savings would be relatively small. The table below shows the average savings, by income, for those who would receive a tax cut.

The Times analysis defines the middle class broadly as those earning between two-thirds and twice the median household income, or about $50,000 to $160,000 per year for a family of three. To focus on families, the analysis excluded individual filers and households headed by people 65 or older and is adjusted for the size of each household.

Under the House bill, The Times has found, about half of middle-class families would pay more in taxes in 2026.

The analysis did not seek to calculate how workers might benefit from a steep cut in the corporate tax rate, which both the Senate and House bills would reduce to 20 percent from a top rate of 35 percent today, or project how the bills might increase economic growth and, with it, Americans’ wages.

On Friday, the independent Tax Foundation released an analysis of the plan’s growth effects. It projected that the Senate bill would increase gross domestic product by 3.7 percent over the next decade and raise wages by 2.9 percent across the economy.

For taxpayers earning more than $1 million a year, the Senate bill offers a more limited upside and downside than the House bill.

The Senate bill is less likely than the House bill to yield tax increases for high-income Americans, in part because it cuts the top marginal personal tax rate, while the House bill creates a so-called “bubble rate” that would actually raise taxes on many high-salaried workers.

The Senate measure would also produce a smaller average tax windfall for high earners than the House version, in part by offering less generous benefits for owners of businesses known as pass-throughs, which are not organized as corporations.

Under the Senate plan, “Americans are especially likely to face a tax increase if they have a smaller family, have mostly wage income instead of investment income, or claim some of the many deductions that the bill repeals, like those for state and local taxes and employee business expenses,” said Lily Batchelder, a professor and tax specialist at New York University Law School, who worked on economic policy in the Obama administration. “They are increasing taxes on many in the middle class, while concentrating their tax cuts on the wealthy.”

The Senate bill appears much better for the very wealthy than it is for the somewhat wealthy. About half of families earning between two and three times the median income — or about $160,000 to $240,000 for a family of three — would pay more in 2018 than under existing law. But among the richest families, those earning more than about $500,000 for a family of three, nearly 90 percent would get a tax cut.

The findings come with an important caveat: The Senate bill, as written, appears unable to muster the 60 votes needed to avoid a Democratic filibuster, meaning Republicans will need to amend it to comply with the budget reconciliation rules and allow permit passage by a simple majority. Those changes could likely include putting expiration dates on some of the bill’s major provisions, which could make the final version of the bill look less favorable to the middle class, particularly in later years.

The Times’s figures are based on an analysis of Census Bureau data using a tax model from the Open Source Policy Center, a Washington research organization affiliated with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. Because the analysis is based on publicly available data, not actual tax records, it may not capture all the intricacies of Americans’ household finances.

The Senate bill differs sharply from the House version in its approach to cutting taxes on businesses. But when it comes to taxes on individuals and families, the bills are more similar than different. Both would double the standard deduction while eliminating a raft of deductions and credits. Both would make the child tax credit more generous. Both would restructure federal income tax brackets to impose lower marginal tax rates at most income levels, although the Senate approach, unlike the House version, doesn’t eliminate two brackets entirely.

The Senate bill includes features that would make its plan more favorable to the middle class. It preserves some popular tax deductions and credits that the House bill initially would have eliminated, and it makes the child tax credit somewhat more generous and widely available. On the other hand, the Senate bill, unlike the House version, would eliminate the deduction for property taxes, which could lead to higher federal taxes for homeowners in areas with high property tax rates or expensive housing markets.

Aparna Mathur, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said senators could improve the bill with further changes, such as expanding the earned-income tax credit and extending the benefits of the child tax credit to more low-income taxpayers. “We clearly need to do more to help the lowest-income families,” she said. “At the same time, we can engage in more base broadening for the highest-income households, perhaps by eliminating and not just capping the mortgage-interest deduction.”

The Times analysis found that roughly one-fifth of the Senate bill’s cuts in 2018 would go to families and individuals earning $1 million or more, and close to half would go to people earning at least $200,000. Between 10 million and 15 million taxpayers earning less than $100,000 a year would pay more than under existing law.

Families earning more than $1 million a year would see their after-tax income rise by about 1.7 percent in 2018 compared with what they would make under current law, nearly triple the gains enjoyed by those earning less than $200,000.

Over all, the Senate bill would cut individual income taxes by about $30 billion in 2018, and by $900 billion over the next decade, according to Congress’s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. And most people in all income groups would see a tax cut, although the cuts would be modest for most lower earners.",Senate Plan Could Increase Taxes on Some Middle-Class Workers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/us/politics/senate-tax-bill.html

At one point in “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” Frances McDormand tears the movie open, showing you what a broken heart looks like. It happens during an uneasily intimate encounter between her character, a tough number named Mildred, and an ailing police chief, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). Until then, Mildred has seemed impervious to his pain. She has rented three billboards attacking his failure to solve her daughter’s murder — one reads “Raped While Dying” — and has been so wrapped up in her hurt that she hasn’t seen anyone else’s. When she realizes how sick Willoughby is, she looks at him as if for the first time. She’s staggered, and so are you.

The pain of others haunts “Three Billboards,” at least whenever the writer-director Martin McDonagh lets it. A playwright (“The Pillowman”) turned filmmaker (“In Bruges”) who’s somewhat of a subgenre unto himself, Mr. McDonagh is a pain artist whose tools include absurd violence, cruel laughs and sucker punches. He skated through his last movie, “Seven Psychopaths,” a barely there comedy that pivots on a creatively stalled screenwriter. As this précis suggests, Mr. McDonagh doesn’t have much to say in that movie — it has a bunny, stolen dogs, guys with guns, good and bad jokes — but what little is said is said by very fine performers grooving on all his words and larky nonsense.

Video

“Three Billboards” is more ambitious than Mr. McDonagh’s earlier features. Like the older ones, it has loads of gab, plenty of guns and the spectacle of men (mainly) behaving terribly. It also restlessly, if not satisfyingly, shifts between comedy and tragedy — a McDonagh specialty — splattering blood along the way. This time, though, he has also given his movie characters instead of disposable contrivances, a plot instead of self-reflexive ideas about storytelling and a rather diffuse overarching metaphor. Mostly, he has freighted it with a tragedy that allows the performers — primarily Ms. McDormand but also the equally excellent Mr. Harrelson and Sam Rockwell — to play to their range.

The movie opens on low boil with Mildred behind the wheel of her station wagon near three derelict billboards. It’s an inviting landscape smudged with soft color, but as she stares at the signs with furrowed intensity, she chews on a fingernail so ferociously she seems on the verge of tearing it off. The billboards aren’t blank — the faded image of a baby smiles down from one, the word “life” pops off another — but they’re the opening pages in Mildred’s opus. Stamping black text against a blood-red background, she uses the billboards to announce her crusade while Mr. McDonagh (who likes self-aware gestures) lays out the story’s fundamentals: its setting, characters, problem, plot and possible villain.

The billboards are a gimmick for Mr. McDonagh and a gambit for Mildred, a way to get things jumping (the investigators, the tale) and splash some foreboding on an outwardly pacific scene. Much of the story involves the ripples of outrage, confusion and buffoonery that the billboards inspire and that soon envelop almost everyone Mildred knows. Months after her daughter’s death, grief has walled her in; isolating and seemingly impenetrable, it is inscribed in the hardness of her gaze and in her grim new identity as a mother of a dead girl. The billboards turn that grief into a weapon, a means of taking on the law and assorted men — a threatening stranger, a vigilante dentist and an abusive ex (John Hawkes) — who collectively suggest another wall that has closed Mildred in.

Mr. McDonagh likes to play comedy against violence and to wring laughs out of the unspeakable. This kind of juxtaposition (in his movies, at any rate) can produce laughter that catches in your throat, giving you pause and maybe provoking thought about why exactly you are giggling. But he doesn’t always know his A material from his B, or doesn’t care; his jokes can be uninterestingly glib with tiny, bloodless pricks that are less about challenging the audience than about obscuring the material’s clichés and overriding theatricality. Everything fits together too neatly in “Three Billboards,” even when chaos descends, but the performers add enough rough texture so that it doesn’t always feel so worked.

Ms. McDormand roughs it up beautifully. A performer of great unforced naturalism, she has always come across more like a character actor than a star, even when she has the lead. She never seems concerned about losing the audience’s love or its sympathy, which can be thrilling, particularly given that female performers are often asked to pander or seduce. In this movie, she makes pain so palpably all-encompassing that you see it in her character’s every glance and gesture: It squares Mildred’s jaw, hardens her mouth and turns her face to stone, as if she were further fortifying her defenses. But pain also makes her ugly, maybe irredeemable, which also makes her joltingly, excitingly human.",Review: On Violence and the Pain of Others in ‘Three Billboards’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/movies/review-three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-martin-mcdonagh.html
