Sen. John McCain“The allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying.","Multiple Republican lawmakers have called on Roy Moore, the Alabama GOP Senate candidate, to step aside following sexual assault allegations.

Moore, a former Alabama state judge, allegedly had sexual contact with teenage girls in the late 1970s and 1980s, the Washington Post reported. Leigh Corfman said Moore had sexual contact with her when she was just 14 and he was 32.

The age of consent in Alabama is 16.

Moore has denied the allegations, saying in a statement obtained by Fox News on Friday that the article was ""based on a lie supported by innuendo.""

""It seems that in the political arena, to say that something is not true is simply not good enough. So let me be clear. I have never provided alcohol to minors, and I have never engaged in sexual misconduct,"" he said.

""As a father of a daughter and a grandfather of five granddaughters, I condemn the actions of any man who engages in sexual misconduct not just against minors but against any woman,"" he added.

Moore, who urged ""the Washington Post, and everyone involved, to tell the truth,"" also said that he trusts ""that the people of Alabama, who know my record after 40 years of public service, will vouch for my character and commitment to the rule of law.""

Still, multiple Republicans have called on Moore to step aside from the special election in December. And the National Republican Senatorial Committee reportedly severed its fundraising ties with Moore.

The White House

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said if the allegations are true, President Trump believes that ""Moore will do the right thing and step aside.""

“Like most Americans, the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a person’s life,"" Sanders said. ""However, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.""

Vice President Mike Pence, “found the allegations in the story disturbing and believes, if true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office,” his press secretary, Alyssa Farah, told reporters.

Sen. Mitch McConnell

“If these allegations are true, he must step aside,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement.

Sen. Cory Gardner

“The allegations against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore are deeply troubling. If these allegations are found to be true, Roy Moore must drop out of the Alabama special Senate election,” Sen. Cory Gardner,R-Colo., the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, said in a statement.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski

“I’m horrified and if it’s true, he should step down immediately,” Murkowski told reporters.

She reportedly also urged Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed to fill Jeff Sessions’ seat when he was tapped to become attorney general, to launch a write-in campaign. The deadline to take Moore off the ballot has passed.

Sen. Mike Lee

Although he formerly endorsed Moore, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has now asked for his image to be removed from any campaign materials.

Sen. Mike Rounds

“If they are true, then he should seriously think about stepping aside,"" Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said.

Sen. John Cornyn

“I find it deeply distrusting and troubling. It’s up to the governor and the folks of Alabama to make that decision as far as what the next steps are,"" Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said.

Sen. Tim Scott

“If they’re accurate, he absolutely should [step aside],"" Tim Scott, of South Carolina, said.

Sen. Susan Collins

“If there is any truth at all to these horrific allegations, Roy Moore should immediately step aside as Senate candidate,"" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.

Sen. Steve Daines

""These are very serious allegations and if true he should step down,"" said Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont.

Sen. John McCain

“The allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying. He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of,"" Arizona Sen. John McCain said.

Sen. Richard Shelby

“It’s a devastating nasty story,” Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby told reporters. “If it’s true, I don’t believe there’d be a place for him in the U.S. Senate.”

Sen. Jeff Flake

Like other Republicans, Flake called on Moore to “step aside” from the election if the allegations are true.

He has also tweeted his call for Moore to “step aside immediately” and lambasted local Alabama GOP officials who defended Moore.

Sen. Luther Strange

Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, who lost the special election primary to Roy Moore, called the allegations “disturbing.”

He has not yet said if he’ll reenter the race, but told the Associated Press that he is doing “research.” It is too late to take Moore off the ballot, but Strange has been encouraged to launch a write-in campaign.

Sen. Rob Portman

“I think if what we read is true, and people are on the record so I assume it is, then he should step aside,” Ohio Sen. Rob Portman said.

Sen. Ben Sasse

Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called the Washington Post’s story ""heartbreaking.""

The senator also agreed on Twitter with National Review editor Jonah Goldberg who said, “As the father of a 14 year old girl, this ‘What’s the big deal?’ crap enrages me.”

Sen. Ted Cruz

""These are serious and troubling allegations,"" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who previously endorsed Moore, said in a statement. ""If they are true, Judge Moore should immediately withdraw. However, we need to know the truth, and Judge Moore has the right to respond to these accusations.""

Rep. Paul Ryan

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement that if the allegations are true, they would disqualify Moore from the special election in December.

“These allegations are disqualifying if true. Anyone who would do this to a child has no place in public office, let alone the United States Senate,” Ryan said in a statement.

Rep. Peter King

""I would say unless he can prove his innocence, the burden is now on him within the next day or so, I believe he has to step down. He owes it to himself, he owes it to the state and and he owes it to the U.S. Senate,"" New York Rep. Peter King said on MSNBC

Gov. John Kasich

Ohio Gov. John Kasich said on Twitter that he’s “long opposed” Moore and called on him to step aside from the race as well.

“I’ve long opposed Roy Moore [and] his divisive viewpoints. The actions described make him unfit for office. The GOP must not support him. He should step aside,” Kasich said.

Former Gov. Mitt Romney

Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, slammed Moore on Twitter.

“Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections. I believe Leigh Corfman,” the former governor said. “Her account is too serous to ignore.

“My fight to expose the truth about what occurred to me when I was sexually assaulted in Mexico in 2010 was for the sole purpose to educate and protect others,” the 35-year-old from Dallas wrote.

The Journal Sentinel initially reported no one from TripAdvisor contacted Love to apologize, though CEO Steve Kaufer wrote in a LinkedIn post last week the company “apologized to the victim for her experience.”

“WHAT APOLOGY? I've yet to hear a word from TripAdvisor, and certainly not an apology!” an agitated Love wrote in a reply to Kaufer’s Nov. 3 post.

Love eventually was contacted by Kaufer and was made aware of a press release the company put out, in which it said it was “horrified that this victim experienced this assault on her vacation in Mexico, and other travelers should be aware of this incident.”

TripAdvisor also admitted to removing Love's post.

“TripAdvisor has been made aware of recent media reports or events concerning this property which may not be reflected in reviews found on this listing,” a box with red text reads on top of some pages, including ones for the Iberostar Paraiso Maya and Grand Velas Riviera Maya resorts. “Accordingly, you may wish to perform additional research for information about this property when making your travel plans.”

“Those were just the first three,” TripAdvisor spokesman Brian Hoyt told the Milwaukee Sentinel Journal. “We’ll be monitoring news coverage moving forward.”

Tourists who spoke to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel for its original report on the alleged deleted posts said their messages were frequently removed because they were labeled by TripAdvisor as “hearsay.”

“To me it’s like censoring,” Wendy Avery-Swanson had told the newspaper after her review of a Mexican resort – in which she said she blacked out after being served alcohol at a swim-up bar – was scrubbed off the website. “It wasn’t hearsay. It actually happened to me.”

The Massachusetts-based travel giant says it employs hundreds of people to police the content of its 535-million user reviews of hotels and restaurants around the world and also uses software to detect fake ones.

But that’s not enough for some lawmakers.

Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., urged the Federal Trade Commission last week to investigate TripAdvisor, saying she's concerned the company “may be prioritizing profits over providing an open, honest forum for traveler reviews,” the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.","TripAdvisor accuser blasts site for allegedly deleting posts about rape, other crimes",https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/09/tripadvisor-accuser-blasts-site-for-allegedly-deleting-posts-about-rape-other-crimes.html

This program could deliver an entirely new system to defeat post-traumatic stress, chronic pain, inflammatory disease, and other illnesses that may not respond to current and conventional treatments. It could revolutionize the way illness and disease are diagnosed and treated.

Currently “neuromodulation” is a last resort. ElectRx could make it the first thing and the only thing needed to restore health.

Invisible wounds

Approximately 20 veterans commit suicide every day, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. This is a much higher rate than civilians.

NORTH KOREA: WILL MINI NUKES BECOME AN OPTION FOR TRUMP?

Invisible wounds from war such as post-traumatic stress, depression and chronic pain are believed to be contributing factors to this tragic loss of life.

The bastion that gave rise to life-changing innovations like the internet and GPS, DARPA, is seeking solutions.

DARPA’s brainboxes are turning their genius to solving the challenges of invisible war wounds. And they’ve enlisted other medical pioneering superstars from all over the country, drawn from academia and the private sector, to join them in finding solutions to PTSD, depression and chronic pain.

The program is called Electrical Prescriptions, or ElectRx. And they are determined to create groundbreaking miniature devices that will initiate self-healing of body and mind. This futuristic tech will use the body’s nervous system to restore and maintain health.

If successful, it could mean entirely new treatments for illnesses that replace the traditional go-to drugs. And even solutions for illnesses that have no current viable treatment.

It is believed that much of the mental health and chronic inflammatory diseases involve abnormal activity in the peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system plays a central role in organ function.

If the nerve signals of the peripheral nervous system could be somehow monitored - and targeted – then there could be great potential to restore health without drugs or surgery.

Commandeering the human body superhighway

The peripheral nervous system is the body’s information superhighway. Motor and sensory signals constantly zoom through this superhighway communicating information regarding our health status. These signals play a role in triggering changes in the brain and other organs to maintain health.

A key part of this initiative is unlocking the mysteries of the body’s data superhighway – the nervous system. Experts are going to figure out specific neural circuits and their role in health and disease. The teams will map neural circuits and develop revolutionary bio-electrical interfaces.

The initiative will need to master how the nervous system regulates many aspects of our health. It will also need to develop the tech to measure and stimulate nerve signals.

ElectRx will be able to change lives by controlling the human body’s superhighway. DARPA will own the road and use it to restore health to our wounded warriors.

POWERFUL TINY TANKS WITH VR AND FUTURISTIC COCKPITS COULD REVOLUTIONIZE THE BATTLEFIELD

Here’s an example … neurochemicals regulate learning and memory in the brain. Peripheral nerve stimulation could be used to regulate neurochemical production. This could mean entirely new treatment options for post-traumatic stress and other mental health challenges.

How would it work?

The devices, called neuromodulation tech, will be so small they could be injected with a needle. They can both monitor and respond from inside the body.

Once inside the body, the ElectRx device would harness its advanced sensing and stimulating technologies to target specific peripheral neural circuits that control organ functions.

They would monitor the person’s health status and then intervene when necessary.

If intervention is required to restore health, then the device would deliver therapeutic patterns of stimulation tailored specifically for the patient.

SLIME OF 300-MILLION-YEAR-OLD CREATURE MAY BE USED FOR BODY ARMOR

A simple example of this sort of tech and approach is the pacemaker, which uses brief pulses of electricity to stimulate the heart to beat at a healthy rate.

ElectRx devices will do something similar, but for other organs, whether the stomach or the brain. This could even provide entirely new ways of treating inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.

It may also even help to safely and reliably instruct the peripheral nervous system to fight disease.

DARPA has selected seven teams of researchers. Here’s a nutshell on 3 of these exciting projects underway.

PODCAST: FIND OUT HOW THIS INSPIRING SPECIAL FORCES AMPUTEE ACHIEVED THE IMPOSSIBLE

Defeating biomolecules to conquer depression

For depression, some research suggests that depression might be caused in part by excess levels of inflammatory biomolecules. Fighting inflammation with ElectRx may also provide new treatments.

Eliminating chronic pain with light inside the body

Circuit Therapeutics is working with optogenetic methods to treat neuropathic pain.

In simple terms, they are using a combination of gene therapy and a light device. By harnessing the power of light and targeting specific regions with it inside the body, they are hoping to put an end to chronic pain. They’re “transducing” the specific circuit and making exciting progress.

Ending PTSD using the neck

PTSD is when individuals are reminded of a traumatic event and feel anxiety and panic. Approximately 8 percent of the U.S. population will have PTSD at some point in their lifetimes, according to the National Center for PTSD.

A University of Texas team, led by veteran Robert Rennaker and Michael Kilgard, is using vagal nerve stimulation to induce neural plasticity for the treatment of post-traumatic stress.

VNS has already had success with depression. To reduce the fear response, they are using targeted VNS during exposure therapy. The vagus nerve is in the neck. They send a mild electric pulse through it and it relays data about the status of the body to the brain.",Remarkable self-healing tech could tackle invisible war wounds,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/11/10/remarkable-self-healing-tech-could-tackle-invisible-war-wounds.html

Tax reform is not about numbers.","Mothers have enough to worry about without being thrown into the ever-present Mommy Wars – those endless debates about whether being a stay-at-home mother is harder than being a mom who works outside of the home. Let us all agree that parenting is both rewarding and incredibly difficult.

While moms may spend more time discussing potty training or social media and phone privileges, the family tax bill is an ever-present issue due to its direct impact on the family budget. Why? Because kids are so darn expensive.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that it will cost about $234,000 in 2015 dollars to raise a child until he or she is 17 years old. That is not even including college. Child care costs are big-ticket items on this list.

Care.com, with New America, found the national average for the annual cost of child care is 31 percent of the median household income. The average cost of day care in the country is just under $200 per week per child. Hiring an after-school sitter for about 15 hours a week averages $214 per week. Employing a nanny is about $556 per week. This is the average – if you live in New York, California or Washington, D.C., you’ll likely pay more.

These are the kinds of costs that make families think twice about having more children – or any children at all. Mothers (and fathers) stay up at night worrying about the quality of care their children receive while they work to keep food on the table. And low-income and middle-class families are hit the hardest.

About three-quarters of all Americans believe it is better for families to have one parent home with children and just over 40 percent of American families strive to make that happen, either with a parent or close relative taking care of their young children. The word “strive” paints an accurate picture of the 10.4 million stay-at-home moms, because despite pervasive stereotypes, the majority of them are not wealthy women.

This is not about government coming to the rescue, but rather families keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple. Abraham Lincoln stated: “The strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.”

A pro-family tax structure encourages families to grow and allows parents the choice of staying at home to care for their children or getting a paying job. This freedom helps families build safe and secure homes, which in turn benefits the country as a whole.

On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.

Child care subsidies can help with the expensive costs of day care and the like. But their benefits are limited to a small subset of the families that use those facilities, and not families that have a parent who stays home or families that are able to rely on other family members for full- or part-time child care.

Both political parties should be commended for wanting to meaningfully work on the federal level to help enable families choose the best option for quality care for their children, while working towards prosperity and a better life. But the solution cannot be more money thrown at problems that instead need thoughtful and creative ideas to benefit as many Americans as possible.

By increasing the child tax credit – now up to $1,000 annually for each child 16 and under – to a maximum of $2,500 a year per child, hardworking lower-income and middle-class parents will get the relief they need, putting more of their own money directly into their pockets.

This money will not just be available for child care but also for food, shelter and educational options like supplemental tutoring or sports programs. This ultimately has a multiplied impact – helping more families and allowing parents more choices, while encouraging economic equality.

President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Both would like to ensure that this reform is pro-family, because they understand that tax relief for families is an investment in America’s future.

As a mother who has both stayed at home and worked part-time or full-time, it is obvious that the more choices we have to provide for our families the better. Sadly, some moms do not have the opportunity to choose.

Congress should seize this historic opportunity to truly reform the tax system and make it pro-family. As part of that effort, forgotten families with children should be allowed to keep more of their own paychecks. This is an opportunity to make a life-changing difference in the lives of American families that are working hard every day to make ends meet.

Families are the crucial social institution tasked with safety and security and the inculcation of skills and values that create healthy, productive citizens necessary for the future of a thriving nation.

If you have allergies or asthma, or are sensitive to pollution, you may have considered purchasing an air purifier to clean the air inside your home. Now, with smoke from destructive wildfires still burning in Northern California affecting people as far as 100 miles away, even those without specific health concerns are thinking about ways to improve indoor air quality. But with so many types of filtration systems on the market (and prices ranging from $100 to nearly $1,000), it can be hard to know where to begin. Check out this quick guide to home air purifiers to figure out which are worth the cost.

Why use an air purifier? Indoor air pollution comes from a combination of particulate matter (dust, mold, pet dander and particles from smoke and cooking stoves) and gaseous pollutants (vehicle exhaust, smoke and chemical fumes) and can be far worse than the pollution outside, simply because it has no way to dissipate.

Those who suffer from asthma or allergies can be especially sensitive to air quality, and using an air purifier could be helpful, together with other methods of keeping out pollution and allergens.

Purify your home, not just the air. Air purifiers can do wonders for removing particulate matter from the air; the problem is that dust, pet dander and the like don’t stay in the air for long. Allergens drift to the ground and become embedded in rugs and soft furnishings — places an air purifier cannot reach. A combination approach will reduce indoor air pollution and allergens more than any one method alone. Here are a few strategies to try:

○ Remove wall-to-wall carpeting; go for easy-to-clean hard flooring and washable area rugs.

○ Vacuum and dust with a microfiber cloth regularly.

○ Ban smoking in and around the house.

○ Do not use a fireplace.

○ Do use the exhaust fans over the stove and in the bathroom.

○ Establish a no-shoes policy.

RELATED: Get an Exhaust Fan for the Bathroom

What to do if you are affected by wildfire smoke. Depending on wind direction and other atmospheric conditions, smoke from wildfires can drift 100 miles or farther from the source of the flames. If you are affected by wildfire smoke (but not in an evacuation area), the Centers for Disease Control recommends staying indoors when possible, with windows, doors, and fireplace dampers closed. Here are a few more things you can do:

○ Use your central air-conditioning system if you have one, but keep the fresh air intake closed to prevent smoke from getting inside.

○ Clean or replace the HVAC filter more frequently as long as you are experiencing smoky conditions.

○ Cut down on activities that contribute to indoor air pollution, including burning candles and using a fireplace, wood stove or gas stove.

○ Avoid vacuuming, as this can stir up large particles that have settled.

○ If you do not have an in-duct air filtration system, it can be helpful to use a portable air purifier with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to remove some of the particulate matter from the air.

○ If you have a medical emergency from smoke, you should call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room immediately.

How air purifiers work. There are a few different types of air purifiers on the market, and not all of them are especially effective or safe. It is important to know what you are buying, so read the fine print on your air purifier before purchasing. The main thing to check is how the purifier cleans the air. It will likely use one or more of these methods:

○ High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter: This is the most common and one of the most effective methods available.

○ Activated carbon: Usually used with a HEPA filter or another filter, activated carbon can help reduce pollution by attracting some chemicals, which bond to the surface of the carbon.

○ Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) cleaners: These use a UV light to kill viruses, bacteria, allergens and some molds. UVGI cleaners may not reduce allergy or asthma symptoms, because typical home cleaners have limited effectiveness.

○ Electrostatic precipitators: Particles entering the purifier are given a charge and then trapped on oppositely charged plates. These machines create a small amount of ozone, which is a lung irritant and pollutant itself, so this type of purifier is probably best avoided.

Not effective as an air purifier at all, ozone generators are being marketed as air cleaners, but they actually add lung-irritating ozone to your home, which can be hazardous. The Environmental Protection Agency does not recommend buying ozone generators.

When to choose a whole-house air cleaner: If you have a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in your home, you have the option of having a whole-house air cleaner installed right in the ductwork. The benefits of a whole-house system are that all of the air is cleaned and there are no bulky appliances to deal with. In-duct systems are expensive, and they must be professionally installed and maintained.

When to choose a portable room purifier: Room purifiers are a good choice for smaller spaces, and multiple units can be used to clean the air even in a larger home. They are portable, so they are a good solution for renters, and cost anywhere from $100 to $1,000 per unit.

Get to know the rating systems. For in-duct air filters, look for the minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) to tell how efficiently they pull particles from the air. MERV values range from 1 to 20; a system rated 7 or higher is about as effective as a HEPA filter. True HEPA filters, which have MERV values of 17 to 20, are not typically installed in HVAC systems. However, some newer homes may be specially designed with in-duct HEPA filtration.

When shopping for a portable air purifier, look for a clean air delivery rate (CADR) of at least 250, but the higher the better. This is a voluntary system developed by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), so not all appliances have a CADR.

An Energy Star label on any air purifier indicates better energy efficiency but does not necessarily mean it is more effective — so also be sure to check the MERV or CADR rating.

Want to be really sure your air purifier is doing its job? Look for the AHAM Verifide mark on your portable air cleaner, which indicates that the manufacturer’s claims have been independently tested and certified.",What to look for when buying air purifiers for your home,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/26/what-to-look-for-when-buying-air-purifiers-for-your-home.html

Jeffrey Dahmer, a former chocolate factory worker, was sentenced to 15 consecutive life terms in prison in 1992 after he confessed to killing and dismembering 17 boys and young men.

His horrific crimes, which involved torture, necrophilia and cannibalism, continue to shock the nation. So much so that Oxygen Media will explore Dahmer in a new two-night special “Dahmer On Dahmer: A Serial Killer Speaks.”

For the documentary, his father Lionel, along with stepmother Shari, came forward to break their silence about the murderer’s upbringing in Wisconsin.

In 1994, the 34-year-old died when he was bludgeoned to death by a fellow inmate.

Shari, who married Lionel after his divorce from first wife Joyce Flint in 1978, quickly befriended her 18-year-old stepson whom she described as “quiet and respectful.”

“What I wanted to do, and what most people wanted to do, was mother him,” the 76-year-old told Fox News. “He was just vulnerable. Even if I wasn’t his stepmother all his life, as a mother you sense those things. And he was very vulnerable. He needed love and he needed attention.”

In the special, viewers will learn Joyce privately suffered from mental illness and reportedly took up to 27 pills a day while she was pregnant with her son, including antidepressants, growth hormones and progesterone.

It’s been speculated that the cocktail of prescription medication could have affected the fetus. Shari also revealed Jeffrey’s grandparents allegedly weren’t allowed to hold him as a baby because Joyce was terrified of germs. Lionel also claimed Joyce rarely touched the infant, except to change his diapers or to hold him for a photo.

By the time Shari came into the picture, she noticed a teenage Jeffrey was a heavy drinker.

“When I moved in, I had my own mini bar and the bottles kept lessening in [liquor],” she recalled. “When Jeff got drunk and had his father’s car, he didn’t remember where it was. We had to track the car down one time because he had parked it somewhere and didn’t remember where. But alcohol was the only thing at that time that stood out.”

Shari also dismissed rumors of Jeffrey struggling with his sexuality.

“Frankly, I don’t think anybody questioned his sexuality when he was in high school,” she said. “I don’t think that proved to be a problem… At that time, I didn’t sense Jeff was either heterosexual or homosexual. He didn’t display any tendencies because he didn’t date.”

Jeffrey’s alcoholism, however, was quickly worsening. When college didn’t work to help get his life in order, his parents encouraged him to join the army in 1979. However, that effort would become another failure.

“We thought that if he happened to join the army, that would help him out,” said Shari. “He went into the army and we found out later, he had been to Germany, but the army… sensed there was something wrong.

""He ended up with a discharge and it wasn’t what you would call a dishonorable discharge. He just didn’t fit in. The only reason we knew he had been rejected by the army was that his army trunk was sent to the house.”

The special also revealed that for the first time two of his servicemen, Preston Davis and Billy Capshaw, accused Jeffrey of rape and sexual assault.

Shari claimed she attempted to get Jeffrey psychiatric help.

“We wanted to get Jeff help,” she said. “Lionel would drive him down to the building and Jeff would go to the front door and go out the back door.”

Despite his troubled life, Shari said she never suspected Jeffrey was capable of committing such catastrophic horror, as his crimes would unveil. When Jeffrey later lived on his own, she would visit his one-bedroom Milwaukee apartment.

It was the same apartment where police would find stored body parts of his victims. Shari now believes Jeffrey was covering his grisly tracks from her.

“I taught [the] boys how to clean,” she explained. “When I went to Jeff’s apartment, I went through his refrigerator and his bathroom. I pulled back the bathroom’s shower curtain. At that point, his apartment was perfectly clean. Spotless.”

Her world came crashing down when Jeffrey was arrested in 1991 at age 31 after a man with a pair of handcuffs dangling from his wrists escaped from his apartment and told police he tried to kill him.

Jeffrey told detectives his first slaughter took place in 1978, unbeknownst to anyone. The loner admitted he would lure men at bars and take them back to his apartment where he drugged and murdered them.

“[I thought] I wished I could have taken it on myself,” said Shari when she first heard of Jeffrey’s confession. “I wished I could have taken the burden from him, but of course, I couldn’t do that. That was my first true thought. My God, why is this happening to somebody so young who has so much life to give?”

Despite the public scrutiny, Shari and Lionel refused to change their names.

“I didn’t feel ashamed,” she said. “We were not guilty. That’s where it stood. My family and many people said, ‘Why don’t you change your name?’ We didn’t do anything wrong. Why should we change our name? Lionel would tell you that’s his given name from his father… Because we were not involved, we didn’t feel ashamed in that respect.”

They also never missed a day of their son’s trial.

“… I wanted to know what was happening at the time,” said Shari. “We were ostracized. Some of the victim’s families would point at us and talk about us… [But] Lionel also had two childhood friends up there. People either hated us or they accepted us. And these gentlemen accepted us and they helped protect us… There’s nothing in life that prepares one for a personal situation in the courtroom.”

Still, both Shari and Lionel never stopped loving Jeffery.

“You love the sinner, not the sin,” she admitted. “… It’s in the bible… If you look at the first trial pictures, you see Jeff in lousy clothes. Well, Lionel and I got up there and literally took the suit off of Lionel’s back, shoes, shirt and tie and we gave them to Jeff. So that he can go to court looking decent. [But] he knew there was no way we [could] condone what he did.”

Shari would continue her relationship with Jeffrey behind bars until his death. Today, she and her husband live a quiet life in retirement.

“Life goes on,” she said. “We’re no different than anyone else in the world… Nobody bothers us here, nobody picks on us. We’ve been here 17 years and we’re part of the neighborhood, no more, no less.”

After years of learning to cope with the aftermath of Jeff’s crimes, Shari is now hoping her story will encourage parents to develop a dialogue on mental illness and become more proactive in their children’s lives.

“I hope that they do what a parent should do, which is interact with your children,” she said. “Be aware of what they’re doing, not just what they tell you. You have to observe upon yourself. If you’re a parent, don’t just accept things at face value. I’m one who delved into things. I just [didn’t] accept them.”

Four steps to take when deciding if you should let someone who betrayed you back into your life.

FOX's Ashley Papa has more:

Betrayal by a loved one is one of the most painful experiences. If you're thinking of letting someone who betrayed you back into your life, counselor, David Essel says first you must forgive:

""If you don't do this you're going to mistrust them, you're going to look for problems when maybe there aren't any, the other big problem you run into is that if this relationship doesn't work out and you want to move on and you haven't forgiven them you're going to put the next person you date on the cross.""

Step two is to own your role in the dysfunction of the relationship. The third step is to have the betrayer write you an apology letter:

""So in other words if someone says i'm so sorry for cheating on you, i'm so sorry i stole money from you that's not enough. I went them to write down the specific things they did who they did them with and why. See, that means they're sincere about coming back in and earning back your trust.""

Fourth, Essel says if they stole something they must pay you back. If they don't do step three or four- let them go.

On this Veterans Day, the mistreatment of American troops remains a red line that few dare to cross.","I remember when I first heard a Vietnam veteran’s story. I was captivated as he described his desperate attempts to render aid as his dying best friend bled out in front of him. Half a world away and decades later in 2008, the scene was still painful for him to recall. But the most shocking part of the story was his return home.

My heroic friend described having to change out of his uniform before roaming American streets – or else he’d be subject to threats. I was only 15 and I simply couldn’t believe that civilians would spit on, curse and even attack returning veterans. And all this happened on American soil.

Serving in the Army today, my peers and I have a very different experience. When we wear our uniforms in public we get pats on the back, offers to pay for our meals, and warm remarks expressing gratitude for our service. Certainly, much has changed for the better. But sometimes I wonder if things will always be this way.

If anything is clear in American culture, it’s that yesterday’s taboo is today’s status quo. The more we normalize disrespect to the national anthem, applaud pledge of allegiance protests, and entertain discussions about how democratic ideals are somehow inherently flawed – the easier it will be to disrespect the people who are sworn to protect those ideals. In other words, what’s preventing Americans from mistreating service members in the future as a form of protest?

The more we normalize disrespect to the national anthem, applaud pledge of allegiance protests, and entertain discussions about how democratic ideals are somehow inherently flawed – the easier it will be to disrespect the people who are sworn to protect those ideals.

In our polarized country, everything is potential political fodder. Sports, entertainment, holidays, national tragedies – things that once unified us – are now sources of division.

Military service is still one of the few things in our society that both sides of the political spectrum can agree is worthy of respect. Supporting the armed forces is about the last inch of common ground left in America. But how much longer until that ground is under siege by those that who seek to divide us?

To be clear, I’m not calling for Americans to blindly worship the military. As Army veteran David French aptly pointed out in a recent piece in the National Review: “Not everyone in the military is a hero. The mere act of donning a uniform does not make you any better than any other American.”

And I agree with French’s assertion that “loving the troops and supporting the military means holding both accountable.” But military accountability is an entirely different issue from the growing anti-American sentiment percolating through our culture.

Consider a recent poll conducted by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, which found that nearly half of U.S. millennials would rather live under a communist or socialist regime than a democratic country.

Amazingly, one in five Americans in their 20s view Soviet dictator Josef Stalin as a hero, while over 25 percent thought highly of his predecessor Vladimir Lenin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. And an appalling 40 percent believe in restricting some First Amendment freedoms.

“Millennials now make up the largest generation in America, and we’re seeing some deeply worrisome trends,” said Marion Smith, the executive director of the foundation.

Worrisome is an understatement.

More and more citizens fail to understand the importance of democracy and thus can’t see value in patriotism. That leaves them more susceptible than ever to false narratives about what it means to be an American. And even worse, such narratives could easily lead them to more radical forms of protest.

Concerned Americans – Democrats, Republicans and everyone else – should work together to educate our fellow citizens and reverse the flow of ignorant ideas that continue to gain momentum. As Thomas Jefferson cautioned us: “If a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.”

American culture is not far removed, in either time or ideology, from the days when U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines were harassed by their own countrymen when in uniform.

On this Veterans Day, the mistreatment of American troops remains a red line that few dare to cross. But with every new protest, it seems that line gets a little less clear.","Army officer: In a divided country, will it soon become dangerous to wear my uniform in public?",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/10/army-officer-in-divided-country-will-it-soon-become-dangerous-to-wear-my-uniform-in-public.html

In making the announcement, Wallace said, “Harris, Dana and Sandra are rising stars and their combined background and expertise across news, business and politics will enable us to provide a more in-depth look at the major stories breaking out of Washington, and around the country. We are living in unprecedented times and this new lineup ensures our viewers will get the best news, information and analysis on the news of the hour across the nation and around the globe.”

Outnumbered Overtime originally debuted as a web show led by Faulkner following the TV version every day and her new program will seek to harness the popularity of that effort.

Faulkner added, “Three years ago, we enhanced cable news with a show that combines news and opinion, predominantly from the female point of view, and immediately, Outnumbered became the number one show in its timeslot. I am proud of the work we’re continuing to do there, and blessed to have this added opportunity to create a new program that will help inform our viewers and keep them engaged in a conversation surrounding the day’s headlines.”

Smith commented, “There’s no one better in the business than Bill Hemmer and I am honored to kick off the network’s news hours with him, informing our viewers of the biggest stories and issues driving the day.”

Following Outnumbered Overtime, Perino will host The Daily Briefing at 2PM/ET, an hour often dominated by breaking news, White House press briefings, and more from Washington and around the nation. With her understanding of what makes news, how to respond to it and her unique political expertise, Perino will break it all down with insight from key Beltway experts.

Perino remarked, “Our new show will aim to take on the major issues facing Americans and explore them from all angles. I am excited for this opportunity to draw from my political background to help our viewers get beyond the headlines and better understand what is really going on behind the scenes in Washington each day.”

The latest House tax reform proposal eliminates one of the biggest tax breaks in sports, tax-exempt financing for stadiums. In the last 15 years, according to the Brookings Institute, sports teams built 36 stadiums with tax-exempt bonds, costing federal taxpayers almost $4 billion.

“Why should the citizens of Oklahoma be subsidizing that move, or Texas or Nebraska?"" Brookings researcher Ted Gayer asked. ""Under current law, citizens around the country are essentially subsidizing the movement of private sports franchises from one location to another, and there's no economic or, I would say, political or fairness reason to justify that.""

But owners say building new stadiums or renovating old ones promotes economic activity that, in many cases, would not otherwise happen.

""These buildings and facilities are used for a lot more than to house eight football games a year or 41 basketball games,"" said sportscaster Jim Gray. ""There's concerts, there's conventions, there's car shows, all types of activities that go into these stadiums and arenas.""

Currently, the Republican House tax proposal kills the tax-exempt bond subsidy, while the Senate version does not.

Both Congressional chambers do agree on two other proposals affecting college sports. One slaps a 20 percent tax on compensation in excess of $1 million to the five highest paid employees of a tax-exempt organizations, like universities and their elite coaches.

The other provision, called the “seating-rights deduction,” eliminates an 80 percent tax break on donations to athletic departments wealthy boosters use to buy season tickets. Critics say the tax subsidy clearly favors the rich and contributes to an excessive emphasis on college athletics.

Others feel it will hurt non-revenue sports, like rugby and rowing.

""I think it's going to end up having unintended consequences which are going to hurt universities and students,"" Gray said.

The Oakland Raiders' bid to build a 65,000-seat stadium includes a $750 million public contribution financed through tax-exempt bonds. Without those tax-free dollars, either the city or team will likely have to come up with more cash. And investors will have to pay taxes on the bonds' interest.

The Xuereb family had to make the difficult decision to put down their 13-year-old companion to stop his suffering.","Few things can mend a broken heart or a troubled mind.

But for James Xuereb the answer seems to always be the same: a loving dog.

A video of James receiving a Bichon Frise as an early birthday gift has gone viral and touched the hearts of many.

In the video, you see his daughter Jaleen handing him a card as he sits unwittingly on the couch.

The photo on the card is almost a dead giveaway -- a photo of a Bichon. But what's written inside and the story behind it brings the 52-year-old man to a heartfelt cry.

It read: ""Hi, my name is Lumo and I am a boy Bichon. No, I am not Nemo, nor could I ever be Lucy, but my mommy brought me to bring you some happiness back into your life. So, as we walk in this journey of life together, may we create our own wonderful memories and reclaim the beautiful memories that you had with Nemo and Lucy. Love, Lumo.""

What elicited such a strong emotion?

More than 13 years ago, James was going through a state of depression. Nothing would cheer him up. That's when, according to Jaleen, his wife Wanda brought him home Nemo, a Bichon Frise puppy. James instantly fell in love.

""He had an attachment to him. He leaned on him for anything and everything,"" says Jaleen of their relationship.

To James, Nemo was another one of his kids. His best friend.

After two years, the family decided Nemo needed company, so they brought home Lucy, another Bichon.

Both dogs, as is common with small breeds, suffered from a congenital heart defect.

Sadly, in late August, Lucy, 11, suffered a cardiac arrest that took her life. Two weeks later, things went from bad to worse.

Nemo's health was deteriorating. His lungs were filled with liquid and he had a hard time breathing. The Xuereb family had to make the difficult decision to put down their 13-year-old companion to stop his suffering.

""My dad was on edge,"" Jaleen recalls. ""He didn't want to talk about [Lucy and Nemo]. He would leave the room if we did. Or he would start crying.""

Meantime, the family put up photos and contemplated ways to make Xuereb feel better.

So Wanda decided it may be time for a new dog. She researched breeders, and found Fern Klapman-Flett's Bichon Lovers in Simcoe, Ontario.

In October, Wanda, and her daughters Jaleen and Jade, went to the breeder to meet a new litter.

""We went back in November to make our pick,"" Jaleen said. ""When we walked through the door, one came up to us and kept pulling on my mom's pants.""

It was number 25, and he kept coming to them and tugging at them.

""That's how we knew.""

Next came the card, the heartfelt cry, and tiny Lumo.

Lumo's name is a testament to the family's fallen -- L-U for Lucy, M-O for Nemo -- the two whose deaths were too much to bear.

But thanks to Lumo, James can finally talk about Lucy and Nemo and smile.

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

The bag — or dress — is also printed with the phrases “free pickup and delivery,” “quality and professionalism,” and “we (heart) our customers.”

Browns also recommends pairing the frock with pumps, chandelier earrings, and an whole other dress underneath, seeing as it’s see-through and all.

Raisman, who captained the 2012 and 2016 Olympic gold medal-winning teams, detailed in an upcoming book the abuse she said she suffered at the hands of disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. The 23-year-old's book, “Fierce,” is set to be released Nov. 14.

Raisman spoke to CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview slated to air Sunday regarding the alleged sex abuse she endured from the doctor who spent more than two decades working with top athletes at USA Gymnastics.

Nassar is currently in jail in Michigan awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to possession of child pornography. Nassar, who was also a sports medicine specialist at Michigan State, is awaiting trial on charges in three separate cases alleging he sexually molested a total of nine girls, including eight who were gymnasts seeking treatment for injuries.

MCKAYLA MARONEY, OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST, SAYS DOCTOR MOLESTED HER

Nassar has since had his medical license revoked and is being sued by more than 100 people who have made similar charges against him.

Raisman told “60 Minutes” she spoke with the FBI regarding Nassar after the 2016 Rio Olympics.

The six-time Olympic medal winner, who has won three gold medals, said she was angry when people asked why she didn't come forward about Nassar sooner.

“Why are we looking at why didn't the girls speak up? Why not look at 'what about the culture?' What did USA Gymnastics do, and Larry Nassar do, to manipulate these girls so much that they are so afraid to speak up?” Raisman told “60 Minutes.”

She added: “I am angry. I'm really upset because it's been -- I care a lot you know, when I see these young girls that come up to me, and they ask for pictures or autographs, whatever it is, I just, I can't. Every time I look at them, every time I see them smiling, I just think, I just want to create change so that they never, ever have to go through this.""

Raisman is only the most-recent high-profile gymnast to say she was abused by Nassar. Last month, Olympic gold medalist Maroney said she was molested by Nassar for years.

AARON HERNANDEZ’S BRAIN SUFFERED SEVERE CTE, RESEARCHER SAYS

“I was molested by Dr. Larry Nassar, the team doctor for the US for the U.S. Women’s National Gymnastics Team, and Olympic Team,"" Maroney wrote on Twitter. ""Dr. Nassar told me that I was receiving ‘medically necessary treatment that he had been performing on patients for over 30 years.’ It started when I was 13 years old, at one of my first National Team training camps, in Texas, and it didn’t end until I left the sport.”

Raisman has demanded USA Gymnastics chang its policies following the allegations against Nassar. USA Gymnastics ordered a review last fall and said it adopted a “safe sport policy that requires mandatory reporting of suspicions of sexual abuse and also sets standards to prevent inappropriate interaction between athletes and adults,” CBS News reported.

""USA Gymnastics is very sorry that any athlete has been harmed,"" the organization told “60 Minutes” in a statement. “We want to work with Aly and all interested athletes to keep athletes safe.""

The Telegraph, who referred to the man’s actions as a “mutiny,” reports that 53-year-old Alain Jan and his wife boarded a Costa cruise bound for the Vanilla Islands of the Indian Ocean on Oct. 26. After two days of travel, however, the captain announced that three scheduled stops in Madagascar had been canceled due to an outbreak of the bubonic and pneumonic plague on the island nation.

""We said OK, it's for health reasons,” Jan told Le Parisen, reasoning that there were other stops planned for other cities in Madagascar, as well as a stop in Mauritius.

VIRGIN VOYAGES TO LAUNCH ADULTS-ONLY CRUISE EXPERIENCE IN 2020

The next day, those stops were canceled as well. But as a consolation, passengers were told they’d be credited with 150 euro, or around $175, to spend aboard the ship.

Angered by the news — and reasoning that even a beverage aboard the ship could cost upwards of $5 — Jan rallied his fellow passengers in a protest at one of the ship’s restaurants. ""There were 60 of us banging our fists on the table to alert other cruise passengers to this con job,"" said Jan, who reasoned that the cruise liner must have known that they couldn’t stop in Madagascar or Mauritius before the trip started, but deliberately failed to notify passengers before the voyage.

The passengers staged another protest later that evening, forcing the captain to call the authorities in the Seychelles. According to Jan, a police chief boarded the ship, listened to both men’s version of events, and ultimately escorted Jan and his wife off the cruise liner at the captain’s request.

Jan, however, finally got the stop-off he was hoping for.

He further claims that upon returning home — Jan lives on the island of Reunion — he met with other passengers from the cruise, who agreed that they were treated “like cattle” and “ripped off,” the Telegraph reports.

Meanwhile, Costa Cruises maintains that they “made every effort” to keep to their schedule, but were unable to do so due to health concerns, according to a statement obtained by the Telegraph. The company added that authorities on Mauritius were the ones who insisted that passengers stay quarantined on the ship.

""Given the delays that would have created, and even longer ones if there were any suspect cases on board, and considering that passengers were already on board, the company was forced to restrict its trip to the Seychelles and Reunion,"" said the statement.

Gen. George S. Patton was one of the most fascinating military figures to dominate the last century. Quite simply, he was a genius for war.

But at 11:45 on the morning of December 9, 1945, Gen. Patton was en route to a pheasant hunt near Mannheim, Germany, when his Cadillac staff car suddenly collided with a two-and-a-half ton U.S. Army truck. Twelve days later, the four-star general -- who had triumphed against Hitler's best from North Africa to Europe -- was dead. The Army concluded it was merely a traffic accident, but others believe it was an assassination attempt.

On VE Day May 8, 1945, American GIs were ready to return home. But George Patton wanted to keep fighting. The always-outspoken general was vocal about who his new enemy was: the Russians. Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower disagreed, and so did many others in Washington.

In this episode of ""War Stories Investigates with Oliver North,"" we'll explore the rumors, myths and conspiracy theories surrounding Patton's mysterious accident and death. We will also explore the highlights of his military career with members of his family.

Patton had planned to leave Germany and return home and retire. Strangely, he was the only one injured in the crash. The official Army accident report is still missing. You'll hear a firsthand account from Patton's driver that day, PFC Horace Woodring. You'll also hear from military author Robert Wilcox, who claims that the accident was staged by American and Russian intelligence and says he knows who killed Patton. And meet nurse Lt.

In a moment of transparency, the Yale-educated lawyer said that the public smearing he received during his tenure as the Green Energy Czar “felt like someone ripped off [his] face and put it on someone else’s body.” He said he didn’t recognize the person they were describing in press accounts.

Conservatives had little to no sympathy for him or others, but recent events have hopefully shed a different light on the matter.

Confirmation hearings are becoming something of a blood sport when the nominees are people who adhere to orthodox Christian views on abortion and matters of sexual identity.

First, there was Russell Vought, President Trump’s nominee for Deputy Director of Office of Management and Budget. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ questioned his Christian faith and belief in the centrality of Jesus Christ for salvation, suggesting basically that his belief makes him unfit for office. Then there was “the Dogma lives loudly within you” remark to Judge Amy Coney Barrett by Sen. Diane Feinstein denigrating the Notre Dame Law Professor and mother of seven’s Catholic faith. The senator’s outrage was based on an article that basically said the opposite of what was charged.

What is happening? Not since the JFK days has there been such hostility to faith. Sadly, back then it was from Protestants, but this is a new, equally insidious version from the left.

The final awakening on this issue came to Concerned Women for America due to Washington rumors of my “imminent” appointment to the office of Ambassador-At-Large for the Office of Global Women’s Issues. This is a position that was created by Secretary Hillary Clinton to assist with the advancement of women’s equality and the empowerment of women and girls around the world.

The ensuing outrage from the left was eye-opening. At the mere hint of the idea that a pro-life, conservative woman could be in the running opened up a flood of hostile and, in many cases, false or misleading articles written by leftist media.

Suddenly, the idea of “fake news” took on new meaning. Left-of-center reporters mostly relied on an opposition research dossier which quotes formerly-affiliated employees from CWA — much of which was dated years before my tenure — accepted without checking false statements by abortion activists, or, worse yet, isolated quotes out of context, much like in the case of Judge Barrett.

Just to name a few:

They claim we oppose birth control, when in truth CWA, and I personally, like the majority of Evangelical women, draw a bright line between birth control and abortion. We have never taken a position against it, but we do support the rights of conscience of women like the Little Sisters of the Poor. The Left, however, wishes to force everyone, even nuns who take a vow of celibacy and poverty, to fund abortion and abortion-inducing drugs. Their lack of tolerance for women of faith is shocking.

They claim that we never support rape-and-incest exceptions; this is one in which they twisted a theological piece that I wrote for the Christian Post. The truth is that every child is innocent. I value every child and her mother and addressed in that piece that abortion harms the woman as well as her child. I believe women deserve better, and as the church, we must offer them better options.

As the survivor of an assault and attempted rape, I know that this issue is deeply painful and complicated, and suffering women deserve our help and grace.

I believe that abortion is the most cynical answer to the plight of women, but the left sees it as the first and best response.

The story of women who regret their abortions is prevalent. Pro-life Americans offer love and hope to women every day in pregnancy help centers, through adoption and through material help. Regardless, in the very piece they criticized, I end by saying, “Regardless of her choice, we must pray for her!”

As a practical matter, every federal legislative effort and most state bills endorsed by CWA contain rape and incest exceptions. I also addressed this in my book, if people had bothered to look.

“ … I should add however that I have and do support legislation that contains a rape-incest exception if it is essential to protect the vast majority of babies. Public policy is downstream of public opinion, and we still have work to do.” (Feisty and Feminine, 89)

They falsely claim we support the criminalization of homosexuality or transgenderism, when in truth, I have never believed it and said the opposite specifically in my book. We can disagree on matters of policy for our military or our schools, but we are called to love our neighbor, and that includes our LGBTQ neighbors.

“Condemning unkindness is not a religious or political stance; it is a human one, and our message transcends those divisions. This means that we condemn liberal attacks against Christian and conservative views; but it also means that we must take a stand against nastiness toward gay people or any group for that matter. We absolutely must condemn countries operating under sharia law where homosexuality is a crime punishable by death. In Nigeria in early 2015, fourteen men were dragged from their beds and attacked by men with clubs and iron bars who said they wanted to ‘cleanse’ their neighborhood of gay people. And who could forget the video of ISIS pushing a gay man off of a roof to his death in Mosul, Iraq? We have to speak out against these kinds of atrocities, and against governments that condone them. Violence of any kind has no place among those who seek peace, and as followers of Christ, it is our duty to stand up against this kind of injustice. We need to condemn violence abroad as well as here in the United States. But even short of violence, we need to consider whether we do what’s right when people say something unkind about gay or transgender people and those who don’t share our opinions or lifestyles. Because here’s the problem: people practicing these lifestyles can’t hear our words of love and hope when we are allowing other people to define us.” (From my book ""Feisty & Feminine,"" Page 70)

They claim that CWA and I oppose the Violence Against Women Act when in truth we have criticized its efficacy. We suggested that there needs to be better oversight ending the waste and fraud by grantees and instead that the federal offer block grants to the states in order to address what even supporters admit is too broad to be effective. (From my book ""Feisty & Feminine,"" Page 44)

The left is fine with spending $400 million per year on programs that aren’t doing enough to protect women. Just because the bill is named well doesn’t mean it is stopping domestic violence. Again, women deserve better.

They claim that I do not support anti-bullying efforts against children who identify as LGBTQ. That is 100 percent false.

In the piece that sparked the hatred, I said, “I despise children being bullied for being ‘gay’ just as much as for being obese or for being from another country or simply being different or for whatever reason. How about we teach our kids, ‘Be ye kind one to another.’”

In my book, I went further. While I absolutely support an end to any and all forms of bullying, I can't help but notice how ironic it is that conservative Christian kids in our school system are bullied for their own beliefs. What are our schools doing to protect them? (""Feisty & Feminine,"" 56)

And just to be clear (despite this being the height of silliness), I don’t hate ""Frozen.""

Interestingly, reporters conveniently left out all of my lifelong work caring for “the least of these” on issues like fighting sex trafficking and fighting for cleaning up the horrible backlog of testing for rape kits (""Feisty & Feminine,"" Page 46-48).

I also worked with others to successfully pass into law the Second Chance Act (Public Law 110-199), which tears down barriers for prisoners reentering society. As a member of Right on Crime, I am working for restorative justice reform, including the use of drug and youth courts and access to mental health care.

But let’s be honest, it does not matter what I say or what I believe. The left must twist my words, because at the end of the day, a pro-life woman with an orthodox Christian worldview is unacceptable to them.

It is becoming a common theme in confirmation hearings. Both the Republicans and Democrats are guilty of demagoguery as Van Jones suggested, and it needs to stop.

Now, to address the rumor of an appointment to the Trump administration: The honest answer is that there is great appeal to the idea of working for President Trump and the opportunity to work on behalf of women around the globe.

It is my hope that under President Trump the Office of Global Women’s Issues will stand for the rights of women to seek fulfillment of their basic needs, to feed and clothe themselves and their children, to fully participate in society, and to be defended against human rights abuses such as violence, killing, discrimination, and false imprisonment. As full participants in society, women should have the agency to pursue education and economic livelihood and to vote or run for office.

There is clearly work to be done. American conservatives often view the world through the lens of our own experience, forgetting that there are millions of women and girls around the world denied basic human rights and treated by their government or culture as literally second class citizens facing discrimination at every turn.

I would be honored to serve my nation and President Trump; however, I do not feel God is leading me to leave Concerned Women for America at this time. We have important work to do and are in a season of amazing growth. Most importantly, I have about 18 months left before my last child goes off to college.

In Washington, ones family is often used as an excuse, but I can assure I am sincere. My husband and I, like most parents, have subjugated our own desires in many ways to do our best to parent.

I do not believe that it would be right for me or for him to travel the world during this season of our lives. Others may be able to do so with aplomb, but we cannot.

There may be a time at which President Trump or some other president will call upon me to serve my country within his or her administration at a later season.

One of the few upsides to the kneeling controversy engulfing the NFL is that it’s reinforced the notion that there are few things in this country more sacred than the lives of our military men and women. Public support for and confidence in the military remains astronomically high, buoyed by the enormous respect most Americans have for those who serve in uniform.

Why, then, do we continue to look away from one of the most disturbing catastrophes befalling our military heroes? It’s estimated that about 22 veterans die from suicide per day. That’s nearly one per hour, a rate far above the average among the general public. The physical, emotional and spiritual brokenness giving rise to the suicide epidemic is destroying lives, families and tearing at the public institution we honor most.

“He looked at a woman standing next to me, ten years my senior, pointed to me and said: ‘You should f--k her to make her realize she’s gay.’ He was the film’s director, Brett Ratner.”

Jones is threatening to sue the league, arguing its compensation committee, headed by Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, misled NFL owners about negotiations on Goodell’s contract, ESPN reported. He wants the NFL to allow all 32 owners to vote on the final contract, not just the committee’s six members.

Jones is also one of multiple NFL owners who purportedly insisted that Goodell’s next deal feature performance-based pay tied to Goodell’s ability to address major business issues – a concept that reportedly infuriated Goodell. The Cowboys owner explained his stance in an interview with the 105.3 The Fan radio station in Dallas.

“We all see how impactful a commissioner's decision can be in many areas. We've given him a lot of power. I think we need the checks and balances of ownership having to actually be in a position to not just suggest but approve of his decisions. So that's what this is about,” Jones said.

The NFL has experienced unprecedented financial success under Goodell, with roughly $14 billion in annual revenue as of 2017. Goodell has earned more than $200 million since he assumed the role of commissioner in 2006. Under the proposed terms of Goodell’s new contract, he would remain commissioner through 2024.

However, Goodell has also presided over several widely-criticized controversies, including the NFL’s handling of national anthem protests, domestic violence and concussion scandals, polarizing relocations of multiple NFL franchises to new markets, the lengthy “Deflategate” dispute with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and declining television ratings.

Aside from concerns related to those business challenges, Jones has publicly challenged Goodell in recent days over the league’s handling of Cowboys star Ezekiel Elliott’s six-game suspension for alleged domestic violence, after a year-long investigation. Jones has argued that Elliott, who was never arrested or charged with a crime, has been treated unfairly throughout the disciplinary process.

""I'd like to completely take this commissioner's name out of my response,"" Jones said. ""To a large degree, it's not about Roger Goodell. It's about the power of the commissioner as it relates to ownership. To the extent that the ownership hires him, extends him, pays him on an ongoing basis, the ownership should have first-hand approval. Each owner should approve that.”

NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart said this week that the league is aware of Jones’ legal threat, but has not been informed of a formal filing of any suit. Lockhart also referred to ESPN’s report that Goodell was “furious” about the negotiations as “nonsense” and described the talks as “amicable.”

The NFL’s 32 owners, including Jones, voted unanimously in May to empower the compensation committee to pursue a contract extension with Goodell. The committee is composed of Blank, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, Bob McNair of the Houston Texans, John Mara of the New York Giants, Clark Hunt of the Kansas City Chiefs and Art Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

In objecting to Goodell’s extension as currently constructed, ESPN reports that Jones says owners were not adequately informed about certain elements of the deal, including a plan for discretionary bonuses. Jones is arguing that the final deal should be subject to a vote by all 32 owners.

“I don’t think this will go to court,” former NFL head coach Sam Wyche, a friend of Jones, told FOX Business Network’s Stuart Varney on Friday. “This may be one of those ways of him working into a negotiating position where he can get that three-fourths of a vote for either extensions or increases in salary. What Jerry Jones keeps saying is he wants [a] performance-based contract – in other words, do a better job.”","NFL commissioner contract dispute with Jerry Jones, explained",http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/11/10/nfl-commissioner-contract-dispute-with-jerry-jones-explained.html

The New York Post reports the Metropolitan Transit Authority has ordered all subway personnel to refrain from addressing riders as “ladies and gentlemen.”

Instead, staffers have been told they must use gender neutral words like riders, passengers, and everyone according to a memorandum obtained exclusively by the Post.

“Please don’t use any greeting other than these,” the memo reads.

Subway workers say political correctness has derailed the nation’s largest subway system.

“They are trying to be politically correct,” one worker told the Post. “They are acknowledging that they have some transgender riders. They don’t want to offend anyone.”

An MTA spokesperson told the Post that gender issues were a consideration for the move.

I suspect it was a preemptive strike by the MTA to avoid some sort of legal action taken by the LGBTQI and the letter A community.

Heaven help the poor cis-gender train conductor who inadvertently mis-genders a gender-fluid passenger.

Gender fluidity, by the way, is the latest fad in the sex and gender revolution. Followers ascribe to a belief that there’s really no such thing as male or female.

For example, you could be a male passenger on the B Train at 34th Street-Herald Square, but you could identify as a female passenger by the time you reach Rockefeller Center.

I know, it’s all very confusing, ladies and gentlemen (my apologies).

Lord only knows what the next stop is going to be on this gender-bender train ride into gender inclusivity. I wonder if they’d be okay if the conductors just hollered out, “You people”?",'Ladies and gentlemen' no longer welcome on NYC subways,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/10/ladies-and-gentlemen-no-longer-welcome-on-nyc-subways.html

According to the Congressional Research Service, there has been 66 mass shootings in the U.S. between 1999 and 2013, tragedies that left 547 innocent people dead.

In the most recent shooting at a rural Texas church, shooter Devin Patrick Kelley gunned down 26 worshipers. New reports have uncovered a man with a troubled past. A 2012 police report described how Kelley escaped from a psychiatric hospital while in the Air Force and was caught trying to sneak guns onto an Air Force base “attempting to carry out death threats” against his superiors there.

But what drives people like Kelley to kill strangers wholesale in a seemingly senseless way?

“Very often mass shooters are injustice collectors and they’re angry at the masses, so there’s that component where everybody doesn’t have a right to live because the mass shooter is angry at ‘others’ in general,” psychotherapist, Dr. Robi Ludwig told Fox News. “And then there’s this feeling of just intense rage where killing one person is not enough.”

Psychologist Dr. Katherine Smerling said these types of murderers often feel victimized by the world and rejected about past humiliations.

“They feel like outsiders looking in instead of part of the world around them. They are grieved and possess a sense of extreme entitlement, seeking power, revenge or both,” Smerling told Fox News.

AARON HERNANDEZ'S BRAIN SUFFERED SEVERE CTE, RESEARCHER SAYS

Another area experts have looked into is the connection between mass murderers and violence toward women.

Several mass shooters share Kelley’s record of domestic violence. Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people in 2016 at the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando had an abusive relationship with his ex-wife, who said he frequently beat her. And Esteban Santiago, who killed 5 people at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, had a history of domestic violence, which included two accusations that he had choked his then-girlfriend.

Ludwig who wrote, “Till Death Do Us Part: Love, Marriage and the Mind of the Killer Spouse,” agreed that mass shooters tend to have roots in domestic violence.

“There appears to be a connection between domestic abusers and mass shooters, which is a fairly new idea. But we should really begin to look at domestic abusers in a slightly different way,” she said.

According to an analysis by Everytown for Gun Safety, 54 percent of mass shootings between 2009 and 2016 involved domestic or family violence.

Many physicians believe mental illnesses don’t appear “out of blue,” that there are warning signs to watch out for. Ludwig and Sterling said learning these signs could lead to early intervention.

The reason for this may lie in the circadian rhythms of the skin cells, which, like nearly all cells in the body, operate on a 24-hour cycle and go into a bit of a lull at night.
Actin is a protein that forms an important part of the cytoskeleton — the supportive structure that gives the cell its shape.
In a later experiment in the study, the researchers observed the same effect in the skin of mice.
The researchers originally expected the fibroblasts to make up for lost ground during the day, but that doesn't happen, Hoyle said.","Be careful of things that go bump in the night, especially if those bumps lead to skin injuries: A new study from England finds that skin injuries that happen at night heal more slowly than those that take place during the day.

Nighttime skin injuries heal about 60 percent slower than daytime skin injuries, according to the study, published today (Nov. 8) in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

The reason for this may lie in the circadian rhythms of the skin cells, which, like nearly all cells in the body, operate on a 24-hour cycle and go into a bit of a lull at night. But the researchers were even more surprised that not only does the healing process slow down at night, but also that the time of the injury completely determines how fast the injury will heal.

""What we found is that how well you can heal depends on the time when you got injured,"" said lead study author Ned Hoyle, a molecular biology researcher at Cambridge University in the U.K. ""The speed of the healing depends on how fast certain cells can get to the wounded area in order to repair it, and that depends on their micro-architecture, which is controlled by the biological clock.""

To study the timing of wound healing, the researchers first looked at skin cells called fibroblasts that were grown in lab dishes over the course of several days, Hoyle told Live Science. These cells are found in the deepest layer of the skin, called the dermis. When an injury occurs, the fibroblasts travel up to the surface, where they're tasked with synthesizing and building the structural support of the new skin, which includes the so-called extracellular matrix and collagen.

But depending on the time of day, the speed at which the fibroblasts move up to the skin's surface varies, thanks to a protein found in the cells called actin, the researchers found.

Actin is a protein that forms an important part of the cytoskeleton — the supportive structure that gives the cell its shape. When the cells are told by their biological clock to ""sleep,"" the shape of the actin proteins changes.

""We found that during daytime, the actin has mostly the form of long filaments, while at night, the majority of it is in a globular form,"" Hoyle said. ""We know that the actin filaments are very important in allowing cells to move.""

As a result of these changes, the fibroblasts travel to the site of the injury more slowly at night, when the actin is mostly spherical.

In a later experiment in the study, the researchers observed the same effect in the skin of mice.

And when the team looked at medical records of human patients recovering from burns, they found evidence of exactly the same phenomenon: ""Wounds incurred during the day were, on average, healed in 17 days compared to the healing times of wounds incurred at night, which was 28 days,"" Hoyle said.

It's still not clear exactly why the nighttime wounds take longer to heal, however. The researchers originally expected the fibroblasts to make up for lost ground during the day, but that doesn't happen, Hoyle said.

""This is one of the most surprising results,"" Hoyle said. ""What we see is a persistent 'time of wounding' effect. The cells wounded during the nighttime never catch up.""

Hoyle said the finding could perhaps be used in the future to develop a technique to trick cells into thinking it's daytime, in case a procedure needs to be performed at night. Such interferences are technically possible, he added.

In addition, Hoyle said that he hopes to study the healing processes further, as they are extremely complex and involve many other cells and proteins beyond fibroblasts and actin.

The news comes after the New York premiere of the controversial film was canceled due to ""unexpected circumstances,"" The Hollywood Reporter revealed, shortly before The New York Times released an article in which five women accused the comedian of being sexually inappropriate with them.

Comedians Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov told the Times C.K. exposed himself to them in a Chicago hotel room in 2002. Abby Schachner shared a similarly disturbing story with the newspaper, telling the Times she heard C.K. masturbating on the phone when she spoke to him in 2003.

Comedian Rebecca Corry said C.K. was inappropriate with her as well.

""He leaned close to my face and said, ‘Can I ask you something?’ I said, ‘Yes,’” she told the Times. “He asked if we could go to my dressing room so he could masturbate in front of me.”

Corry rejected him. A fifth woman, who spoke anonymously, said C.K. repeatedly asked to masturbate in front of her.

A rep for the 50-year-old ""Louie"" star told the newspaper, “Louis is not going to answer any questions.""

FX, the network that aired his TV show, responded: “We are obviously very troubled by the allegations about Louis C.K. published in The New York Times today.

Since 2007, the federal government has instituted various programs to reach at-risk soldiers, including ramped-up efforts on mental health screening and treatment. But the government being the government, it has failed our veterans in the most unconscionable ways and promised reforms have been painfully and inexcusably slow.

Into the breach have stepped private organizations which are doing what the government can’t---or won’t.

Earlier this month, I had the privilege of visiting with a group unique in the way it approaches healing some of our most vulnerable military veterans. Operation Restored Warrior (ORW) was founded in 2008 by Chief Master Sergeant Paul Lavelle, USAF (Ret), a former atheist who saw one big thing missing from the mission to help hurting vets: God.

Lavelle, who says he was called by Jesus to serve his fellow warriors, launched ORW literally on a shoestring and a prayer. Along with a few other dedicated veterans, he designed a program aimed at rescuing, rebuilding and restoring the soul, spirit and heart. He and his team save vets one by one, through faith.

In its nine years, ORW has saved approximately 800 lives, demonstrating that though it is small, it is mighty. And unlike top-heavy organizations, the lean ORW dedicates a whopping 93 percent of its donations to its restorative faith-based programs.

While ORW welcomes all faiths, it’s organized around five-day Jesus-focused immersion programs. These former and active duty soldiers don’t call these sessions “retreats”, because the U.S. military doesn’t retreat. They call them “drop zones”---combat terminology to describe a course they say is a spiritual “counterattack”---that usually take place in beautiful, remote mountain areas in Colorado, California and Virginia.

The “drop zones” are powerful programs led by specially trained facilitators---military veterans all---designed to build up the faith of those who have lost their way. They involve intensive spiritual intervention, prayer, and often brutally honest self-examination, with Jesus at the center. In this truly safe space, surrounded by fellow warriors who have gone through or are going through similar crises, they feel secure to open up, confide, experience catharsis—and heal.

It isn’t all super-intense programming. There is free time built into each day for activities such as fly-fishing, horseback riding, zip-lining or rest. Lavelle says these respites are also critical to aiding their spiritual restoration.

The bonds these men build with each other are astonishing, unbreakable. They lean on each other as they learn to lean once again on God. It’s profound to behold, never mind to experience.

Lavelle next wants to tailor a program specifically for female veterans and other women who may need this kind of healing as much as the men in their lives do.

In my few days with ORW, I saw God working in the hearts of these soldiers, many of whom had come to the program feeling irretrievably broken. After experiencing their “drop zone” and attending a reunion weekend (and some want or need multiple visits), they report moving out of darkness into light, forgiving others and themselves more easily, and enjoying a stronger faith.

The film “Hacksaw Ridge” recounts the true story of Cpl. Desmond Doss, a devout Seventh-day Adventist who refused to carry a weapon and yet rescued 75 wounded soldiers during the Battle of Okinawa. Dodging relentless enemy fire, he repeated a simple prayer: “Let me save just one more.”

That’s become the guiding principle of ORW, and under Lavelle’s leadership and the guidance of his extraordinary team, they are doing just that.

However, the 49-year-old star admitted she wasn't always met with acceptance when she tried to speak out. When she was a child, Judd faced an unwanted encounter with another man.

“I was sexually abused the first time [when] I was in the second grade and I’m teller. Ha, Harvey knows that,” the actress revealed at the 11th Annual HOPE Luncheon Seminar Wednesday at New York’s Plaza Hotel. Judd was honored with the 2017 HOPE Award for Depression Advocacy by the Hope for Depression Research Foundation.

“I went straight to some adults and I said, you know, this just happened, this guy molested me and the adults said, ‘Oh, that’s not what he meant, he’s a nice old guy,’” she shared.

Judd said being sexually abused as a child contributed to her private battle with depression.

“For me [depression is] like being down in a well, being down in the deep dark well and I just can’t get up,” she explained. “And I’m talking, and it’s just absurd to think that I could talk back to you. You know, I can’t hear you, you can’t hear me. It’s complete and total isolation...”

In 2006, People Magazine reported Judd underwent a 47-day program at a Texas treatment center for depression.

“I was in so much pain that the pain of being willing to change was finally less than the pain of staying the same,” she admitted. “And I had so much shame about what I had been through as a kid because it was my fault right? I was the burden, I was the abandoned one. That I was choked on my own shame, I couldn’t even talk about my shame.”

In 2011, Judd released a memoir titled “All That Is Bitter and Sweet” where she claimed to have been the victim of incest. Judd also wrote she endured traumatic experiences at the hands of her mother Naomi Judd’s romantic partners.

Judd is hoping coming forward with her depression will encourage others to seek help.

Every American should take a moment to appreciate and honor the service and sacrifice of all who have served in the U.S. military. We owe them more than we can repay.

Throughout American history, approximately 45 million Americans have served in our armed forces during times of war, along with additional millions who served in peacetime. Since 1775 close to 1.4 million members of the military have died in our wars and military actions.

The Census Bureau reports there are currently about 20 million U.S. military veterans living in the United States out of a population of 326 million.

My military service began on Dec. 2, 1972 and I had the honor and privilege of wearing the Navy uniform for over 32 years. Now I am proud to call myself a military veteran.

You cannot know what it’s like to serve in our military unless you have experienced it. To gain an idea of the sacrifice involved, I would urge everyone to visit the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. The memorial lists the names of the 58,307 American armed services members who lost their lives in that war.

It is difficult to contemplate 58,307. It may resonate as nothing more than a number, a historical figure, a battlefield statistic, but when you walk that wall, touch the names, find a shipmate, friend or family member and reflect on the enormity of that wall it has a significant impact.

The number 58,307 takes on real meaning when tied to a name – and every name on that wall was someone’s son, daughter, father, husband, wife, brother, sister or friend. Imagine the grieving when the death announcement was delivered to loved ones.

The Vietnam War was a defining period for those of my generation. I encourage you to visit the memorial. It will have an emotional impact and make you appreciate Veterans Day, patriotism, and putting service above self and sacrifice for country.

In my tenure in the Navy from the Vietnam War to the Gulf War, one of the most significant changes was ending the draft and going to an all-volunteer military. The bar has been raised for entrance and recruits today are remarkably impressive and need to operate more technologically advanced equipment.

Today’s military represents the finest, best-trained, best-educated, highly motivated and professional soldier, sailor, airman and Marine ever.

Despite two wars, multiple deployments and conflicts elsewhere, our service members want to be there and continue to serve valiantly. They serve because of a sense of duty, honor and patriotism. Other family members have served before them and they see it as their turn. Their country called and they answered.

There is a downside to not having a draft. In the 1960s, families watched Vietnam War reports on the TV network news and read about the war in their newspapers.

Parents worried about their children going to war. Most knew someone who was serving or had served in Vietnam. The general population was engaged.

The draft brought people from all parts of society into the military. Today less than 1 percent of the population serves and the military has become more of a culture with commonality among those serving.

I would not trade our volunteer system, but how many people going about their daily lives have given a thought on any one of the almost 5,900 days or 16 years that members of our military have been fighting in Afghanistan? Or to those fighting in Iraq and elsewhere around the globe?

How many know someone serving in our military today?

The point is the war is distant to most of us because it does not include a close family member. It opens the question of whether we would still be at war today if there was a draft.

My civilian friends talk about the economy, sports, business and politics. My military friends talk about deployment, the last one, the next one, the family separation.

My military friends talk about the 4,526 lost in Iraq and 2,403 lost in Afghanistan because they lost friends and family. Multiply that 10 times for the wounded. The Army bore the brunt of casualties, but it should not be overlooked that more than 11 percent were members of the National Guard and Reserve.

A most difficult and unprepared experience for me was visiting wounded and their parents in Bethesda Naval Hospital. Their resilient spirit of wanting to rejoin their units was unbelievably inspirational. What motivates them? They serve because of a sense of duty, of honor, of courage and because of their loyalty to each other.

What is most precious to us is our children. If we engage militarily we must do so judiciously, with purpose and a “will to win.” We can never let their sacrifice be meaningless.

Five years is recommended, but 10 years may be betterAfter breast cancer treatment, most women who take tamoxifen take it for five years.
But many women who take tamoxifen are perimenopausal, and a recent study found that some women mistake naturally occurring symptoms of menopause with side effects of tamoxifen.","In last week’s issue of People, former Victoria’s Secret model Jill Goodacre opens up about her five-year battle with breast cancer and the medication she’s been on to keep the disease at bay. Goodacre, who’s married to singer and actor Harry Connick Jr., went through surgery and radiation in 2012 after a tumor was detected via sonogram, and has taken the drug tamoxifen ever since.

As she approaches her five-year cancer-free mark, Goodacre says she’s looking forward to stopping tamoxifen. The medication can cause side effects, including weight gain, which Goodacre admits she’s struggled with.

“I’ve always been a pretty fit person, and so to be just rounder and heavier and not to really be able to do much about it—that’s been hard,” she told People. “It’s taken a lot out of my self-confidence.”

That’s a common problem among breast cancer survivors, said Nikita Shah, MD, medical director of the Cancer Risk Evaluation Program at Orlando Health UF Health Cancer Center. (Shah has not treated Goodacre, but does prescribe tamoxifen to many of her own patients.)

Still, tamoxifen can be lifesaving, said Shah, and for many women, its benefits outweigh its potential side effects. Here’s what else breast cancer patients and their loved ones should know about the pros and cons of this treatment.

It can be a treatment or a prevention

Tamoxifen is in a class of drugs known as selective estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs. These drugs work by attaching to estrogen receptors in breast cells, blocking estrogen’s ability to cause cell mutations that lead to cancer.

The drug—taken as a pill or a liquid—is often prescribed to pre-menopausal women after surgery for early-stage breast cancer. Because surgeons can’t always be sure they removed all of the cancer cells, tamoxifen can reduce the risk that those leftover cells will continue to multiply and the cancer will return.

It can also be prescribed to women, pre- or post-menopause who have not been diagnosed with breast cancer, if they have a high risk (1.67 percent or higher) of developing it over the next five years. These women are usually 35 or older, and have risk factors such as a family history of cancer or a history of abnormal biopsies.

It’s only effective for some types of cancer

Studies have shown that tamoxifen can reduce the risk of cancer in high-risk women by more than 30 percent. But because the drug affects estrogen receptors in the body, it only works against cancers that are estrogen-receptor-positive or progesterone-receptor positive. Together, these make up about two-thirds of all breast cancers, according to BreastCancer.org.

“The way tamoxifen works is you’re depriving your cancer cells of estrogen, which is their nutrition,” Shah said. “So that will only work for the cancers that are estrogen-fed or progesterone-fed.”Other factors can affect how well it works, too

Some people have an abnormal version of an enzyme called CYP2D6, which may make tamoxifen less effective. (Some research has suggested this, although larger, more recent studies haven’t found a link.) Patients may want to consider being tested for this enzyme abnormality before starting tamoxifen, to make sure they’ll get the full benefit.

Certain medications, including diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cimetidine (Tagamet), and some antidepressants can also block the activity of the CYP2D6 enzyme.

""That's why it's very important to make sure your oncologist knows every medication you're taking, including supplements,"" Shah said.

Five years is recommended, but 10 years may be better

After breast cancer treatment, most women who take tamoxifen take it for five years. But recent studies have suggested that it can reduce women’s risk for breast cancer even further if it’s taken for 10 years, says Dr. Shah.

However, tamoxifen is only recommended after breast cancer treatment for women who haven’t gone through menopause yet; after menopause, other drugs—called aromatase inhibitors—are known to work better. “If a woman becomes post-menopausal during those five or 10 years she’s on tamoxifen, we will switch her to this other group of drugs that is 20 to 25 percent more effective,” Shah said.

It does have side effects—but they may be overestimated

Despite its protective effects against cancer, some women stop taking tamoxifen because of side effects like hot flashes, mood swings, nausea, vomiting, or weight gain or loss. The drug can cause menstrual irregularities, and changes in sex drive or sleep patterns as well. (Tamoxifen also raises the risk for more serious health issues, like blood clots and uterine cancer; though for most women, the overall risk for these problems is still small.)

But many women who take tamoxifen are perimenopausal, and a recent study found that some women mistake naturally occurring symptoms of menopause with side effects of tamoxifen. In the study, symptom-related drop-out rates were similar across a nearly five-year period for women who took tamoxifen and for those who took a placebo pill.

“Patients will say I started taking tamoxifen and I gained 40 pounds,” Shah said. “But that’s probably a combination of hormonal and lifestyle changes they’re going through. Tamoxifen can cause some fluid retention, and it could maybe cause a 2- or 3-pound weight gain, but beyond that there are probably other things going on as well.”

Shah said it’s important to talk to your doctor if you’re experiencing side effects, rather than stopping a recommended course of tamoxifen.

“There are ways to manage the side effects, and most of them are not permanent. They get better with time,” she said.",5 things to know about tamoxifen,https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/11/10/5-things-to-know-about-tamoxifen.html

There may be a time at which President Trump or some other president will call upon me to serve my country within his or her administration at a later season.","A couple of years ago, while appearing on CNN with Van Jones, former Obama Administration Special Adviser for Green Energy, he shared something personal.

In a moment of transparency, the Yale-educated lawyer said that the public smearing he received during his tenure as the Green Energy Czar “felt like someone ripped off [his] face and put it on someone else’s body.” He said he didn’t recognize the person they were describing in press accounts.

Conservatives had little to no sympathy for him or others, but recent events have hopefully shed a different light on the matter.

Confirmation hearings are becoming something of a blood sport when the nominees are people who adhere to orthodox Christian views on abortion and matters of sexual identity.

First, there was Russell Vought, President Trump’s nominee for Deputy Director of Office of Management and Budget. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ questioned his Christian faith and belief in the centrality of Jesus Christ for salvation, suggesting basically that his belief makes him unfit for office. Then there was “the Dogma lives loudly within you” remark to Judge Amy Coney Barrett by Sen. Diane Feinstein denigrating the Notre Dame Law Professor and mother of seven’s Catholic faith. The senator’s outrage was based on an article that basically said the opposite of what was charged.

What is happening? Not since the JFK days has there been such hostility to faith. Sadly, back then it was from Protestants, but this is a new, equally insidious version from the left.

The final awakening on this issue came to Concerned Women for America due to Washington rumors of my “imminent” appointment to the office of Ambassador-At-Large for the Office of Global Women’s Issues. This is a position that was created by Secretary Hillary Clinton to assist with the advancement of women’s equality and the empowerment of women and girls around the world.

The ensuing outrage from the left was eye-opening. At the mere hint of the idea that a pro-life, conservative woman could be in the running opened up a flood of hostile and, in many cases, false or misleading articles written by leftist media.

Suddenly, the idea of “fake news” took on new meaning. Left-of-center reporters mostly relied on an opposition research dossier which quotes formerly-affiliated employees from CWA — much of which was dated years before my tenure — accepted without checking false statements by abortion activists, or, worse yet, isolated quotes out of context, much like in the case of Judge Barrett.

Just to name a few:

They claim we oppose birth control, when in truth CWA, and I personally, like the majority of Evangelical women, draw a bright line between birth control and abortion. We have never taken a position against it, but we do support the rights of conscience of women like the Little Sisters of the Poor. The Left, however, wishes to force everyone, even nuns who take a vow of celibacy and poverty, to fund abortion and abortion-inducing drugs. Their lack of tolerance for women of faith is shocking.

They claim that we never support rape-and-incest exceptions; this is one in which they twisted a theological piece that I wrote for the Christian Post. The truth is that every child is innocent. I value every child and her mother and addressed in that piece that abortion harms the woman as well as her child. I believe women deserve better, and as the church, we must offer them better options.

As the survivor of an assault and attempted rape, I know that this issue is deeply painful and complicated, and suffering women deserve our help and grace.

I believe that abortion is the most cynical answer to the plight of women, but the left sees it as the first and best response.

The story of women who regret their abortions is prevalent. Pro-life Americans offer love and hope to women every day in pregnancy help centers, through adoption and through material help. Regardless, in the very piece they criticized, I end by saying, “Regardless of her choice, we must pray for her!”

As a practical matter, every federal legislative effort and most state bills endorsed by CWA contain rape and incest exceptions. I also addressed this in my book, if people had bothered to look.

“ … I should add however that I have and do support legislation that contains a rape-incest exception if it is essential to protect the vast majority of babies. Public policy is downstream of public opinion, and we still have work to do.” (Feisty and Feminine, 89)

They falsely claim we support the criminalization of homosexuality or transgenderism, when in truth, I have never believed it and said the opposite specifically in my book. We can disagree on matters of policy for our military or our schools, but we are called to love our neighbor, and that includes our LGBTQ neighbors.

“Condemning unkindness is not a religious or political stance; it is a human one, and our message transcends those divisions. This means that we condemn liberal attacks against Christian and conservative views; but it also means that we must take a stand against nastiness toward gay people or any group for that matter. We absolutely must condemn countries operating under sharia law where homosexuality is a crime punishable by death. In Nigeria in early 2015, fourteen men were dragged from their beds and attacked by men with clubs and iron bars who said they wanted to ‘cleanse’ their neighborhood of gay people. And who could forget the video of ISIS pushing a gay man off of a roof to his death in Mosul, Iraq? We have to speak out against these kinds of atrocities, and against governments that condone them. Violence of any kind has no place among those who seek peace, and as followers of Christ, it is our duty to stand up against this kind of injustice. We need to condemn violence abroad as well as here in the United States. But even short of violence, we need to consider whether we do what’s right when people say something unkind about gay or transgender people and those who don’t share our opinions or lifestyles. Because here’s the problem: people practicing these lifestyles can’t hear our words of love and hope when we are allowing other people to define us.” (From my book ""Feisty & Feminine,"" Page 70)

They claim that CWA and I oppose the Violence Against Women Act when in truth we have criticized its efficacy. We suggested that there needs to be better oversight ending the waste and fraud by grantees and instead that the federal offer block grants to the states in order to address what even supporters admit is too broad to be effective. (From my book ""Feisty & Feminine,"" Page 44)

The left is fine with spending $400 million per year on programs that aren’t doing enough to protect women. Just because the bill is named well doesn’t mean it is stopping domestic violence. Again, women deserve better.

They claim that I do not support anti-bullying efforts against children who identify as LGBTQ. That is 100 percent false.

In the piece that sparked the hatred, I said, “I despise children being bullied for being ‘gay’ just as much as for being obese or for being from another country or simply being different or for whatever reason. How about we teach our kids, ‘Be ye kind one to another.’”

In my book, I went further. While I absolutely support an end to any and all forms of bullying, I can't help but notice how ironic it is that conservative Christian kids in our school system are bullied for their own beliefs. What are our schools doing to protect them? (""Feisty & Feminine,"" 56)

And just to be clear (despite this being the height of silliness), I don’t hate ""Frozen.""

Interestingly, reporters conveniently left out all of my lifelong work caring for “the least of these” on issues like fighting sex trafficking and fighting for cleaning up the horrible backlog of testing for rape kits (""Feisty & Feminine,"" Page 46-48).

I also worked with others to successfully pass into law the Second Chance Act (Public Law 110-199), which tears down barriers for prisoners reentering society. As a member of Right on Crime, I am working for restorative justice reform, including the use of drug and youth courts and access to mental health care.

But let’s be honest, it does not matter what I say or what I believe. The left must twist my words, because at the end of the day, a pro-life woman with an orthodox Christian worldview is unacceptable to them.

It is becoming a common theme in confirmation hearings. Both the Republicans and Democrats are guilty of demagoguery as Van Jones suggested, and it needs to stop.

Now, to address the rumor of an appointment to the Trump administration: The honest answer is that there is great appeal to the idea of working for President Trump and the opportunity to work on behalf of women around the globe.

It is my hope that under President Trump the Office of Global Women’s Issues will stand for the rights of women to seek fulfillment of their basic needs, to feed and clothe themselves and their children, to fully participate in society, and to be defended against human rights abuses such as violence, killing, discrimination, and false imprisonment. As full participants in society, women should have the agency to pursue education and economic livelihood and to vote or run for office.

There is clearly work to be done. American conservatives often view the world through the lens of our own experience, forgetting that there are millions of women and girls around the world denied basic human rights and treated by their government or culture as literally second class citizens facing discrimination at every turn.

I would be honored to serve my nation and President Trump; however, I do not feel God is leading me to leave Concerned Women for America at this time. We have important work to do and are in a season of amazing growth. Most importantly, I have about 18 months left before my last child goes off to college.

In Washington, ones family is often used as an excuse, but I can assure I am sincere. My husband and I, like most parents, have subjugated our own desires in many ways to do our best to parent.

I do not believe that it would be right for me or for him to travel the world during this season of our lives. Others may be able to do so with aplomb, but we cannot.

There may be a time at which President Trump or some other president will call upon me to serve my country within his or her administration at a later season.

The left can relax for now, but who knows about another day? But know this, if it is ever God’s will for me to serve, nothing they can do or say will stop it.",Penny Young Nance: What happened when the left thought I would be joining the Trump administration,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/10/penny-young-nance-what-happened-when-left-thought-would-be-joining-trump-administration.html

For the people now serving in our nation’s armed forces, who put their lives on the line to protect us at home, the very least we can do is support them and their families.

Military families sacrifice a lot, right alongside the service members they love. Being apart on holidays, birthdays and other special occasions is just the tip of the iceberg.

I’m not a veteran, so I can only imagine that peace of mind rarely comes to those whose loved ones live and serve overseas, particularly those who put themselves in harm’s way.

We have a duty to military families, plain and simple. Not only to respect them, although that’s without a doubt part of it, but also to stand with them, to offer a hand when they can’t catch a break and lend our voices when theirs aren’t heard.

This is the new normal we should create together. This is the type of country we should want to live in. Because no matter your stance on war, we should all get behind the people who serve.

So, this Veterans Day, how can you begin repaying our debt? You can donate your resources (time, money, expertise) to the countless organizations that work for our people in uniform. If you’re not sure where to start, here are a few to keep in mind:

One nonprofit that’s making it easier to support military families is DonorsChoose.org. The organization assists students and teachers across the U.S. by helping to provide the tools and experiences they need for a great education.

You can now go onto the website and donate to schools in areas where high percentages of students come from military families. This means you can assist members of the military by helping their kids receive the quality education that every child deserves, but doesn’t always get.

One group of students in a military community in South Carolina recently had their dreams of possessing their own technology center realized when all four of their projects were funded. With 16 new Chromebooks, these preschool through second graders now have the opportunity to “thrive in a global environment that is dependent upon the knowledge and use of technology,” as their teacher, a former military member, has always hoped. This new education, she believes, will encourage curiosity and reveal to them the joy of learning.

If you give to DonorsChoose.org, I’ll match $1 for every $1 you donate so that more military children like those in this vet’s classroom can explore their interests and realize their potential.

In addition to military families, we need to remember and support our veterans.

At every stage in a vet’s post-service life, we (the civilians) should be allies, and we have the chance to do so in all sorts of areas of interest. If you’re passionate about technology, consider giving to Vets in Tech, an organization that offers reintegration services by connecting veterans with the nation’s tech network, resources, and programs.

Or maybe you’re invested in gender diversity and inclusion. Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America’s campaign She Who Borne the Battle is all about bringing full recognition to and improving services for the women who have served this country.

Or, interested in making a global impact? Check out Blue Star Families, which has 35 global communities and chapters that reach 1.5 million military families per year and works to better understand and provide solutions to the challenges that military families are currently facing around the world.

Or perhaps you’re drawn to promoting physical and mental well-being. The Bob Woodruff Foundation facilitates holistic recovery among wounded American vets, navigating the 46,000 nonprofits that serve veterans to invest in high-impact programs that ensure sustainable success in rehabilitation, education and employment, and quality of life.

Whatever you choose, find a way to show military families and veterans that the people of this country stand with them. Otherwise, we don’t deserve their service.","Craigslist Founder: Support military families, and I'll match your donations to one group helping them",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/10/craigslist-founder-support-military-families-and-ill-match-your-donations-to-one-group-helping-them.html

Listen here for the full interview

BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: Welcome back, everyone. Brian Kilmeade here. Thanks so much for listening to the Brian Kilmeade show. In a little while, we're going to have Bill Hammer on. Yes, that same Bill Hammer. But first things first, there's only very few people in this world I break format for and give up the big three, and one of them is on the line. He is Speaker Paul Ryan. Mr. Speaker, welcome.

SEN. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Hey, thanks for breaking format. How are you doing, man?

KILMEADE: Anything for you. Now, what time were you up working out today?

RYAN: Six.

KILMEADE: Six o'clock.

RYAN: Yes.

KILMEADE: Knowing that you had a lot to do, is it harder to work out knowing that you had a lot to do?

RYAN: No, it makes it easier actually. It just helps me get on my day. My mind's a little distracted, but working out's the best way to just process stress to me.

KILMEADE: Process stress. That's what I want to bring up to you. A lot of people on either side of the aisle, the republicans are saying last night was no big deal when the marquee matchup was at Gillespie against Northam, and that Gillespie lost by nine. And democrats are saying this is ""the beginning of our turnaround."" What do you take from Ed Gillespie's significant loss yesterday?

RYAN: Well, obviously democrats are going to do that, and we would be saying the same kind of thing. That's the way the spin works on these things. The way I see it, honestly, is we've got to get our job done, and we've got to - that's why I think tax reform is just so important. Not just politically, but just for the country.

And I think what people want to know and see is that this Donald Trump presidency and this republican Congress makes a positive difference in my life. And granted in the House we feel pretty good because we've actually been passing this agenda left and right. We've passed 394 bills out of the House alone, more in this presidency than in Obama, Clinton, and Bush's at the same time. It's just that about 308 of those bills still haven't gotten into the law. They're still kind of over in the Senate, so we're a little gummed up and frustrated there, but that's why tax reform is so important --

KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: -- because tax reform is one of those things. Those 308 bills I mentioned, those all can be filibustered.

KILMEADE: You talk --

RYAN: Tax reform --

KILMEADE: Right. Well --

RYAN: -- cannot be filibustered.

KILMEADE: -- Mr. Speaker, you know - you just said that's the way politics is. People spin their way out of it. Do you have to make (ph) as republicans -- either you're going to side with President Bush and his policies - 43 or more, free trade, and maybe some type of immigration compromise - or do you have to go with Donald Trump? Is it going to be a choice for republicans - Bush or Trump?

RYAN: We already made that choice. We're with Trump. We already made that choice. That's a choice we made at the beginning of the year. That's a choice we made during the campaign which is we merged our agendas. We ran on a joint agenda with Donald Trump. We got together with Donald Trump when he was President Elect Trump and walked through what is it we want to accomplish in the next two years. We all agreed on that agenda. We're processing that agenda.

Again, in the House, we passed, repeal, and replaced Obamacare. We funded the wall already in the House. We passed rebuilding the military. Once we're on the second installment there, we pass out veterans over all those. We pass, repeal, and replace of Dodd-Frank.

Now, not everything I just said is going into law because, again, if Chuck Schumer gets to filibuster these things in the Senate, that frustrates everybody. But that's my point, Brian. Tax reform is the most singular, signature issue that people think of when they think of republican, when they think of Donald Trump, when they think of how is this going to help me in my life.

An average $1,200 tax cut for the average household in America...

KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: -- where you got half the country living paycheck to paycheck is a big deal. Dropping the tax rates on businesses by 40 percent so they can compete globally and hire more people is a big deal. When you see statistics like the corporate rate reduction loan increases wages like $4,000, it's a big deal. When you see an analysis that just came up that says this tax reform bill will increase jobs by a million jobs, increase economic growth, take home pay and wage growth, that's a big deal. So we got to deliver. And that's what I get out of this, is we got to deliver, we're in the middle of doing it.

The committee's putting the bill through the committee this week, the floor next week, the Senate's following one week behind us. So we just got to deliver, that's what I get out of this.

KILMEADE: And Mr. Speaker, as you know, you got to keep one eye on the Senate, because you're about passing, you're not just about committee and mark ups.

RYAN: Right. Right.

KILMEADE: So you saw what came out yesterday. Evidently, Orrin Hatch's committee is putting out a policy that's backed by Senator Portman that possibly would delay the corporate tax until 2019. So you'll get it to 20 -- would you wait a year for the corporate tax reduction?

RYAN: Yes, I mean this is a long process. The House is going to it's thing, the Senate's going to do it's thing, then we're going to go meet in what we call a conference committee and iron out those differences. Right now, the House bill -- I can't speak for the Senate -- we're immediate and we're permanent.

The -- what Rob Portman will probably tell you is phasing in the corporate reduction still is very good for economic growth, because you have full expensing. And that means it's actually more valuable for a company to expand their operations immediately with a phase in, because they can deduct it off a higher tax rate.

And businesses do multi-year planning. So what economists tell us -- and this is what I think Senator Portman would say -- is that you still get very fast economic growth and you actually are encouraging companies to spend on factories and plants and equipment and hiring people sooner with the phase in.

So I still think you get the faster economic growth. So I'm not trying to come up with excuses, all I'm saying is the Senate is still focused on getting an economic growth plan and the House does it as well. So at the end of the day, this is all to the good, it's just a debate about how good it gets.

KILMEADE: So the Wall Street Journal, who doesn't wake up every day thinking how am I going to mess with the GOP, I just don't like those guys, maybe like Salon or the Huffington Post does, has a little bit of a problem. And they also point out the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is normally supportive of your efforts to overhaul the tax system, said that there's a lot of work to be done here.

And the Chairman of the National Association of Home Builders has a problem on the cap on $500,000 to be able to write off your mortgage. He says that really hurts people in high tax states.

RYAN: Well look, for even people with (ph) the high tax states, here's what this bill does. It's -- you still get to write off the first $500,000 of your mortgage, you get an additional -- we had to back a property tax deduction, oh, and don't forget the fact you just got a doubled standard deduction, so your first $24,000 instead of your first $12,000 are tax free.

If you have kids, you just increased your child tax credit by $600 per child. And we're lowering tax rates across the board. The people above a million don't get a rate lowering, but their income -- most -- more of their income is -- is taxed at lower rates. So actually, even though there's a lot of counter -- false information out there, everybody gets a tax cut.

Everybody's rates go down, everybody's exemption goes up. So the difference here with these kinds of deductions is this.

KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: Do you -- do we just cut tax rates and let you keep your money and you decide what to do with it? Or do we keep tax rates higher, you send your money to Washington, and then if you do something that the IRS approves of, you know a mortgage or something like that, then you can get you some of your money back.

Our philosophy is just cut tax rates across the board so you deduct less but you keep your money first. And you decide what you want to do with your money because it's your money. That's the philosophical difference here.

KILMEADE: So the one thing is you do not cut the top rate for those who -- for the upper class and you leave it at 39.6 percent.

RYAN: Right.

KILMEADE: If you get rid of the deductions and leave that, you'd actually up the taxes on the most successful people in the country, which a lot of people don't despise or resent.

RYAN: No. I'd say -- but one more thing you're forgetting in that, which is we're taking the -- the -- the dollar amount that that rate hits, from $477,000 up to $1 million. So that means another half a million dollars are taxed at a lower rate than they would be under our current law.

KILMEADE: What would that new rate be? So if the high - if the --

RYAN: Well it's 39.6. But it's just - I'm saying 39.6 kicks in at a million instead of $477,000, and 35 percent would be the rate you're at for 477 to a million. The point being even people in the Joint Committee in Taxation that runs the numbers for - official number for Congress say everybody gets a tax cut. Everyone gets a tax cut.

Now what I would simply say is the president made really clear to us that he wants the tax relief on the endikem (ph) tax side to be focused on middle income people. He doesn't want massive tax relief on top.

KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: He wants massive tax relief in the middle and for low income people. That was what the president basically said to Congress to do, that Congress followed suit and did that, but also the people who own businesses are the people you're describing. Businesses are getting their tax rates dropped tremendously. Successful small businesses, their top tax rate goes from over 40 percent down to 25 percent -- KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: -- a proper rate (ph) from 35 percent to 20 percent, the debt tax being repealed. So I would say that most of those folks that you're talking about are owner of businesses. They're getting a big business tax cut, so everyone's going to benefit from this, and that's why we're seeing these estimates that show --

KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: -- more jobs, higher wages, faster economic growth.

KILMEADE: So, Mr. Speaker, two more quick things - I'm getting a lot of people who are I would label as working class say to me, ""I cannot believe they're going to get rid of the tax credit for adoptive parents --

RYAN: Yes.

KILMEADE: -- we needed that money. That's why I - that's one of the --

RYAN: Sure.

KILMEADE: -- great things about adopting,"" which is a great thing to do. Anyway, why would you attacked that?

RYAN: I was one of the authors of the tax credit. We obviously are for that. It's a tax credit that is enjoyed by higher income people, not lower income people. You don't get a tax credit, for instance, if you're getting -taking fosters kids. You actually get a different arrangement there. It was - the question the Ways of Mean Committee asked was, ""do we want to give a person one tax cut for one year for doing one thing, or do we want to give families a tax cut every year for anything?""

And that's the difference here which is do you get one tax cut for adopting a child once, or do we give families a tax cut each and every year for each and every child always, and then let them decide what they want to do with their money. That's the difference here.

KILMEADE: All right. He's getting his hands dirty defending a tax point that hasn't quite take total shape knowing that the democrats are coming out with a plan of their own, and their going to get their hands dirty again. You still act optimistic to get this done by Thanksgiving?

RYAN: Yes, in the House. The plan was always the House out by Thanksgiving, the Senate's going to be about a week behind us because the rule is required the House go first, and the goal here is law by the end of the year, and we're on track.

KILMEADE: Thanks so much, Mr. Speaker. I'll see you in Washington. Hopefully we'll do a longer version of this.

In other words, the anti-Trump media are, as usual, picking and choosing what to focus on based on their usual narrative.

“We've seen everything from the feeding frenzy around the false koi story where video was actually edited to make the president look like an unpolished rube to sanctimonious criticism around the president not taking questions while with the Chinese president when his predecessor also didn't take questions as well during his first trip there,” The Hill media columnist Joe Concha told Fox News.

Trump delivered a powerful speech Friday before a summit of Asian leaders in Vietnam, but CNN decided not to bother airing the late-night speech. The increasingly liberal CNN didn’t even mention the speech on air until a brief update in the 3 a.m. ET hour, while Fox News and MSNBC had reporters on the ground and covered the speech live.

In the speech that CNN viewers never saw, Trump reiterated his “America First” message, saying he will not “let the United States be taken advantage of anymore.” A slew of high-profile Twitter users, who apparently don’t watch CNN, simply saw the president’s speech as an opportunity to mock Trump for not fighting in the Vietnam War.

In addition, numerous U.S. companies announced $250 billion worth of deals in China, coinciding with Trump’s visit with Chinese President Xi Jinping. To wit: Boeing reached a $37 billion agreement to sell 300 planes to China; General Electric picked up three deals in China valued at a combined $3.5 billion; and Qualcomm reached three nonbinding deals to sell $12 billion in semiconductors to Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo over the next three years. None of the job-creating deals received the attention they deserved from mainstream media.

The average American is probably more familiar with a report that Trump was offered women being sent to his room in Russia during the 2013 Miss Universe Pageant. ABC and CBS each spent significant time covering the nonstory -- but predictably muted the fact that Trump didn’t take the offer seriously.

“Lost in all of this is the $250 billion dollar trade deal can actually impact our economy that gets relatively buried because it lacks sizzle and character assessments."" - Joe Concha

“Lost in all of this is the $250 billion dollar trade deal can actually impact our economy that gets relatively buried because it lacks sizzle and character assessments,” Concha said.

The Associated Press even tried to undermine the impact of the announced deals, saying they are “more about the art of diplomacy than the art of the deal” – a dig at the title of one of Trump’s books -- while painting the $250 billion agreements as “ceremonial” and “mostly about symbolism.”

Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor echoed Concha and said the mainstream media is “spinning a successful foreign policy trip into a disaster because that's how they want it perceived.”

Moore made the comments in an extensive new written statement and in an interview on the ""Sean Hannity Radio Show.""

On Thursday, a Washington Post report alleged that Moore initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl in 1979, when he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney in Gadsden, Ala. The report also included claims by three other women that Moore asked them out on dates -- and in two cases, kissed them -- when they were between the ages of 16 and 18. The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16.

""I have never provided alcohol to minors, and I have never engaged in sexual misconduct,"" said Moore in his statement, referencing a claim by one of the women that he gave her wine when she was below Alabama's legal drinking age, which is 19.

""As a father of a daughter and a grandfather of five granddaughters,"" Moore went on. ""I condemn the actions of any man who engages in sexual misconduct not just against minors but against any woman.""

In the radio interview with Hannity, Moore denied ever knowing Leigh Corfman, who told the Post he made sexual advances toward her when she was 14. However, he did not deny dating teenagers as young as 16.

""You understand this was 40 years ago,"" Moore said. ""And after my return from the military, I dated a lot of young ladies.""

When asked by Hannity if he dated teenagers when he was in his 30s, Moore said ""It would have been out of my customary behavior,"" and added that he didn't ""remember dating any girl without the permission of her mother.""

In his statement, Moore implored ""the Washington Post, and everyone involved [in the story], to tell the truth."" But on the radio, Moore said he was ""sure in the next four weeks, they're gonna come out with another article."" He also said that his campaign had ""some evidence of collusion,"" but did not elaborate.

""I trust that the people of Alabama, who know my record after 40 years of public service, will vouch for my character and commitment to the rule of law,"" Moore's statement concluded.

The allegations have caused an outcry from national Republican leaders, who have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are proven true. On Friday, the Senate GOP's campaign arm formally ended its fundraising agreement with Moore.

The GOP's 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney condemned his colleagues' caveat -- only if the allegations are true.

""Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections. I believe Leigh Corfman,"" Romney said. ""Her account is too serious to ignore. Moore is unfit for office and should step aside.""

However, the former state Supreme Court justice has emphatically refused to leave the race, telling Hannity if candidates step aside due to accusations, ""you might as well not run, because when you run you're going to get allegations.""

Despite the allegations, Moore also has the support of several Republican officials in Alabama.

""Humphrey Bogart started dating Lauren Bacall when she was a teenager,"" said state Auditor Jim Ziegler, referring to the then-19-year-old actress.

Paul Reynolds, Alabama's Republican National Committeeman, called it ""a firestorm designed to shipwreck a campaign in Alabama. I think it's sinister.""

Holiday festivities with extended family members often make for tight sleeping quarters, and 52 percent of American adults have admitted to inventing excuses “specifically to avoid uncomfortable sleeping arrangements” at relative’s homes, according to a new study from INTEX.

While it feels good to know that you’re not the only one who shudders at the thought of a night of restless sleep on your great-aunt’s vintage sofa-chair, respondents duly reported that lackluster bedding accommodations are their motivation to politely exit soon after dessert.

At this point, it's worth noting that INTEX — or the Intex Recreation Corp — is a manufacturer of ""air mattresses and air beds,"" as well as toys, furniture, boats and above-ground pools.

That said, the company's study claims that, during the holidays, 62 percent of respondents said they’ve slept on the couch and 44 percent said they’ve spent the night on the floor, like in a sleeping bag. And 39 percent said they had been assigned a bed that was uncomfortably small.

If you thought that sounded rough, others had it even worse. Thirteen percent of adults polled said that they’d been relegated to a child-themed bed, and 7 percent even said they’ve had to sleep in a tent. For these reasons, and limited options, 46 percent of respondents said that figuring out sleeping arrangements are more likely to cause arguments than agreeing on a television program or movie for everyone to watch together.

Military service is still one of the few things in our society that both sides of the political spectrum can agree is worthy of respect.
On this Veterans Day, the mistreatment of American troops remains a red line that few dare to cross.","I remember when I first heard a Vietnam veteran’s story. I was captivated as he described his desperate attempts to render aid as his dying best friend bled out in front of him. Half a world away and decades later in 2008, the scene was still painful for him to recall. But the most shocking part of the story was his return home.

My heroic friend described having to change out of his uniform before roaming American streets – or else he’d be subject to threats. I was only 15 and I simply couldn’t believe that civilians would spit on, curse and even attack returning veterans. And all this happened on American soil.

Serving in the Army today, my peers and I have a very different experience. When we wear our uniforms in public we get pats on the back, offers to pay for our meals, and warm remarks expressing gratitude for our service. Certainly, much has changed for the better. But sometimes I wonder if things will always be this way.

If anything is clear in American culture, it’s that yesterday’s taboo is today’s status quo. The more we normalize disrespect to the national anthem, applaud pledge of allegiance protests, and entertain discussions about how democratic ideals are somehow inherently flawed – the easier it will be to disrespect the people who are sworn to protect those ideals. In other words, what’s preventing Americans from mistreating service members in the future as a form of protest?

The more we normalize disrespect to the national anthem, applaud pledge of allegiance protests, and entertain discussions about how democratic ideals are somehow inherently flawed – the easier it will be to disrespect the people who are sworn to protect those ideals.

In our polarized country, everything is potential political fodder. Sports, entertainment, holidays, national tragedies – things that once unified us – are now sources of division.

Military service is still one of the few things in our society that both sides of the political spectrum can agree is worthy of respect. Supporting the armed forces is about the last inch of common ground left in America. But how much longer until that ground is under siege by those that who seek to divide us?

To be clear, I’m not calling for Americans to blindly worship the military. As Army veteran David French aptly pointed out in a recent piece in the National Review: “Not everyone in the military is a hero. The mere act of donning a uniform does not make you any better than any other American.”

And I agree with French’s assertion that “loving the troops and supporting the military means holding both accountable.” But military accountability is an entirely different issue from the growing anti-American sentiment percolating through our culture.

Consider a recent poll conducted by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, which found that nearly half of U.S. millennials would rather live under a communist or socialist regime than a democratic country.

Amazingly, one in five Americans in their 20s view Soviet dictator Josef Stalin as a hero, while over 25 percent thought highly of his predecessor Vladimir Lenin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. And an appalling 40 percent believe in restricting some First Amendment freedoms.

“Millennials now make up the largest generation in America, and we’re seeing some deeply worrisome trends,” said Marion Smith, the executive director of the foundation.

Worrisome is an understatement.

More and more citizens fail to understand the importance of democracy and thus can’t see value in patriotism. That leaves them more susceptible than ever to false narratives about what it means to be an American. And even worse, such narratives could easily lead them to more radical forms of protest.

Concerned Americans – Democrats, Republicans and everyone else – should work together to educate our fellow citizens and reverse the flow of ignorant ideas that continue to gain momentum. As Thomas Jefferson cautioned us: “If a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.”

American culture is not far removed, in either time or ideology, from the days when U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines were harassed by their own countrymen when in uniform.

On this Veterans Day, the mistreatment of American troops remains a red line that few dare to cross. But with every new protest, it seems that line gets a little less clear.","Army officer: In a divided country, will it soon become dangerous to wear my uniform in public?",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/10/army-officer-in-divided-country-will-it-soon-become-dangerous-to-wear-my-uniform-in-public.html

After Hernandez's CTE diagnosis, his attorneys filed a lawsuit against the NFL and football helmet maker Riddell, accusing them of failing to warn Hernandez about the dangers of football.
While the outside of Hernandez's brain appeared normal, the inside was riddled with CTE, she said.
The next youngest person whose brain they've examined that showed such serious CTE damage was 46 years old, McKee said.
Hernandez inherited a genetic profile that may have made him more susceptible to the disease, McKee said.","Former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez suffered substantial damage to parts of the brain that affect memory, judgment and behavior from the most severe case of a degenerative disease linked to head blows ever found in someone so young, a researcher said Thursday.

Dr. Ann McKee, director of Boston University's CTE Center, stressed that she could not ""connect the dots"" between the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy and the behavior of the 27-year-old who hanged himself in April while serving life in prison for murder.

But McKee said CTE had significantly impacted key parts of Hernandez's brain, including the hippocampus — which is associated with memory — and the frontal lobe, which is involved in impulse control, judgment and behavior.

""We can say collectively, in our collective experience, that individuals with CTE — and CTE of this severity — have difficulty with impulse control, decision-making, inhibition of impulses or aggression, often emotional volatility and rage behaviors,"" said McKee, who has studied hundreds of brains from football players, college athletes and even younger players, donated after their deaths.

Hernandez hanged himself in prison days after he was acquitted in the 2012 drive-by shootings of two men in Boston and just hours before his former teammates visited the White House to celebrate their latest Super Bowl victory.

Prosecutors contended he gunned the two men down after one accidentally spilled a drink on him in a nightclub — and then got a tattoo of a handgun and the words ""God Forgives"" to commemorate the crime.

He had been serving a life sentence without parole in the 2013 killing of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd when he killed himself.

Hernandez, who said he was innocent, did not raise CTE in his defense at either trial.

CTE, which can only be diagnosed in an autopsy, has been found in former members of the military, football players and boxers and others who suffered repeated head trauma.

BU researchers confirmed in September that Hernandez was diagnosed with Stage 3, out of 4, of the disease. But McKee had not publicly discussed her findings until a conference at the university on Thursday.

After Hernandez's CTE diagnosis, his attorneys filed a lawsuit against the NFL and football helmet maker Riddell, accusing them of failing to warn Hernandez about the dangers of football. The lawsuit, which seeks damages for Hernandez's young daughter, said he experienced a ""chaotic and horrendous existence"" because of his disease.

While the outside of Hernandez's brain appeared normal, the inside was riddled with CTE, she said. There was evidence of previous small hemorrhages, which experts associate with head impacts, she said. Other parts, like the hippocampus, had begun to shrink and large holes were found in his brain's membrane, McKee said.

The next youngest person whose brain they've examined that showed such serious CTE damage was 46 years old, McKee said.

""These are very unusual findings to see in an individual of this age,"" McKee said. ""We've never seen this in our 468 brains, except in individuals some 20 years older,"" she said.

""[It's] a clever way...to serve malicious files,"" a spokesperson for the internet security firm Avast told Fox News. ""Although it’s not completely new, it’s rarely seen as a mechanism of spreading malware such as banking Trojans.""

Computer security website Bleeping Computer covered the malware in a recent post.

""This group has taken a novel approach, never before seen in the distribution of banking Trojans,” Bleeping Computer wrote.

The ultimate goal is to trick you into going to the hacked site, then redirecting you until you reach a site offering a Microsoft Word document for download, according to Talos.

“Ironically we have observed the same redirection system and associated infrastructure used to direct victims to tech support and fake [anti-virus] scams,"" Talos added.

So far, the malware seems to be targeting customers in Sweden, India, Australia and Saudi Arabia. But that’s never stopped successful malware from spreading to other countries.

How to protect yourself

Malware often needs you to proactively click on links and buttons. In this case when the Microsoft Word document is opened, it prompts pop-ups such as “Enable Editing,” “Enable Content” and ""Macros have been disabled."" If you do enable the macro, an executable download will infect your system.

The biggest red flag you’ll get is from Microsoft itself. By default, macros are disabled. And Microsoft wants you to keep it that way to protect you from documents coming from untrusted sources.

Avast told Fox News that it is currently ""blocking most of these sites, [which] prevents users from being infected.""

“Defending against this attack requires not only vigilance by companies to make sure the sites and servers are compromised, but that consumers pay attention to what they are clicking on and not enabling macros or open unknown attachments,” according to a post at SC Media, a cybersecurity website.","Cunning malware spreads, going after your bank account",https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/11/10/cunning-malware-spreads-going-after-your-bank-account.html

The latest House tax reform proposal eliminates one of the biggest tax breaks in sports, tax-exempt financing for stadiums. In the last 15 years, according to the Brookings Institute, sports teams built 36 stadiums with tax-exempt bonds, costing federal taxpayers almost $4 billion.

“Why should the citizens of Oklahoma be subsidizing that move, or Texas or Nebraska?"" Brookings researcher Ted Gayer asked. ""Under current law, citizens around the country are essentially subsidizing the movement of private sports franchises from one location to another, and there's no economic or, I would say, political or fairness reason to justify that.""

But owners say building new stadiums or renovating old ones promotes economic activity that, in many cases, would not otherwise happen.

""These buildings and facilities are used for a lot more than to house eight football games a year or 41 basketball games,"" said sportscaster Jim Gray. ""There's concerts, there's conventions, there's car shows, all types of activities that go into these stadiums and arenas.""

Currently, the Republican House tax proposal kills the tax-exempt bond subsidy, while the Senate version does not.

Both Congressional chambers do agree on two other proposals affecting college sports. One slaps a 20 percent tax on compensation in excess of $1 million to the five highest paid employees of a tax-exempt organizations, like universities and their elite coaches.

The other provision, called the “seating-rights deduction,” eliminates an 80 percent tax break on donations to athletic departments wealthy boosters use to buy season tickets. Critics say the tax subsidy clearly favors the rich and contributes to an excessive emphasis on college athletics.

Others feel it will hurt non-revenue sports, like rugby and rowing.

""I think it's going to end up having unintended consequences which are going to hurt universities and students,"" Gray said.

The Oakland Raiders' bid to build a 65,000-seat stadium includes a $750 million public contribution financed through tax-exempt bonds. Without those tax-free dollars, either the city or team will likely have to come up with more cash. And investors will have to pay taxes on the bonds' interest.

I’m now a member of Congress from Florida, waging a different kind of battle: to give America’s military veterans the help they have earned for defending our country.
Just this week, the House passed more than a dozen bills to support veterans and improve the Department of Veterans Affairs.
This Veterans Day, my request of all my fellow Americans – beyond celebrating the amazing patriots who have defended America in an unbroken line since 1775 – is to remember that not all injuries of war look the same.
Take a moment to thank the veterans in your life this Veterans Day, but more importantly, speak with them, really connect with them and let them know you’ve got their six.","In September 2010, I was at the top of my field, working as an Army explosive ordnance disposal expert in Afghanistan. And then a bomb exploded beneath me.

When I awoke days later in Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, I had to grapple with the realization that my legs, along with my usefulness on the battlefield, were likely gone. I would never be an asset to a mission again. If anything, I would be a detriment.

This Veterans Day, however, I now know that I was one of the lucky ones. My injuries were visible – plain for all to see. I was the beneficiary of endless support from doctors, people in our community and veterans organizations that helped me through recovery and helped me to realize I was still only limited by my own drive, grit and determination.

When people see my two legs are missing, they know immediately the assistance I need – help down a step, a cane, or a friendly shoulder to lean on. The kindness of everyone – even complete strangers – brings me feelings of immense gratitude.

Rarely a week goes by that I don’t get a call from a veteran who is struggling with suicidal thoughts. As a society, and especially as a military family, we must do more to support these men and women who return home with the injuries we cannot see.

But many scars of our nation’s wounded warriors are not visible. The recurring memories of an intense moment of combat, the damp feeling of a friend’s blood soaking your own uniform, and the sound of a brother’s last gasp of air will stay with me and my fellow warriors all our lives.

For many, these memories will be a part of a haunting labeled to most as post-traumatic stress. Far too often, my peers are haunted in silence without the same support of a grateful nation encouraging them through their struggle.

Rarely a week goes by that I don’t get a call from a veteran who is struggling with suicidal thoughts. As a society, and especially as a military family, we must do more to support these men and women who return home with the injuries we cannot see.

I’m now a member of Congress from Florida, waging a different kind of battle: to give America’s military veterans the help they have earned for defending our country.

One way we can support these men and women is by passing a bill that I introduced earlier this year called the Oath of Exit. Working with those who have experienced the weight of post-traumatic stress firsthand, I and others wrote the Oath of Exit to be a strong step forward in doing all we can to prevent even one more veteran from harming himself or herself.

The Oath of Exit creates a voluntary pledge for members of the armed forces to ask their brothers and sisters in arms for help – and to provide help when called upon.

That help is badly needed. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, an average of 20 veterans commit suicide every day and a veteran’s risk of suicide is 21 percent higher compared to an adult who has not served in the armed forces.

Coupled with increased awareness and resources to help these veterans, the Oath of Exit will provide an even stronger culture of support within our military family to combat these awful trends.

The Trump administration and Congress have already made supporting veterans a top priority. Just this week, the House passed more than a dozen bills to support veterans and improve the Department of Veterans Affairs.

But there is much more work that needs to be done. The Oath of Exit passed the House earlier this year as a part of the National Defense Authorization Act, but wasn’t included in the Senate version of the bill. We need another strong push to get the Oath of Exit across the finish line.

This should not be a partisan issue. On deployments around the world and at military bases in our own country, there are no Democrats or Republicans – only American patriots, proudly wearing the uniform of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines or Coast Guard.

Our military culture is one where the most important commitments are consistently spoken. The Soldier’s Creed, Ranger Creed, Special Forces Creed, Warrior Ethos, Army Values and Pledge of Allegiance are all examples of statements we put into heartfelt words.

These are the pledges that are important for us to uphold, so we repeat them nearly each day. This is because honor is more than just a word to members of the military and veterans. When we commit to something, we follow through.

This Veterans Day, my request of all my fellow Americans – beyond celebrating the amazing patriots who have defended America in an unbroken line since 1775 – is to remember that not all injuries of war look the same. Many don’t look like anything.

Take a moment to thank the veterans in your life this Veterans Day, but more importantly, speak with them, really connect with them and let them know you’ve got their six.","As a combat-injured veteran, I ask all Americans to help address invisible injuries of war",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/10/as-combat-injured-veteran-ask-all-americans-to-help-address-invisible-injuries-war.html

Vernon Dahmer (DAY'-mur) of Hattiesburg was targeted because he encouraged fellow African-Americans to register to vote during the Jim Crow era.

His widow, 92-year-old Ellie Dahmer, toured the museum with four surviving children and several other relatives. It includes a gallery with photos and descriptions of how the Dahmer home was firebombed. Pieces of the family's burned pickup truck are also on display.

""I think Mississippi's come a long ways to even want to put something up to portray what really happened to people during the civil rights movement,"" Ellie Dahmer said. ""We lived it. Some of them died with it. The rest of Mississippi needs to know about it.""

The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the Museum of Mississippi History — two entities under a single roof — are opening Dec. 9 for the state's bicentennial in downtown Jackson.

Daughter Bettie Dahmer, 62, said she hopes young people, particularly those from poor areas of Mississippi, will visit the museum to learn about the state's troubled history that includes lynching and other violence.

Vernon Dahmer was a farmer and shop owner and served as president of the Forrest County NAACP. His family's home was a haven for young civil rights workers who were challenging state-sponsored racial oppression, and he became a Klan target in January 1966 when he went on the radio and announced he would pay the poll tax for people who couldn't afford it.

Dennis Dahmer, then 11, was asleep in the family home when Klansmen set it ablaze on Jan. 10, 1966. He said his family owned several guns because they lived in the country and liked to hunt. Dennis Dahmer said as the fire raged, his father went from window to window shooting out at Klansmen who were waiting outside to attack the family.

""From what we read (in) the FBI files, these Klansmen — they had the house completely surrounded,"" Dennis Dahmer, now 64, said Friday at the museum. ""They were waiting for us to run out there so they could kill us.""

The family escaped from the back of the house. Vernon Dahmer's lungs were seared by the heat and he died of his injuries.

A jury in 1998 convicted one-time Klan leader Sam Bowers of murder and arson in Dahmer's killing. Bowers was sentenced to life and died in prison in 2006.

The civil rights museum also includes exhibits of other pivotal figures in the push for racial equality, including Medgar Evers, the Mississippi NAACP leader who was assassinated outside his Jackson home in 1963.

NASA could sidestep many of the impediments to a Mars mission if they could just get there faster. But sluggish chemical rockets aren't cutting it — and to find what comes next, one group of engineers is rebooting research into an engine last fired in 1972.

The energy liberated by burning chemical fuel brought astronauts to the moon, but that rocket science makes for a long trip to Mars. And although search for a fission-based shortcut dates back to the 1950s, such engines have never flown. In August, NASA boosted those efforts when the agency announced an $18.8-million-dollar contract with nuclear company BWXT to design fuel and a reactor suitable for nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP), a rocket technology that could jumpstart a new era of space exploration.

""The strengths with NTP are the ability to do the very fast round trip [to Mars], the ability to abort even if you're 2 to 3 months into the missions, the overall architectural robustness, and also the growth potential to even more advanced systems,"" Michael Houts, principal investigator for the NTP project at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, told Space.com. [Superfast Space Propulsion Concepts (Images)]

Superior gas mileage

NTP rockets would pull all that off by offering about twice the bang for the buck that chemical rockets do. Rather than burning fuel with oxygen, a nuclear fission reactor would serve as a powerful furnace, heating liquid hydrogen and expelling the resulting gas for thrust. How much oomph a rocket gets from its fuel depends largely on how fast it can hurl particles out the back, which in turn hinges on their mass. And NTP's single or double hydrogen atoms would be up to a dozen times lighter than chemical rocket outputs.

That atomic bean counting could add up to significant time savings. ""Nuclear thermal propulsion can enable you to get to Mars faster, on the order of twice as fast,"" said Vishal Patel, a researcher involved in subcontract work for BWXT at the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corp. in Los Alamos, New Mexico. ""We're looking at nice 3- to 4-month transit times.""

New tricks with an old technology

Unlike truly exotic propulsion proposals using antimatter or nuclear fusion, researchers have long considered nuclear fission rockets technologically feasible. Concrete development began with the Atomic Energy Commission's Project Rover in 1955 — three years before NASA's founding — and continued with the NERVA rocket prototype, which fired for nearly 2 hours straight during ground tests before budget cuts ended development in 1972.

By then, NASA had already canceled Apollo 18 through 20, as well as Saturn V rocket production. When Mars plans followed suit, the multibillion-dollar NERVA project lost its main purpose, Houts said. The technology saw a brief revival in the late '80s and early '90s with the Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (SNTP) program, which also ran out of funding before flight testing.

But now, with interest turning back toward Mars, past research is finding new life in current projects.

""The key thing is, [the NERVA rocket] was extremely well documented,"" said John Helmey, project manager for BWXT's NTP project. ""We aren't starting from scratch. We're building upon really good work that was done back in that time frame,"" he told Space.com. Over the course of the contract, which extends through 2019, BWXT will develop conceptual designs focusing on fuel elements and the reactor core.

Three main challenges distinguish modern efforts from the legacy research.

Nuclear-testing rules have changed, said Jonathon Witter, BWXT NTP project chief engineer. The potential for trace levels of radioactivity in the engine exhaust means that engineers can no longer let clouds of hydrogen gas billow into the atmosphere. Instead, BWXT plans to test a trick developed at NASA's Stennis Space Center and combust the hydrogen gas with oxygen to make easy-to-catch water. Early, small-scale demonstrations will use non-nuclear hydrogen gas to test this exhaust-capturing method, but water from future nuclear tests could be decontaminated with off-the-shelf technology.

Engineers are also redesigning the fuel elements with new materials surrounding the uranium fuel particles, according to Witter. Rocket efficiency depends on temperature too, and BWXT expects that a ceramic and tungsten composite will allow for better operation at higher temperatures.

What's more, NERVA ran on 90 percent highly enriched uranium that would today qualify as weapons-grade. But because the fission process throws off more than enough heat, those levels are overkill, Patel said. BWXT's designs will harness material enriched to just below 20 percent, putting it in the less-tightly regulated low enriched uranium (LEU) category. On top of allowing safer reactors, the modest levels of fissionable material could open the door to more public-private partnerships.

""The LEU thing really enables the idea that non-governmental entities can get in on this,"" Patel said. ""It's potentially game changing.""

A dark horse for the Red Planet

But extensive design and many years of testing separate NTP's on-paper potential from single-season jaunts to the Red Planet, and nuclear space technology's history of false starts makes it a long shot for NASA's early Mars missions, currently scheduled for the 2030s. ""It's one of several advanced propulsion options, Houts said. ""There're a lot of good options that use chemical systems, and options that use electric propulsion .""

Scott Hall, a developer of one such electric propulsion prototype that recently broke records at the University of Michigan, says he'd love to see any of these technologies get into space, but doesn't think it'll happen soon.

""Optimistically, it will be 15 years,"" Hall said of his high-powered ion thruster, ""and realistically it's probably more like 50… The process is just moving so slowly, and I imagine the nuclear guys are in a similar boat.""

But whether it takes one decade or 10, Houts thinks nuclear technology could transform space exploration. He cites Martian power plants and the possibility of spacecraft that refuel from naturally occurring resources like water or methane as examples of far-off possibilities.

""What we're talking about is a first generation system. The systems beyond that could have extremely advanced capabilities,"" he said.

The episode opens with Meemaw babysitting the gang and doing a rather unorthodox job. Georgie is outside playing with firecrackers after going on a run to the store for cigarettes, Missy is singing in her room deliriously hopped-up on candy and Sheldon is learning the concept of bluffing at poker. Sheldon’s parents come home soon and their babysitter is dismissed.

The next day at church, Sheldon takes issue with Pastor Jeff’s assertion that there’s a 50/50 chance God is real. He tries to break down the science for the youngster, but they reach an impasse when the pastor suggests that some of Sheldon’s favorite scientists were men of faith.

“So Darwin is right about God, but wrong about evolution?”

“Now you’re getting it!”

Sheldon, vowing to destroy Pastor Jeff the following week, has his faith tested when George Sr. stars experiencing chest pains. Mary acts quickly to take him to the hospital and makes Meemaw come and babysit. The situation is scary as none of the kids have ever really seen a parent get into hospital-level trouble before. When Georgie comes home, he says he doesn’t want to go to bed and believes their place is at the hospital. Once Meemaw passes out from drinking too much pink wine, the kids launch a daring plan.

Missy and Georgie agree to snag Meemaw’s keys and take her car to the hospital. After some protest and a whole lot of safety precautions, Sheldon joins them. Unfortunately, none of them know how to get to the hospital, and have to wait to chase an ambulance there. Because they got lost, Meemaw was able to beat them there by about a second. When the kids arrive, she does the cool babysitter thing and covers for the kids.

“Nice bluff,” Sheldon quips.

“There’s germs here that could kill me,” he says.

While wandering, he catches a glimpse of his father being taken care of. He’s shocked and frightened by the image of his weak dad panting and holding his mom’s hand tightly. In that moment, he finds his faith and goes to the chapel to pray. His experience with faith pays off as his mom later comes out to inform them that their dad is going to be OK.

Pendants, uplights, downlights, LEDs — are you confused by all the options out there in kitchen lighting when it comes to creating the illumination you need to prep, cook and dine? We’ve asked expert Ben Mills to explain the different lighting types and the main things to consider in planning an effective design.

Why is kitchen lighting so important? For most of us, the kitchen is the workhorse of the home and a busy spot from morning till night. Good lighting is essential, as it allows you to perform tasks such as prepping food and cleaning up safely, says Mills, executive general manager at Australia’s Crompton Lighting. Plus, it adds character to a space and can quickly take the mood from functional to cozy, perfect for an eat-in kitchen.

Plan lighting as early as possible. Moving light fixtures after a kitchen has been installed can be expensive: Rewiring and repainting mean costs can add up quickly. For that reason, it’s best to plan kitchen lighting during the design stage.

What is a layered lighting design? Light layering involves creating different shades of light, playing with shadows and using colors to highlight a room’s best features. In the kitchen, it generally incorporates task lighting for food prep and cooking, ambient lighting for general illumination and character, and accent lighting to highlight specific features such as a gorgeous backsplash or a piece of art.

Consider safety first. The first priority of kitchen lighting is to provide sufficient illumination for safe and efficient meal prep, cooking and cleaning. This is achieved with task lighting — think LED strip lights under an upper cabinet (these create a lovely, even light with no shadows or heat) or a track system over the island.

Make sure there are no shadows in your prep zones. The best way to do is this is to install task lighting in front of or above you, rather than behind you.

Add ambient lighting for character. Soft, ambient lighting will wash your kitchen with light and create a warm, welcoming glow. It could be in the form of a pendant above a counter or dining table, downlights around the perimeter of the room or a central ceiling light.

Highlight your best features with accent light. Use accent lighting to draw attention to special features such as a backsplash or a dramatic island facade. Installing strip lighting under cabinets or counters is a great way to achieve this. You could also add accent lighting to glass cabinets or open shelving to highlight your displays.

Choose the right style. When it comes to choosing kitchen lights, take your cues from your home’s architecture and the lighting styles in the rest of the home. Choosing similar styles (or at least having a unifying theme such as shape or finish) will create a sense of flow among the spaces. This is particularly important in an open-plan kitchen that flows directly into a living or dining area.

When it comes to decorative lighting trends, the Scandi look is still popular, as well as simple styles in natural wood and black, white and industrial metallics.

Get the proportions right. With pendant lights and other decorative styles, size is also important: too large and the fixture will overwhelm a small kitchen; too small and it may get lost in a large space.

It’s also important to hang the pendant at an appropriate height to reduce the risk of people bumping their heads. Generally speaking, it should be about 32 inches above a table or counter.

Take control. Lighting control systems allow you to alter the illumination as needed and change the mood of the space. With dimmers, for example, you can go from bright lighting for precision cooking to a warm glow for dining. Having controls on separate switch plates lets you control lights in different areas separately.

Up front, here is what I think Roy Moore should do. If he continues to deny the allegations, he should hold a press conference and tell people he wants to clear his name. In the interests of helping the President and avoiding a Democrat, he will continue to campaign for the office and then, if elected, resign so that the Governor can appoint his replacement so that he might focus on clearing his name. He can call this move the Corzine gambit.

Now here’s a post to make everyone mad. I really don’t blame Roy Moore’s voters for sticking with him and I know they are going to come under withering attacks for standing by their man. They don’t deserve it. Clearly a lot of people would prefer to avoid dealing with how we got to this point of moral decay among conservatives who used to really believe character counted.

Well, just this past Sunday a militant atheist shot up a church in Texas, killing about half the congregation. One of those killed was still in the womb, but the baby gets counted as a person to boost the arguments for gun control, otherwise the baby would just be a fetus.

And many on the left on social media attacked the congregants of the church. Some said they got what they deserved. Meanwhile, the media ran with stories of chainsaws attached to machine guns distorting all the basic facts out of willful ignorance.

A week before, a Muslim ran over a bunch of people in New York while Democrats were patting themselves on the back for showing Trump voters running over muslim kids on television.

A few weeks before that, a CBS lawyer lost her job for mocking the dead in Las Vegas that they deserved what they got after a mass shooting, the motive behind which is still unknown.

While all of this is going on, a cake baker is headed to the Supreme Court because he had the audacity to bake a cake for a gay wedding, but he would not do all the decorations the gay couple wanted. So the baker got compared to a Nazi. He will join a florist at the Court who is being put out of business because despite having gay clients, she won’t provide flowers for gay weddings.

People are being harassed for refusing to cheer on men with mental illness who think they are women and the left thinks people in Alabama should have to let men use the ladies’ bathroom. The left is openly counting the days before churches can have their tax exempt status revoked for not embracing gay marriage. Christian private schools will be the first targets. The media on a near weekly basis runs stories that paint culturally conservative voters in a negative light, often distorting basic facts for the sake of narrative.

So you’ll have to excuse Trump voters and Moore voters for thinking the left in this country with a complicit media is out to get them.

Along comes a story about Roy Moore, a happily married man, that involves facts from 30 to 40 years ago and many of the same people who’ve spent a long time covering for people like Harvey Weinstein and are still covering for Hollywood pedophiles are piling on the man. The GOP, who hates cultural conservatives anyway, was quick to pile on.

I don’t blame the Roy Moore voters for thinking people are out to get them because people really are out to get them.

Moore is a fighter for these people. He purports to share their values. And all the people his voters hate happen to hate Roy Moore. They talk about innocence until proven guilty, but they’re ready to run Moore out of town. I don’t blame Moore’s voters, but I do have to blame those who are trying to defend Moore and dismiss the accusations or attack the women coming forward. Conservatism keeps being degraded by a bunch of people who talk Jesus and behave like Satan.

Y’all, I think the facts of the case as presented by the Washington Post are pretty damning. If I were a voter in Alabama, I would probably have to sit it out. But there are a lot of voters who are really damn tired of the culture war and they just want to be left alone. But the left won’t leave them alone. They’re coming for their churches’ tax exempt status. They are coming to force them to either get on board the secular progressive agenda or go into hiding. They are coming for their kids and their guns as well.

So now you are telling them they are really awful, bad people if they stick with Roy Moore instead of allowing into office a man who will side with the people who are out to get them?

I suspect they’ll take your aspersions and hate. They already think you hate them. And because the other side will accept nothing less than the destruction of their way of life, even if they want to walk away from Roy Moore they can’t. Because the other side is bent on their destruction and they think, rightly, that Roy Moore is the only one standing with them.

So we have the luxury of turning our nose up at it. And we can say character counts. But they believe character and morals count too and while they might find Moore’s actions reprehensible, they know the other side won’t be happy until their kids are brainwashed into thinking boys can be girls, a baby’s brains can be harvested with taxpayer subsides, and guns should be made extinct.

You really want to make them choose? You helped cause an existential crisis where they have every good reason to believe their way of life and their values are at stake and you want them to surrender? I can’t blame them for refusing even if I disagree. If you’re demanding the other side surrender in the culture war, don’t be surprised when they’re willing to stand with people they’d never otherwise consider in the name of protecting themselves and their families.",Erick Erickson: I don't blame Roy Moore voters for sticking with him,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/10/erick-erickson-dont-blame-roy-moore-voters-for-sticking-with-him.html

The original DeltaWing coupe is up for sale. The needle-nose prototype racer competed for several years on the endurance racing circuit, where it was out to prove the merits of its innovative, efficient design.

The aerodynamic, lightweight concept was first developed as a single-seat Indycar proposal that was half the weight and twice as efficient as traditional cars, but it morphed into a sports car after the series decided to stick with a more conventional design.

A modified open-top DeltaWing was then entered as an experimental car in the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans, before this coupe version was built by Panoz-owned DeltaWing Racing to take part in what was then called the American Le Mans Series.

Weighing around 1,400 pounds, the DeltaWing has two narrow tires mounted close together in the front, a 1.9-liter 4-cylinder turbocharged engine in the rear and could keep the pace with heavier but more powerful cars while using less fuel and tires. Its best finish was 4th place at the 2014 Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta, near DeltaWing headquarters in Braselton.

Three of the cars were built and raced before rules changes for the 2017 season forced them into retirement. One of the others was destroyed in a crash at Daytona, while the last is on display in the Panoz Historic Racing Museum at the Chateau Elan Winery and Resort near Panoz headquarters, where various road cars based on the DeltaWing layout have been engineered over the years.

This one isn’t eligible to be entered in any professional racing series, but would surely get the most attention at a track day or historic event, especially wrapped in its “God Bless America” stars and stripes livery.

“He looked at a woman standing next to me, ten years my senior, pointed to me and said: ‘You should f--k her to make her realize she’s gay.’ He was the film’s director, Brett Ratner.”

“He ‘outed’ me with no regard for my well-being, an act we all recognize as homophobic.”

Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.","At least 26 people were killed and 20 wounded in Texas after a gunman dressed in tactical gear opened fire at a church outside San Antonio on Sunday, investigators confirmed.

Multiple sources speaking to Fox News identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley. The mass shooting unfolded around 11:30 a.m. at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio.

Investigators said at a news conference Sunday evening that the victims ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. One official said about 20 people were hospitalized with injuries ranging from minor to ""very severe.""

Sunday's massacre is the deadliest church shooting in modern U.S. history. It is also, according to Gov. Greg Abbott, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history.

A possible motive was unclear. Kelley lived in a suburb of San Antonio and didn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. The official said investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show a semiautomatic weapon.

A spokesperson with the U.S. Air Force confirmed to Fox News that Kelley served in the military branch at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until a bad conduct discharge in 2014.

He was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and child, and when he was discharged received 12 months of confinement and a reduction in military rank.

""It is horrible,"" Wilson County Commissioner Larry Wiley told Fox News of the massacre. ""It appears someone walked in and started shooting.""

Around 11:20 a.m., Kelley arrived at a Valero gas station across from the First Baptist Church dressed in black tactical gear and a ballistic vest. He crossed the street and started firing a Ruger AR rifle at the church, officials said. He entered the building and kept shooting.

He was confronted by an armed nearby resident who chased after him. Kelley was later found dead, roughly five miles away in Guadalupe County, according to Wiley. It's unclear whether Kelley was killed by police or the armed resident, or from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

""We have accepted a multiple number of patients from the shooting,"" Megan Posey, a spokeswoman for Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, 15 miles from the church, told Fox News.

Some victims were transported to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, KSAT reported.

Officials said 23 people were found deceased in First Baptist Church, while two were found dead outside. One person who was transported to a hospital later died.

One of those killed was 14-year-old Annabelle Pomeroy, the church pastor's daughter.

The FBI is investigating the shooting, in addition to multiple other agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The San Antonio Express-News reported police were checking the gunman's home for explosives following the shooting.

The church's layout would've made it difficult for churchgoers to flee a shooter who came through the front door, according to a congregant attending a vigil at the church Sunday night.

The church was described as having only small exits on the side and in the back, according to Hunter Green. He said if a gunman came through the front door, people ""wouldn't have had anywhere to go.""

Neighbors of Kelley's told The Associated Press they heard gunfire coming from his direction in recent days.

""It's really loud,"" 16-year-old Ryan Albers said. ""It was someone using automatic weapon fire.""

Another neighbor, who argued hearing gunfire in the area is not uncommon, said they had heard gunfire coming from across the street, but couldn't be sure if it was from Kelley's property.

Attorney General Paxton told Fox News that ""people never think"" a shooting like this can ""happen in their communities.""

""In a small town ... I can imagine that these people are devastated. And everyone in the community is going to ... have some type of close relationship"" to those either killed or injured at the First Baptist Church. He added it's ""hard to justify why anyone would do this.""

""This is horrific for our tiny little tight-knit town,"" Alena Berlanga, who lives 10 minutes outside of Sutherland Springs told The Associated Press. ""Everybody's going to be affected and everybody knows someone who's affected.""

President Trump, speaking from Tokyo during his trip to Asia, called the shooting an ""act of evil,"" and added: ""Through the tears and through the sadness, we stand strong.""

Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.""

Gov. Abbott said in a statement that ""While the details of this horrific act are still under investigation, Cecilia and I want to send our sincerest thoughts and prayers to all those who have been affected by this evil act.""

""I want to thank law enforcement for their response and ask that all Texans pray for the Sutherland Springs community during this time of mourning and loss,"" the statement read.

Sutherland Springs has a population of about 400 residents.

Sunday's shooting comes just over a month after 58 people were killed and hundreds injured on Oct. 1 after a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas.

The Telegraph, who referred to the man’s actions as a “mutiny,” reports that 53-year-old Alain Jan and his wife boarded a Costa cruise bound for the Vanilla Islands of the Indian Ocean on Oct. 26. After two days of travel, however, the captain announced that three scheduled stops in Madagascar had been canceled due to an outbreak of the bubonic and pneumonic plague on the island nation.

""We said OK, it's for health reasons,” Jan told Le Parisen, reasoning that there were other stops planned for other cities in Madagascar, as well as a stop in Mauritius.

VIRGIN VOYAGES TO LAUNCH ADULTS-ONLY CRUISE EXPERIENCE IN 2020

The next day, those stops were canceled as well. But as a consolation, passengers were told they’d be credited with 150 euro, or around $175, to spend aboard the ship.

Angered by the news — and reasoning that even a beverage aboard the ship could cost upwards of $5 — Jan rallied his fellow passengers in a protest at one of the ship’s restaurants. ""There were 60 of us banging our fists on the table to alert other cruise passengers to this con job,"" said Jan, who reasoned that the cruise liner must have known that they couldn’t stop in Madagascar or Mauritius before the trip started, but deliberately failed to notify passengers before the voyage.

The passengers staged another protest later that evening, forcing the captain to call the authorities in the Seychelles. According to Jan, a police chief boarded the ship, listened to both men’s version of events, and ultimately escorted Jan and his wife off the cruise liner at the captain’s request.

VENICE SAYS CRUISE SHIPS NO LONGER WELCOME NEAR CITY CENTER

Jan, however, finally got the stop-off he was hoping for.

""I spent two nights in a hotel in the Seychelles with my wife, then were flown home paid for by Costa. That's how I was freed from the floating prison,"" Jan told Le Parisien.

He further claims that upon returning home — Jan lives on the island of Reunion — he met with other passengers from the cruise, who agreed that they were treated “like cattle” and “ripped off,” the Telegraph reports.

Meanwhile, Costa Cruises maintains that they “made every effort” to keep to their schedule, but were unable to do so due to health concerns, according to a statement obtained by the Telegraph. The company added that authorities on Mauritius were the ones who insisted that passengers stay quarantined on the ship.

""Given the delays that would have created, and even longer ones if there were any suspect cases on board, and considering that passengers were already on board, the company was forced to restrict its trip to the Seychelles and Reunion,"" said the statement.

A Reddit user and Old Navy shopper is claiming that the store recently screwed up his online order and mistakenly mailed him 40 pounds of security tags instead of the two shirts he ordered for his kids.

Sharing his story earlier this week, the shopper — who goes by Mgbgtv8 on Reddit — said he was actually home when UPS came by to drop off the package, but assumed it was something his wife had ordered separately.

“I opened the door, saw my wife's name on label, pushed the box with my foot and thought, ‘That's my wife's problem,'” he wrote.

Eventually, he opened the box, only to discover the aforementioned security tags and what appeared to be an expired $60 coupon. He later took to Reddit to share a photo of the discovery, much to the Internet’s delight.

“Some security person is going to be really bummed when they open a box with just 2 shirts,” joked one user.

“Go to a mall and drop one in every purse and bag you see and watch chaos ensue,” suggested another.

URBAN OUTFITTERS BLASTED FOR 'ARMY FASHION' LINE

Since sharing his post, several other Reddit users shared their similar stories with online orders, including one who claims he ordered ramen soup from Amazon only to receive an external hard drive, and another who claims to have received urinary tract testing kits instead of eye drops.

Mgbgtv8 later explained that he called up a local Old Navy to see about bringing the tags back, but they instructed him to contact customer service. A representative was eventually able to resolve the situation, telling him they’d send over his shirts and a $20 coupon.

She also said she’d send over a return label for the tags, telling him he could “send them back … or not.”

It’s still unclear exactly how Mgbgtv8 ended up with the 40 pounds of security tags, but a former Old Navy employee hypothesized that the tags were supposed to be sent between Old Navy shipping facilities, and somehow got slapped with the wrong label.

The bodies of a man, woman, teenage girl and young boy were found Thursday night inside their home in the northern city of Mapleton, police Chief John Jackson said.

Officers were called to the home around 9 p.m. after neighbors reported that the family had not been seen for days but the lights stayed on and their cars had not moved. One member of the family had not shown up to work for several days, Jackson said.

The officers received no answer at the front door, but they were concerned and removed a window to get inside. Officers then found the four bodies and a dead dog that also had been shot.

""As officers looked around the home they observed things that caused them concern,"" the chief told the Deseret News . ""One of the things that caught their attention was neighbors had said they have a dog that when somebody knocks on the door is very aggressive and barks. They didn't get any of that.""

Jackson said the position of the bodies inside the home led investigators to believe it was a murder suicide, but he declined to offer more information about the scene.

He did not offer details about what may have led to the killings or how they unfolded. Police did not release the identities of the family because investigators were still notifying other family members of the deaths.

The chief said the family had moved to the town a few months earlier, and police had not had any prior interactions with them.

The teenage girl had recently enrolled as a sophomore at Maple Mountain High School, and counselors had been made available to students and faculty, Nebo School District spokeswoman Lana Hiskey told the Salt Lake Tribune.

Tom Barbour, who received the burger, informed the sheriff’s office of Lewis’ kindness and asked them for help to find a way he could do a kind act of his own. He wanted to use his company, CertaPro Painters, to paint someone’s home.

CRAIGSLIST FOUNDER: SUPPORT MILITARY FAMILIES, AND I'LL MATCH YOUR DONATIONS TO ONE GROUP HELPING THEM

The sheriff’s office, after some deliberation, told Barbour of James Martin, a local Army veteran, who has wanted to paint his home for years, the Tulsa World reported.

According to Regalado, Martin served for 15 years in the Army and as a result of his service in the Middle East, has had at least six major surgeries. But it hasn’t stopped him from giving back to his community and fellow veterans.

Martin founded Wounded Veterans of Oklahoma, which teams up with veterans for hunting, fishing and camping trips so they can speak with others about their experiences in the military and help provide some relief.

“Veterans are truly this nation’s most valued treasure,” Regalado said. “James has earned the right to sit back and just enjoy life. Yet through Wounded Veterans of Oklahoma, he continues to sacrifice for the benefit of others who have served this country with honor and pride.”

VETERANS DAY: WE HONOR THE 20 MILLION VETERANS WITH US TODAY AND THE MILLIONS MORE IN OUR PAST

On Thursday, Sheriff Vic Regalado surprised Martin with the gift. He had asked Martin to speak to his deputies about his organization -- while back at Martin's home Barbour was hard at work.

“This is a complete shock,” Martin told the Tulsa World. “It’s amazing how things work.”

Martin called the gift a “blessing.”

“Small acts of kindness for people who serve can be life changing,” he said. “One of the biggest struggles people face in the military and…first responders and police officers face is ‘do people really appreciate what we’re going through?’”

If the projects by the Times and other groups are right, it will be easier for critics to brand the effort as mainly helping the wealthy.

“This is a particularly extreme case because you have a professor trying to wipe away the chalk himself,” Barham said.","A California professor who is seen on video trying to censor pro-life students drawing with sidewalk chalk has been ordered to undergo First Amendment training and pay $17,000 as a result of a district court settlement.

Fresno State University public health professor Dr. Gregory Thatcher recruited students from his class to help deface the Fresno State Students for Life sidewalk chalk.

Thatcher allegedly harassed and intimidated the group, accusing them of chalking outside the free speech zone on campus -- which hadn't existed at the school since 2015.

“What the professor did was wrong, and the only permit a student needs to speak on campus is the First Amendment,” the pro-life club’s president, Bernadette Tasy, told Fox News.

The chalk messages encouraged students on campus to seek pro-life health care options.

Tasy captured an exchange between herself and Thatcher in a video clip of the incident.

“Free speech is free speech in the free speech area,” Thatcher is heard telling Tasy. “It’s a pretty simple concept, okay? This does not constitute a free speech area. Okay?”

After Tasy insisted they had permission from the university, Thatcher started erasing the chalk with his shoe.

“You have permission to put it down, and I have permission to get rid of it. This is our part of free speech. College campuses are not free speech areas,” Thatcher said, “Do you understand? Obviously you don’t understand.”

As part of the settlement, in which Alliance Defending Freedom represented FSSL, Thatcher will pay $1,000 to Tasy and $1,000 to another student, Jesus Herrera, along with some attorneys’ fees. The professor is also required to undergo First Amendment training to be provided by ADF.

Thatcher told Fox News he won’t have to pay a penny out of his own pocket because the settlement was made through his insurance company.

“I did not, in any way, admit to any wrongdoing,” Thatcher said. “I did agree to sit through a training seminar because I love to learn others’ thoughts and opinions.”

But Tasy said it’s not about the money.

“The important thing is that Dr. Thatcher won’t be able to interfere with our expressive activities again,” she said.

Tasy was “really shocked” that a professor would behave like that – especially at a public university.

“Public university professors should be encouraging free speech and not erasing it from existence,” she said.

Travis Barham, ADF Legal Counsel, said Thatcher was “in a league of his own” with such a flagrant violation of the First Amendment.

“This is a particularly extreme case because you have a professor trying to wipe away the chalk himself,” Barham said. “Far too often university officials try to play the role of speech police and try to restrict what can be said and where it can be said on campus.”

Fresno State University did not respond to request for comment. Thatcher remains listed as faculty in the Department of Public Health, as noted by the College Fix.",Pro-life student group wins settlement after professor tries to kick away chalk messages,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/10/pro-life-student-group-wins-settlement-after-professor-tries-to-kick-away-chalk-messages.html

“As a brand, we feel we have a strong sense of social responsibility to support young women and inspire confidence. So we’re on a mission to do just that by showing our audience it’s okay to be yourself, embrace your ‘flaws,’ celebrate individuality, and not strive for what the world perceives as perfection. Because basically, it doesn’t exist,” the brand’s creative manager Samantha Helligso told the Daily Mail earlier this week.

“By showing imagery that's real and authentic, we want to show it's more than okay to be yourself. All you have is what you've got, so own it every day,” she added.

Toulouse prosecutor Pierre-Yves Couilleau told reporters that three students were injured on Friday when the motorist drove into the group, near a university campus in the city of Blagnac.

Couilleau said the driver claimed he acted deliberately and was arrested. Sky News reported the suspect told police he “heard voices telling him to hurt someone” before he was taken into custody.



An attempted murder investigation has been opened, Couilleau said.

The prosecutor said the driver was known to police for about 10 minor crimes and not listed on a French register of people suspected of being radicalized by extremists.



The case was not been referred to France's counterterrorism prosecutors.

According to two police officials, the suspect was born in 1989 and known to suffer from a psychiatric disorder. The officials said he lived near the university.

The three people hurt are Chinese students ages 22 and 23, police officials said. Two were taken to a hospital with injuries that were considered serious, but not life-threatening. The third suffered more minor injuries.

The police officials requested anonymity because they were not allowed to speak publicly about an ongoing investigation.

Ellie Miguel, David King’s granddaughter, shared the plan and photos her grandfather and his dog, Lil Fee, on Twitter, where they quickly gained attention.

“My grandpa is losing his battle with cancer so the nurses helped my grandma sneak their dog into the hospital to say goodbye,” Miguel wrote alongside the Nov. 7 tweet.

Miguel did not disclose which hospital her grandfather had been staying at, nor what his exact diagnosis was, but told Yahoo Lifestyle that he was concerned he wouldn’t get to say goodbye to his loyal companion.

“My grandpa loved his dog Lil Fee,” she told the news outlet. “She would follow him around everywhere. He would bring her everywhere he could. My grandpa had been battling cancer for the past couple of years, but last week it took over his whole body.”

While Miguel’s grandmother brought pictures of Lil Fee to put up in his hospital room, the family knew a visit would be more meaningful for King.

“The nurses always heard my grandma talking about Lil Fee. So they encouraged her and helped her get the dog in,” Miguel told Yahoo Lifestyle. “They had my aunt carry the dog in a really big purse. For the first time that day, he moved his arm in attempts to pet his Lil Fee. It was a moment I’ll never forget.”

For many Americans, this was axiomatic. However, in this cynical era, you are often judged by who you know or who knows you. In some sense, this is a Kafkaesque arrangement where judgments and the assignment of guilt are made without knowledge or forethought.

Take, for example, the stories emanating from revelations of the Paradise Papers. This massive trove of 13.4 million records was founded 100 years ago and operates in various points around the globe managing the assets of very wealthy people. Reflecting millions of loans, financial transactions and e-mails, the data reveal how wealthy individuals manage their portfolios.

Recently a German newspaper, Süddeutsche Zeitung, unraveled the connections indicating how the wealthy sometimes avoid taxes and make business deals.

Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, was caught in the web of these revelations. Despite divesting himself of most business interests when he joined the Trump cabinet, he kept a shipping company, Navigator Holdings, through a chain of companies in the Cayman Islands. Discussing Ross’ Paradise Papers file Jon Swaine of the Guardian noted that Navigator is a company operated by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s son-in-law an allegation that put Ross in the journalistic crosshairs.

The very mention of a transaction in which Russia is included is now branded “collusion.”

Navigator is paid $20 million a year to ship gas out of Russia for a Russian company named Sibur and Sibur is co-owned by Kirill Shamalov, Putin’s son-in-law. Commenting on this matter, Ross said “there is nothing whatsoever improper about Navigator having a relationship with Sibur.” He continued, “The fact that it happens to be called a Russian company does not mean that there’s any evil in it.” That is true on several levels.

This is a third party transaction in which the investor through a holding company joined a deal worth at least $200 a year. Mr. Ross probably knew very little about the transaction and, my guess is, he was unaware of any Russian involvement.

Moreover, the deal does not violate any laws, nor is there any suspicion that is the case. It would appear as if this is a witch hunt in which any reference to Russia is a form of collusion. Clearly this falls into the category of “false news.” But it has even darker implications.

The very mention of a transaction in which Russia is included is now branded “collusion.” You might even describe this phenomenon as contemporary McCarthyism, albeit McCarthy made allegations about those who joined the Communist Party as opposed to present claims that have a gossamer thin relationship to Russian officials.

My guess is these claims aren’t going anywhere, certainly not into the hands of Mr. Mueller, the Special Counsel. But these violations of privacy and reputation should not be overlooked. It is precisely the frivolous investigations of this kind that discourage good people from government service.

The Paradise Papers are certainly not the Pumpkin Papers and, in time, their salacious stories will be replaced. Unfortunately, it will leave in its wake a number of unsubstantiated claims and reputations that have been unfairly besmirched.",Welcome to the new McCarthyism,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/10/welcome-to-new-mccarthyism.html

People crowded inside the By His Grace pantry, tearfully hugging and filling bags with donated bakery goods, groceries and used clothing.

The pantry's director, Lula White, was among those killed in the shooting Sunday at First Baptist Church. White was also the 71-year-old grandmother of the gunman's wife.

As 68-year-old Brandy Johnson walked in, she flinched and she said she could ""see Lu at the desk."" White ""had a heart as big as Texas,"" she said.

Judy Green, along with her husband, Rod, have operated the pantry for 11 years. She said she has slept little since Sunday, waking up screaming from nightmares. The couple, who were married at the church, were not at the service Sunday but later watched as worshippers were carried out in body bags.

""It is fresh in my mind. I see it all — just over and over and over,"" Judy Green said.

Deana Cassel, who is 52 and a lung cancer patient, wiped away tears as she helped straighten piles of used clothing. She said volunteering at the pantry had given her a sense of purpose and a way to channel her grief about losing friends in the shooting.

""There's a lot of poverty in this area, but people don't only come here for something to eat. These people make them think they have someone in their life,"" she said, gesturing toward the Greens.

Law enforcement officials have reopened the intersection where the First Baptist Church stands, but black mesh material was tied to the chain-link fence surrounding it. With the bullet-ridden church door open, a tall wooden cross could be seen at the altar.

At annual Veterans Day observances Saturday, the church victims with military backgrounds will receive a full military salute on the grounds of the community hall, said Alice Garcia, president of the unincorporated town's community association.

""Everyone in the community is doing what they can, but honestly everyone feels so helpless,"" 20-year-old Karyssa Calbert of neighboring Floresville, Texas, said at the hall.

Before the church is demolished, it will serve as a temporary memorial, said Rod Green, who also serves as the grounds steward for the church.

The building will be scrubbed down and white-washed, and chairs will be placed inside — one to commemorate each of the dead.

Green said services will never take place there again. He said the church plans to build a new structure on property it owns elsewhere. Services will be held Sunday at the community hall.

Pastor Frank Pomeroy told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this week that it would be too painful to continue using First Baptist Church as a place of worship.

Other sites of mass shootings have been torn down, including Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012. A new school was built elsewhere.

A one-room Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was torn down in 2006, 10 days after an assailant took children hostage and shot and killed five girls ages 6 to 13. The previous site of the school is now a pasture. A nearly identical schoolhouse with a security fence was erected nearby and named New Hope School.

Devin Patrick Kelley shot and killed 25 people at the church. Authorities have put the official toll at 26, because one of the victims was pregnant.

Kelley died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being shot and chased by two residents when he was leaving the church, authorities said.

Meanwhile, funerals have started. On Thursday, more than 500 people attended a private service at a San Antonio-area Air Force base for Scott and Karen Marshall, a husband and wife who both served in the military, said Randy Martin, spokesman for the 12th Flying Training Wing.

Eleven people remained hospitalized Friday with wounds from the shooting.

MOORE SCANDAL RAISES NEW DOUBTS ABOUT BANNON

If President Trump, a relative political novice, had a better handle on the Alabama Senate race than the man molding his party’s Senate slate for 2018, what does that say about the GOP’s chances in the next year?

Steve Bannon’s urging that Alabama Republicans throw aside an incumbent Republican with a perfect voting record on the president’s issues in favor of former Judge Roy Moore was dubious even before allegations of sexual misconduct with teenagers emerged against now-nominee Moore.

Now, with the claim that Moore as a prosecuting attorney picked up a 14-year-old girl waiting outside of a family court hearing, Bannon’s choice seems downright disastrous.

The former “Seinfeld” producer turned online political agitator turned Trump advisor now functions as sort of the shadow RNC chairman. Anointed by his fellow nationalists and the mainstream press as the architect of a reconstruction of the party, Bannon is trying to replicate his efforts in Alabama in races up and down the ballot and from coast to coast.

The specter facing Republicans today is the possibility that Bannon is not a political genius, evil or otherwise.

Occam’s razor applies pretty relentlessly in the question of candidate selection. And Sen. Luther Strange was the obvious answer in Alabama, at least for the larger purposes of the president, his party and its agenda.

Moore’s many defects as a candidate were well known when his race with Strange began. But given Moore’s strong support among religious conservatives and Strange’s connections to disgraced former Gov. Robert Bentley, the pistol-packing former prosecutor emerged as the frontrunner.

It’s unclear whether Bannon’s boosterism made the difference for Moore, but his fundraising clout and the attention he brought certainly didn’t hurt.

The original concern Republicans had about Moore was that his positions on criminalizing same-sex relations, the fitness of Muslims for federal office and other subjects would be made into an albatross necklace for other Republicans in 2018.

Think of Todd Akin in a Stetson.

As it turns out, it will be much, much worse than that.

The allegations against Moore would have been painful at any time, but coming as they do at a moment when the national discussion is fixed on the subject of men in positions of authority exploiting those younger and less powerful, it’s a disaster.

Moore’s supporters are standing by him as he endures what his brother said is a persecution “like Jesus Christ.” Many on Moore’s side say the charges aren’t true while others say it wouldn’t matter if they are since Moore was unmarried at the time and his alleged actions were limited to kissing and fondling, not intercourse.

That should give you an idea about how this is going to go. Moore’s entire political brand is based on adamancy in support of unpopular positions. One would imagine that goes double here. The national party is cutting some ties to Moore, but it’s easy to see him remaining in the race no matter how much pressure he faces.

Then, Republicans face two unhappy scenarios: Moore wins anyway and is a hit machine for Democrats at least through the remainder of the term, which through 2020. Or, Moore loses and Republicans see their already narrow majority shrink to just one vote.

So which is the better outcome between Scylla and Charybdis? If this race does turn into a Dixiefied variant of the Massachusetts special Senate election of 2010 and Democrats pull off an unlikely win in a deep red state, at least Republicans can brush off Moore before 2018 races start in battleground states. If he wins, he will presumably intend on skunking up the GOP garden party like never before.

Presumably, Bannon did not know about these claims when he dove in to oppose the president’s pick in last month’s primary runoff. It can’t be incumbent on every political strategist to know every detail about the candidates they pick. But just based on what was publically known about Moore’s positions and personality, Bannon was making a risky choice in service of a goal of questionable value.

His bitter feud with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell no doubt generates a lot of contributions and clicks for Bannon and his team, but for a party that’s struggling with majority so mightily it seems like it should be a lower-order issue.

The president and his team have seemingly decided to let Bannon have his way and play kingmaker in races far and wide. He acts with the tacit approval of the White House and some of the presidents’ donor base behind him. If one thinks of Bannon as the genius behind the Trump win, it makes some sense.

But staring at the debacle in Alabama, Trump & Co. must be having some deeper concerns about Bannon’s strategic acumen and the relative merits of his plan. If Bannon was more lucky than good in 2016, giving him such a wide berth could be bad news for 2020.

TIME OUT: FOR THE LIVING

In honor of Veterans Day, we take you back to the opening of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. NYT: “On Nov. 10, 1982, the first visitors toured the newly completed Vietnam Veterans Memorial near the National Mall in Washington. Commonly called ‘The Wall,’ the memorial features a long V-shaped expanse bearing the names of all United States service members killed during the conflict in Vietnam/Southeast Asia. The New York Times on Nov. 11 reported that the memorial sparked emotional responses from visitors: ‘But it is already clear that the wall has touched a much more basic and human strain of response, the simple act of touching the wall as much as reading the names.’ … The memorial’s designer, Maya Lin, a 21-year-old Yale University student, won a national contest that received more than 1,400 submissions. She sought to create a memorial that avoided the politics and controversies of the war because, in her words, ‘the politics had eclipsed the veterans, their service and their lives.’”

Trump net job-approval rating: -19.4 points

Change from one week ago: down 1.2 points

[President Trump’s score is determined by subtracting his average job disapproval rating in the five most recent, methodologically sound public polls from his average approval rating, calculated in the same fashion.]

SENATE GOP LOOKS FOR WAYS TO AVOID DEBT BOMB IN TAX

Bloomberg: “Republican tax writers in the House and Senate scoured the U.S. tax code Thursday … in an all-day struggle to find ways to pay for the deep tax cuts their leaders and President Donald Trump have promised. … Unless they eliminate the red ink … the legislation will be subject to a 60-vote threshold under Senate rules, which could doom it to failure. … As written, the Senate proposal ‘blows a massive hole in the debt,’ said Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, in a Twitter message Thursday night. A GOP aide to the Finance panel said everything in the proposal that Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch released Thursday is designed to be permanent -- and that any issues related to deficit effects will be fixed. The aide didn’t specify how. The committee is scheduled to begin marking up the bill on Monday, Hatch said.”

Senate tax plan differs on individual rates, timing of corporate rate cut - WSJ:“Senate Republicans’ proposal to rewrite the tax code breaks significantly with the one crafted by the House GOP, confronting party leaders with dozens of differences to reconcile and little time before the year-end deadline they’ve set to pass it. The Senate plan, released late Thursday, contrasts with the House version in key areas, including the timing of a corporate tax-rate cut, the number of individual tax brackets, the details of international tax rules, and the particulars of estate-tax changes.”

Paul Ryan: No ‘Dreamers’ language in spending deal - WashEx: “House Speaker Paul Ryan rejected the idea of adding language to protect so-called Dreamers into a year-end spending deal that Congress must pass in the next few weeks. ‘It should be considered separately on its own merits,’ Ryan told reporters Thursday. That comment was aimed at shutting down calls from Democrats and even some Republicans to add the language into the spending bill that's needed to avoid a partial government shutdown in early December. Thursday morning, a dozen House Republicans joined Democrats by calling for language creating a legislative program similar to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that President Trump has said would be rescinded in March.”

Taxpayer dollars let Congress settle sexual harassment cases in secret - Fox News:“A little-known law has been on the books for more than a decade that gives anyone accusing a federal lawmaker of sexual harassment the right to sue – but only if they consent to a lengthy drawn-out process that includes a written statement within 180 days of the incident, 30 days of counseling and another month or so of mediation. … The money comes from a special U.S. Treasury fund – and the payouts are kept quiet. That means, those found to be at fault are publicly shielded and don’t have to pay a penny out of pocket for settlement costs.”

FLYNN FACING SERIOUS HEAT OVER ALLEGED SHADY DEAL

WSJ: “Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating an alleged plan involving former White House National Security Adviser Mike Flynn to forcibly remove a Muslim cleric living in the U.S. and deliver him to Turkey in return for millions of dollars, according to people familiar with the investigation. Under the alleged proposal, Mr. Flynn and his son, Michael Flynn Jr., were to be paid as much as $15 million for delivering Fethullah Gulen to the Turkish government, according to people with knowledge of discussions Mr. Flynn had with Turkish representatives. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has pressed the U.S. to extradite him, views the cleric as a political enemy.”

Boss at Trump’s data firm says he sought out Assange - WSJ: “The chief executive of Cambridge Analytica contacted the founder of WikiLeaks to ask him to share Hillary Clinton -related emails at the same time that people familiar with the matter say the British data-analytics firm had begun working for President Donald Trump’s campaign. Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix said Thursday he asked the office that handles his speaking engagements to contact WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in ‘early June 2016,’ after reading a newspaper report that WikiLeaks planned to publish a trove of Clinton-related emails. He said Mr. Assange was asked ‘if he might share that information with us.’”

Source: Papadopolus said he lied to cover for Trump - ABC News: “George

Papadopoulos, the Trump foreign policy aide who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, initially misled agents out of what he claimed was loyalty to President Donald Trump, according to a person with direct knowledge of the investigation. Trump had publicly denied that there had been any contact between his campaign and Russian officials, and Papadopoulos did not want to contradict the official line, the source said.”



Trump, Clinton camps both reportedly offered Russia dossier - Reuters: “The same political research firm that prepared a dossier on Trump campaign ties to Russia had unrelated information on Clinton Foundation donors that a Russian lawyer obtained and offered to President Donald Trump’s eldest son last year, three sources familiar with the matter said. The White House and Republican lawmakers have attacked the firm, Fusion GPS, over the dossier compiled by a former British spy that is central to investigations in Congress and by a special counsel into conclusions by U.S. spy agencies that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election and wanted to help Trump win. The sources told Reuters that the negative information that Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya wanted to give to Republican Trump’s campaign at a June 2016 meeting in New York had been dug up by Fusion GPS in an unrelated investigation.”

Kremlin cable channel to register as foreign agent - WSJ: “The Russian state-funded foreign television network RT said Thursday that it would comply with a U.S. Department of Justice request that the channel register as a foreign agent, but announced its intention to fight the designation in court.”



White House: No formal Trump-Putin meeting on Asia trip - AP: “President Donald Trump will not have a formal sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin while the two attend a summit, the White House said Friday shortly before Trump landed in Vietnam, the fourth stop on his first official visit to Asia. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force Once, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders blamed scheduling conflicts on both sides for the fact that the leaders will not meet formally during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit taking place in the coastal city of Danang. But Sanders said it was ‘possible’ and ‘likely’ that they could have a less formal encounter, either in Danang or later in the Philippines when Trump and Putin attend another regional conference.”

Kelly said to be further consolidating power - Politico: “The White House is bracing for another staff shakeup upon President Donald Trump’s return from Asia, with senior-level staff moves that could further consolidate chief of staff John Kelly’s power in the West Wing. Deputy chief of staff Rick Dearborn— a former top aide to Jeff Sessions in the Senate who played a central role during the presidential transition — is expected to be reassigned to the Commerce Department or another federal agency, according to multiple administration officials and outside advisers familiar with plans for the staff change. … Kelly is also preparing to replace his deputy Kirstjen Nielsen, who is awaiting confirmation to fill Kelly’s old job as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. … At the White House, a replacement for Nielsen under discussion is Jim Carroll, a soft-spoken lawyer in the White House counsel’s office who is already in talks to play a new role in the West Wing.”

BERNIE WANTS OVERHAUL AT DNC AHEAD OF 2020

WaPo: “Sen. Bernie Sanders, who declined to engage in the fracas over former Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile’s new tell-all book, is pushing for the DNC to adopt at least four changes to its primary process or risk losing credibility with progressive voters. … Sanders (I-Vt.) said in an interview in his Senate office. … ‘There are some people thinking politically, giving all kinds of reasons [why not] — but those are the issues.’ The focus of Sanders’s mini-campaign is on the DNC’s Unity Reform Commission, created after the 2016 primaries — but before Hillary Clinton’s surprise defeat in the general election — to ease tensions among supporters of the two candidates. On Dec. 8 and 9, the commission will meet for the last time and present recommendations to the full DNC. Sanders’s goal is twofold: To highlight the changes he wants most and to prevent the issue from fading when the full DNC meets again.”

“We are not players in the game. We are umpires – or observers – trying to be objective witnesses to what is going on. That doesn’t mean we’re stenographers. If the president – or anyone we’re covering – says something untrue or does something clearly over the line – we can and should report that. But we shouldn’t be drawn into becoming players on the field – trying to match the people we cover in invective. It’s not our role. We’re not as good at it as they are. And we’re giving up our special place in our democracy. There's enough to report about this president – that we don't need to offer opinions or put our thumb on the scale. Be as straight and accurate and dispassionate as we first learned to be as reporters.” – Chris Wallace, the anchor of “Fox News Sunday” in remarks accepting the International Center for Journalists Founders Award for Excellence in Journalism. Watch the remarks here.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Did ya ever stop and think maybe we need them more to help with Nuko NOKO than to attack them for trade and election meddling, respectively???” – Al DiStefano, Cumming, Ga.



[Ed. note: I’m not saying that the president is wrong to change his policies vis-à-vis China. Politicians always change their positions after election. When you like the change, you call it “growing in office.” When you dislike the change, you say he “broke his promise.” I leave it to you to decide which one the president’s moderating stance on China is. All I’m telling you is that for Rust Belt voters, China is a red-hot issue. And if the president really is shifting his approach to the world’s second-most powerful nation, he will have some making up to do with the voters who switched from blue to red in 2016 because of his message of economic populism.]



“I cannot believe that you are mimicking The New York Times and CNN in their breathless exaggerations of a few Democrat wins Tuesday. You write: ‘As Tuesday’s results in Virginia make clear, affluent suburbanites...seem to have taken a sharp turn against Republicans since a year ago.’ Come on Chris, stop the generalizations based on NO FACTS. The overpaid government bureaucrats in the burbs of Northern Virginia are the swamp incarnate! There was no sudden turn. And New Jersey was never in play for the Republicans. It really makes me mad to see you writing this kind of nonsense.” – V. Harris, Nantucket, Mass.

[Ed. note: I certainly don’t want to make anyone angry, unless it’s absolutely necessary. And I’m afraid in this case it may be because I’d rather have you be upset with me than not have the full picture about what’s happening in the American electorate. As we talked about on Wednesday, the Democratic turnout didn’t just surge in Northern Virginia, but all across the Old Dominion. Now, I agree with Sean Trende who points out that some of the down-ballot carnage for Republicans came in districts that were already really gone for the GOP. But there is plenty of evidence that not only is the Democratic base on the march, but that suburbanites are turning away from the GOP. Democrat Ralph Northam certainly trounced his Republican counterpart in the four counties of Northern Virginia, but he did substantially better in the rest of the state than incumbent Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe did four years ago. That’s driven by a couple factors. First, Northam won a majority of white college graduates (aka suburbanites), a group Trump won last year by four points. Second, Northam outperformed Hillary Clinton among white women by 7 points. That’s a huge change in a single year, especially in an era of intense partisan identity. We saw the same effect in races across the country this week and in special elections over the past year. It’s something akin to what we saw among Republicans before the 2010 midterm wipeout for Democrats. As I said, I don’t ever want to make anyone angry for no good reason. But I think there’s some reason for Republicans to start getting upset.]

HE REFUSED HIS RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT BUT DEADLY

Kansas City Star: “His flatulence stopped one police interrogation, but not a continuing investigation that has resulted in a 24-year-old Kansas City man facing federal gun and drug charges. Sean A. Sykes Jr., is charged in U.S. District Court possession with intent to sell cocaine and being a felon in possession of three firearms, two of which were reported stolen. The charges stem from Kansas City police traffic stops on Sept. 1 and Nov. 5, according to court documents. In his report about the interview, the detective wrote that when asked about his address, ‘Mr. Sykes leaned to one side of his chair and released a loud fart before answering with the address.’ ‘Mr. Sykes continued to be flatulent and I ended the interview,’ the detective wrote.”

Men are taking classes in how to unlearn “toxic masculinity.” The course is called Rethinking Masculinity. Its creators designed it with the goal of helping to prevent sexual assault, which is so much in the news today, as allegations keep surfacing against prominent men.

That got me thinking. Do we need less masculinity – or more?

I look at the people who influenced me most as I was growing up – coaches, priests, my dad – and they were all loaded with what some might label “toxic masculinity.” Yeah, my dad, like most dad‘s in the 1970s, was pretty scary (at least to me and my siblings.)

But somehow I survived childhood and retained enough toxic masculinity to start a family of my own.

But guess what? Masculinity is not toxic after all. In the hands of someone who’s been raised in a religious home, with parents who stayed together, and with the influence of good role models, masculinity can be very positive, indeed.

The qualities that people associate with masculinity – competitiveness, assertiveness, protectiveness, strength – these are all things that society needs. But these qualities are also all things that can be used for good or bad. The issue is not the masculinity, but the guy who is using it.

If you want to help prevent sexual assault, I would think you’re going to want to enlist the help of good men. We’ll be glad to help.

Until now, options for those who have endured an arm amputation have been limited. The quality of prosthetics has been entirely unworthy of the men and women who selflessly serve the country.

DARPA has been doggedly determined to find a way to restore limbs. For more than 10 years, this military bastion of innovation has paved the way and funded the best advances to deliver limbs that would far better restore capabilities.

The aim doesn’t stop there. In the Revolutionizing Prosthetics DARPA program, their vision is to also restore intuitive use of the new limbs with near natural control– even through thought control.

The hope is that these limbs will be so good that a service member’s options will be limitless – and that they may even return to duty if they so wish.

LUKE

One of the exciting advances for those who have lost an arm is the LUKE (Life Under Kinetic Evolution) available through Mobius Bionics.

NORTH KOREA: WILL MINI NUKES BECOME AN OPTION FOR TRUMP?

With far better capabilities, LUKE allow users to do many things again for the first time since they lost the arm. It can translate muscle signals into complex arm motions.

Developed by DEKA Research & Development Corp., and funded by DARPA, it is the very first arm cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

About 100 wounded veterans played a vital role in this breakthrough. During development, they assisted by testing the LUKE and providing feedback. More than 10,000 hours went into honing it into the arm.

And it is now commercially available for everyone and available by prescription.

WILL THE US UNLEASH REVOLUTIONARY 'LIGHTNINGSTRIKE' DRONE ON FUTURE ENEMIES?

LUKE is compatible with a range of amputation levels including shoulder, above the elbow and below the elbow. And an amazing breakthrough for wounded warriors as well as those with amputations from other causes such as diabetes, trauma and cancer.

PODCAST: HEAR HOW THIS NAVY SEAL WENT FROM WAR ZONES TO MOVIE STAR

The Need

Since 9/11, it is believed more than 1,600 American warfighters have lost hands, arms, feet or legs.

In war zones, enemies of the U.S. have deployed vicious means of attack, like hidden IEDs, that have caused horrific wounds requiring amputations.

The impact of limb loss can be devastating. In addition to physical challenges, it can have profound psychological, social and economic, social and psychological consequences.

How is LUKE different?

The LUKE arm will give wounded warriors the chance to do more complex movements with precision.

POWERFUL TINY TANKS WITH VR AND FUTURISTIC COCKPITS COULD REVOLUTIONIZE THE BATTLEFIELD

This enhanced precision, greater strength and better range will make daily activities much easier. LUKE provides a shoulder with better range, a hand that can manage both fragile and heavy items, a wrist with more dexterity and an elbow with far more strength.

With this prosthetic advance, users will have the strength to take a heavy grocery bag out of the trunk, carry it into the house from the car and heave it onto a high countertop.

Users can take advantage of the enhanced precision for tasks that require dexterity and a gentle touch such as taking something delicate like an egg out of the fridge and delivering it to the stove to make an omelet – and without the egg breaking on the way.

The LUKE arm can also do things like pour a glass of orange juice in the morning and hold a glass without spilling.

SLIME OF 300-MILLION-YEAR-OLD CREATURE MAY BE USED FOR BODY ARMOR

The better range means users can now reach behind their backs or for something on the top shelf over their heads.

PODCAST: FIND OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT MILITARY DRONES WITH THIS ARMY INTEL OPERATIVE

How does it work?

The central control tech harnesses signals. Electromyogram (EMG) electrodes detect electrical signals from the user’s muscles. Pattern recognition tech then interprets these nerve signals and translates them into the intended arm movement.

This approach is definitely not new. The breakthrough has been just how much this tech can translate from the nerve signals and communicate to the LUKE, giving the user much better control, strength and movement.

The design incorporates multiple motors, which are key delivering the technology’s capabilities. LUKE can deliver 10 powered degrees of freedom.

To control the limb, LUKE users have a number of different input devices and approaches they can choose to use. Surface EMG electrodes and pressure switches is one option.

WILL COMBAT VEHICLES USE URINE FOR FUEL?

Another option is the foot control device, which is generally worn on top of shoes. This was the choice of the first two veterans to receive the LUKE through prescription. The IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) foot controls enable the users to intuitively control the LUKE movements.

There are a number of grasp patterns available and the user can turn them on and off depending on what is needed for the activities ahead.

It was also designed with other practical daily challenges in mind like weather and terrain. The LUKE can be worn outside and will be fine in conditions like light rain.

What’s next?

Now bomb robots are benefiting from the extraordinary advances made by the LUKE project too. These robots are using the LUKE hand capabilities to do their job better.

With bomb robots more capable of stopping dangerous explosive threats, this means that humans do not have to be put in harm’s way to complete the task. Not only can this save lives, it will also help prevent suffering and amputations in the future.

Thanks to DARPA and Mobius Bionics this breakthrough is now commercially available. Mobius is now finally able to accept requests from veterans.

In fact, the very Israelis who are most supportive of gay rights are also the most supportive of Palestinian rights.
Yes, Israel has defended its citizens against terrorist attacks by underage Palestinians because Palestinian terrorist leaders deliberately recruit underage Palestinians.
Likewise, I would oppose censoring Taylor’s anti-Semitic op-ed.
I agree that there is a vast difference between “actual anti-Semitism” and “legitimate criticism of Israel.” But Taylor is not merely criticizing Israel.","A recent op-ed by Matthew Taylor in the Daily Californian – the student newspaper at the University of California, Berkeley – levels an anti-Semitic attack against me and falsely states that I have blood on my hands and am “culpable of the perpetuation of … atrocities” by Israel. The student newspaper refuses to publish my factual response to its attack, so I am doing so in this piece.

In his op-ed, Taylor criticizes a cartoonist at his student newspaper for caricaturing me as a predatory spider “crushing a Palestinian with one foot and holding up an IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) soldier who assassinates a Palestinian civilian,” with blood on my hands. But at the same time, Taylor says the cartoon was “fair criticism.”

In support of his conclusion, Taylor proclaims – without citing any evidence – that Israel is “in fact an egregious human rights abuser,” murders unarmed and innocent civilians, including “underage Palestinians,” commits “intentional…atrocities” and engages in “pinkwashing.”

He calls me a “privileged professor who is culpable for the perpetuation of Israel’s atrocities,” despite my long record of advocating a peaceful two-state outcome between Israel and the Palestinians.

I would not usually reply to such ignorance and oversimplified attacks. But because these false accusations have become a staple of hard-left attacks singling out only the nation-state of the Jewish people for such defamation, I will disprove each of them in turn.

Let me begin with “pinkwashing.” The accusation that Israel is “pinkwashing” it’s bad treatment of Palestinians by its good treatment of gays is a new variation on a discredited old theme.

The core characteristic of anti-Semitism is the assertion that everything the Jews do is wrong, and everything that is wrong is done by the Jews. That is the bigoted thesis of the anti-Israel campaign whose supporters absurdly claim that Israel is engaging in “pinkwashing.”

Bigots such as Taylor hate Israel more than they care about gay rights, so they would apparently prefer to see Israel treat gays the way Israel’s enemies do. To the unthinking anti-Semite, it doesn’t matter how the Jewish manipulation works.



The anti-Semite just knows that there must be something sinister at work if Jews do anything positive. The same is now true for the unthinking anti-Israel bigot. In fact, the very Israelis who are most supportive of gay rights are also the most supportive of Palestinian rights. Pinkwashing is an anti-Semitic canard.

Moreover, Taylor argues that Israel commits “intentional” atrocities against innocent Palestinians including children. The reality is that the Israeli military’s efforts to stop Hamas from indiscriminately killing Israeli citizens with rockets and through terror tunnels has been the opposite of indiscriminate, as Col. Richard Kemp and other military experts have attested.

Kemp has argued that no other country in history has gone to such great lengths as Israel to distinguish between military and civilian targets, even in the face of an enemy that regularly uses its own population as human shields, and that hides military equipment in schools and hospitals.

Israel’s efforts to protect its citizens compare favorably to military bombing campaigns led by the U.S. and NATO in Iraq, Syria, and other areas in which civilians have also been used as human shields. Israel goes to enormous lengths to reduce the number of civilian casualties – even to the point of foregoing legitimate targets that are too close to civilians.

Yes, Israel has defended its citizens against terrorist attacks by underage Palestinians because Palestinian terrorist leaders deliberately recruit underage Palestinians. When I engaged in a debate on the Boycott, Divest and Sanction (BDS) movement that targets Israel at the Oxford Union, I issued the following challenge to the audience and to my opponent:

Name a single country in the history of the world, faced with threats comparable to those faced by Israel, that has a better record of human rights, compliance with the rule of law or seeking to minimize civilian casualties. The room was completely silent.

Taylor also refers to the security barrier erected by the Israeli government – in response to a spate of deadly suicide attacks where the bombers had infiltrated from Palestinian villages in the West Bank – as “the apartheid” wall.

In doing so, Taylor reveals his own ignorance of the realities on the ground, and wrongly exploits the apartheid analogy and devalues the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa during the days of white minority rule and mandated segregation and discrimination against that nation’s black majority.

It is well known that Israel recognizes fully the rights of Christians and Muslims and prohibits any discrimination based on religion. Muslim and Christian citizens of Israel (of which there are more than 1 million) have the right to vote and have elected members Israel’s parliament, some of whom even oppose Israel’s right to exist.

There is complete freedom of dissent in Israel. Muslims, Christians and Jews alike practice it vigorously. That cannot be said of any Arab or Muslim state, or of the Palestinian Authority.

Taylor reveals his own bigotry when he says that “Israel’s apologists intimidated the Daily Californian into retracting the entire cartoon.” But as he himself acknowledges, the most significant criticism came from the university’s Chancellor, Carol Christ, who is not an “Israel apologist.”

Taylor also mendaciously fails to mention that I adamantly opposed withdrawing or censoring the anti-Semitic cartoon, because I want the world to see it and hold accountable those responsible for it. Likewise, I would oppose censoring Taylor’s anti-Semitic op-ed.

Yes, anti-Semitic. Let me explain why. I agree that there is a vast difference between “actual anti-Semitism” and “legitimate criticism of Israel.” But Taylor is not merely criticizing Israel. He is deliberately lying about its actions and policies in order to delegitimize its very existence.

Taylor is singling out only the nation-state of the Jewish people for such defamatory delegitimization, and he is invoking the crassly anti-Semitic libel of “pinkwashing.” Finally, he uses code words – such as “privileged” and “Israel’s apologists” – to suggest a conspiracy of Jewish power that censors anti-Israel expression.

So yes, Taylor’s op-ed falls on the anti-Semitic side of the very line he proposes: “actual anti-Semitism” versus “legitimate criticism of Israel.” In that respect his op-ed is even more bigoted than the spider cartoon he condemns as “crossing the line into anti-Semitism.” The spider cartoon crossed the line with historic images. Taylor crossed the line with current lies.",Alan Dershowitz: An anti-Semitic attack on me by the student newspaper at UC Berkeley deserves a response,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/09/alan-dershowitz-anti-semitic-attack-on-me-by-student-newspaper-at-uc-berkeley-deserves-response.html

Taking the project one step further, the researchers designed the robot to learn and adapt from the behavior of the real fish.
“In somes studies, we compared groups composed of only fish with groups composed of fish and robots,” Bonnet said.
“We could show that the two are behaving similarly, which shows that the robots are able to act like fish, and integrate groups of fish.","Robots may be getting more realistic but most of us can still discern a human from a humanoid. Fish, on the other hand, seem easier to fool.

Researchers at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland have developed an aquatic robot that can infiltrate schools of zebrafish, going so far as to influence their activities. By designing robots to integrate with animal communities, the roboticists hope to unravel these animals’ behavioral and social structures by learning more about how they communicate.

“We wanted to study how a robotic agent can be inserted in a fish shoal, and, when inserted, how this robotic agent could learn how the fish interact, communicate, and take decisions,” Frank Bonnet, an EPFL postdoctoral researcher who worked on the project, told Digital Trends.

The robot has two parts — a magnetic fish and a motor, which is positioned underneath the aquarium and helps propel the robot through the water.

To infiltrate the school, the EPFL team identified characteristics that real fish use to distinguish themselves and designed the robot accordingly. These included physical traits (such as shape, color, and markings) and behavioral traits (including acceleration speeds, size of schools, and how the fish move their tails in transit). Taking the project one step further, the researchers designed the robot to learn and adapt from the behavior of the real fish.

“In somes studies, we compared groups composed of only fish with groups composed of fish and robots,” Bonnet said. “We could show that the two are behaving similarly, which shows that the robots are able to act like fish, and integrate groups of fish. We also used other setups, such as a ring-shaped setup, to show that the robotic agents can influence on the swimming direction preference of the fish.”

EPFL researchers have previously done similar work on cockroach communities, which are willing to accept practically anything that emits specific cockroach pheromones. Fish posed a much more difficult task, but Bonnet already sees how the work will shed light on the nuances of their societies.

“We could already learn which features are relevant for the fish for social integration,” he said. “We can also learn the hierarchy in fish societies, if for instance there are some leaders, and what are the important aspects to become a leader in fish groups, and how the fish are collectively taking decisions.”

I don’t blame Moore’s voters, but I do have to blame those who are trying to defend Moore and dismiss the accusations or attack the women coming forward.","Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Resurgent.

Up front, here is what I think Roy Moore should do. If he continues to deny the allegations, he should hold a press conference and tell people he wants to clear his name. In the interests of helping the President and avoiding a Democrat, he will continue to campaign for the office and then, if elected, resign so that the Governor can appoint his replacement so that he might focus on clearing his name. He can call this move the Corzine gambit.

Now here’s a post to make everyone mad. I really don’t blame Roy Moore’s voters for sticking with him and I know they are going to come under withering attacks for standing by their man. They don’t deserve it. Clearly a lot of people would prefer to avoid dealing with how we got to this point of moral decay among conservatives who used to really believe character counted.

Well, just this past Sunday a militant atheist shot up a church in Texas, killing about half the congregation. One of those killed was still in the womb, but the baby gets counted as a person to boost the arguments for gun control, otherwise the baby would just be a fetus.

And many on the left on social media attacked the congregants of the church. Some said they got what they deserved. Meanwhile, the media ran with stories of chainsaws attached to machine guns distorting all the basic facts out of willful ignorance.

A week before, a Muslim ran over a bunch of people in New York while Democrats were patting themselves on the back for showing Trump voters running over muslim kids on television.

A few weeks before that, a CBS lawyer lost her job for mocking the dead in Las Vegas that they deserved what they got after a mass shooting, the motive behind which is still unknown.

While all of this is going on, a cake baker is headed to the Supreme Court because he had the audacity to bake a cake for a gay wedding, but he would not do all the decorations the gay couple wanted. So the baker got compared to a Nazi. He will join a florist at the Court who is being put out of business because despite having gay clients, she won’t provide flowers for gay weddings.

People are being harassed for refusing to cheer on men with mental illness who think they are women and the left thinks people in Alabama should have to let men use the ladies’ bathroom. The left is openly counting the days before churches can have their tax exempt status revoked for not embracing gay marriage. Christian private schools will be the first targets. The media on a near weekly basis runs stories that paint culturally conservative voters in a negative light, often distorting basic facts for the sake of narrative.

So you’ll have to excuse Trump voters and Moore voters for thinking the left in this country with a complicit media is out to get them.

Along comes a story about Roy Moore, a happily married man, that involves facts from 30 to 40 years ago and many of the same people who’ve spent a long time covering for people like Harvey Weinstein and are still covering for Hollywood pedophiles are piling on the man. The GOP, who hates cultural conservatives anyway, was quick to pile on.

I don’t blame the Roy Moore voters for thinking people are out to get them because people really are out to get them.

Moore is a fighter for these people. He purports to share their values. And all the people his voters hate happen to hate Roy Moore. They talk about innocence until proven guilty, but they’re ready to run Moore out of town. I don’t blame Moore’s voters, but I do have to blame those who are trying to defend Moore and dismiss the accusations or attack the women coming forward. Conservatism keeps being degraded by a bunch of people who talk Jesus and behave like Satan.

Y’all, I think the facts of the case as presented by the Washington Post are pretty damning. If I were a voter in Alabama, I would probably have to sit it out. But there are a lot of voters who are really damn tired of the culture war and they just want to be left alone. But the left won’t leave them alone. They’re coming for their churches’ tax exempt status. They are coming to force them to either get on board the secular progressive agenda or go into hiding. They are coming for their kids and their guns as well.

So now you are telling them they are really awful, bad people if they stick with Roy Moore instead of allowing into office a man who will side with the people who are out to get them?

I suspect they’ll take your aspersions and hate. They already think you hate them. And because the other side will accept nothing less than the destruction of their way of life, even if they want to walk away from Roy Moore they can’t. Because the other side is bent on their destruction and they think, rightly, that Roy Moore is the only one standing with them.

So we have the luxury of turning our nose up at it. And we can say character counts. But they believe character and morals count too and while they might find Moore’s actions reprehensible, they know the other side won’t be happy until their kids are brainwashed into thinking boys can be girls, a baby’s brains can be harvested with taxpayer subsides, and guns should be made extinct.

You really want to make them choose? You helped cause an existential crisis where they have every good reason to believe their way of life and their values are at stake and you want them to surrender? I can’t blame them for refusing even if I disagree. If you’re demanding the other side surrender in the culture war, don’t be surprised when they’re willing to stand with people they’d never otherwise consider in the name of protecting themselves and their families.",Erick Erickson: I don't blame Roy Moore voters for sticking with him,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/10/erick-erickson-dont-blame-roy-moore-voters-for-sticking-with-him.html

In honor of the 121st match-up between Auburn and the Georgia Bulldogs — two teams that share “The Deep South’s Oldest Rivalry” — Chick-fil-A is opening a temporary pop-up restaurant just feet from the Alabama-Georgia state line, where they’ll be broadcasting the game live and giving away free food.

Dubbed the “Rivalry Restaurant,” the pop-up will actually be located in West Point, Ga., around 50 feet from the Alabama border. Despite this, the eatery will appear to be split right down the middle, with Georgia’s logo decorating the left side and Auburn’s on the right.

CHICK-FIL-A OPENS DOORS TO DISPLACED CONGREGATION

The restaurant will also be situated on a mock football field, where fans can engage in a (hopefully) friendly pickup game before the match. Other activities include free face-painting, and a “customized mini-cow” giveaway, in which guests can get their names etched on tiny stuffed cows.

Chick-fil-A’s press release also confirmed appearances by former Georgia quarterback David Greene and former Auburn linebacker Takeo Spikes.

“We’re going to be bringing Auburn, Georgia and Chick-fil-A fans all together for free food, fun, entertainment and a big-screen TV to watch the game on — and I mean a big-screen TV,” said West Point Mayor Steve Tramell earlier this week, per the LaGrange Daily News.

West Point officials added that, while the event is free, fans should head over to the city halls in West Point or Lanett, Ala., to get their hands on special “priority access” wristbands. Wristbands will reportedly be available on-site, as well.

According to Chick-fil-A, the event also celebrates the 125th anniversary of the two teams’ first game. (As Eater notes, the Tigers and the Bulldogs have been playing since 1892, but canceled a few games during World Wars I and II.) Georgia currently leads Auburn with a record of 57 games to Auburn’s 55, with 8 ties between them.

The shuttle knows when the street signals are going to change from one color to the next.”","A driverless shuttle was involved in an accident hours after it debuted in the streets of downtown Las Vegas on Wednesday. But those involved in the conception of the project said the shuttle was not at fault.

“The exciting thing is that the vehicle did exactly what it was programmed to do. This is a really good real-world case of how the technology actually works"", said John Moreno, a spokesperson for The American Automobile Association (AAA,) a sponsor on the project.

""The shuttle came to a complete stop, a semi-truck driver was backing up and unfortunately continued to back up and may not have seen the shuttle and grazed the front bumper of it,” Moreno explained.

“The shuttle recognized that the semi-truck was backing up and as it’s programmed to do: it stopped,” he added.

AAA and transportation company Keolis conducted a review of the all-electric, eight-seat Navya ARMA vehicle and found the shuttle did everything it was designed to do in the incident. The shuttle did have to pause service for the remainder of the day so the review could be done, but it was still operational and drove away from the scene. There was slight cosmetic damage to the vehicle.

No one was injured in the collision.

In a statement, the City of Las Vegas also noted that the shuttle did what it was supossed to do and said testing of the shuttle will continue.

""Had the truck had the same sensing equipment that the shuttle has, the accident would have been avoided,"" the statement read. ""Testing of the shuttle will continue during the 12-month pilot in the downtown Innovation District. Metro Police cited the driver of the delivery truck.""

The pilot program will run for a year and it is free to ride. It travels in a 0.6 mile loop in the central downtown of Vegas, their so-called “Innovation District” that has been testing new integrated technologies that are compatible with city living.

A human attendant remains on the shuttle in case there are kinks that require him or her to manually steer it with a remote control-like console.

“This is the future and having an opportunity to be the first to be able to ride something like this is just like getting a brand new phone, everyone wants to be first one with the brand new iPhone,"" said Maurice Bell, vice president of Mobility Solutions for Keolis, the operator of the shuttle.

Highlighting the unique nature of the technology, Bell added, “It’s the first of its kind in the United States that’s integrated with street signals.

Sporting one of the world’s most recognizable mustaches, Selleck has become one of America’s most well known and durable TV actors, but there are still a ton of facts you probably don’t know about the small screen superstar.

1. Tom almost played Indiana Jones

Selleck’s big break on TV almost didn’t happen. Producers Steven Spielberg and George Lucas wanted him to play Indiana Jones on the big screen in “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” but he was already committed to “Magnum P.I.” after shooting the pilot for the show.

Executive producer Scott Silveri told Vulture that Selleck's role as Courteney Cox's much older boyfriend on ""Friends"" was meant to be brief.

""They went into that, and it was going to be one episode, two tops. And then they had such good chemistry, the producers and the writers at the time decided to explore it a little more.""

His recurring guest role as ophthalmologist Dr. Richard Burke scored him an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series in 2000.



3. ‘Magnum P.I.’ was a family affair

Selleck was married twice and each of his wives had cameos on the hit show. His first wife, Jacqueline Ray, was featured in an episode titled “Birdman of Budapest.” They divorced in 1982 and he then married actress Jillie Mack, who played a small role in two episodes. The second time was the charm with Selleck – the two are still married and share a daughter.

4. Tom has major volleyball skills

The 6’4” heartthrob was once a skilled volleyball player at Hawaii’s Outrigger Canoe Club. Selleck received an honorable mention on the All American team in 1983, and according to a People magazine article from 1984, the only thing that held the actor back from “being a first-class player” was “Magnum P.I.”

5. Selleck’s ‘Magnum’ Ferrari 308 was auctioned off for big bucks

One of the famous red Ferraris Selleck drove on “Magnum P.I.” fetched $181,500 in January 2017. The car was driven by Selleck during the 1984-1985 seasons and was sold to an anonymous buyer in Arizona.

6. His daughter is an equestrian star

Tom’s daughter, Hannah Selleck, is a show jumper who has been riding since she was 4 years old. She told The Hollywood Reporter that she raises her horses in New Mexico because of the California drought and started a breeding business with her dad.

She said her father has been very supportive of her venture.

“He liked the idea of developing the babies and developing young horses, so he was a big supporter of this idea,” she said. “I had a couple top older grand prix horses that brought me along in my career, and when they weren’t able to do their job anymore, I decided to breed them.”

7. He went to USC on a basketball scholarship

Tom played for the Trojans' men’s basketball team as a 200-pound forward in 1965.

An excerpt from the University of Southern California’s basketball guide included a description of Selleck at the time, calling him an “[a]gile and quick performer who adds depth on front line. Business administration major is good jumper with fine mobility. Rapidly improving shooter has impressed coaches with his hustle in practice. Needs to work on defense.""

8. Tom was the Marlboro Man (kind of)

Selleck promoted Salem cigarettes as a young actor and model to pay the rent.

“I did a Salem billboard for about 500 bucks and forever since I’ve been called the Marlboro Man. I did commercials and maybe four still photography jobs to pay the rent,” he told TV Guide. “But in those days, being known as a male model didn’t help your career.”

The sheriff’s office, after some deliberation, told Barbour of James Martin, a local Army veteran, who has wanted to paint his home for years, the Tulsa World reported.

According to Regalado, Martin served for 15 years in the Army and as a result of his service in the Middle East, has had at least six major surgeries. But it hasn’t stopped him from giving back to his community and fellow veterans.

Martin founded Wounded Veterans of Oklahoma, which teams up with veterans for hunting, fishing and camping trips so they can speak with others about their experiences in the military and help provide some relief.

“Veterans are truly this nation’s most valued treasure,” Regalado said. “James has earned the right to sit back and just enjoy life. Yet through Wounded Veterans of Oklahoma, he continues to sacrifice for the benefit of others who have served this country with honor and pride.”

VETERANS DAY: WE HONOR THE 20 MILLION VETERANS WITH US TODAY AND THE MILLIONS MORE IN OUR PAST

On Thursday, Sheriff Vic Regalado surprised Martin with the gift. He had asked Martin to speak to his deputies about his organization -- while back at Martin's home Barbour was hard at work.

“This is a complete shock,” Martin told the Tulsa World. “It’s amazing how things work.”

Martin called the gift a “blessing.”

“Small acts of kindness for people who serve can be life changing,” he said. “One of the biggest struggles people face in the military and…first responders and police officers face is ‘do people really appreciate what we’re going through?’”

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

One of the few upsides to the kneeling controversy engulfing the NFL is that it’s reinforced the notion that there are few things in this country more sacred than the lives of our military men and women. Public support for and confidence in the military remains astronomically high, buoyed by the enormous respect most Americans have for those who serve in uniform.

Why, then, do we continue to look away from one of the most disturbing catastrophes befalling our military heroes? It’s estimated that about 22 veterans die from suicide per day. That’s nearly one per hour, a rate far above the average among the general public. The physical, emotional and spiritual brokenness giving rise to the suicide epidemic is destroying lives, families and tearing at the public institution we honor most.

One of the most decent men I ever worked with was the late Republican leader Bob Michel.
Severely wounded in Italy in the last months of World War II, he spent more than three years in rehabilitation hospitals.","Last Saturday night, Callista and I had the great privilege of attending the Marine Corps Ball in Rome, Italy. The event commemorated the 242nd birthday of the United States Marine Corps, and we were lucky to have arrived in Rome in time to attend.

Former Private First Class Harold Blunk was the guest speaker. In May 1968, during the Vietnam War, he played a major role in the brutal battle for Foxtrot Ridge. This melee was part of the larger battle for Khe Sanh (one of the largest set piece battles with the North Vietnamese Army in the entire war).

Private Blunk’s role was powerfully captured in the citation written for the Silver Star he was awarded for the indisputable valor and bravery he exhibited in the face of combat:

""In spite of the withering enemy fire, he continued to call in fire missions, adjust the fire around the perimeter, and coordinate the adjustments with the forward observer in the company command post. Throughout the hours of darkness, he and his fellow Marines repelled numerous enemy attacks on their position. Private First Class Blunk's leadership and courage in the face of overwhelming odds rallied his fellow Marines and was decisive in their holding the ‘Crow's Nest.’ With ammunition running critically low, he and another Marine left their besieged perimeter on more than one occasion to collect enemy weapons and ammunition to continue their fight against the enemy.""

Now, 49 years later, Harold Blunk is a successful businessman and active citizen, who is delighted to visit Marine celebrations and remind younger Marines of the bond of courage and sacrifice which binds them all together.

With Veterans Day approaching, I couldn't help but think of Harold and other veterans I have known and who have helped shape my life. Here are a few:

One of the most decent men I ever worked with was the late Republican leader Bob Michel. In the Battle of the Hürtgen Forest in 1944, he was in a foxhole when a German sniper killed the man next to him. He always wondered why he had been spared...

My stepfather, Bob Gingrich, served in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. He spent 27 years in the Army and felt he was serving a cause larger than himself. Much of my devotion to and passion for public service grew from the example he set and his attitude and habits.

Callista had four uncles who served in World War II. Three served in Europe and made it home. Uncle Louie served in the Pacific and was killed in the last months of the war. He is buried on Luzon.

One of the most decent men I ever worked with was the late Republican leader Bob Michel. He landed in Normandy and fought his way across France. In the Battle of the Hürtgen Forest in 1944, he was in a foxhole when a German sniper killed the man next to him. He always wondered why he had been spared, and felt God wanted him to devote his life to serving others.

One of the most amazing men I have worked with is former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. Severely wounded in Italy in the last months of World War II, he spent more than three years in rehabilitation hospitals. Bob then forced himself to get well enough to earn a law degree, run for office, and serve 27 years in Congress. He eventually became Senate Majority Leader and a Republican Presidential nominee. Today, at 94 years old, Bob Dole still goes to work every day.

Our freedom, prosperity, and safety depend on the bravery and loyalty of veterans like these and the monumental sacrifices they make for our country. We are infinitely grateful for their service, as well as for the support and countless sacrifices made by their families, who often spend long periods, periods of intense worrying, without their loved ones.

This Veterans Day is a good time to remind ourselves how much we owe the brave men and women who make great sacrifices to defend America and our freedoms.

Miscavige declared “war is over” to members following the decision.

The Church of Scientology denied the documentary’s representation of how it was granted tax exempt status, Fortune reported.

However, The Hill said the IRS was the only organization that could make the decision to revoke the church's tax-exempt status.

The original DeltaWing coupe is up for sale. The needle-nose prototype racer competed for several years on the endurance racing circuit, where it was out to prove the merits of its innovative, efficient design.

The aerodynamic, lightweight concept was first developed as a single-seat Indycar proposal that was half the weight and twice as efficient as traditional cars, but it morphed into a sports car after the series decided to stick with a more conventional design.

Weighing around 1,400 pounds, the DeltaWing has two narrow tires mounted close together in the front, a 1.9-liter 4-cylinder turbocharged engine in the rear and could keep the pace with heavier but more powerful cars while using less fuel and tires. Its best finish was 4th place at the 2014 Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta, near DeltaWing headquarters in Braselton.

Three of the cars were built and raced before rules changes for the 2017 season forced them into retirement.

Her mother, Patricia Ann Spann, 44, has pleaded not guilty to incest. Her court date was slated for January. She could face 10 years in prison if found guilty, Tulsa World reported.

Prosecutors said Patricia Spann also married one of her sons in 2008. The marriage was annulled in 2010 due to “incest,” The Associated Press reported.

The mother said she thought the marriage to Misty was legal because she had lost custody of her daughter and two sons years ago and is not listed on their birth certificates.

And yet my goal, aside from supporting the work mothers at home do, is no different from Komisar’s: “We don’t want the 50s to come back.
The only reason women don’t do this today is because we place so little value on motherhood.
We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies.","This past weekend the Wall Street Journal published what I consider to be the most important op-ed of the 21st century. Due to its sensitive nature, Americans rarely hear about this subject. But they should.

The article, by James Taranto, is entitled “The Politicization of Motherhood,” and it centers on an interview with psychoanalyst Erica Komisar, whose new book “Being There: Why Prioritizing Motherhood in the First Three Years Matters,” makes the oh-so-obvious yet controversial argument that babies need their mothers.

As Komisar says in a video about her book, “Mothers are critically important to children in the first three years of life. [It] impacts their emotional well-being.”

For daring to write such a book, Komisar has received the inevitable backlash. After all, it’s taboo enough to suggest parents should stay home. It’s even more taboo to suggest that parent be Mom. Why? Because popular orthodoxy insists the sexes are interchangeable. That’s what the gender equality crowd believes, and it’s what they want everyone else to believe.

If you don’t agree with it (and you shouldn’t, because it isn’t true), you’ll be treated as a pariah. “I couldn’t get on NPR,” Komisar told Taranto. And, she adds, she was “rejected wholesale—particularly in New York—by the liberal press.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

Komisar did manage to get a spot on “Good Morning America;” but prior to the interview, host Lara Spencer made it clear to Komisar that she didn’t like her book and didn’t “believe in its premise.”

Well, of course she didn’t. Morning television is dominated by female producers and journalists, many of whom are married with kids. And as Bernard Goldberg wrote in “Bias,” “…those gals got a dog in this fight.” He adds, “America’s newsrooms are filled with women who drop their kids off someplace before they go to work or leave them at home with a nanny. These journalists are not just defending working mothers—they’re defending themselves!”

How rich I’d be if I had a dollar for every time I’ve run into this media bias. My first book, which was published 15 years ago (and was coincidentally re-released this year), is similar to Komisar’s in that I make a case for why a mother’s physical and emotional presence are vital to children, to families and to society as a whole. And I too was vilified in the media.

And yet my goal, aside from supporting the work mothers at home do, is no different from Komisar’s: “We don’t want the 50s to come back. What we do want is to be a child-centric society.”

Not the kind of child-centric society we have now, where children are coddled by well-meaning but overprotective parents.

The kind that puts the needs of children above the needs of adults.

Unfortunately, Komisar and I part ways on how to create such a society. As a political liberal, Komisar believes the answer is other people’s money. “All mothers and babies should have the right to be together in the first year,” she says. To do that, America needs maternity leave at full pay “and then flexibility to be together as much as possible for the next two years—meaning mothers should have the ability to work flexibly and part time.”

It is true that flexibility and part-time work become indispensable once children are older and in school all day, but it’s pointless in the first three years. The needs and demands of a baby, let alone a baby and a toddler, are simply too great to be able devote one’s attention to something else without everything falling apart.

Still, there is much Komisar gets right. Her case is particularly compelling because her work has been developed from “three decades’ experience treating families,” writes Taranto. And her conclusions are right on the mark—though admittedly, for some, are hard to hear.

“What I was seeing,” notes Komisar, “was an increase in children being diagnosed with ADHD and an increase in aggression in children, especially in boys, and an increase in depression in little girls.” She saw that the absence of mothers in children’s daily lives was “one of the triggers for these mental disorders.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

They won’t acknowledge it because they refuse to allow themselves, or anyone else, to feel guilty about the choices they’ve made—as if experiencing this emotion is tantamount to being tortured.

But it isn’t the end of the world to feel guilt. “My best patient is a patient who comes to me feeling guilty,” says Komisar. “Women who feel guilty—it’s a ‘signal’ feeling, that something’s wrong, that they’re in conflict. If they go talk to a therapist or deal with the conflict head-on, they often make different choices and better choices.”

And one of those choices, to prioritize baby care well in advance of its arrival, is a smart one. The only reason women don’t do this today is because we place so little value on motherhood. We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies. We don’t understand it because we refuse to look.

I say this to encourage us to get on our knees in surrender and fight for our kids in prayer.
In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ.
Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.","“The older my kids get, the more I realize how little control I have over them. My slipping sense of control produces so much anxiety in my life so I end up grasping for even more control. I don’t know what else to do but I’m afraid to surrender. Really afraid.”

That was a very real and honest fear shared with me recently by another mom who is watching her eldest child navigate his teen years and is worried sick about his choices and the outcomes.

As I wrote about my own struggle with “controlling my kids” in my book “Mom Set Free,” I often wondered if surrender came easier to other moms. I wondered if I was mostly alone in my struggle to unclench my fists that were trying to control outcomes and parent more open-handed to God’s plans.

But based on an Instagram comment feed I scrolled through just last week, I know I am not alone. In fact, control seems to be something most moms struggle with.

Here are just six out of 132 comments shared by brave women and their struggle to surrender:

“I don’t even know what motherhood looks like without being worried, anxious and a total control freak!”

“My biggest fear is MY anxiety becoming THEIR anxiety.”

“I thought I’d moved past control issues once my kids got to school, but now they’re teens and it’s a real struggle to step back and give them their wings.”

“I’m such a control freak and it’s been a challenge not being able to control a single thing with my 5-week-old. Being on her schedule at all times has been the biggest struggle for me.”

“Mom guilt is real and life is crazy! Extra hard when you're a control freak.”

“I am anxious and worried way too often and want everything to be in perfect order. I need to be set free from those unhealthy mindsets!”

I can’t help but wonder if you can relate to any of these comments, because even if you wouldn’t describe yourself as a “control freak” you still might struggle with surrendering your kids to their sovereign Father.

I think part of our struggle is rooted in a misunderstanding of what surrender actually is.

One way we might think of surrender is this: “I give up. There is nothing I can do or say that is going to make a difference here. I’ve tried everything and nothing helps. My influence in my kid’s lives is useless and exhausted. I’m done trying. I surrender.”

But if we look to Jesus we find an entirely different lens through which to view surrender.

In the Gospel of Mark, chapter 14, we find that Jesus is “overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death” (v. 34 NIV). Jesus knew that the fulfillment of his mission was imminent. He would soon take on the sin of the world and bear the wrath and shame for the entire human race. Jesus was “deeply distressed and troubled” when he prayed: “Abba Father, everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will” (v. 36 NIV).

This simple but profound prayer shows us what surrender really is. Surrender is acknowledging God’s power, submitting to his will, and trusting in his goodness.

When we find ourselves grasping for control over our kid’s lives, or our own circumstances, we can pray like Jesus prayed to his Father: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

The above prayer, which my pastor Drew Williams shared at church many years ago, has expanded my heart and opened my hands to God’s perfect will in times when I have come to him very fearful and close-fisted.

This can be our prayer of surrender when:

Our hearts are aching and our fears are raging over the choices our kids are making.

We crash into the reality that our kids unique needs will seriously mess with our perfect plans.

We have so much anxiety over our role as moms that we witness our anxiety spilling over into our homes and onto our kids, who then take on our anxiety.

We feel helpless and hopeless.

This is a prayer that we probably need to pray over and over and over again, each and every day: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

Prayer is not only the antidote to finding peace amidst all of the anxiety-inducing pressure, but it is our most powerful weapon against the enemy who, like it or not, is working against us. He “prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8 NIV).

I don’t say this to scare us. I say this to encourage us to get on our knees in surrender and fight for our kids in prayer.

Our prayers for our children (and with our children) are unimaginably significant. Through prayer, we get to partner with God in the work he is doing in the lives of our kids, all the while remembering that: “It won’t be long before this generous God who has great plans for us in Christ – eternal and glorious plans they are! – will have you put together and on your feet for good. He gets the last word; yes, He does!” (1 Peter 5:11 MSG).

In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ. And not just temporal plans, but eternal plans. And he gets the last word.

We can rest in his sovereignty and surrender to his will, just as we saw Jesus surrendering to his Father’s will in his prayer at Gethsemane. Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.

Surrender isn’t giving up. It’s giving over every one of our fears and worries and problems and weaknesses to God. And in turn, receiving his peace as we partner with him, rather than trying to be him in our kid’s lives.

We have a profound role to play in our kid’s lives, by establishing healthy boundaries and enforcing consistent consequences, wrapped in unconditional love. But as we do that, we have to remember that we are not the originator and orchestrator of our kid’s lives.

Our role is to seek and surrender to “The Great Originator and Orchestrator” and trust him to be – and to do – everything we can’t. He’s good at that, you know. He’s good at being God. So let’s let him. And in doing so, we are enabled to release the anxiety and reclaim the adventure that we’ve lost in the quest to play his role.

Naturally, after that comment, she’s of little help. Meanwhile, Raj and Howard find themselves at a bar watching cricket. While Howard isn’t amused, Raj is in his element. That’s what makes it so easy for him to hit it off with Bernadette’s friend Ruchi, who happened to be there. The next day, Raj reveals that they slept together and are planning to keep their new relationship “casual.” Both Stuart and Penny scoff at the idea of him engaging in a casual relationship.

When they have their first date, Raj comes clean and she seems charmed by his honesty. The date continues and they get on the topic of soulmates. Needless to say, Raj is a believer, but Ruchi’s scientific mind breaks down the chemical reaction that people call “love.” With the help of Bernadette and Howard, he realizes that his relationship with Ruchi isn’t going anywhere romantic. Instead, they’ll just be two people who find each other attractive and have sex, which he’s not all that upset about.

Sheldon continues to contemplate his dip into geology after Bert realizes that he’s been bad-mouthing his life’s work the whole time. He asks Amy if she’d judge him for working on geology.

“Sheldon, you’ve never cared what people thought, even when you really, really should,” she says. Oddly enough, this gives him the courage to pursue his work with Bert. The episode ends on a bad note with Sheldon going back to Bert’s office with his metaphorical hat-in-hand. Sadly, when he arrives he is struck to find that Leonard has taken his place.

Comedians Diana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov told the New York Times Thursday the 50-year-old exposed himself to them in a Chicago hotel room in 2002.
“I want to address the stories told to the New York Times by five women named Abby, Rebecca, Dana, Julia who felt able to name themselves and one who did not,” wrote C.K.
And I've tried to learn from them.
""I’ve brought pain to my family, my friends, my children and their mother.","Louis C.K. admitted Friday that the accusations made by five women who claim the comedian was sexually inappropriate with them are true.

Comedians Diana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov told the New York Times Thursday the 50-year-old exposed himself to them in a Chicago hotel room in 2002. Abby Schachner shared a similarly disturbing story with the newspaper, telling the Times she heard C.K. masturbating on the phone when she spoke to him in 2003. Another woman named Rebecca Corry said C.K. asked her if he could masturbate in front of her. One woman spoke to the newspaper anonymously and said something similar happened to her.

The comedian released an official statement to Fox News Friday and expressed remorse.

“I want to address the stories told to the New York Times by five women named Abby, Rebecca, Dana, Julia who felt able to name themselves and one who did not,” wrote C.K.

“These stories are true. At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my d--k without asking first, which is also true. But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your d--k isn’t a question. It’s a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly.

""I have been remorseful of my actions. And I've tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I’m aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men who would never have put them in that position.

""I also took advantage of the fact that I was widely admired in my and their community, which disabled them from sharing their story and brought hardship to them when they tried because people who look up to me didn't want to hear it. I didn't think that I was doing any of that because my position allowed me not to think about it.

""There is nothing about this that I forgive myself for. And I have to reconcile it with who I am. Which is nothing compared to the task I left them with.

""I wish I had reacted to their admiration of me by being a good example to them as a man and given them some guidance as a comedian, including because I admired their work.

""The hardest regret to live with is what you've done to hurt someone else. And I can hardly wrap my head around the scope of hurt I brought on them. I’d be remiss to exclude the hurt that I’ve brought on people who I work with and have worked with who’s professional and personal lives have been impacted by all of this, including projects currently in production: the cast and crew of 'Better Things,' 'Baskets,' 'The Cops,' 'One Mississippi,' and 'I Love You Daddy.'

""I deeply regret that this has brought negative attention to my manager Dave Becky who only tried to mediate a situation that I caused. I’ve brought anguish and hardship to the people at FX who have given me so much, The Orchard who took a chance on my movie, and every other entity that has bet on me through the years.

The passenger in question, Rajiv Katiyal, was seen in a viral video taken on October 15 being manhandled, beaten, and dragged along the tarmac at Indira Gandhi International Airport by ground staff.

According to India's Conde Nast Traveller, which obtained a copy of a letter from November 8 that details the altercation, Katiyal got into an argument with the staff after being told to stay clear of a truck next to the aircraft. Due to the noise on the tarmac, it seems Katiyal misunderstood the staff, thought they were being rude, and used some expletives in response.

When ground staff refused to let Katiyal board the shuttle bus to the terminal, a physical fight broke out.

The altercation was recorded by cargo staff employee Montu Kalra, according to Traveller. Contrary to some reports that Kalra was a “whistleblower,” IndiGo Airways told the magazine that Kalra was an instigator of the fight, telling his junior staff to prevent Katiyal from boarding the bus.

“Montu Kalra was a cargo employee. He had no reason to approach the passenger area. He had no reason to prevent the customer from boarding the bus. He had no reason to instruct the other colleagues,” said Aditya Ghosh, President & Wholetime Director of IndiGo.

Ghosh apologized in a statement, as reported by The Times of India: “I acknowledge the unpleasant experience our passenger went through, while engaging with our staff at Delhi airport. My personal apologies as this does not reflect our culture. I had personally spoken to the passenger and asked for an apology. At IndiGo, dignity of our passengers and staff is of utmost importance. Any act that compromises the dignity of either is of a serious concern to us. Under the code of conduct violation, this incident was investigated and stern action was taken against the staff. Once again my personal and sincere apologies to the affected passenger.”",Airline apologizes after crew is filmed beating passenger on a tarmac,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/2017/11/09/airline-apologizes-after-crew-is-filmed-beating-passenger-on-tarmac.html

TWITTER USERS IDENTIFY WHITE SUPREMACISTS AT CHARLOTTESVILLE PROTESTS

However, the recent verification of a Twitter account belonging to Jason Kessler, one of the organizers of this summer’s Charlottesville rally, has sparked outrage.

“Looks like I FINALLY got verified by Twitter. I must be the only working class white advocate with that distinction,” Kessler tweeted Tuesday.

Twitter was slammed for verifying Kessler’s account. Comedian Michael Ian Black, who has 2.16 million Twitter followers, described the situation as “disgusting,” and threatened to leave Twitter. “Verifying white supremacists reinforces the increasing belief that your site is a platform for hate speech. I don't want to give up Twitter, but I may have to. Who do you value more, users like me or him?” he tweeted Tuesday.

“Jason Kessler is so toxic that he broke Twitter's verification process,” tweeted anti-fascist activist Emily Gorcenski.

Kessler’s account was still verified on Friday morning.

Twitter acknowledged that more work is needed on its verification policy, and announced a pause in general verifications Thursday.

OBAMA'S TWEET IN RESPONSE TO CHARLOTTESVILLE VIOLENCE IN THE MOST LIKED EVER

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said that, while Twitter’s verification policy had been followed correctly, there are issues with the policy itself. “We should’ve communicated faster on this (yesterday): our agents have been following our verification policy correctly, but we realized some time ago the system is broken and needs to be reconsidered. And we failed by not doing anything about it. Working now to fix faster,” he tweeted Thursday.

“Verification was meant to authenticate identity & voice but it is interpreted as an endorsement or an indicator of importance,” tweeted Twitter Support. “We recognize that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it. We have paused all general verifications while we work and will report back soon.”

The row places Twitter’s criteria for deeming an account “of public interest” firmly in the spotlight. The account of white supremacist Richard Spencer is verified on Twitter, although, as critics have noted, the account of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is unverified.

“We approve account types maintained by users in music, acting, fashion, government, politics, religion, journalism, media, sports, business, and other key interest areas,” explains Twitter on its site. “We’ll ask you to tell us why we should verify an account. If the account represents a person, we want to understand their impact in their field,” it added.

Users looking to get their Twitter accounts verified need to provide Twitter with information such as a verified phone number, a confirmed email address, a bio, profile photo and login verification.

Take, for example, the stories emanating from revelations of the Paradise Papers.
Despite divesting himself of most business interests when he joined the Trump cabinet, he kept a shipping company, Navigator Holdings, through a chain of companies in the Cayman Islands.
Mr. Ross probably knew very little about the transaction and, my guess is, he was unaware of any Russian involvement.
The Paradise Papers are certainly not the Pumpkin Papers and, in time, their salacious stories will be replaced.","In an earlier far more innocent era, my mother told me you will be judged by the friends you keep. For many Americans, this was axiomatic. However, in this cynical era, you are often judged by who you know or who knows you. In some sense, this is a Kafkaesque arrangement where judgments and the assignment of guilt are made without knowledge or forethought.

Take, for example, the stories emanating from revelations of the Paradise Papers. This massive trove of 13.4 million records was founded 100 years ago and operates in various points around the globe managing the assets of very wealthy people. Reflecting millions of loans, financial transactions and e-mails, the data reveal how wealthy individuals manage their portfolios.

Recently a German newspaper, Süddeutsche Zeitung, unraveled the connections indicating how the wealthy sometimes avoid taxes and make business deals.

Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, was caught in the web of these revelations. Despite divesting himself of most business interests when he joined the Trump cabinet, he kept a shipping company, Navigator Holdings, through a chain of companies in the Cayman Islands. Discussing Ross’ Paradise Papers file Jon Swaine of the Guardian noted that Navigator is a company operated by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s son-in-law an allegation that put Ross in the journalistic crosshairs.

The very mention of a transaction in which Russia is included is now branded “collusion.”

Navigator is paid $20 million a year to ship gas out of Russia for a Russian company named Sibur and Sibur is co-owned by Kirill Shamalov, Putin’s son-in-law. Commenting on this matter, Ross said “there is nothing whatsoever improper about Navigator having a relationship with Sibur.” He continued, “The fact that it happens to be called a Russian company does not mean that there’s any evil in it.” That is true on several levels.

This is a third party transaction in which the investor through a holding company joined a deal worth at least $200 a year. Mr. Ross probably knew very little about the transaction and, my guess is, he was unaware of any Russian involvement.

Moreover, the deal does not violate any laws, nor is there any suspicion that is the case. It would appear as if this is a witch hunt in which any reference to Russia is a form of collusion. Clearly this falls into the category of “false news.” But it has even darker implications.

The very mention of a transaction in which Russia is included is now branded “collusion.” You might even describe this phenomenon as contemporary McCarthyism, albeit McCarthy made allegations about those who joined the Communist Party as opposed to present claims that have a gossamer thin relationship to Russian officials.

My guess is these claims aren’t going anywhere, certainly not into the hands of Mr. Mueller, the Special Counsel. But these violations of privacy and reputation should not be overlooked. It is precisely the frivolous investigations of this kind that discourage good people from government service.

The Paradise Papers are certainly not the Pumpkin Papers and, in time, their salacious stories will be replaced. Unfortunately, it will leave in its wake a number of unsubstantiated claims and reputations that have been unfairly besmirched.",Welcome to the new McCarthyism,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/10/welcome-to-new-mccarthyism.html

As President Trump travels overseas. Republicans hetre at home are working on pushing a tax reform plan through Congress.

FOX's Gurnal Scott with the story:

House Speaker Paul Ryan on FOX News Sunday says the reform bill with a trillion-dollar tax cut is on pace to pass the House by Thanksgiving. But critics say key deductions are being left out of the proposal.

Host Chris Wallace pressed the Speaker on what it could mean for many, like those paying off student loans:

(Wallace) ""If I'm able to deduct the interest rate. Now I'm losing that, if I have huge medical expenses and I'm able to deduct the medical.""

(Ryan) ""In exchange for a tax cut, so you get to keep your money more in the first place. So you get to decide what you want to do with your money.""

The GOP hopes to have a bill on the President's desk by year's end.

State District Judge Matt Johnson ended the trial Friday of Christopher ""Jake"" Carrizal after McLennan County jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked. They had deliberated for 14 hours in the first trial arising from the 2015 gunfight that left nine bikers dead.

No retrial was immediately scheduled.

Carrizal, president of the Bandidos' Dallas chapter, was charged with directing the activities of a criminal street gang and two counts of engaging in organized criminal activity with the underlying offenses of murder and aggravated assault.

He testified that a rival biker club, the Cossacks, provoked the May 17, 2015, brawl and gunfight at the Twin Peaks restaurant in Waco.

The mistrial leaves unclear the prospects faced by other defendants charged in the shootout. Experts had been looking toward a verdict from the Carrizal trial as an indicator of how solid the government's cases against other leaders and dozens of members might be.

Testifying in his own behalf, Carrizal told the jury that the Cossacks were behaving provocatively when Carrizal's group arrived at the restaurant for a meeting, and a brawl quickly erupted.

Carrizal said a Cossack was trying to punch him through his safety helmet with brass knuckles when he heard gunshots. He said he tried to reach for the knife in his pocket but couldn't grasp it. As the fight continued and he was on the ground, he reached for a two-shot Derringer pistol in his back pocket and fired it at a Cossack. When he couldn't reload, he took cover behind a light pole and yelled for his father, who also was part of the brawl. He said he saw one member of his group lying dead and another bleeding from the head, so he crawled under a truck.

He finally saw two police officers helping his father, who was shot in the shoulder.

The Waco Tribune-Herald reported that in a note Thursday night, the jury foreman reported a juror identified as ""Mr. P"" told the other jurors he had prior experience with the Cossacks and would not change his mind because of it. That juror has ties to a McLennan County motorcycle shop, which he disclosed on his juror questionnaire in early October.",1st trial stemming from Texas biker fight ends in mistrial,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/10/1st-trial-stemming-from-texas-biker-fight-ends-in-mistrial.html

I didn't get to tell him directly ‘Don't ever touch me!’ That's the way I've always handled things.","Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter has found himself in a new scandal.

Blatter, the ousted head of the global soccer governing body, is the latest prominent man to be accused of sexual misconduct after U.S. women's soccer goalkeeper Hope Solo accused him of assaulting her at FIFA’s Ballon d’Or awards ceremony in 2013.

“I had Sepp Blatter grab my ass,” Solo said in a recent interview with Portuguese newspaper Tribuna Expresso.

“It was at the Ballon d'Or one year. Right before I went on stage... It's been normalized,” said Solo, who presented the FIFA's women's player of the year award in January 2013 and shared the stage with Blatter.

The shocking claim was made after she was asked if sexual harassment was as much an issue in women's soccer as it has been in Hollywood.

“Yes, I've seen it throughout my entire career,"" Solo responded. ""And I wish more female athletes would speak out about their own experiences. It's rampant, it's not just in Hollywood, it's probably all over the place.""

“I've seen it in sports,"" she went on. ""For years, in the past, female players date and end up marrying their college coaches, which obviously a coach should not be doing, especially with a young player. I've seen it not just with coaches, I've seen it with trainers, doctors, and our press officers ... I've seen it amongst players in the locker room. I don't know why more players don't speak out against it.”

When asked why she didn’t come forward before with her allegations against Blatter, Solo says she usually confronts the person directly if she has an issue.

“I speak out directly [with people] when things like that happen,” she said. “In other cases, for instance, I've told my teammates: ‘Don't ever f------ touch me! Don't do it.’ It has been in the showers, it's been in the locker room ... I usually speak directly with the person.

“In the case of Sepp Blatter, I went on the stage, I was nervous for the presentation ... It was the Ballon d'Or I was presenting. After that, I didn't see him and that was kind of bad. I didn't get to tell him directly ‘Don't ever touch me!’ That's the way I've always handled things. Directly.”

A spokesman for Blatter told both Expresso and U.K. newspaper The Guardian that the accusations made by Solo were “ridiculous.”

Blatter, 81, served as FIFA president from 1998 until 2015, when he was banned by the organization over an ethics scandal that shook the sports world at the time.

During Blatter's tenure, he was often accused of making sexist remarks, according to The Guardian. He suggested in 2004 that female players could wear “tighter shorts” like “they do in volleyball.” and in 2013, he called a female candidate for FIFA’s executive committee “good, and good looking”.

Just days after that comment, Blatter made disparaging remarks to new female members of the executive committee. “Are there ladies in the room?” he allegedly asked, before adding, ""Say something! You are always speaking at home, now you can speak here.""",Hope Solo claims disgraced ex-FIFA head Sepp Blatter sexually assaulted her,http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/11/10/hope-solo-claims-disgraced-ex-fifa-head-sepp-blatter-sexually-assaulted-her.html

“If I die helicopter skiing, you have the right out there to do the exact same thing I’m doing to Roy Halladay. He got what he deserved,” Michael Felger, one of the hosts of “Felger and Mazz,” a show on 98.5 SportsHub in Boston said, The New York Daily News reported.

Halladay was killed Tuesday when a small plane he was piloting crashed in the Gulf of Mexico off the west coast of Florida. He was 40 years old.

Throughout the segment Felger called Halladay a “jackass,” “moron” and an “idiot.” He explained that he has “no sympathy” for the former pitcher, the paper reported.

“You’re 40 years old and a multimillionaire with a loving family, and to you, you have to go get that thing where you can dive bomb from 100 feet to five above the water with your single-engine plane with your hand out the window. Wheee! Wheee! Yeah, man, look at the G-force on this! I’m Maverick!” Felger said while imitating the sounds of explosions. “‘Yeah, man, look at this, this is so cool.’ And you die, splat.”

His co-host Tony Massarotti chimed in-between Felger’s rants, described Halladay's death as “an unfortunate circumstance, not a tragedy.”

“What bugs me about a story like this is when they use the word ‘tragedy,’” Massarotti said. “A tragedy is what happened at that church in Texas this past weekend, or an orphanage burning down. This? You know what the risks are!”

Halladay's love for flying stemmed from his father, who was a corporate pilot for years, reported the New York Post. After retiring from Major League Baseball, Halladay left the field to pursue his passion in the skies.

Rand Paul's neighbors are speaking out and casting doubt on reports that a mere ‘landscaping dispute’ led to the attack a week ago that left the Republican lawmaker hospitalized with six broken ribs.

As the suspect -- 59-year-old neighbor and anesthesiologist Rene Boucher -- pleads not guilty to a single misemeanor assault charge, the motive for what Paul's office describes as a “blindside” remains a total mystery.

The New York Times initially reported neighborhood chatter suggesting a long-running landscaping disagreement led to last Friday’s attack in Kentucky.

Boucher’s attorney, Matt Baker, has insisted the incident had “nothing to do” with politics.

But neighbors now say the notion of a yard dispute gone wrong doesn't add up.

In an interview with Fox News, Paul’s neighbor of 17 years, Dan Renshaw, a local car dealer in Bowling Green, was dismissive of reports that the incident stemmed from anything having to do with ""lawn clippings,"" given the severity of the attack. He said U.S. Capitol Police have been to the neighborhood, signaling an intensifying local and federal investigation into last week’s incident.

Further, Renshaw said his son-in-law -- who sits on a neighborhood board -- told him there's never been any reports of conflicts between the two men or any report of trouble from the alleged attacker.

RAND PAUL'S OFFICE CALLS 'VIOLENT' ATTACK A 'BLINDSIDE,' KNOCKS DOWN REPORTS OF YARD DISPUTE

Paul’s senior adviser Doug Stafford also disputed claims of a neighbors' quarrel on Thursday, issuing the senator’s most detailed statement yet on the nature of the attack.

“Last week Senator Paul was vigorously assaulted by someone in his neighborhood. This is a serious criminal matter involving serious injury, and is being handled by local and federal authorities,” Stafford said in a statement to Fox News. “As to reports of a longstanding dispute with the attacker, the Pauls have had no conversations with him in many years.”

Stafford said the first so-called “conversation” with the attacker “came after Sen. Paul’s ribs were broken.”

“This was not a ‘fight,’ it was a blindside, violent attack by a disturbed person,” Stafford said. “Anyone claiming otherwise is simply uninformed or seeking media attention.”

Boucher’s attorney told Fox News on Monday that Boucher and Paul have been neighbors for 17 years and were “prominent members of the local medical community and worked together when they were both practicing physicians.” He said only that the dispute grew out of “a matter that most people would regard as trivial.”

Neighbor Alicia Stivers told WKU Public Radio earlier this week she saw Paul after the attack, and he was having trouble breathing and talking and had lacerations on his face.

She said Boucher apparently mentioned something about Paul's trees being in the way when he's tried to sell his house. At the same time, she said she had never known the two men to complain about anything -- calling the attack out of the blue.

Shawn Parker, an HOA board member in the community, told the same station he doesn't know of any history of property disputes between the men.

Another neighbor, who requested to remain anonymous, disputed the buzz over landscaping in an interview with Fox News on Friday. The source said Paul and Boucher have not spoken for years, while expressing surprise over what happened.

“Dr. Boucher is a kind and gentle fella, I’m shocked,” the neighbor told Fox News. “He’s a caring person—really caring, and gentle.”

The neighbor suggested the senator’s “attitude” could have led to the attack last week.

“Rand is like—big me, little you—it’s what we used to say when we were growing up,” the neighbor said Friday, adding: “Rand may not even know why, but he had a reason. I’d say there was something brewing.”

But what?

Yet another purported neighbor told the Courier Journal reports of a landscaping dispute are wrong.

Two neighbors in Paul’s community told Fox News on Friday that Boucher was divorced from his wife, and lived alone at home.

On Thursday, Boucher and his attorney entered a not guilty plea in Warren County Circuit Court before Judge Brent Potter. Boucher currently faces a charge of misdemeanor fourth-degree assault, stemming from last week’s attack.

Boucher and his lawyer agreed to a pre-trial conference scheduled for Nov. 30 to review the charges. The defendant is free on a $7,500 bond.

Meanwhile, the senator’s injuries are worse than initially thought.

Paul shared a medical update on Wednesday saying he had six broken ribs and a “pleural effusion.” A pleural effusion “is the build-up of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs,” according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Paul’s office initially said the senator broke five ribs after the incident.

As for the single misdemeanor charge, State Police told Fox News on Monday that in Kentucky, there is a statute that considers an assault a felony only if there is serious physical injury. Sources in Paul's office told Fox News' senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano that the senator has been told to expect federal charges to be filed against his attacker.

Though the State Police was unable to provide Fox News a timeline for when their investigation will be complete, a spokesman said “it is up to Commonwealth prosecutors” whether Boucher’s charges could change from misdemeanor to felony based on the severity of those injuries.

Veterans are twice as likely as non-veterans to die from accidental overdoses of the highly addictive painkillers, a rate that reflects high levels of chronic pain among vets, particularly those who served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to federal data.

U.S. government and healthcare officials have been struggling to stem the epidemic of overdoses, which killed more than 64,000 Americans in the 12 months ending last January alone, a 21 percent increase over the previous year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. About 65,000 Americans died in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan.

President Donald Trump named opioids a national public health emergency and a White House commission last week recommended establishing a nationwide system of drug courts and easier access to alternatives to opioids for people in pain.

""Our veterans deserve better than polished sound bites and empty promises,"" said former Democratic Congressman Patrick Kennedy, a recovering addict and a member of the president's opioid commission.

Kennedy said in an e-mail that more funding was needed for treatment facilities and medical professionals to help tackle the problem.

One effort to address the issue has stalled in Congress - the proposed Veterans Overmedication Prevention Act, sponsored by Senator John McCain. That measure is aimed at researching ways to help Veterans Administration doctors rely less on opioids in treating chronic pain.

""The Veterans Administration needs to understand whether overmedication of drugs, such as opioid pain-killers, is a contributing factor in suicide-related deaths,"" McCain, one of the nation's most visible veterans, said in an e-mail on Thursday. He noted that 20 veterans take their lives each day, a suicide rate 21 percent higher than for other U.S. adults.

The VA system has stepped up its efforts to address the crisis, having treated some 68,000 veterans for opioid addiction since March, said Department of Veterans Affairs spokesman Curtis Cashour.

The department's Louis Stokes VA Center in Cleveland has also begun testing alternative treatments, including acupuncture and yoga, to reduce use of and dependency on the drugs, the VA said.

A delay in naming a Trump administration ""drug czar"" to head the effort, however, has fueled doubts about immediate action on the opioid crisis.

Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of Buckingham University, said the professor message scaremongers the students rather than helping them to learn to live a balanced lifestyle.
“Frightening impressionable undergraduates into believing that work alone is all-important is irresponsible, unkind and wrong-headed,” he told the newspaper.","UK’s Cambridge University physical sciences professor came under fire this week from mental health campaigners and students after he suggested undergraduates will have to work hard and abstain from drinking to pass the course.

Eugene Terentjev draw the fury of students and mental health activists after sending out an email last week to first-year natural sciences undergraduates at Cambridge, telling them the course will be difficult and thus they should refrain from drinking and other social activities if they wish to succeed, according to an email leaked to student-run publication Varsity.

“Physical sciences is a VERY hard subject, which will require ALL of your attention and your FULL brain capacity (and for a large fraction of you, even that will not be quite enough),” Terentjev wrote to the students.

“You can ONLY do well (ie achieve your potential, which rightly or wrongly several people here assumed you have) if you are completely focused, and learn to enjoy the course. People who just TAKE the course, but enjoy their social life, can easily survive in many subjects — but not in this one.”

“Remember that you are NOT at any other uni, where students do drink a lot and do have what they regard as a ‘good time’"". - Professor Eugene Terentjev

He added: “Remember that you are NOT at any other uni, where students do drink a lot and do have what they regard as a ‘good time’ — and you are NOT on a course, as some Cambridge courses sadly are, where such a behaviour pattern is possible or acceptable.”

The professor’s comments caused an uproar among activists and students, who called his email “extremely damaging” and neither “appropriate nor acceptable”, with one other university vice-chancellor accusing Terentjev of “frightening impressionable undergraduates”, the London Times reported.

The university’s student union welfare officer, Micha Frazer-Carroll, also criticized the content of the email, claiming it criticized “the very premise of having a social life, or any sort of life, outside of study.”

He always wondered why he had been spared...My stepfather, Bob Gingrich, served in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.
One of the most decent men I ever worked with was the late Republican leader Bob Michel.
Severely wounded in Italy in the last months of World War II, he spent more than three years in rehabilitation hospitals.","Last Saturday night, Callista and I had the great privilege of attending the Marine Corps Ball in Rome, Italy. The event commemorated the 242nd birthday of the United States Marine Corps, and we were lucky to have arrived in Rome in time to attend.

Former Private First Class Harold Blunk was the guest speaker. In May 1968, during the Vietnam War, he played a major role in the brutal battle for Foxtrot Ridge. This melee was part of the larger battle for Khe Sanh (one of the largest set piece battles with the North Vietnamese Army in the entire war).

Private Blunk’s role was powerfully captured in the citation written for the Silver Star he was awarded for the indisputable valor and bravery he exhibited in the face of combat:

""In spite of the withering enemy fire, he continued to call in fire missions, adjust the fire around the perimeter, and coordinate the adjustments with the forward observer in the company command post. Throughout the hours of darkness, he and his fellow Marines repelled numerous enemy attacks on their position. Private First Class Blunk's leadership and courage in the face of overwhelming odds rallied his fellow Marines and was decisive in their holding the ‘Crow's Nest.’ With ammunition running critically low, he and another Marine left their besieged perimeter on more than one occasion to collect enemy weapons and ammunition to continue their fight against the enemy.""

Now, 49 years later, Harold Blunk is a successful businessman and active citizen, who is delighted to visit Marine celebrations and remind younger Marines of the bond of courage and sacrifice which binds them all together.

With Veterans Day approaching, I couldn't help but think of Harold and other veterans I have known and who have helped shape my life. Here are a few:

One of the most decent men I ever worked with was the late Republican leader Bob Michel. In the Battle of the Hürtgen Forest in 1944, he was in a foxhole when a German sniper killed the man next to him. He always wondered why he had been spared...

My stepfather, Bob Gingrich, served in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. He spent 27 years in the Army and felt he was serving a cause larger than himself. Much of my devotion to and passion for public service grew from the example he set and his attitude and habits.

Callista had four uncles who served in World War II. Three served in Europe and made it home. Uncle Louie served in the Pacific and was killed in the last months of the war. He is buried on Luzon.

One of the most decent men I ever worked with was the late Republican leader Bob Michel. He landed in Normandy and fought his way across France. In the Battle of the Hürtgen Forest in 1944, he was in a foxhole when a German sniper killed the man next to him. He always wondered why he had been spared, and felt God wanted him to devote his life to serving others.

One of the most amazing men I have worked with is former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. Severely wounded in Italy in the last months of World War II, he spent more than three years in rehabilitation hospitals. Bob then forced himself to get well enough to earn a law degree, run for office, and serve 27 years in Congress. He eventually became Senate Majority Leader and a Republican Presidential nominee. Today, at 94 years old, Bob Dole still goes to work every day.

Our freedom, prosperity, and safety depend on the bravery and loyalty of veterans like these and the monumental sacrifices they make for our country. We are infinitely grateful for their service, as well as for the support and countless sacrifices made by their families, who often spend long periods, periods of intense worrying, without their loved ones.

This Veterans Day is a good time to remind ourselves how much we owe the brave men and women who make great sacrifices to defend America and our freedoms.

To all of our veterans and those who continue to serve our country, thank you for your dedication and service.

Elliott sat directly in front of a three-judge panel that considered his request to be allowed to play, but the court issued an order in less than an hour disqualifying him from Sunday's game at Atlanta. The suspension was ordered in August as discipline after the league investigated allegations he used force against his girlfriend in the summer of 2016. Elliott vehemently denied the allegations as recently as last week, saying he was not an abuser.

By the time the ruling came Thursday, he had already left the courthouse without speaking to reporters, though he shook the hand of a person who shouted that he was a ""huge fan"" as Elliott raced down steps to a sport utility vehicle.

Although the league won the battle, the appeals judges took a few shots at the NFL for its handling of the suspension of a 22-year-old athlete who will be sidelined while he's second in the league with 783 yards rushing and tied for the league lead with seven rushing touchdowns.

Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs told Paul Clement, the NFL's lawyer, that he found it odd that the issue was ""such a frantic emergency that it can't wait another couple months.""

""This is not just about Elliott and the Cowboys,"" Clement responded, noting that 100 players across the league had been suspended for a total of 500 games over the last two seasons.

""Unfortunately, discipline is a fact of life in the NFL,"" the lawyer said. ""They all have an interest in seeing the same basic rules applied to them.""

Clement said it was important that players not be able to ""game the system"" by using the courts to delay suspensions until it is convenient for them or their teams.

Still, he noted, Elliott would start his suspension as the Cowboys enter the ""easy part"" of their schedule.

""This is the ideal time for him to serve the suspension,"" Clement said.

The NFL did not comment on the court's order, though it affirmed that the suspension was in place.

Elliott's attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Elliott arrived at the hearing just minutes before it began. He was smiling and greeting his lawyers before he moved his chair to face the judges more directly.

In short order, the 2nd Circuit said Elliott didn't meet the standards to continue blocking the suspension, but ordered a hearing as soon as it could be scheduled.

Elliott had received three different legal reprieves as he played the season's first eight games. It wasn't immediately clear how soon the court would rule on Elliott's claim that he was treated unfairly by the NFL.

A while after celebrating their nuptials on Oct. 14 in Hillsboro, Ky., Jason told Yahoo Lifestyle that the song has special meaning for the high school sweethearts.

“Allison comes from a place where she used to be in an abusive relationship, and to know that someone like me could change that for her is absolutely extraordinary,” he said.

While both Dyer and Thurgood are only 18 years old, they’ve been dating for four years since meeting in church. Further, they consider themselves devoted to both their faith and their relationship.

“I didn’t want a relationship [when we met], but I knew God was telling me he was the one, so I took a leap of faith,” Allison told the site.

In hopes of adding a personal touch to the ceremony, she decided to surprise her new husband with the musical interlude. The added touch was deeply personal, as the couple often travels to perform at other churches.

“People call and ask for her to sing, and I’m usually the one behind her,” Jason said.

While the groom remembered that Allison showed him a YouTube clip of another girl singing a similar Elvis cover a year ago, he was totally surprised by her serenade, especially since his best man acted as the sound guy for the ceremony. The bride did, however, tease him with a cryptic message beforehand.

“I told him that if he didn’t cry, I was going to turn around and do it all over again,” Allison said, adding that Jason’s emotional reaction is her favorite part of the video.

On the big day, as Presley’s heartfelt tune wafted through the venue, Jason said he was totally shocked to see his bride-to-be slowly coming towards him in song.

“I saw the mic in her hand, and she was singing, and at that moment, the floodgates opened up. It was a complete surprise. I was really flattered,” he said.

“Today, FX Networks and FX Productions are ending our association with Louis C.K.,” they wrote. “We are cancelling the overall deal between FX Productions and his production company, Pig Newton.

American veterans may hear these words on Saturday, as tributes for former service members roll in in honor of Veterans Day.

Unsure what Veterans Day is? Read on for a look at the holiday and the history behind the occasion.

What is Veterans Day?

“While those who died are also remembered, Veterans Day is the day set aside to thank and honor ALL those who served honorably in the military - in wartime or peacetime,” the Department of Veterans Affairs says.

It explains the holiday “is largely intended to thank LIVING veterans for their service, to acknowledge that their contributions to our national security are appreciated, and to underscore the fact that all those who served - not only those who died - have sacrificed and done their duty.”

Memorial Day, the VA says, is meant to honor those who have died while serving.

What is the history behind the holiday?

The roots of Veterans Day go back nearly 100 years.

Fighting during WWI stopped on Nov. 11, 1918 due to an armistice between the Germans and the Allies, the VA notes. Nov. 11 was commemorated as Armistice Day by President Woodrow Wilson in 1919, it adds.

A resolution passed by Congress in 1926, according to the federal agency, called for Nov. 11 to be remembered every year “with thanksgiving and prayer and exercises designed to perpetuate peace through good will and mutual understanding between nations.”

In 1938, Armistice Day was officially made a legal public holiday, the VA says.

Many American soldiers lost their lives during WWII and the Korean War. In the wake of these wars, Armistice Day was renamed Veterans Day in 1954.

VETERAN ASKS PEOPLE TO TAKE A KNEE AT VETERANS' GRAVES

In 1968, a bill was passed which called for Veterans Day to be observed on the fourth Monday in October starting in 1971. The change was part of a move to give federal workers several three-day holiday weekends, the Navy History and Heritage Command blog The Sextant says online.

But in 1971, two states observed Veterans Day on Nov. 11 instead, The Sextant says, adding that over time, other states did the same.

President Gerald Ford signed a bill in 1975 which pushed Veterans Day back to Nov. 11, with the changes taking place in 1978.

Ford said in a statement that he felt “restoration of the observance of Veterans Day to November 11 will help preserve in the hearts and lives of all Americans the spirit of patriotism, the love of country, and the willingness to serve and sacrifice for the common good symbolized by this very special day.”

What else should I know?

Some in the U.S. observe Veterans Day with parades, such as the upcoming one that will take place Saturday in New York City.

There will also be a wreath-laying ceremony on Saturday morning at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Va.

Many restaurants and businesses are also offering special promotions for veterans which they can take advantage of.

Roy Griffith confirmed to The Associated Press that his son, William Griffith, was the man who died last December when a nurse at a VA hospital in Ann Arbor mistakenly believed he had a no-resuscitation order.

Griffith's death was investigated by the inspector general at the Department of Veterans Affairs. A report released Tuesday called the case ""disturbing,"" although the patient's name wasn't disclosed.

Griffith was suffering from chest pain and stopped breathing while recovering from artery bypass surgery. No one at the hospital attempted to resuscitate him, and he died the day after Christmas.

The elder Griffith declined further comment Thursday. William Griffith's wife, Roberta Griffith, also declined to comment.

""We miss him horribly,"" Griffith's sister, Sara Schuyler, told AP.

Griffith served two years in the Army during the Vietnam War, returning home with injuries in 1971, according to his obituary. He enjoyed darts and billiards. His cremated remains were interred at Great Lakes National Cemetery, a cemetery for veterans in Holly, Michigan, not far from his Oakland County home.

""Bill was a likable man who would do anything if you needed him to. He loved his family and will be missed by all who knew him,"" the obituary said.

Separately, Reps. Debbie Dingell and Tim Walberg said Thursday they've asked the VA for assurances that a ""similar tragedy never happens again."" A spokesman for the hospital, Brian Hayes, said changes have been made, including a requirement that two people confirm the status of a patient's resuscitation order.

The nurse who made the fatal mistake told investigators that he apparently was confused over Griffith's status that day. Hayes said the nurse could be fired.

State District Judge Matt Johnson ended the trial Friday of Christopher ""Jake"" Carrizal after McLennan County jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked. They had deliberated for 14 hours in the first trial arising from the 2015 gunfight that left nine bikers dead.

No retrial was immediately scheduled.

Carrizal, president of the Bandidos' Dallas chapter, was charged with directing the activities of a criminal street gang and two counts of engaging in organized criminal activity with the underlying offenses of murder and aggravated assault.

He testified that a rival biker club, the Cossacks, provoked the May 17, 2015, brawl and gunfight at the Twin Peaks restaurant in Waco.

The mistrial leaves unclear the prospects faced by other defendants charged in the shootout. Experts had been looking toward a verdict from the Carrizal trial as an indicator of how solid the government's cases against other leaders and dozens of members might be.

Testifying in his own behalf, Carrizal told the jury that the Cossacks were behaving provocatively when Carrizal's group arrived at the restaurant for a meeting, and a brawl quickly erupted.

Carrizal said a Cossack was trying to punch him through his safety helmet with brass knuckles when he heard gunshots. He said he tried to reach for the knife in his pocket but couldn't grasp it. As the fight continued and he was on the ground, he reached for a two-shot Derringer pistol in his back pocket and fired it at a Cossack. When he couldn't reload, he took cover behind a light pole and yelled for his father, who also was part of the brawl. He said he saw one member of his group lying dead and another bleeding from the head, so he crawled under a truck.

He finally saw two police officers helping his father, who was shot in the shoulder.

The Waco Tribune-Herald reported that in a note Thursday night, the jury foreman reported a juror identified as ""Mr. P"" told the other jurors he had prior experience with the Cossacks and would not change his mind because of it. That juror has ties to a McLennan County motorcycle shop, which he disclosed on his juror questionnaire in early October.",1st trial stemming from Texas biker fight ends in mistrial,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/10/1st-trial-stemming-from-texas-biker-fight-ends-in-mistrial.html

If Tuesday night’s election results made Republicans fear becoming a minority in the new Congress in 2019, Thursday’s allegations against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore raised a new concern: the prospect of seeing the party’s razor-thin Senate majority reduced to 51-49 much sooner.

And neither are the trains that break down in the under belly of the city leaving passengers stranded for hours with a continuously playing pan flute ensemble.

Click here for a free subscription to Todd’s newsletter – a must-read for Conservatives!

Nor is the most pressing issue the muggers or perverts manhandling women or homeless people urinating on seats or giant rats prowling subway stations.

No, ladies and gentlemen – the greatest threat facing the Big Apple’s subway system is train conductors using the words “ladies and gentlemen.”

The New York Post reports the Metropolitan Transit Authority has ordered all subway personnel to refrain from addressing riders as “ladies and gentlemen.”

Instead, staffers have been told they must use gender neutral words like riders, passengers, and everyone according to a memorandum obtained exclusively by the Post.

“Please don’t use any greeting other than these,” the memo reads.

Subway workers say political correctness has derailed the nation’s largest subway system.

“They are trying to be politically correct,” one worker told the Post. “They are acknowledging that they have some transgender riders. They don’t want to offend anyone.”

An MTA spokesperson told the Post that gender issues were a consideration for the move.

I suspect it was a preemptive strike by the MTA to avoid some sort of legal action taken by the LGBTQI and the letter A community.

Heaven help the poor cis-gender train conductor who inadvertently mis-genders a gender-fluid passenger.

Gender fluidity, by the way, is the latest fad in the sex and gender revolution. Followers ascribe to a belief that there’s really no such thing as male or female.

For example, you could be a male passenger on the B Train at 34th Street-Herald Square, but you could identify as a female passenger by the time you reach Rockefeller Center.

I know, it’s all very confusing, ladies and gentlemen (my apologies).

Gunnery Sgt. Joseph Felix, 34, was found guilty of hazing and maltreatment of recruits at the Marine Corps’ Parris Island, S.C., boot camp, an eight-man jury at Camp Lejeune, N.C., determined.

The Iraq veteran was slated to be sentenced Friday and could face time in a military prison, as well as financial penalties and a dishonorable discharge. The Washington Post reported Felix would appeal if he received “more than a year in prison or is given an other-than-honorable discharge from the military.”

""[Felix was] drunk on power -- and sometimes Fireball whiskey."" - Lt. Col. John Norman

Charged with more than three dozen criminal counts, Felix was accused of being a central figure in an abusive group of drill instructors at Parris Island, a scandal that came to light after the March 2016 suicide of one of the three Muslim-American recruits he targeted.

A MARINE AND HIS DOG’S UNCONVENTIONAL JOURNEY FROM AFGHANISTAN TO ‘STUBBORN POSITIVITY’

In March 2016, Raheel Siddiqui, 20, a Pakistani-American from Taylor, Mich., committed suicide by jumping off a stairwell after Felix yelled at him and slapped him, prosecutors said. Siddiqui’s family filed a $100 million wrongful death lawsuit last month against the Marine Corps.

Lance Cpl. Shane McDevitt, one of Siddiqui’s fellow recruits in his platoon, testified Felix called the Pakistani-American a ""terrorist"" some 10 times.

Two other Muslim recruits said Felix once pressured them into an industrial clothes dryer and turned it on.

Trainee Lance Cpl. Ameer Bourmeche testified Felix forced him into a clothes dryer and turned it on as Felix demanded he renounce his Islamic faith. Bourmeche testified he twice affirmed his creed and twice Felix and another drill instructor sent him for a bruising, scorching tumble inside the dryer. After a third spin, Bourmeche said he feared for his life and renounced his faith. The drill instructors then let him out, he said.

Lt. Col. John Norman, the prosecutor, said Felix “picked out Muslim recruits for special abuse because of their Muslim faith. He degraded their religion and put them in industrial appliances.”

Norman claimed Felix was “drunk on power, and sometimes Fireball whiskey,” he told the jury.

“He wasn’t making Marines – he was breaking Marines,” Norman said.

Other charges against Felix stemmed from a series of disturbing acts involving more than a dozen recruits. They included commanding recruits to choke each other, ordering them to drink chocolate milk and then training them until they vomited and punching recruits in the face or kicking them to the ground.

A hazing investigation led to charges against Felix, five other drill instructors and the training battalion's commanding officer. Eleven others faced lesser, administrative discipline. Felix also was convicted of lying to investigators.

MARINE, 23, FATALLY STABBED IN HAWAII WAS ‘BELOVED’ MEMBER OF UNIT

Felix had pleaded not guilty and did not testify during his trial.

Felix also was convicted of drunk and disorderly conduct and making false official statements.

Felix was permanently removed from his duties as a drill instructor after the investigation began, Marine Corps spokesman Capt. Joshua Pena said.

Felix's chief defense attorney, Navy Lt. Cmdr. Daniel Bridges, said Wednesday the dozens of prosecution witnesses gave contradictory accounts the government unfairly fashioned into a case against the brawny drill instructor who allegedly called all recruits ""terrorist."" Young men told investigators fanciful stories including one in which Felix grabbed a recruit by the throat and lifted him off the ground with one arm, Bridges said.

Felix has served in the Marines since 2002 and is married with four children, The Washington Post reported.

The government did not charge Felix with any crime directly related to Siddiqui's death. The judge, Lt. Col. Michael Libretto, did not allow testimony about whether Felix's actions were responsible for the recruit's death.

The jury decided Felix also roused nearly two dozen recruits from their sleep, ordered them to lie on the floor, and then walked on their bodies along with two other drill instructors.

Plans are also in place to transform Thompson’s room into a winter wonderland, complete with Christmas trees and a visit from Santa.

Thompson’s wish started making headlines last week, when Simard shared that he had been given about one month to live after doctors discovered his cancer spread to his hip and head.

What happens to college football?” Costas said.","From his perch hosting Thursday Night Football, veteran sportscaster Bob Costas has a unique perspective from which to diagnose the health of the NFL — and he says the future looks bleak.

Costas, the longtime NBC broadcaster, said at the University of Maryland on Tuesday that the one-time “cash machine” sport was suffering after multiple investigations into former players who've experienced serious health issues, USA Today reported.

“The reality is that this game destroys people’s brains,"" Costas said. “Not everyone, but a substantial number. That’s the fundamental fact of football, and that to me is the biggest story in American sports.”

Costas was referring to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease linked with repeated head trauma that has become a concern for many athletes, but mostly those playing in the NFL. The disease can impact the brain’s frontal region which controls a person’s judgment, emotion, impulse, control, social behavior and memory.

In a July report, researchers studying the brains of 202 former football players discovered traces of CTE in nearly all of them, The Associated Press reported.

SPORTS RADIO HOSTS UNDER FIRE FOR COMMENTS ON HALLADAY DEATH

Late New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez allegedly had advanced signs of CTE, his lawyer claimed. Hernandez was in jail serving time after a first-degree murder conviction when he hung himself in April. He was 27 years old at the time of his death.

“The cracks in the foundation are there,” Costas said. “The day-to-day issues, as serious as they may be, they may come and go. But you cannot change the nature of the game. I certainly would not let, if I had an athletically gifted 12- or 13-year-old son, I would not let him play football.”

Costas appeared on the Maryland panel with USA Today’s Christine Brennan and ESPN's Tony Kornheiser, each of whom spoke about the future of professional football.

“It’s not going to happen this year, and it’s not going to happen in five years or ten years,"" Kornheiser said. ""But Bob is right: At some point, the cultural wheel turns just a little bit, almost imperceptibly, and parents say, ‘I don’t want my kids to play.’ And then it becomes only the province of the poor, who want it for economic reasons to get up and out.""

BOB KNIGHT SPILLS ABOUT DISMISSAL FROM INDIANA UNIVERSITY, JOHN WOODEN



Costas said the NFL’s belated efforts to study the dangers of football will only hurt the league in the end.

“The more information [that] comes out, the worse it looks,” Costas said.

The sportscaster said he believed forthcoming data would only lead families to prevent their kids from playing until they were at least 18 years old. Or never allow them to play at all.

“But then where’s the talent pool for college? What happens to college football?” Costas said. “The whole thing could collapse like a house of cards if people actually begin connecting the dots.”

Kornheiser said football was on its way to being on the same level as boxing.

“Boxing doesn’t really exist anymore, except on pay-per-view, except every once in a while…Football is headed there,” Kornheiser said. “There is no question, football is headed for margins.”

“I've seen it in sports,"" she went on.
I've seen it not just with coaches, I've seen it with trainers, doctors, and our press officers ...
I didn't get to tell him directly ‘Don't ever touch me!’ That's the way I've always handled things.","Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter has found himself in a new scandal.

Blatter, the ousted head of the global soccer governing body, is the latest prominent man to be accused of sexual misconduct after U.S. women's soccer goalkeeper Hope Solo accused him of assaulting her at FIFA’s Ballon d’Or awards ceremony in 2013.

“I had Sepp Blatter grab my ass,” Solo said in a recent interview with Portuguese newspaper Tribuna Expresso.

“It was at the Ballon d'Or one year. Right before I went on stage... It's been normalized,” said Solo, who presented the FIFA's women's player of the year award in January 2013 and shared the stage with Blatter.

The shocking claim was made after she was asked if sexual harassment was as much an issue in women's soccer as it has been in Hollywood.

“Yes, I've seen it throughout my entire career,"" Solo responded. ""And I wish more female athletes would speak out about their own experiences. It's rampant, it's not just in Hollywood, it's probably all over the place.""

“I've seen it in sports,"" she went on. ""For years, in the past, female players date and end up marrying their college coaches, which obviously a coach should not be doing, especially with a young player. I've seen it not just with coaches, I've seen it with trainers, doctors, and our press officers ... I've seen it amongst players in the locker room. I don't know why more players don't speak out against it.”

When asked why she didn’t come forward before with her allegations against Blatter, Solo says she usually confronts the person directly if she has an issue.

“I speak out directly [with people] when things like that happen,” she said. “In other cases, for instance, I've told my teammates: ‘Don't ever f------ touch me! Don't do it.’ It has been in the showers, it's been in the locker room ... I usually speak directly with the person.

“In the case of Sepp Blatter, I went on the stage, I was nervous for the presentation ... It was the Ballon d'Or I was presenting. After that, I didn't see him and that was kind of bad. I didn't get to tell him directly ‘Don't ever touch me!’ That's the way I've always handled things. Directly.”

A spokesman for Blatter told both Expresso and U.K. newspaper The Guardian that the accusations made by Solo were “ridiculous.”

Blatter, 81, served as FIFA president from 1998 until 2015, when he was banned by the organization over an ethics scandal that shook the sports world at the time.

During Blatter's tenure, he was often accused of making sexist remarks, according to The Guardian. He suggested in 2004 that female players could wear “tighter shorts” like “they do in volleyball.” and in 2013, he called a female candidate for FIFA’s executive committee “good, and good looking”.

Just days after that comment, Blatter made disparaging remarks to new female members of the executive committee. “Are there ladies in the room?” he allegedly asked, before adding, ""Say something! You are always speaking at home, now you can speak here.""",Hope Solo claims disgraced ex-FIFA head Sepp Blatter sexually assaulted her,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/11/10/hope-solo-claims-disgraced-ex-fifa-head-sepp-blatter-sexually-assaulted-her.html

Because basically, it doesn’t exist,” the brand’s creative manager Samantha Helligso told the Daily Mail earlier this week.

“By showing imagery that's real and authentic, we want to show it's more than okay to be yourself. All you have is what you've got, so own it every day,” she added.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the alleged plan being investigated would have paid Flynn and his son Michael Flynn Jr. up to $15 million for delivering Fethullah Gulen to the Turkish government.

The Journal cited “people with knowledge of the FBI’s inquiries” saying the bureau is asking individuals about a December meeting in New York City with Flynn and Turkish government representatives where Gulen’s removal was discussed.

Lawyers for Flynn said in a statement that the allegations were ""outrageous and prejudicial"" before concluding, ""they are false.""

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long sought for the U.S. to extradite Gulen, who resides in the United States. The Journal reported that the alleged discussions involved possibly moving Gulen to a Turkish prison island.

The investigation is part of Mueller’s expansive probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion with Trump associates. The probe has resulted so far in the indictment of Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort, relating to his work for the government in Ukraine.

Sources told the Journal it’s not clear whether the Gulen plan resulted in any money changing hands.

Flynn used to lobby for Turkish interests. He left the Trump White House after misleading Vice President Pence on his contacts with the Russian ambassador. His Turkey and Russia ties are now the subject of various investigations.

Asked about the New York meeting in question, a White House spokesman told the Journal: “We don’t have any evidence that such a meeting took place. And if it did it take place it happened not withstanding the transition.”

Raisman, who captained the 2012 and 2016 Olympic gold medal-winning teams, detailed in an upcoming book the abuse she said she suffered at the hands of disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. The 23-year-old's book, “Fierce,” is set to be released Nov. 14.

Raisman spoke to CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview slated to air Sunday regarding the alleged sex abuse she endured from the doctor who spent more than two decades working with top athletes at USA Gymnastics.

Nassar is currently in jail in Michigan awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to possession of child pornography. Nassar, who was also a sports medicine specialist at Michigan State, is awaiting trial on charges in three separate cases alleging he sexually molested a total of nine girls, including eight who were gymnasts seeking treatment for injuries.

MCKAYLA MARONEY, OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST, SAYS DOCTOR MOLESTED HER

Nassar has since had his medical license revoked and is being sued by more than 100 people who have made similar charges against him.

Raisman told “60 Minutes” she spoke with the FBI regarding Nassar after the 2016 Rio Olympics.

The six-time Olympic medal winner, who has won three gold medals, said she was angry when people asked why she didn't come forward about Nassar sooner.

“Why are we looking at why didn't the girls speak up? Why not look at 'what about the culture?' What did USA Gymnastics do, and Larry Nassar do, to manipulate these girls so much that they are so afraid to speak up?” Raisman told “60 Minutes.”

She added: “I am angry. I'm really upset because it's been -- I care a lot you know, when I see these young girls that come up to me, and they ask for pictures or autographs, whatever it is, I just, I can't. Every time I look at them, every time I see them smiling, I just think, I just want to create change so that they never, ever have to go through this.""

Raisman is only the most-recent high-profile gymnast to say she was abused by Nassar. Last month, Olympic gold medalist Maroney said she was molested by Nassar for years.

AARON HERNANDEZ’S BRAIN SUFFERED SEVERE CTE, RESEARCHER SAYS

“I was molested by Dr. Larry Nassar, the team doctor for the US for the U.S. Women’s National Gymnastics Team, and Olympic Team,"" Maroney wrote on Twitter. ""Dr. Nassar told me that I was receiving ‘medically necessary treatment that he had been performing on patients for over 30 years.’ It started when I was 13 years old, at one of my first National Team training camps, in Texas, and it didn’t end until I left the sport.”

Raisman has demanded USA Gymnastics chang its policies following the allegations against Nassar. USA Gymnastics ordered a review last fall and said it adopted a “safe sport policy that requires mandatory reporting of suspicions of sexual abuse and also sets standards to prevent inappropriate interaction between athletes and adults,” CBS News reported.

""USA Gymnastics is very sorry that any athlete has been harmed,"" the organization told “60 Minutes” in a statement. “We want to work with Aly and all interested athletes to keep athletes safe.""

Their impotent rage, which has been on display for the past year, manifested itself in impotent expression. But President Trump remains in office.

Small groups in liberal cities like Austin and New York showed up to join together to “enjoy a collective cathartic yell into the heavens about our current political establishment,” as the Facebook invitation stated.

The scream-fest came a day after a fairly good election night for Democrats. They captured the governorships in Virginia and New Jersey, and won a bunch of smaller electoral victories elsewhere.

Yet the anti-Trump protestors still screamed.

The screaming wasn’t limited to just making sounds into the air, either. There was some screaming in written form as well.

In the New York Review of Books, Nation columnist Katha Pollitt wrote a piece headlined “Year One: My Anger Management.”

Pollitt raged that she has completely fallen apart over the past year. She wrote that “my work seems trivial” and added: “I hate people now. Well, not all people, of course. Just people who voted for Trump.”

Pollitt wrote that she wanted Trump voters to “have health care and child care and good schools and affordable college and real sex education and access to abortion and a much higher minimum wage.” But the Trump voters didn’t want her – actually, Hillary Clinton’s – offerings “if black people get to have it, too.”

This woman needs a doctor, not a column where she gets to wallow in her unreasonable anger and her bizarre projections. She is failing at the management of her anger.

The larger problem with the screamers and the ragers is that they have let an election that didn’t go their way take over their lives. Politics shouldn’t bring you joy or despair. It isn’t your friend or family, and unless it’s part of your job it should not be part of your daily life.

That politics has taken over everything – permeated all culture, to the point that people believe it’s normal to think and talk about it constantly – is more than a little unfortunate.

Elections will sometimes produce the result you want – but sometimes they will not. If we believe in the structures of our country and in the strength of our system, an election should not be cause for people to futilely scream into the air. If you find yourself signing up for a group scream, it’s time to do some re-evaluating of your life.

Some on the left say “Trump is different.” But anyone who remembers the George W. Bush years or earlier times knows this anger isn’t new.

“If you’re not angry you’re not paying attention,” went the decades-old bumper sticker.

This constant anger that is encouraged by some on the left isn’t healthy and it isn’t constructive. The better plan might be to pay less attention to what makes you that angry. And perhaps to work on screaming less in general, at the sky or elsewhere.",Anti-Trumpers need to scream less and manage their anger more a year after election,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/10/anti-trumpers-need-to-scream-less-and-manage-their-anger-more-year-after-election.html

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, we were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse. To love each other well is to love our children well.",What happened when my daughter saw me kiss my wife,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/what-happened-when-my-daughter-saw-me-kiss-my-wife.html

In other words, the anti-Trump media are, as usual, picking and choosing what to focus on based on their usual narrative.

“We've seen everything from the feeding frenzy around the false koi story where video was actually edited to make the president look like an unpolished rube to sanctimonious criticism around the president not taking questions while with the Chinese president when his predecessor also didn't take questions as well during his first trip there,” The Hill media columnist Joe Concha told Fox News.

Trump delivered a powerful speech Friday before a summit of Asian leaders in Vietnam, but CNN decided not to bother airing the late-night speech. The increasingly liberal CNN didn’t even mention the speech on air until a brief update in the 3 a.m. ET hour, while Fox News and MSNBC had reporters on the ground and covered the speech live.

In the speech that CNN viewers never saw, Trump reiterated his “America First” message, saying he will not “let the United States be taken advantage of anymore.” A slew of high-profile Twitter users, who apparently don’t watch CNN, simply saw the president’s speech as an opportunity to mock Trump for not fighting in the Vietnam War.

In addition, numerous U.S. companies announced $250 billion worth of deals in China, coinciding with Trump’s visit with Chinese President Xi Jinping. To wit: Boeing reached a $37 billion agreement to sell 300 planes to China; General Electric picked up three deals in China valued at a combined $3.5 billion; and Qualcomm reached three nonbinding deals to sell $12 billion in semiconductors to Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo over the next three years. None of the job-creating deals received the attention they deserved from mainstream media.

The average American is probably more familiar with a report that Trump was offered women being sent to his room in Russia during the 2013 Miss Universe Pageant. ABC and CBS each spent significant time covering the nonstory -- but predictably muted the fact that Trump didn’t take the offer seriously.

“Lost in all of this is the $250 billion dollar trade deal can actually impact our economy that gets relatively buried because it lacks sizzle and character assessments."" - Joe Concha

“Lost in all of this is the $250 billion dollar trade deal can actually impact our economy that gets relatively buried because it lacks sizzle and character assessments,” Concha said.

The Associated Press even tried to undermine the impact of the announced deals, saying they are “more about the art of diplomacy than the art of the deal” – a dig at the title of one of Trump’s books -- while painting the $250 billion agreements as “ceremonial” and “mostly about symbolism.”

Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor echoed Concha and said the mainstream media is “spinning a successful foreign policy trip into a disaster because that's how they want it perceived.”

“They are manufacturing controversy,” Gainor told Fox News. “First we had the bogus koi fish story where Trump dumped the fish food into the pond doing exactly as Prime Minister Abe had done.

Once upon a time, General Motors took a novel approach to improving winter traction with the Liquid Tire Chain Traction Dispenser.

The onboard system promised, at the push of a button, improved traction through chemistry. As option V75, it launched in 1969 on everything from full-size Chevrolets and sporty Chevelles to the economical and compact Chevy II. Liquid Tire Chain joined a group of other late-’60s wintery options such headlight washers, a rear-window defroster, and an engine block heater.

The Liquid Tire Chain theory was sound. A control on the instrument panel activated a pair of aerosol canisters mounted above the rear tires that contained a chemical compound labeled Liquid Tire Chain Traction Improver. Inside the canisters was a space-age polymer ready to coat the rear tires and turn slip into grip. Press the button and presto! Evaporating solvent left a traction-improving chemical compound on the tires that resulted in instant winter traction, even on ice. Whether or not the system worked in practice is a matter of historical debate.

MORE CLASSIC CAR STORIES FROM HAGERTY

Just over 2,600 Liquid Tire Chain systems made it onto the road across the 1969 Chevrolet lineup, with the vast majority installed on full-size Chevrolets. For reasons unknown, the V75 Liquid Tire Chain lasted for only a single year. Jaded and perhaps frozen-solid snow and rust belt winter drivers were evidently not convinced that two aerosol cans of anything, not even space-age polymers, could loosen winter’s icy grip on traction, even if the skull and crossbones were right there on the can.

The idea of incorporating winter-traction control into the automobile itself—in the form of liquid or physical tire chains, dedicated snow tires, or all-wheel drive—certainly has merit compared with the corrosive assault from millions of tons of road salt spread onto roads.

Even though V75 Liquid Tire Chain chemical traction might not have taken hold with consumers, relief came in the form of electronically controlled (and thankfully less-toxic) traction assist. Traction and stability control are today ubiquitous features, and advances in tire compound technology and tread design have made putting rubber to road safer than ever, especially in winter.",Liquid Tire Chain: No traction?

“We're watching it very carefully and we are encouraging support for the legitimate government of Lebanon and we're asking other outside parties to stay out of it,” said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson while traveling in Asia. “To the extent there's foreign presence there, whether it's from Iran or Syria or wherever it might be from, we think those forces need to depart and leave.”

Saudi Arabia claims there’s a growing influence of Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and that aggression is a Lebanese declaration of war against Saudi Arabia.

This week, the Saudi government requested its citizens leave Lebanon. Last weekend, the Saudi-backed Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned during a trip to Saudi Arabia. Hariri is still in Saudi Arabia.

Hezbollah’s leader in Lebanon said Saudi Arabia forced Lebanon’s prime minister to resign and that the Saudi government has declared war against Lebanon.

""Lebanon's prime minister is detained in Saudi Arabia and it has to release him,” said Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader. “The Lebanese should work to bring him back to Lebanon and then it is up to him to go wherever, maybe he wants to go back to Saudi - it is his call.""

Secretary Tillerson spoke earlier this week with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al Jubeir, according to the State Department. Secretary Tillerson said the foreign minister claimed Hariri decided to resign “on his own.” The secretary also said he has no indication the Saudis are holding Hariri against his will and pointed out Hariri’s family has lived in Saudi Arabia for some time.

“I'm hopeful that if that is still his intent to leave that he'll do that so that the government of Lebanon can function properly,” said Tillerson of Hariri.

Lebanon’s government is a power-sharing structure designed to distribute power along religious sects. The parliament’s speaker position is reserved for a Shiite Muslim, a Sunni Muslim occupies the prime minister’s office, and the president is a Maronite Christian.

Iran is a Shiite Muslim state while Saudi Arabia’s government enforces a conservative version of Sunni Islam. Their rivalry extends throughout the region, particularly through Syria and Yemen.

Last weekend, Saudi Arabia intercepted a missile fired at its capital from Yemen. Saudi Arabia is fighting Iran-backed rebels in Yemen and the Saudi government claims the missile was an act of war by Iran.

Lt. Gen. Jeffrey L. Harrigian, the commander of the U.S. Air Force’s Central Command, said the missile’s remnants had ""Iranian markings.""

“Once we can confirm that with some actual forensics I think that will be useful in deciding what action to take next, particularly at the U.N. Security Council because that would represent a violation of certain Security Council resolutions in terms of providing arms into a conflict zone,” said Secretary Tillerson. “Whether this specific missile came from Iran, it seems very likely but I think we’d like to get the final forensics on it.”",US asks foreign forces to leave Lebanon as Iran-Saudi tension heats up,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/10/us-asks-foreign-forces-to-leave-lebanon-as-iran-saudi-tension-heats-up.html

Often, they are looking to remove the outer layers of the claws as new claws grow, also it feels so good to get a stretch on the vertical surface!""

And the media and Democrats continue to peddle the line that it played no role during the election itself.

The dossier, she said, is “part of what happens in a campaign where you get information that may or may not be useful and you try to make sure anything you put out in the public arena is accurate. So this thing didn’t come out until after the election, and it’s still being evaluated.”

A little girl who was born with a life-threatening heart condition saw a big wish come true recently, when she was able to “marry” her best friend in a special playground ceremony. Sophia Elyssa Chiappalone, of Connecticut, has already undergone two open-heart surgeries and several other procedures, and had made the special request ahead of a third surgery, which is scheduled for January at Boston Children’s Medical Center, Yahoo reported.

On Oct. 23, Sophia and her best friend, Hunter, who she met in preschool, joined together on a playground and exchanged “vows” while photographer Marisa Balletti-Lavoie of Sassy Mouth Photo captured the precious images. The idea came from the pint-sized bride herself, and was happily agreed to by Hunter and his mom.

Sophia was diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, which is a genetic heart defect involving four different issues, shortly after her birth. Sophia’s mother, Kristy Somerset-Chiappalone, started the “Sophia Elyssa Chiappalone the beautiful baby with a broken heart” Facebook page and explained that her daughter’s case is considered severe and will require several open-heart procedures before it is completely repaired. The condition is also likely to shorten her lifespan, and she will need a heart and lung transplant in the future.

“She’s a walking miracle,” Somerset-Chiappalone told NBC Connecticut. “There is no life expectancy at this time because there’s no reason for her to be alive.”

Balletti-Lavoie told Yahoo she was asked to do the shoot by Hunter’s mom, Tracy Laferriere, who is a close friend. Shortly after she shared photos of the pair on her Facebook page, their story went viral.

“I cannot help but be overwhelmed by the love and support we’ve gotten with Sophia and her recent wish,” Somerset-Chiappalone posted on her personal Facebook page, on Oct. 25. “It was pure innocence in the purest form.

The television plays a crucial part in our day-to-day lives, so it’s important to keep its placement in mind when planning out a room. Given the shape and massive size of today’s TVs, the big screen has become a massive eyesore without many places to go other than smack dab in the center of a wall. If this is sounds familiar, get ready to get inspired by these three inventive tricks to hide your TV in plain sight.

1. Camouflage it with a black wall. One lone rectangular block of black in a room can create a striking feature that is unfavorable in many designs. By extending the dark hue across a bigger space, you can create a fun accent wall and play down the glaring, shiny black electronic screen. All it requires is a bucket of paint from your local hardware store and a little know-how on basic painting techniques.

If a full black wall is too bold for your design taste, painting just the horizontal strip of the wall that the TV occupies is a nice compromise. Then, you can balance the room with black home decor pieces. Keep it minimal with a black-and-white palette or add some color to lighten the look.

2. Pair it alongside other appliances. If you’re faced with the scenario of having two or more gaping black holes in your room, the best solution may be to simply combine them as an intentional arrangement instead of an odd-one-out situation. For example, you can juxtapose a fireplace with a TV above the mantel. Get a gallery look by hanging similarly-sized pieces, such as a cabinet or oversized artwork. Alternatively, if you enjoy watching television in the kitchen while you prepare or eat dinner, nestle it in with other appliances, such as an oven or wine fridge.

Be sure to take some safety measures when displaying electronics above appliances. Protect your TV from rising heat by mounting it above a mantel or enclosing it in a well-ventilated cabinet. Also make sure the television is still at a comfortable viewing angle to reduce neck strain or consider investing in a flexible wall mount.

3. Invest in built-ins. This is a more customized approach to hiding a TV. Sliding doors, swiveling panels and folding cabinets are carefully measured to the device for a sleek disguise. One of the simpler strategies is to cover the TV with sliding doors that can be matched to the rest of your wall or stand out as an interesting focal point. Other popular ideas include a snug art panel that slides to reveal or conceal a TV. Or if you’d rather opt for a cabinet enclosure, you can conceal additional media components, like speakers or game consoles. Although these options are more expensive and time-consuming, they will completely conceal your TV from view. Do your research and consult an experienced cabinetmaker, electrician or media professional to make the job more manageable.",3 strategies for disguising your TV in plain sight,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/03/3-strategies-for-disguising-your-tv-in-plain-sight.html

Rod Green says that at a Christmas dinner one year, Kelley had ""bragged about being armed."" The Greens also said they watched Kelley closely when he showed up wearing all black last month at a festival at the church.

Judy Green says Kelley was ""completely distant and way out in thought.""

Kelley died of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound after Sunday's massacre.

The sanctuary of the small-town Texas church where a gunman carried out a massacre will be turned into a temporary memorial for the more than two dozen victims.

The grounds steward of First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs tells The Associated Press Friday that services will never take place there again and the building will eventually be demolished.

The gunman shot and killed 25 people at the church on Sunday. Authorities have put the official toll at 26, because one victim was pregnant.

Grounds steward Rod Green says the building will be scrubbed down and the church will place 26 chairs inside to commemorate the victims.

Green says the church plans to build a new structure on church property elsewhere. Green says regular services will be held Sunday at a community hall run by a local association.

More than 500 people have attended a private funeral on a San Antonio-area Air Force base for a husband and wife who were among the more than two dozen killed when a gunman opened fire at a small-town Texas church.

The San Antonio Express-News reports that the service for Scott and Karen Marshall was held Thursday afternoon at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph.

Randy Martin, spokesman for the 12th Flying Training Wing, says a traditional military funeral was held for the couple, who were killed Sunday at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs. The service was closed to media and the public at their family's request.

Martin told the newspaper that Karen Marshall was promoted posthumously to senior master sergeant. She had been planning to retire from the military soon. Martin said Scott Marshall, already a military retiree, was a civilian employee at the base.

Medical officials say 11 people remain hospitalized with wounds from Texas church shooting that left more than two dozen dead remain hospitalized.

Conditions of the patients at two San Antonio hospitals range from good to critical. They were among those wounded when a gunman opened fire at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs last Sunday. The gunman died of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being chased by bystanders and crashing his car.

Brooke Army Medical Center on Friday reported having seven patients from the church. The hospital says patients include five adults and two children.

University Health System had four patients, two of whom are children.

Officials at both hospitals declined to release more specific information on the wounded patients.

A weekly food pantry has resumed operations at a site next to the Texas church that less than a week ago endured the state's worst mass shooting.

The pantry's director, Lula White, was among the more than two dozen killed Sunday at the First Baptist Church in Sutherlands Springs. White was also the 71-year-old grandmother of the gunman's wife.

On Friday, people crowded the small space, tearfully hugging and filling bags with donated bakery goods, groceries and used clothing. As 68-year-old Brandy Johnson walked in, she exclaimed she could ""see Lu at the desk.""

Husband and wife, Rod and Judy Green, have operated the pantry for 11 years. They were married at First Baptist but didn't attend the service that Devin Kelley brought to an untimely end with semi-automatic gunfire.

Residents and neighbors of Sutherland Springs volunteered Thursday as a way help the tiny Texas community recover from the shooting at a Baptist church that left more than two dozen dead.

Twenty-year-old Karyssa Calbert of neighboring Floresville, who is six months pregnant, could not give blood but came to give moral support. She says people are doing what they can, ""but honestly everyone feels so helpless.""

Dr. Evelyn Mok-Lin, a reproductive endocrinologist and medical director of the center, said several of these patients originally requested a fertility workup, often because their friends had gotten one done, and were worried by their low antimüllerian hormone (AMH) levels or how many ovarian eggs they have left.

This scenario is even more concerning following a study published last week that low AMH levels are not tied to a woman’s chances of getting pregnant.

“There’s a pervasive misconception that AMH predicts fertility and is a measure of egg quality — both of those things are false,” explained Mok-Lin. “AMH is purely a measure of egg quantity,” not successful pregnancy outcomes.

There’s a lot of worry around infertility.

According to a Johns Hopkins study, 19 percent of 18- to 29-year-old women think they’re probably infertile, while only 6 percent are likely to be.

Half of women report they are putting off parenthood, often until their mid-30s when it’s harder to conceive.

The rising age of motherhood has likely added to women’s uncertainty around fertility.

Modern Fertility is hoping to stem that anxiety by “giving people the tools they need to have more control over their fertility,” Afton Vechery, the co-founder of the startup told Healthline.

Vechery and co-founder Carly Leahy believe information is the first step to helping women who aren’t quite ready for kids learn about their fertility health.

When she was talking to her 20- and 30-something female friends, Vechery realized “a common theme was really high anxiety around infertility and that there was no easy way for them to get answers.”

To change that, Modern Fertility is launching an at-home testing kit that will analyze 10 hormones related to fertility.

Here’s how it works: You’ll receive a package in the mail with clear instructions.

Then, you prick your finger and put four drops of blood onto a blood collection card. You’ll ship the card back to a CLIA- and CAP-accredited lab.

Modern Fertility will then provide women with a “simple, easy to understand” online report.

That analysis will include Modern Fertility’s proprietary fertility score — still in development — which will compare an individual’s fertility health to that of other women her age.

“We also give you the option to swing by a local lab,” and will provide a lab slip to bring in, Vechery noted. You can preorder kits now for $149, which will ship later this year.

Vox writes that the business of fertility tests is a “booming market for a new arm of medicine,” and lists Modern Fertility’s competitors, like Future Family, as companies capitalizing on the proactive — and possibly unnecessary — test.

“In this case, I worry people just want more info because it’s easy and cheap. It could lead them to pursue fertility treatment before they actually know they need it,” Mok-Lin said.

Also, reproductive endocrinologists and clinical chemists specializing in fertility are skeptical about the actual scientific accuracy of the promised product, which is positioned as a replacement for more expensive in-office tests.

Potentially a $149 extra expense

Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a reproductive endocrinologist who encourages women to start routinely checking their fertility health by 25 years old, believes “anything that can raise awareness about women’s fertility is a positive thing.”

That includes Modern Fertility, which has the marketing savvy and ease-of-use to reach thousands of women.

“I want the same number of people that know about 23andMe to get their fertility checked,” said Eyvazzadeh.

She’s impressed by Modern Fertility’s mission to make testing accessible to all women regardless of socioeconomic status.

A Modern Fertility test kit sells for $149, which Vechery calls “a fraction of the cost” of the same tests at hospitals or at fertility clinics.

However, actual savings — if any — vary widely depending on the woman’s insurance, the clinic she goes to, and the state she lives in. A fertility panel typically runs from fully covered by insurance to $350.

If you want to follow up on your results with a doctor, you aren’t saving any money.

“If a woman brought her Modern Fertility results to a fertility doctor, the tests would need to be repeated,” Dr. Janet Choi, a reproductive endocrinologist at CCRM New York explained.

So, instead of saving you $149 dollars, the kit could be an extra expense.

While positioning themselves as a cheaper alternative to fertility testing, Modern Fertility writes on its site that “tests are exclusively intended to be used for wellness monitoring.”

Vechery clarified, “Our test is designed to supplement the interaction between a woman and her doctor. We do not diagnose any conditions and instead, inform a female about these hormones and fertility/infertility more broadly so she can make decisions that are right for her.”

She also noted that all of the content that accompanies each of the results has been developed alongside and approved by medical professionals.

These professionals haven’t been named by the company, but Vechery told Healthline that they’re in the process of hiring a chief medical officer.

Sensitive results without counseling

Modern Fertility’s test is not meant to replace tests needed in a full fertility work-up — it’s just a supplement.

The ease of online ordering and at-home testing has the potential to reach more women than in-office tests and close the fertility awareness gap.

But Eyvazzadeh and Choi worry that the intimate nature of fertility makes delivering results online irresponsible.

For example, if a woman finds out that she doesn’t have as high of an egg count as expected at her age, it could cause her to become depressed unnecessarily or seek out fertility treatment.

Certain results could lead a woman to freeze her eggs, undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF), or have a baby sooner.

Even with recently published studies showing egg count isn’t connected to getting pregnant, many fertility doctors recommend women get a screening by the time they’re 30 as a first step to understanding their overall fertility health.

Modern Fertility said they’re pairing with physicians to analyze tests, which Eyvazzadeh said is essential.

But all fertility experts expressed concern about the lack of explanation and comfort a doctor traditionally provides.

“They say that they have a panel of advisors to help interpret results, but I don’t think that’s enough counseling for a patient,” Choi said.

However, she’s positive about the potential conversation about fertility that the startup could help advance.

“If these tests are truly pretty accurate, it’s a good starting point for women to do these in the privacy in their own home. Women could use it as stepping stone to get consultation with doctors, but need to follow up” to really understand results, Choi said.

Fertility is more complicated than a score

Modern Fertility’s kit is testing for how many eggs a woman has left in her ovaries — not their quality — as well as for endocrine, or hormone, disorders.

Not all fertility issues are caused by endocrine disorders, and further evidence shows that there’s no link between egg count and getting pregnant. The AMH test was actually developed as a complementary test for egg extraction during IVF.

Modern Fertility will analyze some biomarkers related to the endocrine system, including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and some hormones closely associated with fertility, like AMH.

Mok-Lin said some analysis of the other hormones Modern Fertility is testing for, like TSH, “is very cut and dry. There are set cutoffs in the lab between what’s normal and what isn’t. You can give a quick interpretation.”

What concerns Mok-Lin is the interpretation of the hormones targeted at fertility — follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), luteinizing hormone (LH), and progesterone (P4) specifically — that some tests call for.

To give a woman an accurate picture of her fertility health, the hormone test needs to be analyzed in the context of a woman’s age, family and medical history, and lifestyle.

“A hormone test alone is not the whole story but it’s definitely a start,” Eyvazzadeh said.

Reproductive endocrinologists and the clinical chemists that specialize in fertility hormones also stress that there is no 100 percent accurate test of egg health.

What makes analyzing a woman’s fertility workup even more complicated is that “each one of those 10 markers has limitations and have to be interpreted within the full clinical picture,” said Joely Straseski, PhD, the medical director of endocrinology for ARUP Laboratory and a spokesperson for the American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

“I’m extremely concerned about how they will be interpreted,” Straseski stated.

The interpretation is so nuanced that even OB-GYNs refer patients to fertility endocrinologists.

“I worry the results would cause panic and stress because there’s not good interpretation,” Mok-Lin further explained.

The emotional reaction of patients to results is also less controlled and supportive than in an office setting.

Choi explains how she’d approach two scenarios where egg count wouldn’t be used as a sole indicator of fertility.

For example, if a woman gets a fertility health workup at age 35 that says her egg count is high, a fertility doctor would run more bloodwork or propose an ultrasound.

“Even if I see a low AMH in a 30-year-old woman, I’m not going to counsel her and say ‘you’re doomed to infertility.’ I’d counsel her to think about having a family sooner,” Choi said.

Fertility score is a “red flag”

The ability to have a personalized conversation about options contrasts with Modern Fertility’s delivery of results.

Along with hormone test analysis, women will get a fertility score. This score will compare data on your ovarian reserve, ovulation, and general body systems with that of other women your age.

“The fertility score raises a whole bunch of red flags for me,” David Grenache, PhD, a clinical chemist, chief scientific officer at TriCore Reference Laboratories, and a spokesperson for the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, told Healthline.

“How was that equation developed? Is it based upon actual patients that have known outcomes? Will it be published and peer-reviewed or is it a trade secret?” he questioned.

Modern Fertility’s website says the score is “approved for ages 21–40.” “Who approved it?” Grenache asked.

According to Vechery, “The fertility score is in development. Today the fertility score is physician mediated and used for tracking purposes of females every year. We eventually intend to publish in a peer-reviewed journal.”

“I wouldn’t even know how to counsel a patient based on that fertility score,” Choi said.

That the score could be confusing or distressing to a patient is also problematic.

Is accurate at-home blood testing for fertility possible?

Modern Fertility’s promise of easy-to-read results delivered to your door is part of a trend toward accessible care in the United States.

Patrick Beattie, who has a background in chemical engineering and rapid diagnostics, is passionate about accessible care. He believes people should have much more control over their health.

A main way to do that is to move health access like testing and pharmacies to much more convenient locations, including the home.

As an acquaintance of the co-founders who is not involved with Modern Fertility, he’s impressed by the co-founders’ commitment to accessible care. He also reiterated the need for solid science.

“It’s important to combine this passion for concept — more convenient care — with the rigor of science to make sure we’re not creating hype,” Beattie said. “There’s a potential downside if you overhype things, especially in the consumer market.”

Modern Fertility’s lack of peer-reviewed or published science — all while they’re pre-selling kits on their website — is troubling to several people Healthline talked to.

Dried blood spot (DBS) samples, like the ones Modern Fertility plans to use in their at-home kits, have been around for decades.

But this consumer testing, as well as use of small sample sizes, could create some accuracy issues — giving women anxiety about infertility or assuring them they’re fine when they’re not.

It’s not clear what type of method or methods the company plans to use to measure each of the 10 hormones.

“The number of things (analytes) [able to be measured] would entirely depend on the method being used… which we don’t know in this case,” Straseski said.

While “there isn’t a finite number of things (analytes) that you could theoretically measure in one drop of blood,” Straseski clarified, it’s most common to measure one analyte per dried blood spot.

That’s because smaller amounts of blood contain fewer molecules of each analyte. To test for 10 different things, you need to provide a sufficient amount of blood.

That’s why, as Grenache explained, “More is better.” It’s both easier to analyze, and you get more reliable results.

Grenache is extremely skeptical of the analysis that Modern Fertility is selling. “I am doubtful they can do what they claim with any degree of accuracy required of clinical blood tests,” he said.

Not only is the amount of blood being collected minimal, compared to many protocols — though this cannot be assessed further since Modern Fertility won’t be sharing their methods until later this year — but the finger prick method could cause a few additional problems when analyzing this sensitive information.

“The quality of a test result is only as good as the quality of the sample” is the core tenet of laboratory chemistry, Grenache shared.

To ensure the quality of blood samples, the blood spots must dry for three to four hours in a horizontal position and at room temperature, which will be impossible to ensure at home.

Some tests also need to be collected on a specific day during a woman’s cycle.

Also, blood from a finger prick is not as high quality as blood taken with a needle at your doctor’s office. The blood is affected as it passes through skin and tissue. “Many tests are compromised by that type of collection,” Grenache confirmed.

Modern Fertility is not yet publicly disclosing details, but said they plan to publish peer-reviewed information.

“It’s up to Modern Fertility to prove that they can deliver these tests from a technically feasible standpoint,” Beattie said.

Expanding awareness of fertility can empower women

Although questions around the scientific legitimacy of Modern Fertility’s fertility test remain, most of the experts believed the company could help bringing awareness to fertility health and give women access to more important information.

“Fertility is extremely complex. It’s rarely as easy as getting a simple score and knowing your fertility health,” Straseski told Healthline.

For women who want to know more about their fertility health now, keep these three things in mind:

If you’re able to, visit a doctor in person or virtually to make medical decisions or get feedback on potentially emotional issues instead of using consumer products.

Talk to your OB-GYN about your lifestyle habits, family history, and potential timeline for having a child to see if a fertility health test is right for you.

Check consumer health products’ websites for published scientific studies before sending them any money.

If you do order a fertility health test from a website, schedule an immediate follow-up with your doctor to make sure you’re interpreting the results and recommended next steps accurately.

Moore, a former Alabama state judge, allegedly had sexual contact with teenage girls in the late 1970s and 1980s, the Washington Post reported. Leigh Corfman said Moore had sexual contact with her when she was just 14 and he was 32.

The age of consent in Alabama is 16.

Moore has denied the allegations, saying in a statement obtained by Fox News on Friday that the article was ""based on a lie supported by innuendo.""

""It seems that in the political arena, to say that something is not true is simply not good enough. So let me be clear. I have never provided alcohol to minors, and I have never engaged in sexual misconduct,"" he said.

""As a father of a daughter and a grandfather of five granddaughters, I condemn the actions of any man who engages in sexual misconduct not just against minors but against any woman,"" he added.

Moore, who urged ""the Washington Post, and everyone involved, to tell the truth,"" also said that he trusts ""that the people of Alabama, who know my record after 40 years of public service, will vouch for my character and commitment to the rule of law.""

Still, multiple Republicans have called on Moore to step aside from the special election in December. And the National Republican Senatorial Committee reportedly severed its fundraising ties with Moore.

The White House

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said if the allegations are true, President Trump believes that ""Moore will do the right thing and step aside.""

“Like most Americans, the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a person’s life,"" Sanders said. ""However, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.""

Vice President Mike Pence, “found the allegations in the story disturbing and believes, if true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office,” his press secretary, Alyssa Farah, told reporters.

Sen. Mitch McConnell

“If these allegations are true, he must step aside,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement.

Sen. Cory Gardner

“The allegations against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore are deeply troubling. If these allegations are found to be true, Roy Moore must drop out of the Alabama special Senate election,” Sen. Cory Gardner,R-Colo., the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, said in a statement.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski

“I’m horrified and if it’s true, he should step down immediately,” Murkowski told reporters.

She reportedly also urged Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed to fill Jeff Sessions’ seat when he was tapped to become attorney general, to launch a write-in campaign. The deadline to take Moore off the ballot has passed.

Sen. Mike Lee

Although he formerly endorsed Moore, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has now asked for his image to be removed from any campaign materials.

Sen. Mike Rounds

“If they are true, then he should seriously think about stepping aside,"" Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said.

Sen. John Cornyn

“I find it deeply distrusting and troubling. It’s up to the governor and the folks of Alabama to make that decision as far as what the next steps are,"" Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said.

Sen. Tim Scott

“If they’re accurate, he absolutely should [step aside],"" Tim Scott, of South Carolina, said.

Sen. Susan Collins

“If there is any truth at all to these horrific allegations, Roy Moore should immediately step aside as Senate candidate,"" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.

Sen. Steve Daines

""These are very serious allegations and if true he should step down,"" said Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont.

Sen. John McCain

“The allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying. He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of,"" Arizona Sen. John McCain said.

Sen. Richard Shelby

“It’s a devastating nasty story,” Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby told reporters. “If it’s true, I don’t believe there’d be a place for him in the U.S. Senate.”

Sen. Jeff Flake

Like other Republicans, Flake called on Moore to “step aside” from the election if the allegations are true.

He has also tweeted his call for Moore to “step aside immediately” and lambasted local Alabama GOP officials who defended Moore.

Sen. Luther Strange

Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, who lost the special election primary to Roy Moore, called the allegations “disturbing.”

He has not yet said if he’ll reenter the race, but told the Associated Press that he is doing “research.” It is too late to take Moore off the ballot, but Strange has been encouraged to launch a write-in campaign.

Sen. Rob Portman

“I think if what we read is true, and people are on the record so I assume it is, then he should step aside,” Ohio Sen. Rob Portman said.

Sen. Ben Sasse

Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called the Washington Post’s story ""heartbreaking.""

The senator also agreed on Twitter with National Review editor Jonah Goldberg who said, “As the father of a 14 year old girl, this ‘What’s the big deal?’ crap enrages me.”

Sen. Ted Cruz

""These are serious and troubling allegations,"" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who previously endorsed Moore, said in a statement. ""If they are true, Judge Moore should immediately withdraw. However, we need to know the truth, and Judge Moore has the right to respond to these accusations.""

Rep. Paul Ryan

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement that if the allegations are true, they would disqualify Moore from the special election in December.

“These allegations are disqualifying if true. Anyone who would do this to a child has no place in public office, let alone the United States Senate,” Ryan said in a statement.

Rep. Peter King

""I would say unless he can prove his innocence, the burden is now on him within the next day or so, I believe he has to step down. He owes it to himself, he owes it to the state and and he owes it to the U.S. Senate,"" New York Rep. Peter King said on MSNBC

Gov. John Kasich

Ohio Gov. John Kasich said on Twitter that he’s “long opposed” Moore and called on him to step aside from the race as well.

“I’ve long opposed Roy Moore [and] his divisive viewpoints. The actions described make him unfit for office. The GOP must not support him. He should step aside,” Kasich said.

Former Gov. Mitt Romney

Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, slammed Moore on Twitter.

Moore made the comments in an extensive new written statement and in an interview on the ""Sean Hannity Radio Show.""

On Thursday, a Washington Post report alleged that Moore initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl in 1979, when he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney in Gadsden, Ala. The report also included claims by three other women that Moore asked them out on dates -- and in two cases, kissed them -- when they were between the ages of 16 and 18. The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16.

""I have never provided alcohol to minors, and I have never engaged in sexual misconduct,"" said Moore in his statement, referencing a claim by one of the women that he gave her wine when she was below Alabama's legal drinking age, which is 19.

""As a father of a daughter and a grandfather of five granddaughters,"" Moore went on. ""I condemn the actions of any man who engages in sexual misconduct not just against minors but against any woman.""

In the radio interview with Hannity, Moore denied ever knowing Leigh Corfman, who told the Post he made sexual advances toward her when she was 14. However, he did not deny dating teenagers as young as 16.

""You understand this was 40 years ago,"" Moore said. ""And after my return from the military, I dated a lot of young ladies.""

When asked by Hannity if he dated teenagers when he was in his 30s, Moore said ""It would have been out of my customary behavior,"" and added that he didn't ""remember dating any girl without the permission of her mother.""

In his statement, Moore implored ""the Washington Post, and everyone involved [in the story], to tell the truth."" But on the radio, Moore said he was ""sure in the next four weeks, they're gonna come out with another article."" He also said that his campaign had ""some evidence of collusion,"" but did not elaborate.

""I trust that the people of Alabama, who know my record after 40 years of public service, will vouch for my character and commitment to the rule of law,"" Moore's statement concluded.

The allegations have caused an outcry from national Republican leaders, who have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are proven true. On Friday, the Senate GOP's campaign arm formally ended its fundraising agreement with Moore.

The GOP's 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney condemned his colleagues' caveat -- only if the allegations are true.

""Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections. I believe Leigh Corfman,"" Romney said. ""Her account is too serious to ignore. Moore is unfit for office and should step aside.""

However, the former state Supreme Court justice has emphatically refused to leave the race, telling Hannity if candidates step aside due to accusations, ""you might as well not run, because when you run you're going to get allegations.""

Despite the allegations, Moore also has the support of several Republican officials in Alabama.

""Humphrey Bogart started dating Lauren Bacall when she was a teenager,"" said state Auditor Jim Ziegler, referring to the then-19-year-old actress.

Paul Reynolds, Alabama's Republican National Committeeman, called it ""a firestorm designed to shipwreck a campaign in Alabama. I think it's sinister.""

The vulnerability, which Appthority researchers have dubbed Eavesdropper, was introduced when developers ""carelessly"" hard coded their credentials in mobile apps using the Twilio Rest API or SDK for communications services. Those developers failed to follow Twilio's guidelines for secure use of credentials and tokens.

""By hard coding their credentials, the developers have effectively given global access to all metadata stored in their Twilio accounts, including text/SMS messages, call metadata, and voice recordings,"" Appthority's Michael Bentley wrote in a blog post. ""The scope of the exposure is massive including hundreds of millions of call records, minutes of calls and audio recordings, and text messages.""

About 33 percent of apps with the Eavesdropper bug are business-related. They include ""an app for secure communication for a federal law enforcement agency, an app that enables enterprise sales teams to record audio and annotate discussions in real-time, and branded and white label navigation apps for customers such as AT&T and US Cellular,"" Appthority wrote in a news release.

The vulnerability, which Appthority has described as ""easy"" to exploit, would allow an attacker to ""access confidential knowledge about a company's business dealings and make moves to capitalize on them for extorting actions or personal gain,"" Bentley added.

Collectively, the affected apps have been downloaded around 180 million times. Moreover, more than 170 of the affected apps are currently available in official app stores today.

Appthority discovered the flaw in April 2017 and notified Twilio about it the following month. Twilio has since reached out to developers of the affected apps and is working with them to secure their accounts.

Meanwhile, Appthority says this problem is not limited to apps created with Twilio.

I give China great credit.""

But anyone who thinks this comment represents a softening of the president’s commitment to renegotiating trade deals so they better reflect American interests better think again.

President Trump sees in China a nation that has used trade to dramatically increase its wealth and place in the world, taking advantage of past U.S. acquiescence to Chinese trading practices.

This is why President Trump turned his rhetorical guns away from the Chinese government and toward the practices of former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, which allowed Beijing to run roughshod over U.S. interests.

The president will have the opportunity to take some immediate action on the trade enforcement front when he returns home from his Asia trip. He will need to deal with a unanimous decision by the United States International Trade Commission that found the free trade agreement between the U.S. and South Korea has been violated repeatedly by South Korean washing machine manufacturers Samsung and LG.

Whirlpool CEO, Jeff M. Fettig called the U.S. International Trade Commission’s decision “a win for American manufacturers and American workers.” He added: “For the third time since 2013, the ITC has found that Samsung and LG engaged in unlawful conduct by violating U.S. trade laws. This vote sets the stage for the administration to put in place an effective remedy to create a level playing field for American workers and manufacturers. This type of corrective action will create U.S. manufacturing jobs.”

The U.S. International Trade Commission will make an official recommendation to President Trump in December on what action to take regarding the South Korean companies.

According to the commission’s website: “The Commission may recommend to the President an increase in a duty, imposition of a quota, imposition of a tariff-rate quota … trade adjustment assistance, or any combination of such actions. In addition, the Commission may also recommend that the President initiate international negotiations to address the underlying cause of the increase in imports or that he implement any other action authorized under the law that is likely to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition.”

The effect of the Samsung and LG washing machine dumping has been a dramatic increase in the share of the U.S. washing machine market going to the two companies that can be attributed to their illegal actions.

A retail and consumer market-share survey run by the Stevenson Company found that from mid-2008 to mid-2017, Samsung’s U.S. market-share jumped from an almost insignificant 1.7 percent to nearly 20 percent of the entire U.S. washing machine market. LG, for its part, experienced around a 30 percent gain to just over 16 percent of market-share.

The net result of the two South Korean companies dumping assault on U.S. markets has been that they have gone from having about 14 percent market-share to a 36 percent share.

This dramatic increase demonstrates that the concerted strategy by Samsung and LG to willfully violate the trade laws agreed to by the United States and South Korea has paid handsome dividends.

Now that both companies have established a significant U.S. foothold for their washing machines, Samsung and LG are planning on opening manufacturing plants in South Carolina and Tennessee, respectively, in an attempt to hold onto and expand their gains.

This wrinkle is why the decision by the U.S. International Trade Commission last month against the South Korean companies sets the stage for a major test of the Trump administration’s resolve in enforcing trade deals.

If Samsung and LG are allowed to substantially benefit from a long pattern of dumping at a loss into the U.S. market after getting caught with their hands in the cookie jar for the third time, it will send an unmistakable signal around the world that – all the rhetoric aside – it is foolish to follow trade rules that don’t suit your purposes.

On the surface, it may seem like the upcoming White House decision on the Samsung, LG trade case is about washing machines. But it is really about the integrity of every current and future U.S. trade deal.

Gardeners know that a landscape is much more than plants. The lushest foliage and flowers have limited appeal without other elements to act as a foil. Rocks and stones play a vital role, setting unpolished grainy textures against delicate plants, playing earthy tones against vivid floral displays, and adding weight, mass and a sense of solidity to a dynamic green scene. Enlist these heavy hitters to take your garden to the next level of loveliness.

Steady as a rock. The presence of rocks in a garden is calming and restful. Surrounded by seasonal changes of plants and weather, rocks stand firm. For some, this steadfastness promotes a meditative environment and a strong connection with nature on a spiritual level.

Creating a rock garden as a place for reflection is possible in even the smallest garden, using existing materials and virtually no water. Sitting in a quiet corner contemplating plants growing in harmony with rocks is a respite from the busy outside world.

Stones for sustainability. Rocks, stones and gravel cut down on areas used for lawns and water-hungry plants, substantially reducing water usage. “With our limited water resources and changing climate, sustainability is an underlying philosophy for most landscape designers,” says Janine Mendel, a landscape designer at Cultivart Landscape Design.

Local heroes. Mendel points out that many washed river stones for sale are from countries like Indonesia, and this contributes to erosion there. Buying exotic stone is really the reverse of sustainability, she says. Going local makes even more sense when you factor in the financial and environmental cost of transporting heavy materials long distances.

Aesthetically, local stones and rocks add a cohesive look, especially if there are already naturally occurring rock elements in your garden.

Supporting players. Rocks and stones enhance feature plants as an attractive edging for garden beds. If existing soil is poor, they form a raised bed that can be filled with a more fertile medium.

When planting around rocks, consider color, shape and size. Dark green backgrounds make light rocks stand out, while pale planting makes an ideal foil for dark rocks. Don’t forget that rocks absorb heat — ideal for warmth-loving plants. Don’t plant shrubs that will grow to hide them.

Smooth stones are a lovely accent for tiny succulents in a small garden. Plant a selection of quirky cactuses in a light potting mix with crushed pumice or gravel mulch for drainage. Decorate with a layer of pretty stones — they’ll help retain moisture, which means that less watering is required.

Rocks au naturel. “The placement of rocks in a contrived landscape should reflect how they’d occur in a natural environment. It’s quite a creative skill,” Mendel says.

Japanese “dry landscapes.” Rocks and stones are fundamental to Asian gardens. The Japanese concept of karesansui, meaning “dry landscape,” has taken off globally as a way to use small spaces, reduce water consumption and provide a calm environment. Raked into ripples, sand or fine gravel represents ocean waves, while rocks symbolize islands. Moss is sometimes included, but no other plants or trees.

Water on the rocks. The alliance of rocks and water is key to Asian garden philosophy. It affirms the yin-yang concept of balancing opposite and complementary natural forces. Water is mercurial, filled with light and motion, while rocks are constant and immovable. Together, they create balance and unity.

Bring tranquillity and harmony to your garden by positioning rocks near water, whether it’s a small pond, a stone vessel or a bubbling water feature.

Water also intensifies subtle colors, sharpens contrast, and makes rocks and stones mirrorlike. Dull, dry rocks reveal their full beauty and character when wet, so submerge them or let droplets splash from a water feature to make them shine.

Sculptural rocks. When it comes to garden sculpture, nature does it best. Wind, water, earthquakes and time shape rocks into astonishing artworks. If you’re lucky enough to have an amazing rock, position it prominently to reveal its most interesting face.

Note: Landscaping outlets sell naturally sculpted rocks. Also keep an eye on construction sites — you may be able to get permission to haul away excavated rocks. Before removing any rock from private or public land like a beach or preserve, check to make sure that it’s allowed.

Bold boulders. A boulder is a large rock worn smooth by water. Transporting massive boulders for landscaping is expensive, but using lightweight ceramic versions is one solution.

Stacking stones. Humans have built piles of rocks and stones for eons; dry stone walls date back to Neolithic times. Rock walls have survived in many areas, including England, Ireland, Scandinavia and South America. The Peruvian Inca city of Machu Picchu is made entirely of dry stone construction.

“Currently in Australia one of the trends is … stone used in walling and paving rather than as a more sculptural element,” Mendel says. Local stones and no adhesive chemicals make dry stone walls an eco-friendly addition to a garden.

Cairns occur all over the world. In some places, they are primitive stone stacks; in others, elaborate hive-like monuments. They often have religious, memorial or ceremonial significance, though many were built as navigation aids for travelers.

Building a cairn is an absorbing way to spend time in nature. Play “rock Lego” and plant feathery grasses, such as the variegated Japanese silver grass (Miscanthus sinensis ‘Variegata’) that wave in the wind as a contrast.

A cairn can be as simple as a tower of rocks in decreasing sizes. Ensure that your rocks have a stable seat, or use a little help from cement. Practice on small ones until you get the idea. When you feel confident, go bigger.

Choose a spot where it shows to best advantage and where surrounding plants enhance it.

A liking for lichen. Moss and lichen add color and texture to rocks, and they bring the impression of age. Their amazing colors often occur naturally and turn a nondescript rock into a special attraction.

I’ve used a “moss milkshake” with some success — and a good dash of patience. Make a thick sludge of buttermilk or yogurt and live moss (many nurseries sell tubs of moss, or you could collect it), and then paint it on rocks and stones in a shady place. Mist with water daily until it’s established. Pitted rocks are a better medium than smooth ones.

""[It's] a clever way...to serve malicious files,"" a spokesperson for the internet security firm Avast told Fox News. ""Although it’s not completely new, it’s rarely seen as a mechanism of spreading malware such as banking Trojans.""

Computer security website Bleeping Computer covered the malware in a recent post.

""This group has taken a novel approach, never before seen in the distribution of banking Trojans,” Bleeping Computer wrote.

The ultimate goal is to trick you into going to the hacked site, then redirecting you until you reach a site offering a Microsoft Word document for download, according to Talos.

“Ironically we have observed the same redirection system and associated infrastructure used to direct victims to tech support and fake [anti-virus] scams,"" Talos added.

So far, the malware seems to be targeting customers in Sweden, India, Australia and Saudi Arabia. But that’s never stopped successful malware from spreading to other countries.

YOUR SPAM IS GETTING DANGEROUS

How to protect yourself

Malware often needs you to proactively click on links and buttons. In this case when the Microsoft Word document is opened, it prompts pop-ups such as “Enable Editing,” “Enable Content” and ""Macros have been disabled."" If you do enable the macro, an executable download will infect your system.

The biggest red flag you’ll get is from Microsoft itself. By default, macros are disabled. And Microsoft wants you to keep it that way to protect you from documents coming from untrusted sources.

Avast told Fox News that it is currently ""blocking most of these sites, [which] prevents users from being infected.""

“Defending against this attack requires not only vigilance by companies to make sure the sites and servers are compromised, but that consumers pay attention to what they are clicking on and not enabling macros or open unknown attachments,” according to a post at SC Media, a cybersecurity website.","Cunning malware spreads, going after your bank account",http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/11/10/cunning-malware-spreads-going-after-your-bank-account.html

The Wall Street Journal reported that the alleged plan being investigated would have paid Flynn and his son Michael Flynn Jr. up to $15 million for delivering Fethullah Gulen to the Turkish government.

The Journal cited “people with knowledge of the FBI’s inquiries” saying the bureau is asking individuals about a December meeting in New York City with Flynn and Turkish government representatives where Gulen’s removal was discussed.

Lawyers for Flynn said in a statement that the allegations were ""outrageous and prejudicial"" before concluding, ""they are false.""

""Out of respect for the process of the various investigations regarding the 2016 campaign, we have intentionally avoided responding to every rumor or allegation raised in the media,"" Robert Kelner, Stephen Anthony and Brian Smith wrote. ""But today's news cycle has brought allegations about General Flynn, ranging from kidnapping to bribery, that are so outrageous and prejudicial that we are making an exception to our usual rule.""

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long sought for the U.S. to extradite Gulen, who resides in the United States. The Journal reported that the alleged discussions involved possibly moving Gulen to a Turkish prison island.

The investigation is part of Mueller’s expansive probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion with Trump associates. The probe has resulted so far in the indictment of Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort, relating to his work for the government in Ukraine.

Sources told the Journal it’s not clear whether the Gulen plan resulted in any money changing hands.

Flynn used to lobby for Turkish interests. He left the Trump White House after misleading Vice President Pence on his contacts with the Russian ambassador. His Turkey and Russia ties are now the subject of various investigations.

Asked about the New York meeting in question, a White House spokesman told the Journal: “We don’t have any evidence that such a meeting took place. And if it did it take place it happened not withstanding the transition.”

Inspired by the countless accusations of sexual harassment and assault lobbied against Weinstein and numerous other powerful men in Hollywood, BMI country songwriter of the year, Ross Copperman, felt inspired to comment on it the only way he knows how. “Female,” which can be heard below, was specifically written with this scandal in mind for Urban to perform. The songwriter has previously written lyrics for stars like Kenny Chesney, Jake Owen and Brett Eldredge.

On Tuesday, Urban was recognized by BMI for his philanthropy and said that he immediately recognized the profound and important lyrics in the song and got in the recording studio right away.

“I think it's just time for a recalibrating of the past, you know? Things have been a certain way for a long, long time, and I think you're seeing a turning of the tide for that,"" Urban told the Associated Press. ""This song just spoke to me. I just wanted to get in and record it right away.""

Vernon Dahmer (DAY'-mur) of Hattiesburg was targeted because he encouraged fellow African-Americans to register to vote during the Jim Crow era.

His widow, 92-year-old Ellie Dahmer, toured the museum with four surviving children and several other relatives. It includes a gallery with photos and descriptions of how the Dahmer home was firebombed. Pieces of the family's burned pickup truck are also on display.

""I think Mississippi's come a long ways to even want to put something up to portray what really happened to people during the civil rights movement,"" Ellie Dahmer said. ""We lived it. Some of them died with it. The rest of Mississippi needs to know about it.""

The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the Museum of Mississippi History — two entities under a single roof — are opening Dec. 9 for the state's bicentennial in downtown Jackson.

Daughter Bettie Dahmer, 62, said she hopes young people, particularly those from poor areas of Mississippi, will visit the museum to learn about the state's troubled history that includes lynching and other violence.

Vernon Dahmer was a farmer and shop owner and served as president of the Forrest County NAACP. His family's home was a haven for young civil rights workers who were challenging state-sponsored racial oppression, and he became a Klan target in January 1966 when he went on the radio and announced he would pay the poll tax for people who couldn't afford it.

Dennis Dahmer, then 11, was asleep in the family home when Klansmen set it ablaze on Jan. 10, 1966. He said his family owned several guns because they lived in the country and liked to hunt. Dennis Dahmer said as the fire raged, his father went from window to window shooting out at Klansmen who were waiting outside to attack the family.

""From what we read (in) the FBI files, these Klansmen — they had the house completely surrounded,"" Dennis Dahmer, now 64, said Friday at the museum. ""They were waiting for us to run out there so they could kill us.""

The family escaped from the back of the house. Vernon Dahmer's lungs were seared by the heat and he died of his injuries.

A jury in 1998 convicted one-time Klan leader Sam Bowers of murder and arson in Dahmer's killing. Bowers was sentenced to life and died in prison in 2006.

The civil rights museum also includes exhibits of other pivotal figures in the push for racial equality, including Medgar Evers, the Mississippi NAACP leader who was assassinated outside his Jackson home in 1963.

The health ministry of Poland, which has one of the lowest birth rates in Europe, has put out a short video praising rabbits for producing many offspring.

The YouTube video shows rabbits munching on lettuce and carrots while a rabbit ""narrator"" reveals the secret of their big families — exercise, a healthy diet and little stress. The brief appearance of a human couple enjoying a romantic picnic hints that a little romance might help, and a wine glass turned upside down suggested an anti-alcohol message.

Viewers are told: ""If you ever want to be a parent, follow the example of rabbits.""

It is the latest step by the conservative government in this mostly Catholic country of 38 million to reverse a shrinking population. European Union figures show that Poland's birth rate was 1.32 children per woman in 2015. Only Portugal had a lower fertility rate, though the figures in Spain and Greece were almost as low as Poland.

The Health Ministry said in a statement to The Associated Press that it was trying to encourage Poles in their reproductive years — between the ages of 18 and 45 — to adopt a healthy lifestyle that would improve their reproductive health.

It also said it was seeking to raise public awareness of the issue in a way that ""did not offend anyone and was not vulgar.""","Amid low birth rates, Polish government asks citizens to multiply like rabbits",https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/08/amid-low-birth-rates-polish-government-asks-citizens-to-multiply-like-rabbits.html
