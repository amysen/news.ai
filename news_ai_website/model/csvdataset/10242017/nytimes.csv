But selling off landmarks also comes with risks. Many old-line retailers have struggled to strike a balance between cashing out their valuable real estate and holding on to historic buildings that have come to define their brands.

It is a difficult task that Lord & Taylor is now undertaking.

Founded by the English merchant Samuel Lord in 1826, the department store was once a favored retailer of high society. When its Fifth Avenue flagship opened in February 1914, it drew 75,000 visitors, who were treated to music from a pipe organ on the seventh floor and could choose to dine in one of three restaurants on the top floor.

But as the company moved into the mass market in subsequent decades, it lost much of its luster.

It was under Richard Baker, a veteran real estate investor, that Lord & Taylor recovered. Mr. Baker led a 2006 takeover of the department store company, and used that as a springboard for further acquisitions, from the Canadian chain Hudson’s Bay to Saks to the e-commerce outlet Gilt Groupe. He is now chairman and interim chief executive of Hudson’s Bay.

But as the retail industry has been battered by the tidal waves of e-commerce, Hudson’s Bay has seen its stock price fall by nearly a third over the past year. Retail sales at Hudson’s Bay were down about 1 percent in the first half of the year. As of Monday’s close, the retailer had a market capitalization of roughly $1.7 billion, or a tenth of WeWork’s private market valuation.

Hudson’s Bay has faced enormous pressure to sell its trove of real estate holdings — including its crown jewel, the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store farther up Fifth Avenue. That property was appraised recently at about $3.7 billion.

One of Hudson’s Bay’s shareholders, the real estate investment firm Land and Buildings Investment Management, has pushed for the company to sell the Saks store, suggesting it might be desirable to a hotel developer or as bricks and mortar space for Amazon.

“The path to maximizing the value of Hudson’s Bay lies in its real estate, not its retail brands,” Jonathan Litt, the founder of Land and Buildings Investment Management, wrote in a letter to the board of Hudson’s Bay in June.

That pressure apparently has had an impact. Last week, the department store operator said that its chief executive, Gerald Storch, had stepped down and that he would be replaced on an interim basis by Mr. Baker.

And Tuesday’s announcement acknowledges Mr. Litt’s criticism to some extent. Beyond the Lord & Taylor building sale, Hudson’s Bay struck agreements to lease some of its other retail space to WeWork, including in Hudson’s Bay stores in Canada.

WeWork’s partner in its real estate joint venture, Rhône Capital, will also invest $500 million in Hudson’s Bay. (The joint venture, WeWork Property Advisors, will eventually take over some of that holding.)

All told, that will give Hudson’s Bay more than $1 billion in fresh capital to pay down debt and bolster its cash holdings. The $850 million purchase price for the building is about 30 percent higher than an appraisal made in July 2016.

“This partnership places H.B.C. at the forefront of dynamic trends reshaping the way current and future generations live, work and shop: the sharing economy and urban and suburban mixed-use real estate planning,” Mr. Baker said in a statement.

For WeWork, the deal is a sign of the fast-growing start-up’s ambitions.

Originally created as a provider of shared working spaces, the company has increasingly pitched itself as reinventing how work is done. That vision has drawn backers like SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate, which invested $4.4 billion in WeWork this year.

The Hudson’s Bay deals are meant to give WeWork prime real estate, particularly in Midtown Manhattan, with a way to blend street-level retail space alongside upper-floor real estate more useful for shared office space.

“Retail is changing, and the role that real estate has to play in the way that we shop today must change with it,” Adam Neumann, WeWork’s co-founder and chief executive, said in a statement. “The opportunity to develop this partnership with H.B.C. to explore this trend was too good to pass up.”

While WeWork normally leases space in commercial buildings, it set up WeWork Property Advisors to buy some property outright. Among the advantages of such arrangements is that the start-up would be able to enjoy any rise in the value of the real estate where it sets up its co-working spaces.

‘No One Knows What That Means’

Trevor Noah on Monday took up the cause of Representative Frederica Wilson, the Florida congresswoman who’s become embroiled in a war of words with the White House over President Trump’s call to a military widow. When the chief of staff, John Kelly, called Ms. Wilson “an empty barrel,” Mr. Noah had a sharp comeback at the ready.

“Wow. Where I come from you don’t call someone an empty barrel. Because no one knows what that means.” — TREVOR NOAH

In an address to reporters, Mr. Kelly went on to accuse Ms. Wilson of grandstanding at an event two years earlier, but a tape of the event seemed to disprove his account. Mr. Noah said he owed her an apology.

“People don’t realize, but she’s not only a four-term congresswoman. She’s a former educator with a master’s degree. She was a member of the Florida State Legislature. And she also founded the 5,000-people Role Models program. The same program that helped a young man named La David Johnson graduate from Miami public schools to become a celebrated Green Beret. So, she’s not an empty barrel; she’s someone who deserves an apology.” — TREVOR NOAH

What Did Bush Say to Obama?

At a benefit for victims of recent hurricanes, President George W. Bush leaned over at one point and muttered something to President Barack Obama that made him crack up. We may never know what it was — but Stephen Colbert has a few guesses.

“Hey, were you born in Kenya?” “Twenty bucks if you pants Clinton right now.” “Yo, real quick — where’s Puerto Rico?” “This morning, I painted a Shih Tzu.”

The Punchiest Punchlines (J.F.K. Files Edition)

“President Trump announced that he’s releasing thousands of files on J.F.K., even though they were already set to be released. And he said, ‘Not only that, I’m declaring Oct. 31 Halloween.’” — JIMMY FALLON “Because Lee Harvey Oswald took a mysterious trip to Mexico weeks before the assassination, some historians are concerned that the documents could be damaging to U.S.-Mexico relations. Oh, I think that ship has sailed.” — STEPHEN COLBERT

“There is chaos in the crosswalks,” said Mr. Canepa, who admits to a few close calls with distracted driving and walking himself.

They convince themselves that ‘this text is important,’” he said. “It’s something we need to be aware of.”

There is a dearth of data directly linking distracted walking to pedestrian injuries and deaths, but it seems to be a global problem, too. Preliminary studies “give a hint to unsafe behavior,” said Dr. Etienne Krug, director of the Department for Management of Noncommunicable Diseases, Disability, Violence and Injury Prevention at the World Health Organization.

People who text and walk, for example, are nearly four times as likely to engage in at least one dangerous action, like jaywalking or not looking both ways, and take 18 percent more time to cross a street than undistracted pedestrians. Solutions, Dr. Krug said, are “hard to legislate and even harder to enforce.”

A number of other cities have come up with creative ways to help protect so-called cellphone zombies, who talk, text, listen to music, check their email and even snap selfies. Initiatives include low-tech efforts, like edgy signs in Hayward, Calif. (“Heads Up! Cross the Street. Then Update Facebook.”) and no-selfie zones in Mumbai, and specially designed traffic lights in Europe and several pieces of legislation in reaction to Honolulu’s new law.

Last month, the Board of Supervisors in San Mateo County, Calif., unanimously passed a resolution prohibiting pedestrians’ use of cellphones while crossing streets. It’s not enforceable, as state law governs such issues, but David Canepa, who introduced the measure, said it was an important springboard; the resolution is expected to go to the California Legislature for statewide consideration in January.

“There is chaos in the crosswalks,” said Mr. Canepa, who admits to a few close calls with distracted driving and walking himself. “I know it’s an issue. I’ve lived it. My cellphone is my life.”

As children, he said, we are taught to look both ways when crossing a street, but “you can’t look both ways when you’re looking down and texting.”

Critics are concerned about personal freedom and slow to adjust to new ideas, Mr. Canepa said. “But at the end of the day, people understand the value of public safety,” he added. “This legislation is practical and is common sense. It will save lives.”

At least 10 states have debated similar legislation dealing with distracted pedestrians or bicyclists; none of it has passed, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Legislation is pending in two states, the group said, and in September, New York passed a law that directs New York City to study its efforts to educate the public on the dangers of distracted walking.

Municipal laws are not tracked, but Rexburg, Idaho, may have been among the first to adopt a citywide ban, in 2011. The city recorded five pedestrian deaths in a short period in a concentrated area. It was a high toll, given the city’s size: about 35,000 residents.

“It was a shock to our system,” said Stephen Zollinger, Rexburg’s city attorney.

Distracted walking was suspected. Along with other safety measures, Rexburg barred pedestrians from using hand-held devices — except while talking — while crossing public streets, he said, and “we’ve not had a pedestrian fatality since.”

Bodegraven, a small town near Amsterdam, tried a different approach. This year, it embedded LED-illuminated strips in the crosswalk at a busy intersection — right in the line of sight of people staring at their phones. When the traffic lights turn red or green, so do the lights at ground level, alerting pedestrians when it’s safe to cross.

The pilot program aims to anticipate trends, not reverse them, said Dolf Roodenburg, the project leader and a traffic engineer in the Netherlands. If it’s successful, the town hopes to install the lights at more intersections and on bike paths, and offer them to other cities.

In Augsburg, Germany, similar lights were installed last year after a teenager using her smartphone was struck and seriously injured by a tram when she walked onto the tracks.

There are, of course, contrary points of view on the effectiveness of legislating pedestrian behavior.

Janette Sadik-Khan, a former commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation and now transportation principal at Bloomberg Associates, which advises mayors around the world, said laws against texting and walking were not the answer. They have no basis in any research, are poorly conceived and distract from the road design and driver behavior issues that are responsible for most crashes, she said.

“It’s an easy way out. Engineering is a lot more difficult, but a lot more efficient,” Ms. Sadik-Khan said. “Traffic safety is very serious business in government, based in sound analysis.”

She and others recommended focusing on proven strategies like vehicle speed reduction, which is one of the most effective ways to reduce deaths, as survival rates are higher in low-speed collisions.

Vehicle design can also help. “In some countries, cars are designed to be more forgiving to pedestrians,” said Deborah A. P. Hersman, president and chief executive of the National Safety Council. Making bumpers softer and modifying the front ends of vehicles can reduce the severity of a pedestrian impact, but only 44 countries, mostly in Europe, require manufacturers to apply these protections, according to the W.H.O. The United States is not among them.

Rochelle Sobel, founder of the Association for Safe International Road Travel, a nonprofit group, said it was important for Americans traveling abroad to learn the local road culture. In the Dominican Republic, pedestrians do not have the right of way, and in some countries, drivers routinely ignore traffic regulations.

For example, they may fail to stop at intersections or red lights, Ms. Sobel said. In many low- and middle-income countries, where about 90 percent of the world’s road-traffic deaths occur, according to the W.H.O., pedestrians often share poorly maintained roads with animals, carts, cars, buses and trucks. Those roads are already high-risk environments not designed for walking, Ms. Sobel said.

Ms. Hersman, who previously served as chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said concerns about government overreach often lessened with time. Laws requiring seatbelt use or restricting smoking initially met resistance but now are widely accepted.

“It’s important to have an open mind,” she said. “Society can move forward.”

Mr. Massey of Synaxis said it would take some convincing for people to see value in laws to combat distracted walking.

“I agree in principle — begrudgingly,” he said. “It’s a bit Big Brotherish. We don’t like that in this country.”

European efforts are more realistic, Mr. Massey added. “I think the lights are brilliant,” he said. “It reflects an understanding of human nature: People are going to do it anyway, so let’s make it safer.”","Reading This While Walking?

The thought experiment’s framing, however, circumvented my usual concerns about unjust sanctions. I know what my rapist did to me, so I know he is guilty. Worries about the inhumanity of capital punishment were also blunted in part because this was purely hypothetical and in part because of the inhumanity he exhibited those long years with his penchant for violence.

Although the death sentence seemed wholly appropriate, I still considered how I would feel if a judge gave my rapist a less severe punishment: a natural life sentence — a life sentence with no chance for parole without a successful appeal.

After reporting back to my therapist, she offered another thought experiment. “What if,” she said, “your rapist had been sentenced to death, but then had been pardoned?” I did not have to mull this question over. I knew I would feel exactly as I do now, exactly as I have felt for the past two decades: that the world is a terribly unjust place. It is a place where my life can be irrevocably transformed because a man could exert control, manipulation and violence over me for years without repercussion. It is a place where my rapist and others like him are enabled at both societal and local levels. His mother, for example, simply told us to quiet down whenever she heard my screams — a response as horrifying as it is understandable given the many ways society tolerates violence against women.

A hypothetical pardon would allow him to escape repercussions just as he has escaped them in reality. Nearly 20 years later as I began trauma therapy again, he has a secure job, an accomplished and beautiful wife, and a healthy daughter. He is living a life many dream of, while my life is disrupted as I continue to heal from the wounds he inflicted when I was a child. E.M.D.R. begins with the choice of reliving either the earliest traumatic memory or the most painful, rendering it as harrowing as it is effective; E.M.D.R. is not for the faint of heart.

IN FEBRUARY 2016 — only weeks after the thought experiments with my therapist — the philosopher Jennifer Lackey published an opinion piece in The Stone. In the article, she uses her experience teaching philosophy to inmates to argue for the irrationality of natural life sentences. Lackey bases her argument against natural life sentences on two reasonable claims: (1) people (criminals, specifically) can and do change in profoundly transformative ways, and (2) we cannot know the future.

For Lackey, the fact that we have good statistical evidence that criminals can and do change is especially problematic given our vast epistemic limitations regarding the future. “Natural life sentences,” she wrote, “say to all involved that there is no possible piece of information that could be learned between sentencing and death that could bear in any way on the punishment the convicted is said to deserve, short of what might ground an appeal.”Citing the possibility of prisoner transformation, Lackey then puts her question about rationality directly: “How is it rational,” she asks, “to screen off the relevance of this information? How, that is, is it rational to say today that there can be no possible evidence in the future that could bear on the punishment that a decades-from-now prisoner deserves?”

Natural life sentences, Lackey notices, are a “glaring exception” to the way we think about rational decision making in other contexts. Natural life sentences “permit binding, life-altering decisions to be made in a state of radical epistemic impoverishment.”

Lackey’s argument strongly suggests that transformation is an exceedingly important consideration for sentencing. This is not an alien notion; the criminal justice system often takes good behavior and contrition as evidence of transformation that is relevant to one’s sentence. This occurs not just under the direction of theories that value rehabilitation, but in all but the “crudest forms of retributive justice.” Rehabilitation, then, is one aspect that many believe separates crude justice theories from other, presumably better, justice theories.

I read Lackey’s article very soon after the thought experiments with my therapist. I noticed that Lackey’s argument easily applied to the death penalty, and I realized that the sentences I desired for my rapist were precisely the ones Lackey condemns as irrational. Since nothing in her argument prevented me from applying her logic to my own desires, I had to wonder if her argument also concluded that I was irrational for desiring permanent punishments. If it is irrational for the state to prescribe a permanent punishment given our epistemic limitations and prisoners’ likelihood for change, wouldn’t it be similarly irrational for victims to ignore these considerations?

There are, of course, crucial differences between victim’s desires and punishments carried out by the state. While sometimes the criminal justice system considers the wishes of victims and their families, the criminal justice system’s central aim is to protect the interests of the state and the community. This aim does not always coincide with the interests or wishes of the victim. Admittedly, there are often very good reasons for the state to ignore the wishes of victims. But my concern is less about what the state should do in practice and more about what arguments that prioritize transformation say about victims who desire permanent punishments.

Here I will be blunt: it matters very little to me whether my rapist is transformed at some point in his life. It matters to me only to the extent that I will readily agree that it would be better if he became the sort of person who did not inflict violence upon others. I would be very happy hearing that no other women would be harmed by him. But in terms of the punishment that he deserves? Transformation does not matter to me. And this is not irrational: There are many carefully considered reasons one might want a natural life sentence for perpetrators of egregious and irrevocable harm.

Desiring death or a natural life sentence for those who inflict traumatic violence is a rational response because whether or not my particular rapist transforms is irrelevant to whether or not I will ever have the chance to be the sort of person I might have been. His transformation is irrelevant to whether or not I will be able to live the sort of life I could have were it not for the injustice done to me. I desire a death or natural life sentence for my rapist because that is what seems appropriate given the amount of damage he wrought in my life.

Rape is itself a transformative experience. I will never be the same, and I have no idea how my life might have been different without the experience. My rapist expertly dismantled my sense of self as he isolated me from friends and family. He manipulated me so that he could more effectively inflict violence and exert power and control over me. I know that I have suffered, that I have struggled, and that I might not have survived. I’ve read about the neurological effects of prolonged trauma, and I know that I am now — and perhaps always will be — affected in some capacity by the things he did to me. After plenty of rational consideration, I cannot imagine any personal transformation that would make me think he deserves anything less than a permanent punishment.

In response, one might call my stance a crude form of retributive justice. Perhaps it is. I know that expressing desire for retribution is a risky move in its unpopularity. Social narratives have long praised forgiveness and love especially for those who have wronged us. Theories of justice have also moved beyond ones that emphasize retribution — and for good reason in many cases. I understand this perspective: For many years it was abhorrent for me to think of responding to the violence I suffered with more violence. But calling the desire for permanent punishment crude does not render it irrational however unpopular it might be.

One might, in the end, respond by saying that arguments like Lackey’s are proposing only policy change. These arguments, we might say, are not meant to prescribe the appropriate feelings for victims. If so, we might think that my worries about what arguments can say to individual victims is off the mark. While it’s clear that policy change can be a central aim, audiences of such arguments include victims of traumatic crimes. Yet it is not clear that such arguments always take victims into account.

Although my attitude is in no way representative of all victims, epistemic arguments that prioritize criminal transformation must contend with the implication that they can be used to paint trauma victims irrational when they desire retribution.

It’s certainly important to advocate for prisoners who are wrongly incarcerated and for those who were victims of the overzealous war on crime era. The injustices in our criminal justice system are too numerous and too serious to ignore. But criminal justice reform should not be so myopic that it compounds trauma survivors’ victimization. Those who manage to survive traumatic crimes have enough to battle without arguments that undermine their rational considerations. Advocates for criminal justice reform can, and should, do better.",Is There a ‘Rational’ Punishment for My Rapist?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/opinion/rape-punishment-rational.html

START SMALL If you’re nervous about playing with a deep, dark hue, “limit the color to the inside of cabinets, backs of bookshelves or a painted floor,” said Donald Kaufman, who owns the paint company Donald Kaufman Color with his wife, Taffy Dahl. “Dark, bold windows often bring the outside in.”

Ms. Studholme, of Farrow & Ball, suggested starting with a contained space like a powder room, the underside of a claw-foot tub or a hallway. “When you arrive, it creates a sense of drama,” she said. “You come through and go, ‘Wow.’” An added bonus, she noted: “A dark color in the hall makes the rooms off the hall feel really big and light.”

Ellen O’Neill, director of strategic design intelligence for Benjamin Moore, recommends starting with a focal point, like a fireplace mantel or the inside of shelves or drawers. “I recently photographed a home where the owner painted the inside of the drawers of an antique Chippendale chest a rich aubergine,” she said. “What a color surprise every time you open a drawer.” And as you become more confident, she said, “you can graduate to painting doors to a room or hallway, window trim or wainscoting.”

TEST IT OUT When you’re ready to tackle a whole room, “start with a color family that is already dominant in the home and select two to three shades that you feel makes a statement,” Ms. O’Neill said. “I’d get quarts of each color and paint large swatches of each, one set next to a window and one set in a corner. Observe how the room’s lighting affects the colors three times a day.”

EMBRACE THE DARKNESS “A deep, rich color goes an especially long way in a room without a lot of natural light, as dim rooms look particularly dull in lighter colors,” said Frances Merrill, the founder of Reath Design in Los Angeles, who painted her children’s room Farrow & Ball’s Pigeon gray. “It makes the small space feel finished and gives definition to the ever-rotating collection of artwork.”

In the playroom, she used Templeton Gray from Benjamin Moore. “Every surface in this room is usually covered in a layer of Legos and half-finished science experiments,” she said. “I find that the deeper colors mask the chaos.”

“Conventional wisdom states that small spaces — especially those facing north — should be lightened to increase the sense of space,” said Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute consultancy. “However, painting trim a lighter color in an area painted with darker hues can actually increase the illusion of space,” she said, because it creates a “greater impression of height or width in the space.”

Whatever your situation, “it’s best to work with what you’ve got, rather than try to fight the light,” said Ms. Studholme of Farrow & Ball, which offers a guide to how light affects color on its website.

PREPARATION IS KEY “Before painting, ensure surfaces are sound, clean, dry and free from dirt, grease and any other contamination,” said Ms. Cosby of Farrow & Ball. “Always sand down surfaces to achieve a smooth base.”

And if you change your mind later, dark colors are just as easy to paint over as light ones, assuming you prep properly. “Start by priming over the bold hue, then apply two coats of the desired color,” said Ms. O’Neill of Benjamin Moore. But “be sure to allow the primer coat to dry completely before applying the first coat of color.”

GO HALFSIES To add “sophistication and spirit” to a client’s “stark, boxy, white rental,” Alex Kalita, a founder of Common Bond Design in Manhattan, painted the bottom half of the bedroom wall in Hague Blue from Farrow & Ball. She calls it “the chair-rail effect” and notes that it serves a few purposes: “It simulates architectural variation in otherwise uniform space; it ties in the building’s teal window frames; and it leverages the cozy, rich, complex and grown-up quality of Hague Blue, while maintaining the practical qualities of white paint, like the illusion of ceiling height.”

Another tip: “If you’re tempted to go dark and bold on the walls, but you prefer a restrained aesthetic, try keeping the furniture neutral,” Ms. Kalita said. “You can even make bulkier pieces recede by camouflaging them in the wall color. We had our client’s Wonk NYC dresser color-matched to Hague Blue, so that the piece could augment the client’s storage without competing for attention with the room’s more deliberate and sculptural design elements. Dark walls do a good job of visually absorbing things.”

FINALLY, BE BRAVE “I encourage people to be brave with color and unleash their inner artist,” said Ms. Eiseman of the Pantone Color Institute. “Experiment with color, have fun with it, allow yourself to live with it for a while. It is, after all, just one or two cans of paint. And when, and if, you tire of it, move on to another color and treat yourself to another creative exercise.”",Scared of Dark Paint?

He was silenced more than 81 years ago at 38 — murdered in the summer of 1936 by a paramilitary death squad at the outset of the Spanish Civil War for his anti-fascist sentiments and homosexuality. His burial site in an anonymous mass grave somewhere in fields outside Granada remains a mystery.

But his powerful voice is still one that binds this nation as it struggles with tensions between the Catalan independence movement and the Spanish state, which threatened to remove the region’s separatist government and initiate a process of direct rule by the central government in Madrid.

In August, the poet’s verses offered a measure of comfort after the deadly van attack along the Ramblas, the heart of Barcelona. Over booming loudspeakers, thousands of antiterrorism protesters listened to a recital of García Lorca’s tribute to his favorite thoroughfare: “The street where all four seasons live together. The only street I wish would never end.”

When he was 18, he set off from Granada in 1917 on the first of four expeditions by steam train with his art history professor and other students to tour Andalusia. It was then, he said, that “I became fully aware of myself as a Spaniard.” He was seeking memories of “the ancient souls who once walked the solitary squares we now tread.”

My love of García Lorca extends to all his writing that explores the rural tragedies of women in Andalusia and an earthy culture where death and love are deeply intertwined. I had never expected to visit his house in Granada, where the poet wrote his trilogy of greatest plays — “Blood Wedding,” “Yerma,” and “The House of Bernarda Alba.”

But a reporting assignment took me to the city one day, and I met his niece, Laura García Lorca, in his family home, Huerta de San Vicente, now a museum and whitewashed sanctuary, which is surrounded by linden trees and roses.

The downstairs living room was dark and smelled faintly of jasmine. It was furnished with black and white photos from many decades ago, along with García Lorca’s baby grand piano and a pensive portrait of the writer, with dark wavy hair and sharp eyes, wearing a mustard robe.

His niece led me upstairs to his bedroom and study, furnished with a single bed and an oak desk stained with ink. And there we paused, the memories in this silent house so profound that her tears still flow. “The story is very present,” she said. “We share this as our loss.”

It was soon after that I decided to chase the spirit of this fractured nation through García Lorca’s literary inspirations in southern Spain. I began my first journey with a 10-day road trip with my husband, Omer, through Andalusia in a rented Fiat, hurtling on a smooth stretch of highway through golden hills and olive groves and white villages and ancient Arab fortresses.

We toured Granada, the poet’s hometown, where liberal and conservative political divisions still simmer in a lingering fight over control of García Lorca’s vast archives. In the meantime, the literary treasure has not yet moved from Madrid to a soaring new cultural center built to house it. But public authorities and the writer’s family are close to settling their differences and the archives are expected to arrive within months at the center by the tranquil Plaza de Romanillo.

Before his death, García Lorca alienated the local society by complaining that Granada was inhabited by a cold, introverted ruling class. Yet, despite the mutual loathing, he held court here in the 1920s with his young literary circle of intellectuals, “El Rinconcillo.” At a restaurant known then as Cafe Alameda, he would read his works aloud from the same corner table.

Photo

Today his refuge is named Chikito, and the restaurant’s cuisine is typically Andalusian with a popular tapa of tiny snails with ham and almond sauce and its specialty, an oxtail stew. In 2015, the writer’s favorite corner was transformed into a shrine with a life-size bronze statue of García Lorca seated at a vintage marble table in a dapper bow tie.

The most touching tribute, though, is spontaneous — an annual midnight-to-dawn flamenco tribute every Aug. 19 on the anniversary of García Lorca’s death that is an open secret among performers and locals.

It takes place in the hills northeast of Granada in El Barranco de Viznar but it received little public attention on the 80th anniversary of his death a year ago near the likely mass graves.

In the balmy darkness, trembling voices rose from the forest to the sound of cante jondo or deep song — music that inspired the poetry of García Lorca, who was a musician himself. He likened its rhythms and wavering stammers to the trilling of birds and the music of forest and fountain. And he believed it had to be preserved because it represented the ancient music of the persecuted and oppressed of Andalusia — Arabs, Jews and Gypsies — who fled into the mountains in the 15th century to escape the Spanish Inquisition.

For the writer, other cities like Seville offered more openness and tolerance — something he considered a reflection of physical geography and the Guadalquivir River that flows within the city and outward to the Atlantic Ocean, shooting through, he wrote in a poem, like “a constant arrow.”

We traveled to Seville, where we sampled a boat trip along the olive-colored Guadalquivir for about a $20 ticket. But the hourlong ride seemed more languid than García Lorca’s dynamic description and the riverside more neglected. The highlights on the trip centered on passing under bridges, the oldest Triana or Isabel II rebuilt by engineers for Gustave Eiffel.

Instead we found more of the city’s essential soul or spirit of “duende” in the sprawling San Fernando municipal cemetery. At its entrance is an exotic neighborhood of tombs and shrines devoted to the city’s Andalusian aristocracy — flamenco stars and fallen bullfighters such as Francisco Rivera Pérez “Paquirri,” who is sculpted in a matador’s suit and poised to guide a bull’s final attack.

It was in Seville that García Lorca befriended Ignacio Sánchez Mejías, a bullfighter who was also a poet and a playwright. After Ignacio was gored in a post-retirement bullfight in 1934, García Lorca wrote his classic elegy in tribute to him, a 1935 poem of disbelief and grief about his death at 43.

Photo

There is no more affecting place to read aloud his lament — “Oh white wall of Spain! Oh black bull of sorrow! Oh hard blood of Ignacio!” — than beside the matador’s simple grave. It lies in the shadow of an enormous tomb for his fellow bullfighter and brother-in-law, Joselito, who was killed in 1920 by a bull named Bailaor. That marble and bronze sculpture depicts Joselito in his draped coffin, shouldered by 18 distraught men and women. One of the figures is Ignacio, head cast to beseech the cloudless skies.

Death, honor and frustration are themes that endlessly fascinated García Lorca. In 1933, he staged the premier of “Blood Wedding” in Madrid, drawing on 1928 newspaper accounts of a defiant bride, Francisca Cañadas, who abandoned her fiancé — her sister’s brother-in-law — to flee hours before a pending marriage deep into the countryside with her beloved first cousin.

Her sister and her husband tracked them down, fatally shooting the cousin and strangling Francisca, leaving her for dead on the road to Nijar. The bride survived, living for decades with the enmity of her village who blamed her for provoking the tragedy.

In his drama, García Lorca transformed the key characters and heightened the bloodshed. He conceived of the set inside a spacious cave like the ancient enclaves in Purullena and Guadix, southern towns in the province of Granada known for mazes of whitewashed caves fashioned into homes and with inhabitants called trogloditas. He was struck by the rare accommodation of life and earth in the labyrinth of cave dwellings — some that date back to the 16th century.

We had stayed a few years earlier in a rented cave in Purullena, which is also known for its cobalt blue ceramics made with a special polychrome technique that dates to the 16th century. The cave was a cool refuge on hot August nights and so profoundly silent that sleep transformed to nights of intensely vivid dreams. On this trip, we returned again to explore the caves in Guadix and Purullena, some thoroughly modern with wrought iron guard gates, chimneys, marble floors, Wi-Fi access and television antennas poking out of the oatmeal colored hills. Others were gothic ruins from past centuries, poetry in white against the blue splendor of skies.

On a back road in a cave neighborhood in Purullena, a silver haired woman in a black coat and cane noticed us photographing the homes. She beckoned us inside her cave with a red tiled awning and arched door.

Her kindness reminded me of another basic element of Andalusia that García Lorca cherished — its people. On the same day that she spoke to us, we stopped nearby in Graena, a small town that is home to spring-fed thermal baths and an outdoor barbecue restaurant, Bar La Pradera, which specializes in lamb chops and steak grilled on hot coals. We had not dined there in five years, and tourists rarely stop there, at the terrace across from an open-air municipal pool and garden. But the owners welcomed us back with kisses and then they invited us to their home.

No journey like this could be complete without witnessing the last act of “Blood Wedding.” We rumbled along a dirt road to reach the Cortijo del Fraile, the crumbling farmhouse where Francisca Cañadas lived with her father who owned the property then. Today, it is a surreal landmark of ruin and romance in Europe’s only semidesert, the Cabo de Gata Nature Preserve in Almería, Spain’s southeastern corner.

The fragile farmhouse is surrounded by a wire fence to prevent entry of tourists. Its facade has been minimally restored but there is much more work to be done. A plain marker took note of its literary pedigree — and also its star turn as a backdrop in various movies, among them, Sergio Leone’s spaghetti western “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.”

From the ruins, we headed toward the town of Nijar and stopped at one of its oldest municipal cemeteries. Its white walls were full with rose and blue silk flowers and tribute plaques to the village’s dead, including members of the star-crossed Cañadas family.

Every time I visit Andalusia, I try to find some trace of the grave of the runaway bride. She never married and was essentially buried in life by the scorn of her village. And every year nothing changes in the essential rural tragedy imagined by García Lorca.

A lone cemetery worker offered me a vague hint that Francisca Cañadas’s tomb is placed near a soaring cypress tree, a symbol of mourning and hope. But a stone plaque was nowhere to be found. According to the family’s wishes, the worker said, it is marked with a false name.",Chasing the Spirit of a Fractured Spain Through García Lorca,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/travel/andalusia-federico-garcia-lorca-spain.html

A mutual friend of Cuddy and Simmons’s from graduate school, Kenworthey Bilz, a professor of law at the University of Illinois, tried to reassure Cuddy.
On Sept. 26, 2016, Amy Cuddy woke up and checked her phone to find a chilling text from a friend.
It’s not good.”If Amy Cuddy is a victim, she may not seem an obvious one: She has real power, a best-selling book, a thriving speaking career.
“Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself.","The video is now TED’s second-most popular, having been seen, to date, by some 43 million viewers. In the years after the talk, Cuddy became a sought-after speaker, a quasi celebrity and, eventually, the author of a best-selling book, “Presence,” in 2015. The power pose became the sun salutation for the professional woman on the cusp of leaning in. Countless hopefuls, male and female, locked themselves in bathroom stalls before job interviews to make victory V’s with their arms; media trainers had their speakers dutifully practice the pose before approaching the stage. Cuddy has gone on to give talks on power and the body (including power posing) and stereotyping to women’s groups in Australia, at youth homeless shelters, to skin-care workers by the thousands, to employees at Target and agents at State Farm Insurance. Cuddy’s fans approach her in airports, on ski slopes in Telluride, in long lines after her talks, to hug or to thank her, filled with their own power-posing stories — sharing how bold body language helped them get their jobs or win some match or confront a bully at work.

But since 2015, even as she continued to stride onstage and tell the audiences to face down their fears, Cuddy has been fighting her own anxieties, as fellow academics have subjected her research to exceptionally high levels of public scrutiny. She is far from alone in facing challenges to her work: Since 2011, a methodological reform movement has been rattling the field, raising the possibility that vast amounts of research, even entire subfields, might be unreliable. Up-and-coming social psychologists, armed with new statistical sophistication, picked up the cause of replications, openly questioning the work their colleagues conducted under a now-outdated set of assumptions. The culture in the field, once cordial and collaborative, became openly combative, as scientists adjusted to new norms of public critique while still struggling to adjust to new standards of evidence.

Cuddy, in particular, has emerged from this upheaval as a unique object of social psychology’s new, enthusiastic spirit of self-flagellation — as if only in punishing one of its most public stars could it fully break from its past. At conferences, in classrooms and on social media, fellow academics (or commenters on their sites) have savaged not just Cuddy’s work but also her career, her income, her ambition, even her intelligence, sometimes with evident malice. Last spring, she quietly left her tenure-track job at Harvard.

Some say that she has gained fame with an excess of confidence in fragile results, that she prized her platform over scientific certainty. But many of her colleagues, and even some who are critical of her choices, believe that the attacks on her have been excessive and overly personal. What seems undeniable is that the rancor of the critiques reflects the emotional toll among scientists forced to confront the fear that what they were doing all those years may not have been entirely scientific.

One of the seminal social-psychology studies, at the turn of the 20th century, asked a question that at the time was a novel one: How does the presence of other people change an individual’s behavior? Norman Triplett, a psychologist at Indiana University, found that when he asked children to execute a simple task (winding line on a fishing rod), they performed better in the company of other children than they did when alone in a room. Over the following decades, a new discipline grew up within psychology to further interrogate group dynamics: how social groups react in certain circumstances, how the many can affect the one.

The questions grew even more profound, using experiments to tease out universal susceptibilities, raising the possibility that behavior was more easily swayed by outside forces than personality researchers previously believed. The field reached a moment of unusual visibility in the mid-20th century, as practitioners, many of them Jewish refugees or first-generation immigrants from Europe, explored, post-World War II, the way group pressures or authority figures could influence human behavior. In one simple study on conformity in 1951, the social psychologist Solomon Asch found that people would agree that one drawn line matched the length of another — even if it clearly did not — if others around them all agreed that it did. In subsequent years, researchers like Stanley Milgram (who tested how people weighed their consciences against the demands of authority) and Philip Zimbardo (who observed the effect of power on students assigned as either prison guards or prisoners) rejected the traditional confines of the lab for more theatrical displays of human nature. “They felt the urgency of history,” says Rebecca Lemov, a professor of the history of science at Harvard. “They really wanted to make people look.”

Since the late 1960s, the field’s psychologists have tried to elevate the scientific rigor of their work, introducing controls and carefully designed experiments like the ones found in medicine. Increasingly complex ideas about the workings of the unconscious yielded research with the charm of mesmerists’ shows, revealing unlikely forces that seem to guide our behavior: that simply having people wash their hands could change their sense of culpability; that people’s evaluations of risk could easily be rendered irrational; that once people have made a decision, they curiously give more weight to information in its favor. Humans, the research often suggested, were reliably mercurial, highly suggestible, profoundly irrational, tricksters better at fooling ourselves than anyone else.

Already relatively accessible to the public, the field became even more influential with the rise of behavioral economics in the 1980s and 1990s, as visionaries like Richard Thaler, (who won the Nobel Prize in economics this month) found applications for counterintuitive social-psychology insights that could be used to guide policy. In 2000, Malcolm Gladwell, the author of the best-selling “Tipping Point,” applied irresistible storytelling to the science, sending countless journalists to investigate similar terrain and inspiring social psychologists to write books of their own. In 2006, Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard, published the best seller “Stumbling on Happiness” — a book that tried to explain why we plan so poorly for our own future. That same year, TED started airing its first videos, offering a new stage for social psychologists with compelling findings, ideally surprising ones. The field was experiencing a visibility unknown since the midcentury; business schools, eager for social psychologists’ insights into leadership and decision-making, started pursuing social psychologists, with better pay and more funding than psychology graduate schools could offer.

This moment of fizziness for the discipline was already underway when Cuddy arrived at Princeton’s graduate program in 2000, transferring there to follow her adviser, Susan Fiske, with whom she first worked at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She moved to Princeton with her husband at the time — they later divorced — and in her second year there, she had a child. Her academic work continued to thrive as she collaborated with Fiske on research on stereotyping, which found that groups of people (for example of a particular ethnicity) who were judged as nice were assumed to be less competent and vice versa. (“Just Because I’m Nice Don’t Assume I’m Dumb,” was the headline of a Harvard Business Review article by Cuddy.) Fiske and Cuddy’s resulting papers are still heavily cited, formulating a framework for stereotyping that proved hugely influential on the field.

And yet, especially early on at Princeton, Cuddy felt uncertain of her place there. She feared that her brain simply could not function at a high-enough level to power her through the program. Cuddy suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident the summer after her sophomore year in college, when a friend of hers fell asleep at the wheel while Cuddy was asleep in the back seat. In the months after the accident, Cuddy was told she should not expect to finish college; her fog was so deep that she remembers being retaught how to shop for groceries. Even after Cuddy recovered, her friends told her that she had changed, that she was not the same person — but she could not remember who she had been before. It took her four years and multiple false starts before she could return to college. Even after she was accepted to graduate school at University of Massachusetts, she confessed to Fiske that she feared she would not be able to keep up with the work.

Cuddy was trained as a ballet dancer — in between her stints at college, she danced as an apprentice with the Colorado Ballet — but her interest in studying the body and its relationship to power did not begin until 2009, her first year as a teacher at Harvard Business School. At the invitation of her department chair, she joined a small circle of academics meeting with Joe Navarro, a former F.B.I. agent who had written a book about body language. The invited parties, which included Dana Carney, a professor at Columbia University who studied body language and power, all spoke briefly about their work. In the conversation that followed, Navarro pointed out that Cuddy’s own body language, during her presentation, signaled insecurity: She was fiddling with her necklace, wrapping her arms around her torso.

Carney and Cuddy had been noticing the same kinds of body language in their female students, who performed well on written materials but lost points, compared with their male counterparts, on class participation. Their body language was constricted; they raised their hands with their elbows cradled in their other hands; they made themselves physically small; they spoke less often.

The two researchers wondered whether people whose physical cues looked like their female students’ — self-protective, insecure — would feel more powerful or even change their behavior if they simply adopted more expansive body positions.

Carney and Cuddy brainstormed a research project to test this question. At Columbia, Carney recruited students, telling them that they were part of a study intended to measure the effects of placing an electrocardiograph’s electrodes either above or below the heart. In the study of 42 subjects that they eventually published, experimenters arranged half the students into positions associated with high power (leaning back in a chair with feet crossed on a desk, for example) and half the students into positions associated with low power (like crossing arms in front of the body). Before and after the poses, experimenters took saliva swabs from the students to measure how the positions affected cortisol and testosterone levels. They also asked the students to report (before and after the poses) how in charge and powerful they felt on a scale of one to four (a measurement known as “self-reported feelings of power”). And they measured whether that feeling had what researchers call a “downstream effect” — a resulting behavior. People who feel power, the literature suggests, are more likely to engage in a range of certain behaviors, including risk-taking; so the experiment also measured the subjects’ willingness to bet on a roll of the dice.

“I remember how happy we were when Dana called me with the results,” Cuddy says. “Everything went in the direction it was supposed to.” The abstract that they eventually wrote — that their editors approved — reflects the incautious enthusiasm that characterized the era: “That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful, has real-world, actionable implications.”

In 2014, on a podcast called “Story Collider,” Cuddy connects the study that made her so famous with the accident that subtly shifted her identity. After the crash, she recalled, she felt as if she were merely passing for herself, an inauthentic version of who she used to be. It made sense, then, that she ended up “studying how people can become their aspirational selves,” she said. “How can you become a self that you are not now?”

The year that Amy Cuddy published her power-posing paper, Joseph Simmons, who attended graduate school at Princeton with Cuddy, was starting to think about his own seminal paper, one that would, unknown to either of them, have as much influence on her life as it would on his own; it would, in fact, change not just their lives but the field as they knew it, with wildly differing consequences for each of them.

Cuddy and Simmons, each of whom came from working-class backgrounds, had been fond of each other at Princeton, even if they did not socialize often: Cuddy was a new mother, and Simmons was five years younger and heavily committed to his softball team. Simmons considered Cuddy a friend, someone he was always happy to see at a party, despite their obvious differences: Cuddy, who used to follow the Grateful Dead, would have been the one dancing at the party, while Simmons would have been the one laughing with his close friend, a fellow graduate student named Leif Nelson, about the latest buzzy journal article that seemed, to them, ridiculous.

Having arrived at Princeton wide-eyed, straight from Mount St. Mary’s College in Maryland, Simmons, within a few years, appeared to some of his classmates to have lost some of his idealism about academia; maybe he exhibited his idealism about science in a way that could be mistaken for cynicism. Simmons had an unusual interest in statistics, the way its airtight logic could neatly prove, or disprove, the worth of an extravagant idea. He and Nelson were endlessly critical of other studies’ findings, an intellectual exercise they enjoyed and considered essential. The two of them, Nelson says, were “into thinking about subtleties in data collection and analysis.”

After finishing a postdoctoral program at Princeton, Simmons lost touch with Cuddy, who was by then teaching at Northwestern. He remained close to Nelson, who had befriended a behavioral scientist, also a skeptic, Uri Simonsohn. Nelson and Simonsohn kept up an email correspondence for years. They, along with Simmons, took particular umbrage when a prestigious journal accepted a paper from an emeritus professor of psychology at Cornell, Daryl Bem, who claimed that he had strong evidence for the existence of extrasensory perception. The paper struck them as the ultimate in bad-faith science. “How can something not be possible to cause something else?” Nelson says. “Oh, you reverse time, then it can’t.” And yet the methodology was supposedly sound. After years of debating among themselves, the three of them resolved to figure out how so many researchers were coming up with such unlikely results.

Over the course of several months of conference calls and computer simulations, the three researchers eventually determined that the enemy of science — subjectivity — had burrowed its way into the field’s methodology more deeply than had been recognized. Typically, when researchers analyzed data, they were free to make various decisions, based on their judgment, about what data to maintain: whether it was wise, for example, to include experimental subjects whose results were really unusual or whether to exclude them; to add subjects to the sample or exclude additional subjects because of some experimental glitch. More often than not, those decisions — always seemingly justified as a way of eliminating noise — conveniently strengthened the findings’ results. The field (hardly unique in this regard) had approved those kinds of tinkering for years, underappreciating just how powerfully they skewed the results in favor of false positives, particularly if two or three analyses were underway at the same time. The three eventually wrote about this phenomenon in a paper called “False-Positive Psychology,” published in 2011. “Everyone knew it was wrong, but they thought it was wrong the way it’s wrong to jaywalk,” Simmons recently wrote in a paper taking stock of the field. “We decided to write ‘False-Positive Psychology’ when simulations revealed it was wrong the way it’s wrong to rob a bank.”

Simmons called those questionable research practices P-hacking, because researchers used them to lower a crucial measure of statistical significance known as the P-value. The P stands for probable, as in: How probable is it that researchers would happen to get the results they achieved — or even more extreme ones — if there were no phenomena, in truth, to observe? (And no systematic error.) For decades, the standard of so-called statistical significance — also the hurdle to considering a study publishable — has been a P-value of less than 5 percent.

To examine how easily the science could be manipulated, Simmons and Simonsohn ran a study in which they asked 20 participants their ages (and their fathers’ birthdays). Half the group listened to the Beatles song “When I’m Sixty-Four”; the other listened to a control (the instrumental music “Kalimba”). Using totally standard methodology common to the field, they were able to prove that the participants who listened to the Beatles song were magically a year and a half younger than they were before they had heard the music. The subject heading of the explanation: “How Bad Can It Be? A Demonstration of Chronological Rejuvenation.” It was witty, it was relatable — everyone understood that it was a critique of the fundamental soundness of the field.

“We realized entire literatures could be false positives,” Simmons says. They had collaborated with enough other researchers to recognize that the practice was widespread and counted themselves among the guilty. “I P-hacked like crazy all through my time at Princeton, and I still couldn’t get interesting results,” Simmons says.

The paper generated its fair share of attention, but it was not until January 2012, at a tense conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology in San Diego, that social psychologists began to glimpse the iceberg looming ahead — the sliding furniture, the recriminations, the crises of conscience and finger-pointing and side-taking that would follow. At the conference, several hundred academics crowded into the room to hear Simmons and his colleagues challenge the methodology of their field. First, Leslie John, then a graduate student, now an associate professor at the Harvard School of Business, presented a survey of 2,000 social psychologists that suggested that P-hacking, as well as other questionable research practices, was common. In his presentation, Simonsohn introduced a new concept, a graph that could be used to evaluate bodies of research, using the P-values of those studies (the lower the overall P-values, the better). He called it a P-curve and suggested that it could be used, for example, to evaluate the research that a prospective job candidate submitted. To some, the implication of the combined presentations seemed clear: The field was rotten with the practice, and egregious P-hackers should not get away with it.

Journal-paper presentations on statistics are usually unremarkable affairs, but this one precipitated a sequence of exchanges so public that the field had to take notice. The first took place during that event, with Norbert Schwarz, an eminent social psychologist, in the audience. Schwarz, as he listened, grew furious: He believed that the methodology of the survey was flawed, and he indignantly objected to the idea of the P-curve as a kind of litmus test aimed at individuals. He would not let these ideas go uncontested; he interrupted loudly from the front row, violating standard academic etiquette. “The whole room was like, ‘Oh, my God, what just happened?’ ” recalls Brian Nosek, a social psychologist who now runs the Center for Open Science, intended to encourage and normalize replications. Others quietly thanked Schwarz for bravely speaking up.

Not content to stop there, Schwarz followed up four days later with an open letter to 5,000 members of the society’s listserv, explaining in further detail, and with some condescension, his reservations. Although Simonsohn was angry, he still hoped to cool down the conversation. He emailed Schwarz asking if they could talk, so that they could come to a sort of understanding, in the name of science, and release a joint statement. Schwarz agreed but told Simonsohn, over the course of several email exchanges, that he needed more time. Simonsohn lost patience after three weeks: He posted large parts of the email exchange on his personal website, then posted a blistering attack on Schwarz on the society’s listserv, filled with bold caps and underlines, in which he said, among other things, that he knew firsthand that Schwarz had engaged in P-hacking.

“I regret it,” Simonsohn says now about posting the emails. Since then, Simmons, Simonsohn and Nelson say they have given a lot of thought to codes of conduct for communicating responsibly when conveying concerns about a scientist’s work. But the academic blowup between Simonsohn, then a relative unknown in social psychology, and Schwarz, the standard-bearer, signaled from the beginning that leaders on each side would ignore the norms of scientific discourse in an effort to discredit the other. One imminent shift in methods would bring another shift — one of tone — that would affect the field almost as drastically.

After 2012, questions of methodology started dominating every social-psychology conference, as did the topic of replications. Across disciplines, a basic scientific principle is that multiple teams should independently verify a result before it is accepted as true. But for the majority of social-psychology results, even the most influential ones, this hadn’t happened. Brian Nosek, who started the Reproducibility Project (now called the Center for Open Science), an effort to test 100 important social-psychology papers, said that recognition of potential flawed methodology only fueled interest in his project. “The paper shone a light on how easily things could go wrong,” Nosek says. “Knowing that possibility in concept made the Reproducibility Project a test case in some people’s mind of ‘Does it?’ ”

For years, researchers treated journal articles, and their authors, with a genteel respect; even in the rare cases where a new study explicitly contradicted an old one, the community assumed that a lab error must account for the discrepancy. There was no incentive to replicate, in any case: Journals were largely not interested in studies that had already been done, and failed replications made people (maybe even your adviser) uncomfortable.

But in the years after that Society of Personality and Social Psychology conference, a sense of urgency propelled a generation of researchers, most of them under 40, to re-examine the work of other, more established researchers. And politeness was no longer a priority. “All of a sudden you have people emailing other people, asking for their data and then writing blog posts accusing them of shoddy practices,” says Eli Finkel, a social psychologist at Northwestern. “That was unheard-of. Now it was happening all the time.” Some blog posts took on the impact of journal articles, as interested parties weighed in with an impromptu peer review. In 2014, Psychological Science started giving electronic badges, an extra seal of approval, to studies that made their data and methodologies publicly available and preregistered their design and analysis ahead of time, so that researchers could not fish around for a new hypothesis if they turned up some unexpected findings.

Not surprisingly, replicators sometimes encountered the kind of outraged resistance that Simmons and Simonsohn initially did. The same month that Simmons and Simonsohn gave their talk, Stéphane Doyen, a social psychologist in Belgium, published a paper challenging a classic study in the field of priming, which holds that small cues, like exposure to certain words, can subconsciously trigger behaviors. The original study found that research subjects walked more slowly after being exposed to words associated with old age; the replicators found no such effect and titled their journal article “Behavioral Priming: It’s All in the Mind; but Whose Mind?” John Bargh, a professor at Yale, a luminary who published the original study, responded with a combative post on Psychology Today’s blog, claiming that discrepancies in the experiment design accounted for the difference and calling the researchers “incompetent or ill informed.” When other priming studies failed to replicate later that year, the Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, who discussed priming in his book “Thinking Fast and Slow,” wrote a letter to social psychologists who studied the effect, urging them to turn their attitude around. “To deal effectively with the doubts, you should acknowledge their existence and confront them straight on,” he wrote.

The intention of replicators was now unassailably noble — who could argue with better science? — but there was also, for the first time, status to be found in topplings, as journals started publishing more replications, many of which received lavish press attention. It was also inevitable that those being challenged would read envy into their attackers’ motivations. (In a tweet, Gilbert described those he deemed the worst offenders as “shameless little bullies.”)

Jay Van Bavel, a social psychologist at New York University, has tweeted openly about a published nonreplication of one of his studies and believes, as any scientist would, that replications are an essential part of the process; nonetheless, he found the experience of being replicated painful. “It is terrifying, even if it’s fair and within normal scientific bounds,” he says. “Because of social media and how it travels — you get pile-ons when the critique comes out, and 50 people share it in the view of thousands. That’s horrifying for anyone who’s critiqued, even if it’s legitimate.”

The field, clearly, was not moving forward as one. “In the beginning, I thought it was all ridiculous,” says Finkel, who told me it took him a few years before he appreciated the importance of what became known as the replication movement. “It was like we had been having a big party — what big, new, fun, cool stuff can we discover? And we forgot to double-check ourselves. And then the reformers were annoyed, because they felt like they had to come in after the fact and clean up after us. And it was true.”

In August 2014, the day before her second marriage, Amy Cuddy learned that a replication of her 2010 study led by a 34-year-old economist at the University of Zurich named Eva Ranehill had failed to yield the same results. “I remember thinking, Oh, bummer,” Cuddy says. But she was not distraught; often there was some perfectly good reason for a discrepancy in two studies of the same concept.

There were several key differences — Ranehill’s sample size, at 200, was much bigger, and she had designed a double-blind setup. Ranehill had her subjects hold two poses for three minutes each. She did not find an increase in either risk-taking behavior or the expected hormone changes.

Cuddy thought it was likely that the difference in time — six minutes of standing versus two — was a crucial one and probably accounted for the disparity in the results. “It’s not a crazy thing to test,” Cuddy says. “I guess under the theory that more is better? But it could go the other way — three minutes is a really, really long time to be holding a pose like that. It seems likely to me that it would be really uncomfortable, but sure, study it, and let’s see.”

She was relieved to see that the “feelings of power” finding had replicated. But Ranehill used language in her write-up that played down that finding’s importance. Although in one study of her own, Cuddy also played down the finding, she has otherwise consistently, in interviews, been enthusiastic about the idea that a body posture could change someone’s feelings. “We’re psychologists,” she says. “We try to change how people feel.” She also, at the time of the Ranehill replication, still anticipated that other research would probably show downstream effects — more risk taking, or more competitiveness, or better performance in job interviews.

By the time Cuddy got word of Ranehill’s replication, she had given her TED talk, developed a significant speaking career and was writing a book. Simmons had received tenure at Wharton and was writing, with Simonsohn, a blog called Data Colada, in which they sometimes tried to replicate other people’s work. By 2014, there was near-unanimous agreement the Data Colada team had profoundly changed the field’s research techniques for the better. But for the average researcher, an email from someone at Data Colada signaled unpleasantness ahead. “It’s like the police knocking on your door in the middle of the night,” one psychologist said.

In the wake of Ranehill’s failed replication, Cuddy and Carney set to work on a response. Carney, who is now a tenured associate professor of management at the University of California, Berkeley, tried to chart a P-curve of all 33 studies they were mentioning in their paper (which was already under review). Carney sent the paper and the P-curve to Nelson for some feedback, but he sent it on to Simmons and Simonsohn, as they were the experts.

The letter Simmons wrote back to Carney was polite, but he argued that her P-curve had not been executed correctly. He and Simonsohn had each executed P-curves of the 33 studies, and each found that it was flat, suggesting that the body of literature it reflected did not count as strong evidence. He did write that “conceptual points raised before that section are useful and contribute to the debate” but that they should take the P-curve out. “Everybody wins in that case.” According to Cuddy, she and Carney thought the P-curve science was not as settled as Simmons believed it to be. But afraid of public recrimination, they did exactly as he said — they took out the P-curve.

A few weeks after the paper was published, Cuddy learned from Simmons and Simonsohn that they were writing a blog post on the paper. A mutual friend of Cuddy and Simmons’s from graduate school, Kenworthey Bilz, a professor of law at the University of Illinois, tried to reassure Cuddy. “He’ll say his piece, and you’ll say yours, and that will be the end of it,” Bilz told Cuddy. “It’s not like you’re going to become the poster girl for this kind of thing.”

Cuddy was at her home office in Boston when she received an email from Simmons and Simonsohn. They showed her a draft of the post they planned to put online criticizing the paper; they invited feedback on anything the authors felt was incorrect or unfair. “We embrace trying to be as civil as possible but understanding that at some point you are going to say, ‘You were wrong,’ ” Simonsohn said. “People won’t like that, no matter how you much you dress it up. It’s not something people want to hear.”

The post criticized the new paper, as well as the 2010 study. It showed Simmons and Simonsohn’s own unfavorable P-curve and essentially argued that the original published findings on hormones and risk-taking were probably a result of chance. They did not include a feelings-of-power measure in the P-curve they showed. But the blog post did mention in its last footnote that there was a significant effect of power posing on “self-reported power,” although the language made it clear that it didn’t count for much: Simmons believes that self-reports of power generally reflect what is called a demand effect — a result that occurs when subjects intuit the point of the study. Cuddy believes that studies can be constructed to minimize that risk and that demand effects are often nuanced.

Cuddy responded to Simonsohn with a few points that they incorporated into the post but said she preferred to write a longer response in a context in which she felt more comfortable.

Cuddy felt ill when Simmons and Simonsohn published the post with the headline: “Reassessing the Evidence Behind the Most Popular TED Talk.” As illustration, they used a picture of Wonder Woman. Cuddy felt as if Simmons had set them up; that they included her TED talk in the headline made it feel personal, as if they were going after her rather than the work.

The post, which Simonsohn distributed to his email list of hundreds, quickly made the rounds. “People were sending me emails like I was dying of cancer,” Cuddy says. “It was like, ‘We send our condolences,’ ‘Holy crap, this is terrible’ and ‘God bless you; we wish we could do something, but obviously we can’t.’ ” She also knew what was coming, a series of events that did, in fact, transpire over time: subsequent scrutiny of other studies she had published, insulting commentary about her work on the field’s Facebook groups, disdainful headlines about the flimsiness of her research. She paced around, distraught, afraid to look at her email, afraid not to. She had just put together a tenure package and worried that the dust-up would be a continuing distraction.

Cuddy did not like seeing her work criticized in a non-peer-reviewed format, but she wrote a bland statement saying, essentially, that she disagreed with their findings and looked forward to “more progress on this important topic.” Carney reassured Cuddy in the months after the Data Colada post that their paper would eventually be vindicated — of course the effects were real; someone would prove it eventually.

Eventually, the Data Colada post caught the eye of another influential blogger, Andrew Gelman, a professor of statistics and political science at Columbia University, whose interest in Cuddy’s work would prove durable, exacting and possibly career-changing for Cuddy. Gelman wields his sizable influence on the field from afar, on his popular blog andrewgelman.com, where he posts his thoughts on best statistical practices in the sciences, with a frequent emphasis on what he sees as the absurd and unscientific. Gelman, who studied math and physics at M.I.T. before turning to statistics, does not believe that social psychology is any more guilty of P-hacking than, say, biology or economics. But he has devoted extensive attention to the field, especially in more recent years, in part because of the way the media has glorified social-psychology research. He is respected enough that his posts are well read; he is cutting enough that many of his critiques are enjoyed with a strong sense of schadenfreude.

Four months after the Data Colada post, Gelman, with a co-author, published an article in Slate about Carney and Cuddy’s 2010 study, calling it “tabloid fodder.” Eventually, Cuddy’s name began appearing regularly in the blog, both in his posts and in comments. Gelman’s writing on Cuddy’s study was coolly dismissive; it bothered him that Cuddy remained fairly silent on the replication and the Data Colada post. For all he knew, Cuddy was still selling the hormone effect in her speaking gigs and in her best-selling book, “Presence,” which he had not read. Had he looked, he would have been annoyed to see that Cuddy did not include a mention of the Ranehill replication. But he might have been surprised to see how little of the book focused on power posing (just a few pages).

On his site, Cuddy’s name, far from the only one he repeatedly invoked, became a go-to synecdoche for faulty science writ large. When he saw that Cuddy had been invited to speak at a conference, he wondered why the organizers had not invited a bunch of other famous figures he clearly considered bad for science, including Diederik Stapel, who had been accused of outright fraud.

His site became a home for frequently hostile comments from his followers. “She has no serious conception of ‘science,’ ” one posted. Another compared Cuddy to Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos chief executive under investigation for misleading investors. Though Gelman did encourage his readers to stick to the science, he rarely reined anyone in. In one exchange in July 2016, a commenter wrote, “I’ve wondered whether some of Amy Cuddy’s mistakes are due to the fact that she suffered severe head trauma as the result of a car accident some years ago.” Gelman replied, “A head injury hardly seems necessary to explain these mistakes,” pointing out that her adviser, Fiske, whom he has also criticized, had no such injury but made similar errors.

Gelman, whom I met in his office in late June, is not scathing in person; he is rather mild, soft-spoken even. Gelman was vague when asked if he felt there was anything unusual about the frequency of his comments on Cuddy (“People send me things, and I respond,” he said). He said it was Cuddy who was unrelenting. He later emailed me to make sure I was aware that she attacked him and Simmons and Simonsohn on a private Facebook page, without backing up her accusations with evidence; he was still waiting for a clear renunciation of the original 2010 paper on the hormonal effects of power posing. “I would like her to say: ‘Jeez, I didn’t know any better. I was doing what they told me to do. I don’t think I’m a bad person, and it didn’t get replicated’ — rather than salvaging as much as she can.”

Gelman considers himself someone who is doing others the favor of pointing out their errors, a service for which he would be grateful, he says. Cuddy considers him a bully, someone who does not believe that she is entitled to her own interpretation of the research that is her field of expertise.

Cuddy has asked herself what motivates Gelman. “Why not help social psychologists instead of attacking them on your blog?” she wondered aloud to me. “Why not come to a conference or hold a seminar?” When I asked Gelman if he would ever consider meeting with Cuddy to hash out their differences, he seemed put off by the idea of trying to persuade her, in person, that there were flaws in her work.

“I don’t like interpersonal conflict,” he said.

On Sept. 26, 2016, Amy Cuddy woke up and checked her phone to find a chilling text from a friend. “I’m so sorry,” it said. “Are you O.K.?” She felt a familiar dread, something closer to panic. For the past year, she had mostly stopped going to social-psychology conferences, feeling a chill from her community. Another social psychologist had told her that a graduate student asked if she really was friends with Cuddy. When she responded, “Yes,” the young woman asked, “Why?”

It was the kind of information Cuddy wished she did not have; her closest friends were told to stop passing on or commenting about that kind of thing, but acquaintances still did it. She felt adrift in her field. She worried about asking peers to collaborate, suspecting that they would not want to set themselves up for intense scrutiny. And she felt betrayed, not just by those who cut her down on social media, in blog posts, even in reviews (one reviewer called her “a profiteer,” not hiding his contempt), but also by some of those who did not publicly defend her. She was not wrong to think that at least in some cases, it was fear, rather than lack of support for her, that kept people from speaking up. Two tenured psychology professors at Ivy League universities acknowledged to me that they would have publicly defended some of Cuddy’s positions were they not worried about making themselves targets on Data Colada and elsewhere.

Two days before Cuddy received that text from a friend, Gelman once again posted about the power-posing research, but this time he issued a challenge to Dana Carney. “When people screw up or cheat in their research, what do their collaborators say?” he wondered in the post. For Carney, he wrote, “it was not too late.” Unknown to Cuddy and Gelman, Carney had already linked, in her C.V., to Simmon and Simonsohn’s critique of that first, influential 2010 study, but she hadn’t made the kind of statement or gesture that Gelman expected from Cuddy.

That morning of the troubling text, Cuddy logged onto her computer and discovered that Carney had posted on her website a document (then quickly published on New York magazine’s site) that seemed intended to distance its author forever, in every way, from power posing. “I do not believe that ‘power pose’ effects are real,” she said. Not only had she stopped studying power poses, “I discourage others from studying power poses.”

She listed a number of methodological concerns she had, in retrospect, about the 2010 paper, most of which, Cuddy says, Carney had never raised with her. In an email a few months earlier, Carney had clearly told Cuddy that she thought the study’s data was flimsy, the sample was tiny, the effects were barely there. But Cuddy said she had never received notice that this kind of renunciation was coming. Carney declined to comment for this article, but Nelson, who is in her department, said she was clearly in a tough position, saddled with all the negatives of the work — the hit to her reputation — with none of the upside: the speaking fees and the positive feedback from teary fans who no doubt fuel Cuddy’s conviction in the research.

For much of the scientific world, Carney’s statement was an act of integrity and bravery. “Whoa! This is how to do it!” tweeted Michael Inzlicht, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Toronto who had eloquently written about his own crisis of confidence about his field of research, ego depletion.

To Cuddy, Carney’s post seemed so sweeping as to be vague, self-abnegating. Even Simonsohn, who made clear his support for Carney’s decision, thought the letter had a strangely unscientific vehemence to it. “If I do a bad job proving there’s a ninth planet, I probably shouldn’t say there’s a ninth planet,” he says. “But I shouldn’t say there is no ninth planet, either. You should just ignore the bad study and go back to base line.”

Cuddy wrote a lengthy response to Carney that New York magazine published. (New York, Slate and The Atlantic have closely reported on the replication movement.) Then she stopped taking phone calls and went almost completely offline. She found that she couldn’t eat; at 5-foot-5, Cuddy went down to 100 pounds.

Less than two weeks after Carney’s disavowal, Cuddy got on a plane so she could meet her commitment to speak to a crowd of 10,000 in Las Vegas. As frail as she had been since her accident, she headed to an arena in Las Vegas and roused the crowd, a tiny woman on a giant stage, taking up space, making herself big, feeling the relief of feeling powerful.

When I emailed Joe Simmons in July and asked to meet with him, he readily agreed but warned me that he does not check his email often. “I had to take email off my phone,” he explained when we met at a coffee shop across the river from Wharton. A lot of his work these days was stressful — sometimes the emailer was angry, sometimes he was — so if he looked at his phone before bed, “that was it — I wouldn’t sleep all night.”

When Simmons and I met, I asked him why he eventually wrote such a damning blog post, when his initial correspondence with Carney did not seem particularly discouraging. He and Simonsohn, he told me, had clearly explained to Cuddy and Carney that the supporting studies they cited were problematic as a body of work — and yet all the researchers did was drop the visual graph, as if deliberately sidestepping the issue. They left in the body of literature that Simmons and Simonsohn’s P-curve discredited. That apparent disregard for contrary evidence was, Simmons said, partly what prompted them to publish the harsh blog post in the first place.

But the email that Simmons and Simonsohn had sent was, in fact, ambiguous: They had explicitly told her to drop the P-curve and yet left the impression that the paper was otherwise sound. At my request, Simmons looked back at his original email. I watched as he read it over. “Oh, yeah,” he said quietly. He had a pained look on his face. “We did say to drop the graph, didn’t we?” He read it over again, then sat back. “I didn’t remember that. This may be a big misunderstanding about — that email is too polite.”

Cuddy and Carney had taken their advice literally. Simmons stood by his analysis but recognized that there was confusion at play in how they interpreted the events that transpired. Simmons says he harbored no ill will toward Cuddy before criticizing her paper; if anything, he remembered her warmly. “She was great,” he said, smiling at the memory. “We published the blog post despite my history with Amy. Because I realized that once we pulled the trigger on this. … ” He did not finish the sentence. Cuddy had, in fact, become the poster girl for this kind of work, which even he thought was not fair. “The original study wasn’t particularly egregious,” he said. “It was published in 2010 before anyone was thinking about this.”

For a moment, the scientist allowed the human element to factor into how he felt about his email response to that paper. “I wish,” he said, “I’d had the presence of mind to pick up the phone and call Amy.”

The public nature of the attacks against Cuddy have reverberated among social psychologists, raising questions about the effects of harsh discourse on the field and particularly on women. Earlier this year at the conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology, there was a presentation of a 2016 survey of 700 social psychologists, assessing their perceptions of the influence of social media on their careers. The subsequent conversation on popular Facebook groups was so combative that Alison Ledgerwood, a social psychologist at the University of California, Davis, felt the need to respond in a blog post. In it, she argued that if scientists keep having hostile conversations on social media, women are more likely to be driven away from the field. (Women in the profession, the survey presented at the conference reported, participated less than their male colleagues in social-media discussions.)

Even people who believe that the methodological reforms are essential say its costs to science are real. “It’s become like politics — we’ve created two camps of people who shouldn’t be in two camps in the first place,” says Jay Van Bavel, the social psychologist at N.Y.U. “It’s perceived slights and defensiveness, and everybody has some history or grievance — and it will never end because there is that history of perceived grievances, of one of your colleagues who has been put through it, or criticized your friend in a public forum. It’s terrible for science. It’s not good.”

If Amy Cuddy is a victim, she may not seem an obvious one: She has real power, a best-selling book, a thriving speaking career. She did not own up fully to problems in her research or try to replicate her own study. (She says there were real hurdles to doing so, not least of which was finding a collaborator to take that on.) But many of her peers told me that she did not deserve the level of widespread and sometimes vicious criticism she has endured. “Amy has been the target of mockery and meanness on Facebook, on Twitter, in blog posts — I feel like, Wow, I have never seen that in science,” Van Bavel says. “I’ve only been in it for 15 years, but I’ve never seen public humiliation like that.”

As a result, the breadth of the accusations — how diffuse they are — could easily be mistaken for the depth of her scientific missteps, which at the outset were no different from those of so many of her peers. “We were all being trained to simplify, to get our message out there — there were conferences and panels on how to do it,” says Richard Petty, a social psychologist at Ohio State. “One of the ironies is that Amy just did it more successfully.”

I was surprised to find that some of the leaders in the replication movement were not Cuddy’s harshest critics but spoke of her right to defend her work in more measured tones. “Why does everyone care so much about what Amy says?” Brian Nosek says. “Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself. Leif Nelson, one of the three pioneers of the movement, says Cuddy is no different from most other scientists in her loyalty to her data. “Authors love their findings,” he says. “And you can defend almost anything — that’s the norm of science, not just in psychology.” He still considers Cuddy a “very serious psychologist”; he also believes the 2010 paper “is a bunch of nonsense.” But he says, “It does not strike me as at all notable that Amy would defend her work. Most people do.”

Every researcher has a threshold at which he or she is convinced of the evidence; in social psychology, especially, there is no such thing as absolute proof, only measures of probability. In recent months, Cuddy reached the threshold needed to alter her thinking on the effect of hormones. She mentioned, at a psychology conference where she was presenting her work, that a study had recently been conducted on power posing. “They found no hormonal effects,” she said before taking a breath. “That study is done very well, and I trust those results.” Although 11 new papers have recently been published that do not show the downstream effects of power posing on behaviors, Cuddy is still fighting for power posing. The research, she says, still shows its effect on feelings of power: At the conference, she presented a comprehensive meta-analysis, a version of which, she says, she will soon publish, with a strong P-curve supporting that, and she also presented a P-curve suggesting that power posing had a robust effect on self-evaluations, emotions and moods.

Cuddy now seems ready to move on to a new phase. We met near her home in Newton, Mass., in August. Cuddy, smiling, fresh from physical therapy for a torn ACL, was in a tennis skirt, looking young and more lighthearted than I had ever seen her. She had abandoned the dream of tenure. She was planning a new project, a new book, she told me. It was coming together in her mind: “Bullies, Bystanders and Bravehearts.” It would be personal; there would be research; she would write, and she would talk, and she would interview people who had suffered fates worse than her own and bounced back. She would tell their stories and hers, and because she is a good talker, people would listen.",When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Raf Simons for Calvin Klein was a new addition to the Designer of the Year shortlist, but then again, this is not his first appearance at the fashion awards-scene rodeo; in June he won both women’s wear designer of the year and men’s wear designer of the year at the CFDA Awards in New York in June.

As the audience rose and prepared to face the rain, one couldn’t help but think: for an industry whose raison d’être is an obsession with newness, the awards event scheduled for Dec. 4 at the Royal Albert Hall, which doubtless will be uplifting and in the right spirit, also is running a high risk of feeling like more of the same.

Unsurprisingly, it was among the British Emerging Talent categories, broken into separate awards for men’s wear and women’s wear this year, that some fresher faces finally were mentioned: Charles Jeffrey for Charles Jeffrey Loverboy was nominated for the men’s award, and Natalia Alaverdian for A.W.A.K.E, Michael Halpern and Rejina Pyo were among the women’s wear nominees.

Interesting, too, was the inclusion of Supreme in the shortlist for Urban Luxe Brand, as the skate wear brand continues its charge closer into the bosom of the fashion establishment.

Perhaps the biggest surprise — and most controversial choice — was the nomination of Maria Grazia Chiuri of Dior as Designer of the Year. Ms. Chiuri has been at the brand’s helm for three seasons now, and a subject of critical debate for almost as long. Dior sales may be robust but reviews of her collections have been mixed (to put it mildly).

LONDON — “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” the hit British play and final installment of J.K. Rowling’s cult fantasy series, is off to Australia.

“It really gives us pause for the future because volcanic eruptions will continue, and they will come at unpredictable times,” Dr. McCormick said.","As less water is absorbed into the clouds, less rain falls into seas and lakes. And if a volcano erupts in the Northern Hemisphere, especially at high latitudes, the cooling effect may tamper with the summertime heating that controls monsoon winds over Africa.

When rainfall is reduced and monsoons are suppressed, the Nile fails to flood as usual, starving the crops that depend on its water.

“We guess there was a lot of fear when the Egyptians see the Nile not flooding that year,” said Joseph Manning, a historian from Yale and co-author on the study. “There was fear about what’s going to happen. ‘Are we going to starve like last time when there was no flood three years in a row?’”

That fear could have fueled riots. But to establish a connection between volcanoes and revolts in ancient Egypt, the team first had to determine the dates for when the volcanoes erupted.

They did that by looking at ice core data from Greenland and Antarctica, which contain trapped sulfur from ancient volcanic eruptions. The scientists then turned to papyrus records to figure out when the Nile River failed to flood as usual.

But the records from the Ptolemaic period were all qualitative, not quantitative. So the team turned to the Nilometer record, which contains measurements taken by large instruments built during Egypt’s early Islamic period to monitor the Nile River’s annual flood level.

The researchers used the data from the Nilometer record to gain measurements from 622 A.D. to 1902 A.D., and identified 60 eruptions between those years. On average the Nile flood level was nearly nine inches lower during eruption years, the team discovered.

This suggested a pattern that may have existed during the Ptolemaic Period, as well.

After confirming a link between volcanic eruptions and poor Nile flooding, the team then matched the dates of Ptolemaic eruptions with papyrus records of well-known rebellions. They found that eight of ten large uprisings happened within two years of a volcanic eruption.

More Reporting on Archaeology

The biggest of these, the 20-year Theban revolt, began in 207 B.C., followed a large tropical eruption two years earlier. A papyrus report from this time indicated that most of the farmers were killed and the land had gone dry.

In their paper, the researchers were careful to clarify that volcanoes alone were not the cause of Egyptian revolts. Rather, the natural disasters set off a reaction that mixed other ingredients — like heavy taxation, ethnic conflict and disease — to incite social unrest.

“You have all of these things coalescing at a time, and you can image it’s a powder keg,” said Dr. Ludlow. “All of it puts a strain on the social system and can just ignite into revolt against the Ptolemaic Greek elites.”

Not every eruption in that period was linked to a revolt. The river failed to flood in the years following massive eruptions in 46 and 44 B.C. during Cleopatra’s reign, but her food allocation policies may have helped avert uprisings.

Kyle Harper, a professor of classics at the University of Oklahoma who has studied environmental change and the fall of the Roman Empire, said the new paper was compelling and that it showed a strong link between volcanic forces and their effects on the Nile River. He added that he would like to see if the analysis could be extended to Egypt’s Roman and early Islamic periods.

But Kevin Anchukaitis, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arizona, said that the study had some shortcomings. For instance, he called the variability in the Nile River flooding during eruption years relatively small. The study also did not account for weather effects like El Niño during that period, he said.

Dr. Ludlow responded by saying that the study shows that the flood levels are consistently lower following eruptions, and that larger eruptions produced a correspondingly greater drop in flood levels.

To Michael McCormick, a professor of history at Harvard, the study offers a note of caution as we face climatic changes in the future.

“It really gives us pause for the future because volcanic eruptions will continue, and they will come at unpredictable times,” Dr. McCormick said. “It is sobering to see how this may have had an effect on a very productive economy in the ancient world, and we need to reflect on how it may affect us.”",Volcanoes Helped Violent Revolts Erupt in Ancient Egypt,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/science/volcanoes-ancient-egypt-revolts.html

SEATTLE — Amazon said on Monday it got a total of 238 proposals from cities and regions across North America that want to be the home of its proposed second headquarters.

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

According to her aides, the first lady is aware of criticism directed at her bullying prevention efforts, given the president’s proclivity for digital insults. Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s communications director, said that Mrs. Trump is an “independent woman” who would continue her efforts.

“She’s used to naysayers,” Ms. Grisham said. “And this is not going to be new for her. She’s made a commitment to children in many different areas, and this is one of them.”

Officials at Pacer’s National Bullying Prevention Center, the organization behind National Bullying Prevention Month, said that they were not aware that the first lady was visiting Michigan but have made efforts to reach out to the White House. Paula F. Goldberg, Pacer’s executive director and co-founder, said in an interview that she hoped Mrs. Trump would “continue speaking out about cyberbullying and bullying prevention.”

“That’s a role she could play, and one that is very important,” Ms. Goldberg added.

Laura Talmus, who helped found Beyond Differences, the Bay Area nonprofit that created “No One Eats Alone” in 2012, said she had also not heard from the White House.

“They really have to extend far beyond a one-time appearance at a school,” Ms. Talmus said in an interview. “We just hope that constant care of children all year round, including what they read and hear on social media, and the news and at home at the dinner table will also be something that can be influenced.”

In a statement, Mrs. Trump said the same.

“By our own example, we must teach children to be good stewards of the world they will inherit,” Mrs. Trump said. “We need to remember that they are always watching and listening.”

As she prepares to formally start a platform in the coming months, Mrs. Trump’s recent trips are more like short jaunts that allow her to lend her image to causes without speaking at length in public or traveling too far from the White House.

Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner revels in his long, red hair and shaggy beard — and hit .322 with a robust .945 on-base plus slugging percentage this season. Astros second baseman Jose Altuve is the shortest everyday player in the majors at 5 feet 6 inches — but this season he’s probably the best player, too. Altuve led the majors in batting average, at .346, and hit .400 in the A.L. playoffs.

“Jose Altuve is a perfect player,” Astros Manager A.J. Hinch said this month, and who could argue?

Other notables dot the lineups — the newcomer Cody Bellinger and the old pro Chase Utley for the Dodgers; the homegrown sensations Carlos Correa and George Springer for the Astros — and both pitching staffs include an ace yearning for a championship. The Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw, 29, and the Astros’ Justin Verlander, 34, have won the Most Valuable Player Award, and will probably spend their golden years gathering on a stage in Cooperstown every July. But neither has a World Series title to his name.

Kershaw, who will start Game 1 against another top left-hander, Dallas Keuchel, went 18-4 and led the National League in earned run average for the fifth time, with a 2.31 mark. He reached 200 strikeouts for the seventh time, and despite middling postseason numbers over all (6-7, 4.40 E.R.A.), the Dodgers have now won eight of his last nine playoff appearances.

“His desire to be great is relentless,” said Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers’ president of baseball operations, after the N.L.C.S was over. “You watch how he prepares, you watch how he goes about his work every fifth day, and for all that he has put into this game, knowing how badly he wants to pitch in a World Series, I’m overcome with joy for him that he gets to experience this.”

Kershaw has spent his entire 10-year career with the Dodgers, while the Astros are just getting to know Verlander, who joined them in a trade from Detroit on Aug. 31, moments before his eligibility for the postseason would have run out.

Verlander has taken the mound nine times for Houston, postseason included — and gone 9-0 with a 1.23 E.R.A. He brings elite pitching and star power to the World Series; his fiancée, the supermodel Kate Upton, wore a 1980s-vintage Astros warm-up jacket, with the old rainbow design, to the on-field celebration after the final game of the A.L.C.S.

“I just congratulated him, and told him I was proud of him and what he had done,” said Nolan Ryan, an Astros executive and Hall of Fame pitcher, after Verlander was named the most valuable player of the series. “He stepped up and he’s a big part of this ball club. I enjoy power pitchers, and he was a real pleasure to watch.”

Verlander will start Game 2 of the World Series on Wednesday, probably against the Dodgers’ Rich Hill. The series’ starters should also feature the All-Stars Yu Darvish (in his final performance or two before free agency) and Alex Wood for the Dodgers, and the Astros’ shutout duo from Game 7 against the Yankees, Charlie Morton and McCullers.

“Teams driven by stats or by names, they don’t do anything, they don’t get anywhere,” Morton said in the raucous clubhouse after Game 7 of the A.L.C.S. “Teams with grit, a tight-knit bond, those teams outperform expectations.”

That may be true, but both of these teams were expected to contend, and both fulfilled their promise all year long.

Leading Off With a Bang

The Astros use their best power hitter, George Springer, in the leadoff spot. He went just 3 for 26 in the A.L.C.S., but bashed 34 homers in the regular season with a strong .367 on-base percentage.

“He’s an incredible tone-setter — his presence, his energy, his knowledge of the strike zone, his threat to do exactly what he did tonight,” Hinch said after Springer homered in a victory this summer. “He’s a middle-of-the-order bat who’s leading off the game, and once it rolls back around, you can see how productive he can be getting the most at-bats of the night.”

Dangerous Curves

As fastball velocity rises in the majors, use of the curveball — with its greater speed variation than the slider — is also up. No two starters throw more curves than the Astros’ McCullers and the Dodgers’ Hill. McCullers, who silenced the Yankees with a flurry of curveballs to close out Game 7 of the A.L.C.S., threw curveballs on 47.4 percent of his pitches in the regular season, by far the most for any major leaguer with at least 100 innings. Hill ranked second, with 37.5 percent curveballs. McCullers throws the pitch much harder than Hill, with an average velocity near 86 miles an hour, compared to about 74 m.p.h. for Hill.

Unassuming Champions

Besides Bellinger, no Dodger hit 30 homers or drove in 80 runs this season. But if their offense seems underwhelming, consider the lineup for their last World Series game, in 1988: Steve Sax, Franklin Stubbs, Mickey Hatcher, Mike Marshall, John Shelby, Mike Davis, Rick Dempsey, Jeff Hamilton, Alfredo Griffin. Nobody on that Dodger team had more than 25 homers or 82 runs batted in, but with stellar pitching (including two complete games from Orel Hershiser) and the timeliest of all timely hitting (Kirk Gibson’s iconic homer to end Game 1), the Dodgers upset the Oakland A’s in five games.

A Complete Player. Almost.

Few players have ever matched the all-around skills and longevity of the Astros’ Carlos Beltran. He is one of five players with at least 2,700 hits, 400 homers, 300 steals and multiple Gold Gloves, along with Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez, Willie Mays and Andre Dawson. Yet only two of those players — Rodriguez and Mays — have won the World Series. Beltran lost in his previous appearance, with St. Louis in 2013.

Catching On

While Houston’s catcher is the seven-time All-Star Brian McCann, the Dodgers’ Austin Barnes keeps a lower profile. A backup to Yasmani Grandal for most of the season, Barnes emerged to start six of the Dodgers’ eight games in the playoffs. The team acquired him with Enrique Hernandez from Miami in a seven-player deal in December 2014 that sent second baseman Dee Gordon to the Marlins.

Barnes, who by then had played part of just one season above Class A, supports the theory that minor league numbers translate to the majors: his on-base percentage in the minors, .388, matches his on-base percentage for the Dodgers, and his slugging percentage (.439 in the minors, .430 for the Dodgers) is nearly identical.

Reminder of Home

Jansen wears No. 74, a number worn by only nine other players in major league history. For Jansen, it was not simply a high number assigned randomly one spring training. He chose it to honor the street address of his boyhood home in Willemstad, Curacao. His parents had struggled to keep the house after Jansen’s father suffered a stroke when Jansen was 12. Baseball success has taken care of the mortgage.

“The short story is I helped my parents save the house,” Jansen said a few years ago. “We had good times, good memories over there, and also we went through a lot of tough times with the 74. That’s why I’m wearing it.”

Name That Team

Neither team began with its current nickname. For their first three seasons, the Astros were known as the Colt .45s, after a suggestion from a fan named William Neder, who wrote in a contest entry, “The Colt .45 won the West and will win the National League.” In the team logo, smoke rose from a pistol to form the “C” in Colts. In December 1964, with the Colt firearms company considering a lawsuit over merchandising rights, the team owner Roy Hofheinz changed the name to Astros to capitalize on the space race.

“The name and insignia will help dispel the image of Texas as a land of cowboys and Indians,” Hofheinz said.

The Dodgers went through several names in their early years in Brooklyn — Atlantics, Grays, Bridegrooms, Superbas, Robins. In the 1930s, the name Dodgers — for folks who dodged trolley cars on their way across busy Brooklyn streets — finally stuck.

Name That Tune

Visitors to Minute Maid Park know the word “coyotes” has only two syllables: those are “ky-oats” who wail along the trail in the clap-along seventh-inning stretch anthem “Deep In The Heart of Texas.” Likewise, fans at Dodger Stadium — from the South Bay to the Valley, from the West Side to the East Side — groove along to Randy Newman’s “I Love L.A.” after every win.

Two No. 32s

Both teams have 10 retired numbers, including No. 32 for a pitcher. The Dodgers’ 32 honors the Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax, but the Astros’ honoree is far less known. In April 1964, before the Dodgers or most teams had retired any numbers, the Astros — then still known as the Colt .45s — retired 32 for Jim Umbricht, a top reliever in their first two seasons as an expansion team. After posting a 2.01 E.R.A. in 1962, Umbricht was found to have a malignant tumor in his leg. He returned after surgery and pitched well again, but died of lymphoma the next spring at age 33.

If you miss seeing Mary Hart on “Entertainment Tonight,” for which she was a host from 1982 to 2011, you can still find her on TV, on the far right of your screen behind the home plate for games at Dodger Stadium with her husband, Burt Sugarman. In roughly the same seating location for the games at Houston’s Minute Maid Park, you’ll see Nolan Ryan with his wife, Ruth. And you’ll almost surely see the ubiquitous Marlins Man — a Miami lawyer and sports superfan named Laurence Levy — in his trademark orange jersey and visor somewhere close by.

An Orbit All His Own

The Dodgers are one of just three teams without a mascot, joining the Yankees and the Los Angeles Angels on the no-fun list. Luckily, the Astros have Orbit, a fat and furry green prankster with little baseballs affixed to his antennas. Orbit, who likes to shed his shirt and streak across the field to celebrate winning streaks (get it?), is known for playfully teasing the players; he held a sign reading “I’m Not Touching You” while hovering inches from the head of the notoriously twitchy Adrian Beltre. Orbit is a rival of the Tampa Bay Rays’ Chris Archer, who presented him with a formal “Declaration of Unfriendliness” after a series of madcap antics this summer.

Common Alumni

The Dodgers’ Hernandez and Josh Fields are a former Astros, and Houston’s Josh Reddick has played for Los Angeles. Outfielder Jimmy Wynn, known as the Toy Cannon, ranks fourth on the Astros’ career home run list and played for the Dodgers in the 1974 World Series.

Don Sutton, the Dodgers’ career leader in wins, losses, shutouts and strikeouts, left the team as a free agent to join the Astros in 1981. He fractured a kneecap in his final start of that season and missed the playoffs, but several others have played in the postseason for both teams, including Fields, Reddick, Enos Cabell, Danny Heep, Jose Lima, Davey Lopes, Jeff Kent and Rafael Landestoy.

Playoff History

A meeting of former National League West rivals, this World Series feels a bit like the 2014 Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and the Denver Broncos; for decades, the matchup occurred multiple times every regular season.

But the Astros, who moved to the A.L. in 2013, did face the Dodgers in a playoff series after the strike-shortened 1981 season, when baseball staged a best-of-five series between the first- and second-half winners of each division. The Astros — who had beaten the Dodgers in a one-game playoff to win the West the year before — took the first two games in Houston but dropped the last three at Dodger Stadium.

Nolan Ryan had no-hit the Dodgers two weeks before, but he lost the finale to Jerry Reuss, who spun a five-hitter against his former team to send Los Angeles on its way to a championship.",World Series Preview: A Matchup With No Underdog,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/sports/baseball/dodgers-astros-world-series.html

MONDAY PUZZLE — The crossword editor Will Shortz has called this period of time the “golden age of puzzles,” which makes it especially funny to me that a crossword puzzle then goes ahead and declares six of its own ages. It’s very meta, to use a colloquialism, and a decent start to our solving week.

Today’s Theme

Timothy Polin offers us a theme set of six words that all end in -AGE, and separates the suffix from the base word to make a new AGE, as it were. Mr. Polin manages to pack a lot of theme material comfortably within his grid.

For example, at 39A, the word BONDAGE is split into BOND AGE and clued as “Period known for its 007 movies?” Similarly, at 50A, the word COVERAGE is split into COVER AGE and clued as “Period when tribute bands thrived?” because tribute bands play covers of songs.

I liked this set, although the top entry, 17A’s ANCHORAGE, stood out to me as a place name in a set of nonplace name words. And we have OWIE crossing BOBO, which in itself is not an issue, but they are not great entries. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, I enjoyed seeing the debut of SAFE SPACE and am glad that it was not clued derogatorily. I also enjoyed the moment of thought I had to give to the cleverly written 10D, when I realized that CLOCKS are not seen in casinos purposely, so that gamblers will lose track of time and bet more.

Some had planned on filing a legal challenge if the Trump administration had said yes to the request, known as a “state innovation waiver.”

“This is a case of the law’s guardrails protecting people and their coverage,” said Sarah Lueck, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning group that had opposed the waiver. “Hopefully now Iowa can start looking at more practical and less disruptive solutions to deal with the challenges in its market.”

The Washington Post reported recently that President Trump in August had asked Seema Verma, the federal official in charge of reviewing Iowa’s plan, to reject it. Some supporters of the law saw that as a deliberate effort to keep premiums high; Mr. Trump frequently cites sharply rising premiums as proof that the health law is failing.

But Ms. Reynolds said the Trump administration had worked with Iowa “to the greatest extent possible” to get the waiver approved. The health law allows such waivers only if a state proves the alternative coverage will be as comprehensive and affordable, covers a comparable number of people and does not increase the federal deficit.

Last week, the administration informed the state that its plan would likely increase the federal deficit, but that it would take several weeks to figure out by how much. That, Ms. Reynolds said, prompted her to withdraw the request.

In a joint statement with Ms. Reynolds, Ms. Verma echoed Mr. Trump’s contempt for the 2010 law, calling it “unaffordable, unsustainable and unworkable.”

The individual insurance market is particularly fragile in Iowa, partly because the state has allowed tens of thousands of healthy people to keep old plans that do not comply with the health law. Aetna and Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield, the state’s most popular insurer, are both withdrawing at the end of the year.

The only insurer remaining in Iowa’s Affordable Care Act marketplace for next year, Medica, is seeking premium increases that average 56 percent, blaming Mr. Trump’s decision to stop paying subsidies known as cost-sharing reductions that lower many people’s deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. Most Iowa customers will not feel the increase, however, because they qualify for premium subsidies that will rise to cover it. But state officials have predicted that most of the 28,000 people who receive no subsidies will cancel their coverage.

So far, the Trump administration has granted state innovation waivers to three states, Alaska, Minnesota, and Oregon; they will use federal money to help insurers cover the claims of their most expensive customers next year, with the intent of lowering premiums. Oklahoma abruptly withdrew a similar request last month — one that state officials said would have reduced premiums by an average of 30 percent — saying that the Trump administration had been too slow to approve it.

Last November, news of the “Mud Men” chat spread like wildfire.

Students started noticing the racist chat on the morning of Nov. 11 when freshmen who were targeted posted screenshots of the threats on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, forcing students inside the Penn bubble — and plenty outside of it — to pay attention. Black organizations sent a barrage of emails and texts to their constituencies about the situation and began to plan for an emergency town hall. By the afternoon, the news had been picked up by national civil rights activists, including Shaun King and DeRay Mckesson. The news was trending on Twitter for hours before the school issued an official response.

There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of Penn’s black freshmen and in turn, Penn’s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.

The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on Penn’s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.

That problem is not exclusive to the University of Pennsylvania: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.

Don’t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat’s existence. I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.

Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the Penn administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.

Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.

The racist chat appeared to have been created in Oklahoma, but for the creator to have known so many members of the black freshman class, he or she would have to have been at Penn. So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus. There were multiple individuals who were taunting students on this chat, and all were anonymized by pseudonyms. So the big questions were: How many people were involved? Would they act on their covert threats? How much of the population of the school did they speak for? The chats also included a racial taunt that invoked the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, some chapters of which have been shut down at other campuses for racist behavior. (The Penn S.A.E. chapter immediately denounced the online attacks.)

Working with the F.B.I., the administration was able to identify the creator of the GroupMe chat within a few weeks — a student at the University of Oklahoma who had been accepted to Penn but chose not to attend. The student was suspended, and both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Oklahoma issued condemnations of his actions. Ultimately, the investigation found that no Penn students were involved in the chat. But these kinds of incidents make black and brown students increasingly wary.

GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It’s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.

An anonymous attack on GroupMe doesn’t feel that different from racist propaganda in “real life.” Just a few months ago, someone put up neo-Nazi recruitment fliers around campus. They were promptly removed, but the incident had an important thing in common with the GroupMe disaster: anonymity.

The creator of the GroupMe and the people who hung the fliers hid their names and faces, putting the students they were targeting in the precarious position of questioning who to trust.

Who is to blame for a faceless flier or for anonymous internet trolling? Either incident could be indicative of the racist opinions of one person or of many.

Today, we get to experience that feeling nine times in one puzzle. Ten, actually, if we count the meta that Alan Arbesfeld has neatly tucked inside his grid. Mr. Arbesfeld debuts a puzzle called “Walls and Doors,” and the idea behind it is that we are given nine 5x5 “rooms” that need to be filled in. Each answer is five letters long and the clues are not hard to solve. The roadblock occurs because the clues are not given in any particular order, so it is up to us to figure out where each word goes.

For me, that was the hardest part of the puzzle. One letter in each grid is filled in (spelling out the phrase “floor plan”), but that was only of nominal help to me. After much erasing — you want to do this one in pencil — I was able to get the central grid No. 5. That was encouraging, but then I needed to start all over again and solve another grid. I knocked out No. 8. And so on, until I had experienced seven of the nine “Aha!” moments.

The unusual heat in Los Angeles also comes amid a period of extreme weather events around the country, such as the devastating hurricanes that have hit Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida; temperatures of over 100 degrees in Portland in August and San Francisco last month; and the wildfires that have raged through parts of California.

“For Angelinos, October is Santa Ana season,” said William Patzert, a climatologist with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is about 10 miles northeast of Dodger Stadium.

Santa Ana winds blow toward the Pacific Ocean when a high-pressure system builds over the Great Basin desert in Nevada. That pushes winds through the high desert and three mountain passes — Cajon, Banning and Santa Clarita River — at speeds ranging from 30 to 50 miles per hour.

“As they drop down into the basin where Dodger Stadium is, they tend to heat up and dry out,” Patzert said. “What we’re expecting in the next couple days is record-breaking heat.”

This could be not-so-welcome news for the starting pitchers in Game 1, Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers and Dallas Keuchel of the Astros.

Dodger Stadium, which sits in Chavez Ravine in the hills just above downtown Los Angeles, is one of baseball’s more pitcher-friendly ballparks — especially at night. This is due to not only the stadium’s dimensions, with its ample 385-foot power alleys, but also Los Angeles’s weather patterns. Normally, mornings bring an offshore flow, as warm air is carried out toward the ocean.

In the afternoon, the winds often shift, bringing in a moist, heavier marine layer that benefits pitchers, weighing down long drives that might normally leave the ballpark. If that marine air is absent, replaced by warm, dry and thin air from the Santa Ana winds, it could be a boon for lineups with plenty of pop. The Astros were second in the American League with 238 home runs, while the Dodgers were fourth in the National League with 221.

Keuchel, though, did not seem to mind.

“This weather is always beautiful,” he said Monday. “It’s that dry heat.”

Asked if it was hot enough to make him consider shaving his bushy, chest-length beard, Keuchel laughed.

“Well, if it’s hot enough for four wins, I’ll shave it for sure,” he said.

For a long time, weather was less of an issue in the World Series. Until the postseason was expanded in 1969, the World Series wrapped up much earlier in October. And until 1971, when Commissioner Bowie Kuhn persuaded NBC to begin broadcasting some World Series games at night, postseason games were played exclusively during the day.

Kuhn, sensitive to criticism over the move away from traditional day baseball, sat in the stands without an overcoat during Game 2 of the 1976 World Series, even though others around him shivered as they watched the Yankees play the Reds in Cincinnati. In 1979, Kuhn prohibited the Baltimore Orioles and Pittsburgh Pirates from wearing ski caps during warm-ups or in the dugout, even though it was 41 degrees at the start of Game 1.

After Kuhn was long gone, the postseason calendar kept expanding. Division series were added in 1995 to supplement the league championship series that had begun 26 years before. And then a wild-card game was added for each league in 2012.

The extended postseason action has created the opportunity for more bone-chilling nights when the Series takes place in cities like Boston, New York, Denver, Detroit, Chicago or Philadelphia.

After a frigid 2006 World Series, when the St. Louis Cardinals and the Detroit Tigers improvised to keep warm when the temperature dipped below 40 degrees, the New Era apparel company persuaded Major League Baseball to allow it to develop three types of cold-weather accouterments: knit ski caps, balaclavas and fleece-lined baseball caps with ear flaps, which drew comparison to cartoon character Elmer Fudd’s hunting cap.

The gear came in handy in 2008, when the Phillies and Tampa Bay Rays had to play in wet, windy and cold conditions in Philadelphia.

Dodgers outfielder Curtis Granderson pondered the weather’s effects on the postseason in 2006, when he played for the Tigers. “Since spring training, outside of maybe the first few weeks in April, it’s been nice weather all season,” he recalled thinking that year. “Now we’re trying to determine the best teams in baseball and it’s anywhere from 20 to 50 degrees colder than you’ve been playing all season long? Has anyone thought about this?”

Such considerations will not be necessary on Tuesday. Neither will the balaclavas, scarves and wool coats.

But when researchers put an Elmo sticker on the apple, more than a third chose it. That’s a significant result, and from a cheap, easily replicated intervention.

While the intervention seems simple, any study like this is anything but. For many reasons, doing research in nutrition is very, very hard.

First, the researchers have to fund their work, which can take years. Then the work has to be vetted and approved by an Institutional Review Board, which safeguards subjects from potential harm. I.R.B.s are especially vigilant when studies involve children, a vulnerable group. Even if the research is of minimal risk, this process can take months.

Then there’s getting permission from schools to do the work. As you can imagine, many are resistant to allowing research on their premises. Often, protocols and rules require getting permission from parents to allow their children to be part of studies. If parents (understandably) refuse, figuring out how to do the work without involving some children can be tricky.

Finally, many methodological decisions come into play. Let’s imagine that we want to do a simple test of cookies versus apples, plus or minus stickers — as this study did. It’s possible that children eat different things on different days, so we need to make sure that we test them on multiple days of the week. It’s possible that they might change their behavior once, but then go back to their old ways, so we need to test responses over time.

It’s possible that handing out the cookie or apple personally might change behavior more than just leaving the choices out for display. If that’s the case, we need to stay hidden and observe unobtrusively. This matters because in the real world it’s probably not feasible to have someone handing out these foods in schools, and we need the methods to mirror what will most likely happen later. It’s also possible that the choices might differ based on whether children can take both the apple and the cookie (in which case they could get the sticker and the treat) or whether they had to choose one.

I point out all these things to reinforce that this type of research isn’t as simple as many might initially think. Without addressing these questions, and more, the work may be flawed or not easily generalized.

These difficulties are some of the reasons so much research on food and nutrition is done with animals, like mice. We don’t need to worry as much about I.R.B.s or getting a school on board. We don’t have to worry about mice noticing who’s recording data. And we can control what they’re offered to eat, every meal of every day. But the same things that make animal studies so much easier to perform also make them much less meaningful. Human eating and nutrition are typically more complex than anything a mouse would encounter.

Overcoming these problems and proving spectacular results in preteens are some of the reasons this study on cookies and apples, and others like it, are so compelling. The authors have transformed this work into popular appearances, books and publicity for the Food and Brand Lab.

But cracks began to appear in Mr. Wansink’s and the Food and Brand Lab’s work not long ago, when other researchers noted discrepancies in some of his studies. The numbers didn’t add up; odd things appeared in the data, including the study on apples and cookies. The issues were significant enough that JAMA Pediatrics retracted the original article, and the researchers posted a replacement.

The problems didn’t end there. As Stephanie Lee at BuzzFeed recently reported, it appears that the study wasn’t conducted on 8-to-11-year-olds as published. It was done on 3-to-5-year-olds.

Just as mice can’t be easily extrapolated to humans, research done on 3-to-5-year-olds doesn’t necessarily generalize to 8-to-11-year-olds. Putting an Elmo sticker on an apple for a small child might matter, but that doesn’t mean it will for a fifth grader. On Friday, the study was fully retracted.

Making things worse, this may have happened in other publications. Ms. Lee has also reported on a study published in Preventive Medicine in 2012 that claimed that children are more likely to eat vegetables if you give them a “cool” name, like “X-ray Vision Carrots.” That study, too, may be retracted or corrected, along with a host of others.

As a researcher, and one who works with children, I find it hard to understand how you could do a study of 3-to-5-year-olds, analyze the data, write it up and then somehow forget and imagine it happened with 8-to-11-year-olds. The grant application would have required detail on the study subjects, as well as justification for the age ranges. The I.R.B. would require researchers to be specific about the ages of the children studied.

I reached out to the authors of the study to ask how this could have happened, and Mr. Wansink replied: “The explanation for mislabeling of the age groups in the study is both simple and embarrassing. I was not present for the 2008 data collection, and when I later wrote the paper I wrongly inferred that these children must have been the typical age range of elementary students we usually study. Instead, I discovered that while the data was indeed collected in elementary schools, it was actually collected at Head Start day cares that happened to meet in those elementary schools.”

This is a level of disconnect that many scientists would find inconceivable, and I do not mean to suggest that this is the norm for nutrition research. It does, however, illustrate how an inattention to detail can derail what might be promising work. The difficulties of research in this area are already significant. Distrust makes things worse. The social sciences are already suffering from a replication problem; when work that makes a big splash fails to hold up, it hurts science in general.

We want to believe there are easy fixes to the obesity epidemic and nutrition in general. We want to believe there are simple actions we can take, like putting labels on menus, or stickers on food, or jazzing up the names of vegetables. Sadly, all of that may not work, regardless of what advocates say.

With so few A.I. specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia. In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.

Uber hired 40 people from Carnegie Mellon’s groundbreaking A.I. program in 2015 to work on its self-driving-car project. Over the last several years, four of the best-known A.I. researchers in academia have left or taken leave from their professorships at Stanford University. At the University of Washington, six of 20 artificial intelligence professors are now on leave or partial leave and working for outside companies.

“There is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry,” said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

Some professors are finding a way to compromise. Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records). Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.

“There are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia,” Mr. Zettlemoyer said. “The salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.”

To bring in new A.I. engineers, companies like Google and Facebook are running classes that aim to teach “deep learning” and related techniques to existing employees. And nonprofits like Fast.ai and companies like Deeplearning.ai, founded by a former Stanford professor who helped create the Google Brain lab, offer online courses.

The basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math. But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call “a dark art.” Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.

In order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places. Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills. Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.

“I can’t compete with Google, and I don’t want to,” said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries. “So I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.”

But the industry’s giants are doing much the same. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have opened A.I. labs in Toronto and Montreal, where much of this research outside the United States is being done. Google also is hiring in China, where Microsoft has long had a strong presence.

The push to modernize the way fares are paid comes during a disastrous year for the subway system, with delays on every line, rush-hour malfunctions that have strangled the system, and worse: a train derailed in Manhattan in mid-June, injuring dozens of people and raising concerns over whether the subway was even safe. Service deteriorated so much that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency that month.

The challenges involved with making the trains run have to do with the outdated infrastructure in the tunnels and along the tracks, not the somewhat less-antiquated infrastructure of the MetroCard system.

Officials see the new payment system as a way to make getting into subway stations and onto buses faster, though that could bring more passengers into a system that is already straining to handle the millions it carries every day.

The new system will replace the MetroCard, but MetroCards will not be phased out until 2023 — 30 years after they replaced tokens for subways and buses. Until 2023, passengers can pay their fares the new way or with a MetroCard. The new system will also process fares for the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North commuter lines, which are also operated by the transportation authority.

The most obvious difference will be what passengers do to go through a subway turnstile or board a bus: wave or tap a smartphone or a credit or debit card, instead of swipe a MetroCard.

The system will work through apps like Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay as well as “contactless cards” — credit or debit cards with embedded chips that rely on a wireless technology known as near field communication, or N.F.C.

“The millennial generation, those who are more prone to new technology, will be our greatest users in the early stages,” Mr. Lhota said. He added that card issuers “are going to want to be a part of it” and would add the near-field technology “when they realize that 5.8 to 6 million people in New York City are getting on the subway every day.”

Mr. Lhota said another potential advantage was that fare readers could be installed near the back doors on buses to “allow for all-door boarding.” That would let buses pull away from bus stops sooner than they do now, reducing travel times.

The transit agency is hiring the same company that designed the system in London, which is also the company that developed MetroCards a generation ago. In London, the card that riders use is called the Oyster. In New York, the name has yet to be determined.

The new system will not mean the end of the flat fare that has defined the New York subway system since it opened in 1904. Fares on the London Underground are based on distance, as they are in other cities that use similar technology, like Washington. But Mr. Lhota said he was not contemplating changing the fare structure for the subways. (The Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North do charge by distance, using zones that usually include several stations.)

The reaction from transit advocates to the MetroCard’s eventual demise was generally positive.

“First things first: moving to a modern fare system is a convenience for riders,” said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance. “It allows them to benefit from the extraordinary innovations the private sector is undertaking these days.” But he said the new system would also benefit the transit agency, which has run its own currency system since the subways were brand new more than a century ago.

“The digital payment world has moved so quickly in the last 20 years that the M.T.A. has been left completely behind,” Mr. Raskin said. “Switching to a system that can take advantage of that means the M.T.A. shouldn’t end up in a situation where in 10 years it’s out of date. It can take advantage of every new innovation that’s yet to come.”

Thomas K. Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban policy group, praised the move, predicting that ridership would increase once the new fare system was widely available, just as it did after the MetroCard was introduced.

He called the new fare system “a real win-win and an important step for the M.T.A. to be taking.”

The transit agency has been talking for years about replacing the MetroCard, which made its debut when Bill Clinton was president. The basic fare then was $1.25 — $1.50 less than it is now and $1.75 less than with a single-ride MetroCard.

The transit agency ran a pilot program for a successor to the MetroCard in 2006. Officials hoped to do away with MetroCards by 2012 and believed that contactless bank cards would be the way to the future. But while such cards were popular in Europe, they did not immediately catch on in this country.

The transit authority sought bids for the new system and chose Cubic Transportation Systems, the company behind the MetroCard, from among five proposals. Monday’s vote by the transit authority’s finance committee sends the new fare payment plan to the agency’s board for a final decision on Wednesday.

Cubic signed a licensing deal in 2016 with Transport for London, the transit agency for greater London, that allowed Cubic to take the technology developed for London to other cities.

But calls about New York’s new fare payment system, once it is installed, will be answered nearly 400 miles away, in Buffalo. Cubic plans to open a call center there, putting jobs in an area that is struggling economically but is important politically to state officials like Mr. Cuomo, who controls the transit agency.",New York to Replace MetroCard With Modern Way to Pay Transit Fares,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/nyregion/metrocard-subway-new-york.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

‘No One Knows What That Means’

Trevor Noah on Monday took up the cause of Representative Frederica Wilson, the Florida congresswoman who’s become embroiled in a war of words with the White House over President Trump’s call to a military widow. When the chief of staff, John Kelly, called Ms. Wilson “an empty barrel,” Mr. Noah had a sharp comeback at the ready.

“Wow. Where I come from you don’t call someone an empty barrel. Because no one knows what that means.” — TREVOR NOAH

In an address to reporters, Mr. Kelly went on to accuse Ms. Wilson of grandstanding at an event two years earlier, but a tape of the event seemed to disprove his account. Mr. Noah said he owed her an apology.

“People don’t realize, but she’s not only a four-term congresswoman. She’s a former educator with a master’s degree. She was a member of the Florida State Legislature. And she also founded the 5,000-people Role Models program. The same program that helped a young man named La David Johnson graduate from Miami public schools to become a celebrated Green Beret. So, she’s not an empty barrel; she’s someone who deserves an apology.” — TREVOR NOAH

What Did Bush Say to Obama?

At a benefit for victims of recent hurricanes, President George W. Bush leaned over at one point and muttered something to President Barack Obama that made him crack up. We may never know what it was — but Stephen Colbert has a few guesses.

“Hey, were you born in Kenya?” “Twenty bucks if you pants Clinton right now.” “Yo, real quick — where’s Puerto Rico?” “This morning, I painted a Shih Tzu.”

The Punchiest Punchlines (J.F.K. Files Edition)

“President Trump announced that he’s releasing thousands of files on J.F.K., even though they were already set to be released. And he said, ‘Not only that, I’m declaring Oct. 31 Halloween.’” — JIMMY FALLON “Because Lee Harvey Oswald took a mysterious trip to Mexico weeks before the assassination, some historians are concerned that the documents could be damaging to U.S.-Mexico relations. Oh, I think that ship has sailed.” — STEPHEN COLBERT

“These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty.","Silent clues to a violent past are buried among the scores of mass graves that dot Chungui district in the mountainous Ayacucho region of Peru. There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

Photo

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

Photo

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Jeff Chen is back with a surprisingly straightforward puzzle, which made me wonder if he was secretly taking us for a ride. His puzzles have had some pretty neat gimmicks in them, so when I see a list theme from him, my first thought is that perhaps he is pulling the old bluff on us.

Today’s Theme

It’s actually a list theme, but it’s a tight one. A total of four, two-word phrases each have a synonym for “victim” as their first word, and the CON MEN who target them are hiding away at 43D. For example, at 30A, the answer to “A mere pittance” is CHUMP CHANGE and, at 40A, the answer to the clue “Unexpected hit” is SUCKER PUNCH.

Tricky Clues

21A: A “Person setting the stage?” could be a narrator, but today it’s a ROADIE setting up for a concert.

57A: This puzzle was one of the entries in the Westchester Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and quite a few of the solvers were bamboozled by the spelling of MARK ANTONY with a ‘K.’ Many contestants thought that his name was spelled with a ‘C,’ but it’s not. And you have that easy crossing of PORKY’S to confirm.

23D: My first reaction to IBANKER was “What? No!” but it’s a thing.

37D: UNDEROOS were haute couture when The Boy was a wee one. He preferred the Batman ones.

Constructor Notes

My mother-in-law’s name is Patsy and I’m a big fan of Patsy Cline — “Walkin’ After Midnight” is one of my favorites. Not hard to see where I got the idea for the puzzle. What is hard to see is PATSY CLINE in the grid. She could have gone where PIGEON COOP is, but my mother-in-law in a crossword where PATSY is associated with CHUMP, SUCKER, and MARK ... hmm.

Probably not good for your marriage, Mr. Chen. Or your life.

After The New York Times revealed sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein, thousands of women across the nation stepped forward to recount their own stories, reviving the decade-old #MeToo campaign on Twitter and Facebook and lending their voices to a new campaign against harassment, abuse and discrimination in the workplace. The new voices came from Hollywood stars, California lawmakers and the Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney — but also from lesser-known voices across industries, political affiliations and generations.

“It is unacceptable if even one of you feels you cannot voice a concern about inappropriate workplace conduct,” Ms. White wrote. “Let’s collectively ensure that we have a zero-tolerance policy toward harassment of any kind.”

The Times-Picayune investigation revealed that at least two women had filed complaints with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

In one, an employee who was not named accused Mr. Besh of pressuring her “to submit to his sexual overtures,” the newspaper reported. She said that, during a work trip, he encouraged her to drink heavily and later “overwhelmed” her in her hotel room where he “engaged in oral sex and fell asleep.”

In a statement, Mr. Besh said there had been a “consensual” relationship.

In Australia, the government is vexed by what it sees as Beijing’s interference in domestic politics. In Europe, politicians are raising an alarm over heavy-handed trade tactics aimed at acquiring foreign technology. In Southeast Asia and Africa, there are complaints about a new era of Chinese colonialism.

China’s ties with two regional heavyweights — Japan and India — remain strained, and Mr. Xi faces an unusually precarious situation on the Korean Peninsula, with both the North and the South defying him, one building a nuclear arsenal and the other deploying American missile defenses.

Still, in a marathon opening speech last week, Mr. Xi showed no sign of retreat and hinted at even bigger spending to vault China to world greatness: more for the military to make it a first-class fighting outfit with global reach, and more for his overseas infrastructure program, the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, which he sees as a way to win friends around the world.

Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China’s economic reforms that started in the late 1970s, set a policy of keeping a low profile in international affairs and biding time. But more than his predecessors, Mr. Xi is abandoning that approach — and encountering pushback.

In Germany, a sharp increase in Chinese investment has prompted complaints that China is closing its markets even as it goes on a buying spree abroad, especially of valuable technology companies. Policy makers are considering options for retaliating.

There are also concerns that China is trying to divide the European Union by cultivating poorer countries like Hungary and Greece and using them to block policies supported by richer countries that hurt Beijing.

Rising powers always face resistance. But in China’s case, that pushback comes not just from the West but also from neighbors who remember the tributary system of its imperial past — or are wary of its Communist political system despite its embrace of capitalism decades ago.

Mr. Xi has made inroads in Southeast Asia, gaining influence in Myanmar, Malaysia and Thailand. But improving ties with Myanmar’s civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, have been offset by the deep popular mistrust of China in that country.

In Malaysia, Beijing’s investments in infrastructure have been met with accusations that the nation is selling off its sovereignty. And in Thailand, a rail project important to a new trade route from southern China has been delayed by haggling over costs.

In Vietnam, China’s efforts to take advantage of Mr. Trump’s neglect have fallen short, said Prof. Alexander L. Vuving of the Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu. “Xi’s pressure in the midst of a weakening U.S. commitment has forced some concessions but it has also deepened Hanoi’s mistrust of Beijing,” Professor Vuving said.

Even in the Philippines, where the strongman president Rodrigo Duterte has cozied up to Beijing and distanced himself from the United States, Mr. Xi has not enjoyed a complete victory. American drones and spy planes have been more decisive in Mr. Duterte’s battle against Islamic militants than the rifles donated by China.

“The quantities of arms sent are not significant compared to the amount needed by the armed forces and the police,” said Roilo Golez, a former congressman. “Five thousand rifles are very minimal and token.”

Mr. Xi has sometimes succeeded in positioning China as a responsible power by stepping up when Washington has stepped back — speaking up for globalization at Davos, or in favor of the Paris climate change accord.

“People are paying far more attention to China’s influence operations than I have seen before,” said Dan Blumenthal, director of Asian studies at the American Enterprise Institute.

But Beijing has also struggled to sway global opinion without resorting to heavy-handed methods or threats that can be counterproductive.

In Australia, which China has sought to use as a kind of pilot zone to test methods that could be adopted in the United States and Europe, Mr. Xi has already encountered a backlash.

China has encouraged Chinese businessmen to give to political campaigns, recruited Chinese students to press its policies in classrooms and mobilized local Chinese-language news media.

In a thinly disguised warning this month, Australia’s intelligence chief, Duncan Lewis, described such activities as “a threat to our sovereignty, the integrity of our national institutions and the exercise of our citizens’ rights.”

Analysts say Australia has been a tempting target because China is its biggest trading partner, and it is home to large populations of Chinese immigrants and students, who provide critical financial support to its universities.

But the government is now considering new limits on campaign contributions, restrictions on foreign investments and tougher counterintelligence laws. Australia is also seeking to strengthen security ties with India and Japan.

“The Chinese party-state has overplayed its hand in trying to influence Australia’s choices,” said Rory Medcalf, head of the national security college at the Australian National University.

Concern about political interference by China is also growing in New Zealand, where a Chinese official recently advised Chinese-language journalists to coordinate coverage with China’s official press.

“I never imagined the level of instruction was that direct,” said Anne-Marie Brady, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, who recently published a research paper on Beijing’s efforts in New Zealand.

Mr. Shi, the international relations professor, said President Trump’s “negative attitude toward liberal world trade and climate change” had emboldened Mr. Xi to take a more active role on the global stage.

“If you have a child who is at risk for serious complications of certain infections, like flu, you don’t want them waiting in the waiting room,” Dr. Jackson said.
Again, ask if you can come at a particular time when you can go right into an exam room.","But concerned parents don’t necessarily have to stay in the waiting room, she said; you can check with the desk about how long it’s likely to be and then take a walk or wait in the car, and ask the staff to call your cellphone when it’s your child’s turn.

The policy also provides guidelines for cleaning exam rooms in between patients, disinfecting equipment (including wiping stethoscopes with alcohol), cleaning up after any spills involving body fluids, and general housekeeping. (Certain infections require more than just cleaning, of course; if a child has measles or chickenpox, we have to track down everyone who was exposed and offer specific protections to those who aren’t fully immunized, and measles is so infectious that cleaning the room isn’t enough — we actually have to leave it empty for a while to get rid of the risk.)

Parents might want to ask about infection control when they are choosing a pediatrician, Dr. Jackson said. Look to see that surfaces and toys look easy to clean, that tissues and a place to dispose of tissues are provided, that hand sanitizer is easily accessible.

You might also want to ask how the practice handles children who are not adequately immunized, and whether they are kept out of the waiting room when they’re sick.

Ask, “How do you triage? What does your waiting room look like? Are your health care workers immunized against influenza? Do you have a policy for infection control?” she said.

No matter where we start, we always come back to good hand-washing or the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer. “Hand hygiene at all levels” is critical, said Dr. Mobeen H. Rathore, the lead author on the policy statement, who is a professor of pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Jacksonville, and the chief of pediatric infectious disease at Wolfson Children’s Hospital. Parents should be vigilant, he said, “teaching their children hand hygiene, practicing their own hand hygiene, insisting health care providers practice hand hygiene — it’s O.K. to ask.”

And then there is what we now refer to as “cough etiquette,” that is, covering a cough, coughing into your elbow rather than your hand, and, yes, again, practicing hand hygiene after wiping your nose or dealing with a cough.

But while infection control in the waiting room and the exam room are important, the best ways to protect your child actually go back well before that trip to the doctor. First and foremost, make sure your child is fully immunized, including getting the annual influenza vaccine as soon as it’s available. Yes, I know, that means going to the doctor’s office, but it’s still the most crucial thing you can do, and if you get the flu shot early in the season, your child will have had time to generate a full immune response before there’s a lot of flu going around.

And if the bad thing happens, in spite of everyone’s best efforts, and there’s that dreaded waiting room exposure for a very contagious disease like measles or chickenpox, you at least want to be one of the people who was there with a fully immunized child. “There’s nothing better than giving your child vaccines to prevent infections,” Dr. Rathore said.

More immediately, for any given visit to the doctor, good infection control precautions start before you actually come in, and they involve both the parent and the pediatric office staff. The people you talk to on the phone should have the training they need to ask you if there are concerning symptoms — a funny rash, a fever, a bad cough — which suggest that your child should not spend any time in the waiting room.

If you have a sick child, make sure to explain the symptoms when you make the appointment, and tell the staff if there are additional details that might raise the odds that it’s something contagious (recent return from exotic travel, exposure to someone with a known infection, child not properly immunized). Maybe they can put you into an exam room right away or have you come at the very beginning or the very end of the day.

“We had a case very recently, a parent who called us, said the child may have chickenpox,” Dr. Rathore said. “We asked them not to bring the child in to the clinic. We looked at the child outside.”

If you have a child who is particularly vulnerable to infections, you might ask whether there is a way to minimize time in the waiting room, especially during the winter months. Some practices try to batch the well child checkups, or the newborn and young-infant checkups, for example, so that there are certain hours or days when the waiting room and exam rooms are dedicated to infants, too young to be fully immunized (we don’t start giving flu shots till 6 months, and babies born premature are especially vulnerable to respiratory infections).

Mayor Edward I. Koch compared the attack to a lynching.

After one participant testified for the prosecution, Mr. Lester, who had pleaded not guilty, was convicted of second-degree manslaughter and first-degree assault. He was sentenced in 1988 to the maximum prison term, 10 to 30 years. Two others were convicted of manslaughter as well.

In state prison, Mr. Lester earned a general equivalency diploma and an associate college degree in business administration. He learned to play the guitar and composed an ode to Mr. Griffith’s mother.

In 2001, grown by then to 5 feet 10 inches tall and 170 pounds, Mr. Lester was paroled and deported back to Britain, where he had lived until he was 14 before immigrating to the United States with his siblings, mother and stepfather.

In England he moved in briefly with his father, who had remained there after the others left for New York. He got a menial factory job, earned a degree in engineering and started his own electrical services company. He went on to live with a woman in Ashton-Under-Lyne, a town on the River Tame in Greater Manchester, and had three children with her.

Mr. Lester died on Aug. 14. Though the Coroners Service for the Manchester South District said on Monday that the cause was still under investigation, the family said it was suicide. Mr. Lester was 48.

“He suffered from depression due to the fact that he was wrongly convicted,” his sister Jayne Lester said in a telephone interview from Florida, where she lives. “He was just tormented. He was never the same person.”

Her brother was haunted by “guilt dreams,” she said, but was not a coldblooded killer.

“He really wasn’t a bad person the way they made him out to be,” she said. “He wouldn’t tell on anybody, and they had to blame someone.”

Jonathan Louis Lester was born on July 6, 1969, in Wales to John Lester and the former Jean Pollard.

The Life Events listing on his Facebook page consists of only two dates: 1984, when he started John Adams High School in Queens, and 1987, when he said he left school.

He is survived by his parents; two sisters, Julia and Jayne; a stepbrother, Peter; and his three young children. His mother, who also lives in Florida, remarried and is now known as Jean Holmes.

“What happened in Howard Beach — and make no mistake about it, no ifs, ands or buts about it — it was a racial incident that triggered off this violence,” Justice Thomas A. Demakos said in sentencing Mr. Lester in New York State Supreme Court in Queens.

Declaring that Mr. Lester showed “no remorse, no sense of guilt, no shame, no fear,” the judge asked, “What kind of individual do I have before me, who, after witnessing a young black man get crushed by a car, continues his reckless conduct by savagely beating another black male with a bat?”

Jason Ladone and Scott Kern were also convicted of manslaughter in the attack. Mr. Ladone was released in 2000, Mr. Kern in 2002.

Mr. Sandiford, who, like Mr. Griffith, was from Brooklyn, survived the beating. He married Mr. Griffith’s mother, Jean, and died of AIDS in 1991.

“In my heart I’m sorry to hear of his death,” Mr. Griffith’s mother, now Jean Griffith Sandiford, said of Mr. Lester in a telephone interview on Monday. “Regardless of what happened, I always forgave them.”

Mr. Lester later admitted to beating Mr. Sandiford with the bat. But he did not chase Mr. Griffith onto the highway, he told The Daily News in 1996, and was unaware while pursuing Mr. Sandiford that Mr. Griffith had been struck by a car.

He added, however: “I accept responsibility for Michael Griffith’s death. If we hadn’t chased him, he wouldn’t have died.”

Charles J. Hynes, the special prosecutor in the case, rejected Mr. Lester’s version of events and expressed dismay at his release from prison after he had been rejected four times for parole.

“Jon Lester can try and rewrite history all he wants,” Mr. Hynes wrote in an email on Monday. “Some would say 15 years’ imprisonment is significant punishment, but after 15 years he was alive, and Michael Griffith is dead.”

During those 15 years, mostly at Wende Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison near Buffalo, and the Sullivan Correctional Facility in Fallsburg, N.Y., in Sullivan County, Mr. Lester studied and counseled other prisoners on anger management.

In jailhouse interviews and shortly after his release, he insisted that he had never been a racist and expressed regret for the attack, something the sentencing judge said he had failed to do after his conviction.

“I was just a typical cocky teenager who got involved in a situation which I couldn’t control,” he told the British newspaper The Sunday Mirror in 2001.

“I’m not that baby-faced thug anymore,” he told The Daily News.

“I’m responsible for someone being dead,” he said in an interview with The Times Herald-Record of Middletown, N.Y. “I can never undo that, and I will live with it every day forever.”

Mr. Lester remembered reading that Mr. Griffith had two sisters.

“I have two sisters,” he told The News. “It was Christmas week. I thought I had ruined Christmas. I had probably ruined Christmas forever. I had probably ruined Christmas for the Griffith family forever, too.”

He emerged from prison scarred from fights with fellow inmates, who he said had attacked him, and armed with a business degree, which he had earned from Sullivan County Community College with a straight-A average. He had also recovered from Crohn’s disease, a bowel disorder that required several operations.

After returning to England, he attended Stockport College in Manchester before starting his electrical services business.

“In his last days he was a successful and caring businessman with a high degree of integrity who tried to live his life and give back to society,” his sister Jayne Lester said. “He always regarded the Howard Beach case as a huge tragedy to everyone involved.”

She added, “The fact that he couldn’t come back to America is basically what killed him, because he couldn’t be with his family.”

Mr. Lester’s family did not publish an obituary; his sister announced the death on Facebook. Among those who expressed condolences online was Victoria Gotti, a former neighbor and the daughter of the deceased Mafia boss John Gotti.

Ms. Lester said she had returned from England a few weeks ago with her brother’s ashes.

“At last,” she wrote, “he will be at rest in the U.S.A. Where his heart was and always wanted to be.”","Jon Lester, Convicted in Howard Beach Race Attack, Dies at 48",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/obituaries/jon-lester-convicted-in-howard-beach-race-attack-dies-at-48.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

More than two years after the New York City police officer Brian Moore was fatally shot while on patrol in Queens, his fellow officers relived that night, as testimony began on Monday in the trial of the man prosecutors say killed him with two bullets to the head from a silver revolver.

With the slain officer’s mother and father listening, officers who were on the scene testified in State Supreme Court in Queens, recounting the events of May 2, 2015, of watching as the young officer was shot and trying to save him.

Officer Moore’s partner, Erik Jansen, described how a routine patrol in Queens Village turned deadly. Officer Moore pulled the car up alongside a man who appeared to be trying to evade the officers’ sights and asked the man what he had on him.

Seconds later, three shots rang out.

They both ducked, Officer Jansen said, and he dove from the car, rolling onto the gravel outside. While on the ground, he radioed for help. When he stood up, he saw his partner slumped toward the passenger side, unresponsive. He took off his shirt, he said, and held it to the back of Officer Moore’s head. “I kept trying to tell him to wake up,” he explained to the jurors and the prosecutor, Daniel Saunders.

At that point, Mr. Saunders asked Officer Jansen to look around the courtroom. Could he point out who had fired the shots, Mr. Saunders asked. Officer Jansen stood up.

The holders of such power tend to be men, who have evaded accountability, let alone atonement, who have, over and over, proved impervious to receipts.
But it means something that we’re even talking about “receipts” as an emblem of an era.","A receipt used to refer to something material — physical proof of a transaction that was usually financial. Anyone who has ever filed an expense report can attest to how easy they are to lose. Phone technology has simplified our relationship to the receipt as a material thing. Uploading scraps of paper to an app, say, helps maintain blood pressure and sanity. That same technology has nudged receipts into the realm of metaphysics. They’re as much conceptual now as they are illegible wads in the Bermuda Triangle of a purse or a pair of jeans, kept by your accountant but by the cosmos too. Receipts are a confirmation of the truth, a corroboration of hypocrisy. And they’re fast — faster than that FOIA request, faster than a special-counsel investigation. Receipts are comeuppance by way of the H.O.V. lane.

Three days after the Weinstein story broke in The Times, Donald Trump Jr. dug up a 2015 tweet by the documentary filmmaker Michael Moore that called Weinstein “one of the best people to work with in this town” and tweeted, “This didn’t age well.” In response, a torrent of receipts flooded Trump Jr.’s post, including a cover of The New York Daily News that mocked his father for bragging about groping women and a party photo of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner smiling happily with Weinstein. Those receipts told the pot it was calling the wrong kettle black.

Receipts as a stand-in for legal and legislative or even personal justice have a robust and varied life in popular culture, where they’re evidence admissible in the court of beef. Just about the best laugh anybody has given me all year comes halfway through Katy Perry’s song “Swish Swish.” It’s a nominal dis track delivered with the whimsical illogic of certain nursery rhymes. At the end of the second verse, Perry lifts her pettiness to a spiritual plane. “You’re ’bout as cute as/An old coupon expired/And karma’s not a liar.” That’s not the funny part. That’s just Perry doing her stabbing with a spork. The funny part is how she knows karma tells the truth: “She keeps receipts.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“Swish Swish” was aimed, apparently, at Katy Perry’s foe Taylor Swift, who claimed last year that Kanye West lied that she’d signed off on his song “Famous,” in which he boasts “I made that bitch famous.” Her public display of outrage lasted a few months. Then West’s wife, Kim Kardashian, posted to Snapchat a video of West talking with Swift on the phone about the song that contradicted Swift’s claim, inspiring GQ’s Jake Woolf to note, in an article on the scandalette: “She does, in fact, have the damn receipts.”

The stakes for the receipts era might seem tastelessly low. But receipts can also implicate more broadly. During the denouement of the “Famous” affair, Slate’s Katy Waldman wrote, “The receipt boom registers a shift in our society: Where the powerful once exercised their power with relative impunity, now we might be seeing glimmers of accountability.” Well, almost no one who has been presented with receipts has copped to being culpable. So if we are not yet seeing actual accountability, then at the very least there is shame, and for the receipt holder, righteousness.

Or just glimmers of reason. “Receipts” enjoy a robust social-media life as a visual contradiction of anyone from pop stars to our president. The side-by-side comparisons tweeted in January, by the National Park Service, of the crowds at Barack Obama’s 2008 swearing-in and Donald Trump’s this year refuted President Trump’s claim that his were bigger. The Park Service’s tweet was deleted from its account, but its image lived on elsewhere as a kind of ghost receipt for whenever Trump and some of his staff bragged about historic inauguration attendance. In September, after the president deleted some tweets praising Luther Strange, the incumbent Senate candidate from Alabama who went on to lose the special-election primary runoff, speculation ensued about whether it was illegal for Trump to expunge those tweets. The news organization ProPublica archives them all, but the act of erasing any would seem to make such tweets even more valid as receipts.

Receipts represent a kind of extralegal self-sufficiency. You may not need an attorney general if you can take a screen shot. “Receipts” can even act as a kind of racial relief, as a lightening of the burden of proof. There’s a long history of white Americans needing no proof to accuse black Americans of having committed a crime, while blacks could never seem to find enough. “Receipts” may not be capable of delivering judicial justice. But they’re certainly useful for exposing all manner of injustice, like an eyewitness video of an unarmed black man’s being shot and killed by the police that is shared with the world because it contradicts the officer’s version of events.

The author Ta-Nehisi Coates has spoken about history being the ultimate kind of receipt in that it confirms centuries of claims of racial injustice. In a conversation earlier this month at the New School in New York, he discussed his experience with Clyde Ross, the moral anchor of Coates’s 2014 essay, “The Case for Reparations,” and how critical certain kinds of proof are to changing the way you see the world. Ross’s accounts of discrimination were evidence of a legacy of American racism. “Clyde Ross,” Coates said, “gave me the receipts.”

This modern cast of “receipt” hails from a tragic source, the same well that also gave us such infectious expressions of trouble as “Hell to the no” and “Crack is whack.” It hails from Whitney Houston. In 2002, before the release of a new album (“Just Whitney”), Houston sat down for an interview with Diane Sawyer, who voiced concern about Houston’s rumored drug use. She mentions a news item claiming a $730,000 drug habit. Houston is incredulous. “Come on,” she says, with more aggrieved Chicagoan in her voice than you’d expect from a Jersey girl. “730? I wish.” Then she lets out a hoarse, sputtering laugh: “I wish whoever’s making that kind of money off of me could share it with me.” Then she stops laughing. “No way. I want to see the receipts,” she says before a pause and some agitation. “From the drug dealer I bought $730,000 worth of drugs from: I want to see the receipts.” Her pique was a quietly comic performance of umbrage — one she couldn’t sustain. Shortly after, she confesses to Sawyer. It’s gutting.

Houston is talking about her life, but it has always felt to me as if she’s really talking about the way the music business warped and misused her. Of course she was on drugs. But the people around her looked the other way, while demanding more of her, sober or not. With Sawyer, Houston was cool, but watching the conversation now, you can sense a more desperate anger. Showbiz cannibals and a greedy celebrity press were chewing her up. A decade before the overdose that killed her, Houston was talking about America, the way its power has devoured black people and women — sometimes for money, sometimes for sport, sometimes for nothing. She was the receipt.

The holders of such power tend to be men, who have evaded accountability, let alone atonement, who have, over and over, proved impervious to receipts. But it means something that we’re even talking about “receipts” as an emblem of an era. It means we bought something that isn’t working. And we’re determined to keep pointing out how defective it is.","In These Lying Times, ‘Receipts’ Offer a Glimmer of Justice",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/magazine/in-these-lying-times-receipts-offer-a-glimmer-of-justice.html

To do that, they must contain the revenue losses from reducing tax rates, both over the next decade and in the years to follow.

The party’s most difficult fights will be over how to do that — by some combination of eliminating popular tax breaks and employing accounting maneuvers, such as setting some tax cuts to expire, in order to reduce revenue losses.

Mr. Corker stands as a possible impediment to that plan. A longstanding opponent of rising federal deficits, the senator has said he will not vote for any tax bill that would increase the federal debt by a dollar. But on Thursday, the House is expected to give final approval to a budget blueprint that would protect a 10-year, $1.5 trillion tax measure from a Democratic filibuster.

A Treasury Department report released on Friday showed that the budget deficit for fiscal 2017 grew by $80 billion, to $666 billion, as federal spending eclipsed revenues and economic growth remained tepid. At the same time, Congress is contemplating what the president has promised would be the largest tax cut in history.

The protracted Tuesday-morning brawl quickly spread from taxes and debt to foreign policy and the president’s fitness for office.

Mr. Corker said Mr. Trump was “absolutely not” a role model for the children in America.

“I don’t know why he lowers himself to such a low, low standard and is debasing our country,” Mr. Corker said in a CNN interview, suggesting that he will soon convene hearings to examine the ways Mr. Trump “purposely has been breaking down relationships around the world.”

“It’s unfortunate that our nation finds itself in this place,” he added.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Corker have been locked in a public feud for weeks. Mr. Corker has said that Mr. Trump runs his White House like a reality TV show, and Mr. Trump has responded by mocking Mr. Corker’s height, calling him “Liddle’ Bob.”

Mr. Trump has made declarations about the tax plan while the legislation is still being drafted. On Monday, Mr. Trump said the plan would not include any changes to how much Americans can save in tax-deferred retirement plans like 401(k) accounts.

“Hopefully the White House will step aside and let that occur in a normal process,” Mr. Corker said on NBC’s “Today.”

Any tax plan would need all the Republican support Mr. Trump can get in the Senate, and his fight with Mr. Corker puts that support in jeopardy.

“I think it’s fine for him to come over,” Mr. Corker said of the president’s visit to Capitol Hill. “I do look at these things as more of a photo op. They’re not really about substance, but more power to him.”

The Republicans have promised the most sweeping revision of the tax code in decades, a challenging task that has already met Democratic opposition.

We ate our last meal there before heading out of the city toward the vast tea estates and spice gardens that lace the Cardamom Hills of Kerala.

To get there, we spent nearly five hours in a van grinding our way up the steep hills of the Western Ghats, stopping only for plates of vegetable curry and glasses of fresh pineapple juice. The road narrowed as we worked our way past wildlife sanctuaries and forests of sandalwood. The oppressive mugginess of the city had lifted, giving way to weather cool enough that I considered digging out the one light sweater I brought. Tea estates cascaded down the steep valleys, their tight, trimmed shrubs looking as manicured as a formal English garden.

Manoj Vasudevan, a photographer who teaches tourism in Kerala and who has been exploring the mountains here for decades, was our guide. That included explaining the finer points of mountain driving in India, which required faith, acceptance and a good horn.

The strips of pavement hugging the mountainside were often only wide enough to hold one vehicle, but sometimes three would try to navigate a stretch at once. Horns were essential to blast our gentle warnings on blind curves. Inevitable traffic knots that brought traffic to a stop were solved when a driver or a passenger would hop out and calmly direct cars and buses to back up or edge around each other. Everyone would then head on without a harsh word or even a friendly wave.

Many of the sprawling tea estates we passed are owned by Tata Global Beverages, which maintains 51 estates in India and Sri Lanka.

Soon, we were back on the road headed for the heart of spice country. Small spice gardens started to pop up the way “u-pick” apple orchards do in upstate New York. Some offer tours for a couple of hundred rupees, about $3. Others declare themselves to be organic, and have small shops where packets of vibrant ground turmeric, nutmeg and green cardamom pods can be had for prices that would make a cook used to prices at an American grocery store fall to her knees.

Touring spice gardens is a fairly new pursuit here, driven by an increasing appreciation of agriculture and cooking among tourists.

“Twenty years ago when I traveled this way there was not even a single place,” Mr. Vasudevan said. “Ten years ago there were maybe a few places. Now, they’re all over. Somebody started it then everyone started copying it because they saw that people were becoming curious to see how spices grow.”

Photo

And then there’s black pepper. From the time of the Roman Empire, people have been coming to Kerala for black pepper. Wars have been fought over it. The plants that produce the fruit are everywhere. Their thin green vines wrap around jackfruit, mango and coconut trees that grow with such abandon they don’t seem to need a bit of human effort to thrive.

Cardomom is a big money maker here, but black pepper remains the coin of the realm. Even though Indian pepper growers are fighting off cheaper production in countries like Vietnam, there are still plenty of wealthy owners who oversee vast plots of pepper plants. But in every village and small town, you can find someone who grows a little pepper and sells a few kilos when a bill comes due or there’s a wedding to fund. About 30 percent of the people who live here are involved in the spice trade, Mr. Vasudevan estimated.

Ms. Gomez and I found our way to a small, organic spice garden in Thekkady where Thomas Puttampurakkal, a retired Kerala police officer in his 80s, tends to pepper vines that twist around jackfruit and nutmeg trees growing in what seems to be an agricultural system with no real pattern or structure.

He uses only elephant dung for fertilizer. Pepper, he explained, is all about terroir. The best grows naturally here in the high elevations, the green berries protected by the shade until they ripen.

The green pepper berries become black pepper after they spend four or five days in the sun. Those same green berries can also produce white pepper, whose pungency is softened by a long soak in water before they are dried and their husks removed.

Ms. Gomez and I wandered through Mr. Puttampurakkal’s spice garden like kids in a toy store. We rubbed curry leaves between our fingers and dug up turmeric roots. We searched around the bottom of willowy cardamom stalks 12 feet tall, looking for green buds. We sucked the custardy pulp off the seeds inside cacao pods, smelled clove buds and peeled a bit of bark from a cinnamon tree.

We found a nutmeg tree and pulled down a round piece of fruit the size of my palm. Someone had a knife, so we sliced it open to reveal a glossy dark gem covered in a lacy red coat. The seed is nutmeg, the red covering mace.

In the little shop Mr. Puttampurakkal runs, I bought bags of the small, local black Malabar peppercorns locals call tribal pepper and another of the fat, fragrant peppercorns called Tellicherry, named after the famed growing region in Northern Kerala.

I bit into one. It tasted like citrus and flowers. In a split-second, heat overtook the flavor, like hot perfume in my mouth.

Ms. Gomez wandered in, her hands filled with nutmeg. “You have no idea how excited I am,” she said.

Photo

Mr. Puttampurakkal was laughing, probably at us. It was hard to tell. It didn’t matter.

I had made it to the Cardamom hills. Ms. Gomez was right. It was God’s own country. Or, at least, a cook’s.

If You Go

Kerala is always warm, but can get downright hot and muggy from March to May. December through February is reliably dry and cooler, and also more crowded. The monsoon season comes in May and can last until November. The mountains with their spice gardens and teas estates are always cooler than the coast. It’s relatively easy to rent a car or van with a driver, or take a small tour bus to the spice and tea regions. Car rentals are available, too.

Tea fans can visit the Briar Tea Bungalows (V-363, Kannan Devan Hills Village, Talliar post, Idukki; teabungalows.com/talayar-valley-bungalow-munnar/) in the Talayar Valley in Munnar, where you can pick your own tea onthe 2,500-acre estate.

And I’d had a good time with him on “[A Little] Night Music.” Also, he’d been a mystery writer, you know. He was one of the most prolific mystery writers in America. He wrote (and co-wrote) under a pseudonym, Patrick Quentin.

Miranda: My favorite thing is bringing the song into the room to my collaborators. That’s my favorite part of the process. Not the writing of it, not even it being done. It’s the moment when I know my collaborators are going to make it better.

Sondheim: That’s my least favorite part of collaboration. Unless I really like what I’ve written.

Miranda: Oh?

Sondheim: Then I want to share it with a collaborator. But no, I don’t get that excitement that you get out of it, presenting it to collaborators. First of all, I only really do it with a book writer. I don’t with a director. I just don’t want to call in a director till it’s ready to present, and that means me and my collaborator. But you know, Lapine8 was the first one who actually made me give him unfinished songs. I never give unfinished songs.

Miranda: Did you find that valuable?

Sondheim: No, not particularly, but it was valuable to him.

Miranda: Well, it’s like being naked.

Sondheim: Exactly, and I don’t really mind that as long as I wash myself.

Miranda: You’re gonna show up naked sometimes.

Sondheim: You’ve got to have somebody who’ll surprise you and, you know, it’s the old lesson, you’ve got to work on something dangerous. You have to work on something that makes you uncertain. Something that makes you doubt yourself.

Miranda: Talk a bit about that danger and uncertainty.

Sondheim: Well, because it stimulates you to do things you haven’t done before. The whole thing is if you know where you’re going, you’ve gone, as the poet says. And that’s death. That leads to stultified writing and stultified shows.

Miranda: Since “Hamilton,” I have been pitched every historical era.

Sondheim: Of course! And so that’s the one thing you don’t want to do. After “Gypsy” I got nothing but backstage stories and I said, “The only thing I don’t want to write is anything to do with show business.” That’s the only thing.

SONDHEIM HAS CERTAINLY followed his own advice in this regard: His choice of subject matter over the last half-century of work demolishes any notions of the kinds of stories musical theater can tell. From a violent barber (“Sweeney Todd” with Hugh Wheeler) to ancient Roman farce (1962’s “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,” with librettists Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart) to fractured fairy tales (“Into the Woods” with James Lapine). Within this vast terrain, he and his collaborators have also radically experimented with the musical theater form: See the diptych structure of “Sunday in the Park With George,” also with Lapine, in which each act takes place a century apart, or the unprecedented “Company” (1970), with a book by George Furth, a meditation on commitment and monogamy, which Sondheim describes as a “non-plot” musical.” Here he is, arriving at the form of “Follies,” his legendary 1971 musical with librettist James Goldman about a reunion of retired performers from a 1930s Ziegfeldesque revue: “You start with the subject matter and some content and it takes form. If you’re going to say, ‘O.K., it’s a reunion party,’ well, hello, don’t try to give it a plot. And if you don’t give it a plot, what’s going to hold it together? Uh-oh. That’s what’s dangerous and that’s what’s scary about it.”

We gravitate toward the subject of surprise, both for the audience and for the playwright.

Sondheim: That was a big lesson from Peter Shaffer.9 We went to see a play once about the mad queen of Spain and in the first act there were two rapes, an evisceration, a fire and something horrifying with a child, I don’t remember. And at the end of the first act I said, “This is so much my kind of thing. Why am I bored?” He said, “There’s no surprise.” And I thought, “Put that on your bathroom mirror.” Surprise: if it’s in the lyric, the unexpected word, the unexpected note, the unexpected incident. The unexpected, the unexpected, that’s what theater is about. If you had to patent one thing in the theater, it’s surprise.

Miranda: Can you think of any times you’ve surprised yourself in the writing process?

Sondheim: Oh, come on, as a writer you’re always surprised when you think of the right note or the right word. You think, “Oh, I didn’t know I could — oh, that’s good!” You know, writing’s full of surprises for oneself. It comes with the territory, but this is a different kind of thing. This is surprising the audience —

Sondheim bats the question away. He’s either uninterested in recounting a specific time that he surprised himself while writing, or there have been so many that it’s impossible to pick: It comes with the territory.

Two years ago, I interviewed Sondheim and John Weidman together for a PBS documentary, but my favorite moment from the interview never aired. We were on the subject of “Finishing the Hat” from “Sunday in the Park With George,” one of Sondheim’s most celebrated songs, and maybe the greatest song ever written about the self-induced spell of the creative process.10 In this excerpt from that interview, just as in his work, Sondheim’s collaborator brought out the best in him:

Weidman: Do you remember you called me the night you finished that song?

Sondheim (smiling): Was I excited?

Weidman: You were ... beyond excited. I mean, it’s like you needed to call somebody. I may have been number 17 on the list, but I could hear it in your voice, you said, “I just wrote this song.”

Sondheim: Yeah, I remember, I wanted to tell everybody. [Laughs.] I wanted to tell everybody. I was really pleased.

Miranda: I love the story you told about the making of it in your book, about being inspired by a party game you were creating for Phyllis Newman’s party,11 and realizing you’d spent the entire night in a sort of trance —

Sondheim: I started planning that game at 8 o’clock in the evening, and when I looked up, it was 7 o’clock in the morning. I’m exaggerating, but not by much. Time had disappeared. That’s what happens — you must know that yourself. You must know that the great thing about writing and creating is, time disappears. You are in the moment, and the moment can go for eight hours or for two minutes, or whatever, until the phone rings, or you know, you have to go get something to eat.

PRESENT DAY again — I’m trying to give Sondheim credit for expanding the scope of the American musical, and he is passing on the credit to his mentor Oscar Hammerstein instead.

Miranda: Something that’s so essential about your work is that I think you have expanded the terrain of what musical theater can be. The notion of, “This is a musical, that’s not a musical,” is BS. It’s carried entirely by the passion of the creators.

Sondheim: Yeah, but Oscar invented that with “Oklahoma!” He took a play that was about homosexuality in the West and turned it into a sunny musical. Because he saw something in it that was beyond what Lynn Riggs12 had written, about the opening of territories, the promise of America. He saw that which anybody else reading that play would not have seen.

Miranda: O.K. But it gets back to the notion of, “If I can find myself in the work, others will see themselves.” So it’s about not being afraid of specificity.

Sondheim lights up.

Photo

Sondheim: Absolutely! That’s exactly what he taught me, when he criticized my poetic Hammerstein lyrics when I was starting out.13 He said, “That’s not what you feel. Don’t write what I feel. Write what you feel.” Oh! It had never occurred to me to write what I felt. And Oscar was the one who taught everyone to do that.

Write what you feel. Or as George’s muse, Dot, says to him in “Sunday,” “Anything you do,/Let it come from you./Then it will be new.”

And then for a moment you let in the depth and intensity and range of Stephen Sondheim’s feeling for the past half-century. That Tony and Maria of “West Side Story” first fell in love as Sondheim sharpened his Blackwing pencils, finding the words for their doomed romance at age 25. That Mrs. Lovett of “Sweeney Todd” hatched her diabolical plans from this writing couch as Sondheim talked to himself. That within Sondheim, somewhere, is both Georges Seurat and Fosca, Pseudolus and Mama Rose, John Wilkes Booth and Madame Armfeldt, Charley Kringas and Little Red Riding Hood. He has served up vodka stingers for Joanne (“Company”) and chrysanthemum tea for the Shogun (“Pacific Overtures”). Sixty years of iconic theatrical moments, and they exist as a result of the specific way Stephen Sondheim feels. Line by line, note by note, surprise by surprise.

And if you’re Sondheim, there are days like today, when you feel under the weather and the day is full of distractions. But there are also nights when you write “Finishing the Hat,” and you’re so proud of what you’ve made that you have to call a friend and say, “I just wrote this song.”

What’s important is that Sondheim is still here, staring down another deadline. Starting on a hat. Feeling his way toward the moment when time disappears.

Sondheim: You shouldn’t feel safe. You should feel, “I don’t know if I can write this.” That’s what I mean by dangerous, and I think that’s a good thing to do. Sacrifice something safe.

John Kelly, President Trump’s chief of staff, is grimly suited to addressing the family of a fallen service member. Mr. Kelly, a retired four-star general, is the highest-ranking officer to lose a child in Iraq or Afghanistan. His son Second Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in Afghanistan in 2010.

After more than 40 years with the Marines, Mr. Kelly possesses the gravitas and credibility on matters of military and public service that his boss does not. Which is perhaps why Mr. Trump consulted him for advice on how best to console Myeshia Johnson after her husband, Sgt. La David Johnson, was killed under still-unexplained circumstances in Niger.

Representative Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat and family friend, said Mr. Trump had upset Ms. Johnson by seeming to forget her husband’s name and by saying, in effect, that Sergeant Johnson knew what he was signing up for. Mr. Trump responded by attacking the congresswoman and insulting the family, insisting he’d said the right thing.

Mr. Kelly then weighed in at a media briefing on Thursday. One might have expected him to bring some dignity to this agonizing and confounding episode, putting things right with remarks chosen with the care for which he is known among his fellow service members. But after a passionate and moving recounting of Gold Star families’ trauma, he instead waded waist-deep into the morass Mr. Trump had created, insulting Ms. Wilson by accusing her of taking credit in 2015 for securing funding for a federal building in Miami named for two slain F.B.I. agents. He said she “stood up there and all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call he gave the money — the $20 million — to build the building.”

Maybe he simply misremembered what happened that day; we all make mistakes. But a video of the event subsequently showed that Ms. Wilson had made none of the string of boasts that Mr. Kelly put in her mouth.

Did Mr. Kelly quickly acknowledge his errors? No. Instead, in the days since, he and the White House have added to his mistakes by refusing to correct them.

“I honestly don’t think you can be close to any animals and not realize their very vivid personalities,” she said.

Clive Wynne, a professor and director of the Canine Science Collaboratory at Arizona State University in Tempe, who was not involved in the research, said the new study offered a “really rich picture” of the overlap among species.

Robert Latzman, an associate professor at Georgia State University, who was not involved in the study, said his research with chimpanzees in zoos has always left open the question of whether animals in the wild are somehow different.

“What’s exciting about these data is there’s some suggestion that wild apes look very similar to what we would expect in terms of basic dispositional traits and continuity of those traits — and I don’t mean just to captive chimpanzees, but to humans,” he said. “The work in the wild underscores how similar these animals truly are to humans.”

Alexander Weiss, who led the new study, said he was particularly interested in examining the personality traits of animals in the wild. His findings were in line with previous research he’s done on chimpanzees in captivity.

“The fact that we’re showing this consistency in the wild is nice, because it allows us to draw more general conclusions,” said Dr. Weiss, a senior lecturer at the University of Edinburgh. “It’s not just being in a zoo that’s causing these individual traits to be stable.”

The study’s underlying data will be made publicly available so other scientists can use them in their own research, he said.

Although most of the animals tested in 1973 had died by the time the recent analysis was conducted, the study also concluded that an animal’s personality traits were generally consistent over time.

Dr. Goodall said that fits what she’s seen, too. She only visits Gombe twice a year now, and only two animals are still alive from the days when she knew them as individuals. One, a mother of twins named Gremlin, has changed a bit, Dr. Goodall said.

“I think the main difference in her personality is she’s become more confident as she gets older, just like people do,” she said.

Dr. Goodall added that she’s pleased that researchers are still finding so much of interest at Gombe, and tapping into the expertise of Tanzanian field workers.

And, of course, she’s happy that the academic perspective has shifted from the time when she was told only humans had personalities, minds and emotions.

“Today you can get your Ph.D. studying animal personality. I think we’ve come around full-cycle,” she said. “It absolutely vindicates all that I’ve ever believed.”",Wild and Captive Chimpanzees Share Personality Traits With Humans,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/science/chimpanzees-goodall.html

But as negotiations between Amazon and local publishers continue, the major players are staying silent.","You know all those bespoke experiences that American urbanites have been reviving: the artisanal butcher and barber shops, the gourmet grocer and the community bookstore? In Australia, though weakened by shopping centers, they never really died.

This is still a place where many Australians can buy a novel, sausages and shampoo in three different shops, each owned by a neighbor with children at the local school.

Big box stores are rare and independent bookstores are strong: Their sales accounted for around 26 percent of Australia’s book business in 2015, according to Nielsen, up from 20 percent in the late 2000s, more than double the share for independents in the United States.

Romantics (and some booksellers) argue that Australians simply favor local offerings. Cynics (and some economists) argue that many Australians are just wealthy and complacent, unfamiliar with more convenient alternatives that they’ll eventually embrace and come to love.

Regardless, this much is clear: Amazon’s arrival is a stress test not just for individual retail categories but also for Australia’s own writing, and way of life.

“Our culture is, and all cultures are, being swamped by outside influences,” Mr. Rubbo said. “We’re fighting to defend our voice.”

What Do You Want and When Do You Want It?

Amazon’s first “fulfillment center” in Australia sits at the intersection of several highways about an hour south of central Melbourne. There are food companies and warehouses for Penguin Random House nearby, and inside, room for millions of products.

Union organizers say they are watching the location closely to ensure that new hires receive Australia’s minimum wage of roughly 18 Australian dollars, around $14.50. But on a recent visit, the warehouse was empty except for a few gray shelves in the middle of a gray floor. The only employees were construction workers clad in neon-green and finishing a bathroom.

What comes next is anyone’s guess. Amazon turned down requests for an interview, and did not respond to emails with specific questions.

The company is known for this sort of thing, preferring buzz to transparency, and here in Australia, that’s led to excitement for many who are hoping for an easier, much broader online shopping experience — along with real estate speculation in the warehouse market, the rollout of a new free delivery service by Australia’s postal service, and what the chief executive at one large retailing conglomerate described as “a healthy sense of paranoia.”

Booksellers know the feeling. Amazon hasn’t explained why it’s taken so long to bring its full retail operation to Australia but Australians have been able to order from Amazon’s American site for years and even with shipping costs, book prices are often equal to or cheaper than what can be found in Sydney or Melbourne.

There are other digital booksellers already in Australia too, including Book Depository, an Amazon subsidiary from Britain, and Booktopia, a start-up that nearly went public last year.

Tony Nash, the chief executive of Booktopia, which according to the company, controls about 4 percent of Australia’s book market, said that Amazon has already made everyone more competitive.

Booktopia, for example, now uses conveyors, automatic packing machines and a staff of 150 people to get books into customers’ hands, in some cases on the same day they’re ordered.

“It’s not about price,” Mr. Nash said. Especially in countries with small widely dispersed populations like Canada and Australia, where 24 million people are spread across a continent the size of the United States, “it’s about the logistics.”

But isolation, as Australians know better than most, can help and hurt.

Sean Guy, a manager at The Bookshop in Darwin, Australia’s northernmost major city, said if he lived in a more isolated community like Alice Springs, in the nation’s interior desert region, “I’d probably find it a lot easier to go online for five minutes than call the local bookshop.”

For most everyone else, he added, bricks-and-books still work.

“You’ll never be able to beat the prices of Amazon, but you can save on time by going into a store,” he said. “And people like supporting local businesses.”

Australians already buy more books per capita than Americans (based on Nielsen sales figures) and spend more hours reading.

Michael Heyward, the publisher at Text, an independent publisher with a mix of new and established Australian writers, including Helen Garner, said that maybe Australia’s built up enough independence to live with Amazon in peace.

“I would like to believe we can have our cake and eat it,” he said in an interview at his office in Melbourne.

But just below his own bookish calm — and the not-so-secret hope that Amazon will help sell more books — there are wider concerns.

“Let’s not outsource our minds to the narcissism of the global algorithm,” warned Anna Funder, the author of “Stasiland” and “All That I Am,” at a booksellers conference last year. And she’s not alone.

“People who work in the book industry are agents of culture rather than just instruments of commerce,” said Tim Winton, the author of Australian classics like “Cloudstreet,” and one of Australia’s best-known writers. “When you take away their role as agents of culture and reduce them to instruments of capitalism, it changes the dynamic.”

In interviews with more than a dozen booksellers, authors, independent publishers and lawyers specializing in copyright, two worst-case scenarios emerged.

One, widely considered the more likely, involves Amazon convincing Australia’s big publishers to provide steep discounts and promises of faster delivery, driving down prices and author royalties for all books, and possibly putting independent booksellers’ orders at the end of the line.

“Amazon controls the negotiating process,” said David Gaunt, the co-owner of Gleebooks in Sydney. “If they choose to sell the new Richard Flanagan book at $9.99,” he added, referring to Australia’s last winner of the Man Booker Prize, who has a new novel out, “we’ll sell none.”

The second nightmare scenario, according to booksellers and authors, is that Amazon will find a way to tilt Australia’s labor, tax and import laws in its favor.

Stock grants for employees could be used to decrease tax liability, as Amazon has done in Europe. What else Amazon might do is a question lawyers and consultants are already gaming out, while lobbying the Australian government, which at this point seems determined to protect its own.

Starting in July, a new digital services tax will be levied on all online purchases of 1,000 Australian dollars, or roughly $780, or less. Netflix, eBay and Amazon will all be affected.

Australian lawmakers have also resisted calls from economists on the government’s own Productivity Commission to eliminate the country’s parallel import restrictions. The rules essentially give Australian publishers a national monopoly over any book they publish. Booksellers are not allowed to import books from another country if the book has been published by an Australian copyright holder within 30 days of overseas release and if the Australian publisher can supply the book within 90 days.

Critics say the rules are protectionist, and a cause of overpriced books.

But these restrictions, copyright lawyers say, should keep Amazon from stocking its warehouses with cheaper books shipped in from abroad. And they are widely seen by authors as the foundation of Australia’s literary culture.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The copyright law that went into effect in May 1969 essentially created a protected market in a country that, until then, had relied almost entirely on Britain for its books.

Now, many authors say, any effort to soften the rules or let Amazon skirt them would weaken local publishers, reduce royalty rates and return Australia to a reliance on outsiders who may not care to publish the array of Australian authors now in circulation.

“What makes me anxious is this sort of return to a centralizing of cultural power,” said Mr. Winton, who has published more than two dozen books for adults and children. For Australia, he said, Amazon may represent a step backward: “It’s a retrograde move.”

Price vs. Personal Interaction

Inside the Readings flagship store on Lygon Street, Australian authors get prominent displays on front tables and on the first shelves people see.

At Riverbend Books in Brisbane, another independent bookseller well known to publishers and authors, roughly 60 percent of the books are written by Australians.

Photo

Would Amazon give local authors the same level of promotion? Will it publish and print its own books in Australia or make sellers of used books more dominant? Will it undermine or compete with the community ethos that bookstores like Readings represent?

“We have a lot of questions,” said Mr. Rubbo, 69, a quiet, casual man with intense blue eyes who has expanded Readings to seven locations in and around Melbourne over the past 41 years.

He said that since the arrival of Borders in 2002, Readings and many other bookstores have strengthened their bonds with local authors and readers. Events are now the norm; Readings will do 260 this year alone.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The strongest independent bookstores, while maintaining a 1990s feel at times, complete with racks of music CDs, are also linked up with universities and schools and Australia’s well-known writers festivals in Sydney, Melbourne and elsewhere.

Many customers, while open to buying some items from Amazon, seem pleased with the status quo for books. “I like seeing the physical book itself, and the chance to find things you wouldn’t find otherwise,” said Sonya Theys, 24, who was browsing at Readings one recent evening.

Authors are even more zealous. “If literature is a religion, the bookstore is the church,” said Alec Patric, an award-winning novelist who also happens to work at Readings. “It’s a delicate equilibrium.”

Amazon’s deals with publishers could upset all of that. Mr. Rubbo said he has pressed them to keep the playing field even, to not give Amazon any special treatment with delivery time or price.

Suzy Wilson, the owner of Riverbend, has made the same case to major Australian publishers. She said she was told not to fret. “They were giving me a bit of a pep talk really,” she said.

But as negotiations between Amazon and local publishers continue, the major players are staying silent. Penguin Random House and Hachette turned down requests for comment.

How well do air purifiers work?

In Mr. Heffernan’s in-depth test and review of HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Arrestance) air purifiers for Wirecutter, he found that on the whole, they are extremely effective at reducing the particle pollution in your home. Air purifiers capture small particles in the air that are generally not visible to the naked eye by trapping them in a dense mat of fine fibers.

To put it simply, they draw in polluted air, trap the particles, then blow out clean air.

In order to be HEPA certified, air filters have to remove 99.97 percent of particles that are exactly 0.3 microns in diameter — a size that’s especially difficult to filter mechanically. The models Wirecutter has tested were able to remove virtually all particles as small as 0.01 micron, one-thirtieth the HEPA standard.

Again, while the long-term effects of short-term smoke exposure may be low, any kind of particle pollution can still affect our health, and that pollution is more concentrated indoors — meaning nearly all of us can benefit from cleaner air.

“Most of us spend a lot of time indoors,” Mr. Heffernan said. “And indoor air is more polluted than outdoor air. It kind of comes down to what we have in our homes: pets, rugs, furniture that traps dust. And many homes are not terribly well ventilated.”

Especially if you’re older or have asthma or other respiratory conditions, you may want to consider an air purifier. All of the HEPA-certified models Mr. Heffernan tested with his colleague John Holecek were effective at removing particulate pollution.

For homes in smoke-prone areas, including those near wildfire-affected areas, Heffernan suggested running the purifier on high for an hour, then turning it down to medium or low, which should keep the amount of smoke in your home to a minimum.

How to choose an air purifier

When choosing an air purifier, it’s important to ensure first that the purifier is indeed HEPA certified; it’ll usually be listed as “true HEPA.” You’ll also want a model with a tight seal around the filter. “If it’s not well sealed, air is going to flow around the edges,” Mr. Heffernan said. “If it’s letting dirty air around the edges, you’re not getting the full effect.”

Some models may list a CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) rating. This measures the volume of air that will pass through the unit, telling you how efficiently the model will work depending on the size of the room. Mr. Heffernan suggested looking for a CADR rating of at least 200, which means the unit effectively delivers the equivalent of 200 cubic feet of pure air per minute.

These models are often recommended for smaller rooms of about 300 square feet, and they will cycle the air four to five times per hour in a room that size, ensuring that pollutants are filtered quickly. This isn’t to say a model with a 200 CADR rating won’t work in a larger room, but it will work more slowly.

If you’re looking for a more cost-effective solution, you can also upgrade your existing HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system to improve air quality.

HVAC systems come with basic filters that trap larger particles, like pet hair. You can upgrade your filter to one that traps smaller particles, as noted by the filter’s MERV rating, or Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value. This metric indicates how efficiently the filter will reduce particulates that pass through it.

The higher the number, the better the rating. According to the E.P.A., “Filters with a MERV between 7 and 13 are likely to be nearly as effective as true HEPA filters at controlling most airborne indoor particles.” There are also “whole house” purifiers that provide true HEPA filtration in HVAC systems, but these are expensive and may require upgrading your home’s air handler.

As effective as HEPA-certified air purifiers are, some come with dubious additional features. Many of them claim to produce ozone to destroy pathogens, which sounds impressive, but the California Air Resources Board warns against them. Ozone, or O3, is a respiratory system irritant that can cause health problems.

A 2008 ARB report said the “introduction of any amount of ozone into indoor spaces may result in increased levels of formaldehyde, ultrafine particles, and other pollutants.” In fact, if you are indeed in California, you may not even be able to order these types of units on Amazon.

Many purifiers claim to reduce VOCs, or volatile organic compounds, using an activated charcoal filter. “Very few of them actually do,” Mr. Heffernan added. “It comes down to the mass of the activated charcoal filter.” In order to be effective, the activated charcoal filter would have to be a minimum of five pounds to have any statistically significant effect, he said. Most contain a tiny fraction of that.

How to care for your air purifier

Maintenance of your air purifier should be minimal. Most HEPA filters are designed to run continuously for a year, though many manufacturers recommend checking them every six months. If there’s a fair amount of buildup on your filter, or you just want peace of mind, simply replace it.

Beyond purifying your air, there are additional precautions to take if you live in a smoke-adjacent area or you’re concerned about pollutants.

Many of these tips are common sense: Keep your windows closed, and avoid spending too much time outdoors to keep from bringing particulates into your home.

“I would also recommend simple tasks, like washing your sheets and pillowcases. You don’t want to spend eight to 10 hours on sheets filled with smoke,” Mr. Heffernan said. And if you’re planning to vacuum, remember that vacuuming can also kick up dust and smoke that has settled, so mopping may be a better approach.

Finally, if you’re using a paper face mask instead, or want one so you can go outside in a smoke-adjacent area, keep in mind that most of them have limited utility, as the E.P.A. points out in its guide. In order to offer adequate protection from smoke particles, you would need a mask that’s rated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as N95 or P100. These ratings indicate that the mask or respirator blocks out 95 to 99.9 percent of particles 0.3 microns or larger.

“So if you’re going to be outside and you want a mask, you need one of these certified masks,” Mr. Heffernan said. “A paper one won’t do any harm, but it shouldn’t give you a false sense of security.”",What to Know Before Buying an Air Purifier to Clear Wildfire Smoke,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/smarter-living/what-to-know-before-buying-an-air-purifier.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, I express myself with images.”

Steyer, a hedge fund manager-turned-environmentalist who spent more than $91 million on behalf of Democrats in 2016, finds this reticence baffling. “What is the calculus to being silent on the most important issue of the day, where it’s absolutely critical to the American people, and it will go on the historical record of what you did or didn’t do?” he asked me. “I don’t understand.”

I’ve spoken to Democrats who fear making impeachment too partisan, holding out hope that if Trump’s behavior becomes egregious enough Republicans might join the effort to hold him accountable. Others, Sherman told me, say, “We don’t want to distract from health care, and from our economic plan.” And, of course, some on the left believe that a functioning Mike Pence administration would be worse than the dysfunctional Trump regime.

There are strategic merits to all these arguments. But they leave many Americans terrified by Trump’s erratic behavior and incompetence feeling marooned, confused as to why their leaders aren’t treating this presidency like the civic emergency that it is. At some point, we need politicians to address the crisis in front of us. “We have a democracy to protect and a republic to save, and that’s what this is all about,” Green told me.

Obviously, no matter how grave the threat, a Republican-controlled Congress has little incentive to act. But even if Democrats retake the House in 2018, Sherman told me, impeachment “would still require a change in public opinion.”

This is why Steyer’s campaign is potentially useful, even if at first glance it seems quixotic. Sure, it’s hard to imagine anyone who doesn’t already despise the president being convinced by the earnest plea of a filthy-rich California climate activist. But Steyer is aiming at movement-building; he wants to reach people who desperately want Trump gone but don’t know what to do about it. “We’re asking electeds to stand up for the right thing, but we’re going to American citizens to ask them to demand it,” he said.

Some commentators fear “normalizing” impeachment as a tool of routine political warfare. But Bill Clinton’s impeachment already normalized its use against Democrats on the flimsiest of pretexts. Had Hillary Clinton been elected, the campaign to remove her would probably be in full swing by now. Democrats may wish to return to a less destructive brand of politics, but that’s not an option while Trump sits in the White House.

While he does, we’re all better off if he thinks impeachment is a possibility. “I’m hoping that if Trump is aware that he could be removed, that that awareness constrains him to the extent he can be constrained,” Sherman said. And the best way to show Trump that people are serious about impeaching him is to put the message on television.",Democrats Should Embrace Impeachment,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/opinion/trump-impeachment-tom-steyer.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Retailers say that the carriers began sending out letters to them a year ago saying they would no longer handle their shipments.

For consumers who live in states stocked with fine-wine retailers, like New York, the restrictions are an inconvenience. For consumers in states with few retail options, they are disastrous. It’s hard enough outside major metropolitan areas to find wines from small producers. The crackdown makes it that much harder.

Before the internet, the bigger wine shops sometimes printed periodic catalogs for their customers, particularly around the holidays. If those catalogs found their way into hands in other states and enticed a few far-flung sales, it was no big deal one way or the other.

Broadband changed everything. No longer did retailers have to identify and attract potential customers. With a few clicks of the mouse, eager consumers could seek out wine shops all over the country, scour their inventories and order the bottles they wanted.

“That’s one of the happy miracles of the age,” said Jamie Wolff, an owner of Chambers Street Wines in New York.

Like other retailers I spoke with, Mr. Wolff was not willing to offer precise sales figures, but he said a significant amount of Chambers Street’s business had been from out of state.

“It seems a shame to tell consumers anywhere that they can’t freely purchase something they want,” he said.

Until 2005, many retailers quietly engaged in interstate business without much fuss. But that year, which roughly coincided with the widespread access to high-speed internet, the Supreme Court ruling in Granholm v. Heald effectively lifted many state bans on buying directly from out-of-state wineries.

Though the ruling applied to wineries, not to retailers, Granholm had a liberating effect on consumers who suddenly found it much easier to find the wines they wanted online. The decision also allows the direct shipment of wines purchased by tourists at wineries to all states.

The efforts to curtail interstate shipping, many retailers believe, are a result of heavy lobbying by wine and spirits wholesalers, supported by generous campaign contributions to state legislators and other elected officials. In New York State, for example, wholesalers have given $2.7 million to candidates for office, compared with $678,000 donated by retailers, according to the Nation Institute on Money in State Politics.

“Wholesalers have been looking at this issue for quite some time,” said Daniel Posner, owner of Grapes the Wine Company, a retailer in White Plains. “They went to state liquor authorities and said, ‘People aren’t following the laws.’ Now it’s all coming to a brutal end.”

Photo

Mr. Posner, who also is president of the National Association of Wine Retailers, an advocacy group, said about half of Grapes’ business was with out-of-state clients, primarily in New Jersey and Connecticut. He said the potential ramifications for his small business, with its 12 employees, were huge.

“As in anything in business, this is pure greed,” he said. “There are very few industries that are so regulated. We have an authority that looks over us, that makes sure we pay our bills on time. We have a very rigid system in place, state by state. These wholesalers, they hold all the cards.”

The wholesalers, for their part, insist that their interest is solely to protect consumers from fraud, threats to health and underage drinking.

In a phone conversation, Craig Wolf, president and chief executive of the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, a trade group, posed a nightmarish scenario of teenagers in New York ordering Thunderbird — the cheap, flavored fortified wine of skid rows and song — from retailers in Nevada.

“New York can’t hold Nevada accountable,” he said. “Multiply that out by tens of thousands. There’s no jurisdiction for retailers at the federal level.”

I suggested that the example was far-fetched, but Mr. Wolf pivoted, pointing to several cases in Europe where people had died from drinking counterfeit spirits. The states, which have the power to license retailers, he asserted, keep them honest. Allowing retailers to sell out of state, he suggested, created a scenario for an unregulated system to run amok.

“With everybody licensed, the supply chain is guaranteed top to bottom,” he said.

Wholesalers have argued for years that such tight regulation, which happens to be to their commercial advantage, is all that protects the wine and spirits business from descending into chaos. The Supreme Court did not buy the argument in 2005, and to me, their economic interest seems a far more likely motivation than public health.

For years, wholesalers around the country have been consolidating into bigger and bigger entities. The American wine market was worth around $62 billion in 2016, and according to Forbes magazine, revenues at the top three wholesalers accounted for almost half of that value. The more fragmented the wholesalers can keep the market, the better they insure their place in it.

Retailers will adapt to the restrictions on interstate sales, though it will not be easy. Devin Warner, president of the Chicago Wine Company, a retailer, said 50 percent of its sales go out of Illinois.

“We’ve felt the pinch of states closing down,” he said. “We’re just going to have to look for other ways to replace that business.”

At the same time, retailers are lobbying for bills that would loosen restrictions on web purchases. A bill in New York that would permit out-of-state retailers to ship to New York died in committee last year, Mr. Posner said. He is hoping the bill will be reintroduced in January.

“The internet has allowed many industries to go forward, but this is sending us backward,” he said.

Independent retailers also face the threat of consolidation. Costco is now the biggest wine retailer in the country, and Amazon is now getting into selling wine, a move that has been given brick-and-mortar significance by its recent acquisition of Whole Foods Market, which has many outlets with retail wine licenses.

As for Watson’s removal, it will not go down as the fastest in N.B.A.","There are some reasonable explanations to account for such an unusually favorable coaching climate. A whopping 14 teams introduced new coaches to start the 2013-14 season. Nine teams began the 2014-15 season with new coaches, followed by six new hires entering 2015-16 and 10 more to open last season. A period of relative calm after that amount of turnover was perhaps inevitable.

Throw in the presence of a few long-tenured coaches who have copious amounts of job security — namely San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich, Miami’s Erik Spoelstra and Dallas’ Rick Carlisle — and it gets easier to understand why openings have been scarce lately.

Carlisle, who also serves as president of the N.B.A. Coaches Association, has his own theory, insisting that the recent tranquillity on league benches isn’t as fluky as it might seem.

“The caliber of coaching in the league right now is excellent from top to bottom,” Carlisle said in a phone interview. “And owners have clearly come to the accurate conclusion that it’s important to commit to a coach, because there’s going to be more player movement under the rules in the new C.B.A. It’s important for teams to have as much continuity as they can.”

Of course, after Phoenix moved so swiftly in dumping Watson in the wake of its humiliating start, there will understandably be fears that a regression to the mean looms and more firings are on the way. The N.B.A. is certainly due for some upheaval in this area, especially after an off-season that failed to deliver its usual surprise coaching change (or three).

Who’s next? With Chicago having fully entered rebuilding mode and presumably taking some heat off the embattled Fred Hoiberg, uncertainty shrouds the future of the Knicks’ Jeff Hornacek, largely because the executive who hired Hornacek in June 2016 — Phil Jackson — is already gone.

The Pelicans have missed the playoffs in Alvin Gentry’s first two seasons, which naturally invites pressure, but remember that Gentry is tasked with the challenge of trying to win with a team built around two big men — Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins — at a time when small ball and 3-point shooting reign.

The circumstances of Watson’s situation in Phoenix make it something of an outlier regardless. The Suns have left the distinct impression that they aren’t really trying to win games, but rather are focused instead on asset collection and player development with a roster that features six players aged 21 or younger. It hasn’t helped that the progress of its recent top draft packs, apart from Devin Booker, has been painfully slow.

The closest thing to a sense of anticipation Phoenix could thus boast coming into the season was the widespread belief that it will try to trade guard Eric Bledsoe and veteran center Tyson Chandler before the league’s Feb. 8 trade deadline.

Watson, 38, earned the full-time job despite posting an underwhelming 9-24 record as interim coach after Phoenix fired Hornacek just past the midpoint of the 2015-16 season — in what was Watson’s first season on an N.B.A. bench as an assistant. Amid a seven-season playoff drought and mounting local frustrations with the tenure of Suns owner Robert Sarver, it often seemed as though Watson had the job merely as a placeholder.

What ended Watson’s tenure as head coach — beyond reports of discord between him and general manager Ryan McDonough — was the Suns’ alarming lack of competitiveness so early in the season. They were beaten by 48 points at home by a Portland team playing without the suspended C.J. McCollum in the season opener, then absorbed a 42-point pounding in Los Angeles against the Clippers one night after allowing 132 points in a loss to the Lakers.

The Suns now turn to the experienced Jay Triano, who served as the head coach of the Toronto Raptors for two-plus seasons in addition to multiple stints in charge of the Canadian national team. Triano takes over the league’s youngest collection of players, with an average age of just 24.5 as of opening night, looking to extract more effort and discipline from this group while management actively tries to find a new home for Bledsoe.

Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 12. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

“They think of the Saudis as big money,” said Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group, a political research and consulting firm.
Mr. Schwarzman’s Blackstone and Mr. Son’s SoftBank have so far been the biggest beneficiaries of Saudi Arabia’s largess.
One executive, unprompted, said bankers would be taking selfies to put in pitch books for future business in Saudi Arabia.
Topic A in the hallways is the initial public offering for Aramco.","“Saudi Arabia is moving aggressively to diversify its economy and implement important reforms,” Mr. Schwarzman told me, explaining why so much of the world’s business community has become intrigued by the kingdom as an economic and business partner.

Among those reforms is the recent decision to allow women to drive. One senior Saudi female executive told me that she had owned a Mercedes for years and couldn’t wait to learn how to drive it; like many women here, she has needed a driver to take her to and from work.

But to truly understand where the country’s new influence over the business community comes from, you simply need to follow the money.

With Saudi Arabia looking to invest the proceeds of its oil sales in new businesses and industries — it is planning an initial public offering for its state-owned oil company, Aramco, next year — the kingdom represents perhaps the largest honey pot in history. Virtually everyone here will have his or her pitch book at the ready and a hand out.

“They think of the Saudis as big money,” said Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group, a political research and consulting firm. “Not smart, not dumb, but really big money that’s ready to move. And that attracts an extraordinary number of people who’d like a little piece.”

Wall Street’s biggest companies are sending swarms of bankers here, as are private equity firms and hedge funds. One executive described the gathering as “a ring-kissing exercise,” an effort by businesses to prove their loyalty as the country’s Public Investment Fund — which is the formal sponsor of the event — begins to dole out hundreds of billions of dollars as part of its diversification plan, known as Vision 2030.

Mr. Schwarzman’s Blackstone and Mr. Son’s SoftBank have so far been the biggest beneficiaries of Saudi Arabia’s largess. This year, the country committed $20 billion to a new Blackstone fund to be used, in part, to fix aging infrastructure in the United States. And it gave $45 billion to Mr. Son’s SoftBank Vision Fund, the largest technology fund in the world.

It has already made investments in WeWork, SoFi and Fanatics, and is negotiating an investment in Uber. Speaking of Uber, Travis Kalanick, its former chief executive and a current board member, is expected here; the Saudis invested $3.5 billion directly in Uber last year.

A number of participants, speaking anonymously so as not to offend their hosts, grumbled about what they described as having to trek to the desert to get their picture taken. Others said attendance was mandatory because the kingdom was a client. One executive, unprompted, said bankers would be taking selfies to put in pitch books for future business in Saudi Arabia.

Journalists from around the world are also here at the conference. (I’m among the many journalists interviewing executives and officials on panels.)

Topic A in the hallways is the initial public offering for Aramco. There have been reports recently that the I.P.O. might be delayed or that the government might sell a stake in the company to the Chinese, either as an alternative to the public offering or as a way to help establish a valuation.

The kingdom is said to be seeking a valuation of $2 trillion for Aramco, which would make it the largest company in the world — and give the government enough money to pursue its diversification strategy. But some investors and analysts, who have yet to see any of Aramco’s financials, have warned that such a valuation is far too high.

At stake is Saudi Arabia’s ability to pay for its transformation. And for many of the attendees, the kingdom’s ability to pay huge fees to Wall Street also hangs in the balance. The fees from the I.P.O. offering are estimated to be worth as much $1 billion, which would make it the biggest payday ever for an offering. With questions still lingering about where the I.P.O will be listed, it is notable that Thomas W. Farley, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, and Xavier Rolet, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, are both scheduled to attend.

In an interview over the weekend, Aramco’s chief executive, Amin H. Nasser, insisted the I.P.O. was still on track for next year.

“We have always said that we will be listing in 2018 and, to be more specific, in the second half of 2018,” he said. “However, I think journalists and writers — they are expecting more and more information, and we are governed by, you know, certain rules with regard to talking about the I.P.O. and all of that.”

When Aramco will go public and at what price will most likely be the chatter of the week, if not a full-fledged parlor game, but the real question, Mr. Bremmer said, “is what anyone can learn about the internal dynamics of the royal family?”

There are continuing questions about whether the kingdom’s investments in new industries and businesses will be able to produce the kind of returns that oil has for generations here.

And just as important, there are questions about whether the diversification strategy can create enough jobs to keep the population employed and expand the domestic economy.

“How much support is there for the aggressive across-the-board reforms of Vision 2030?” Mr. Bremmer asked. “Do attendees come away with any more confidence that Saudi isn’t only on the right track but that they can execute on it? We shall see.”

The answer will have a huge impact on the future of this country — and will be worth a lot of money.","In the Saudi Desert, World’s Business Leaders Follow the Money",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/business/dealbook/in-the-saudi-desert-worlds-business-leaders-follow-the-money.html

Vicki Eastus, a puzzle solver in Brooklyn, put it this way: “The more hectic life is, the more calming I find filling in those little boxes.”

Search the internet for research on the impact of puzzle-solving on the brain, and you’ll find plenty of studies. But the results are mixed, and it’s not clear whether puzzle solving has any purely physiological benefits.

The psychological benefits, though, are not in question.

“When you do a puzzle, the mind becomes completely absorbed in the task at hand,” said Joanne Cohen-Katz, a psychologist in Allentown, Pa. “There is total focus on what is happening in the moment, which is the definition of mindfulness. And we know that mindfulness results in all sorts of positive changes in the brain.”

For one, solving a crossword can be a path to serenity in a world of uncertainty.

“I don’t think I have to sell you on the increased demand for this type of pastime in an increasingly worried world,” wrote Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times, in a memo to Lester Markel, the Sunday editor, after the Pearl Harbor attack. “You can’t think of your troubles while solving a crossword.”

In recent interviews, New York Times crossword enthusiasts shared their emotional connections to the pastime and described the value they find in the exercise.

Harry Hassell, of Jackson Heights, Queens, remembered his mother working on crosswords. “Amid the chaos of the household, it allowed her a personal pleasure and a routine all her own,” he said. “It also allowed me to see her not just as a car-pooling, tennis-playing mother, but also as a clever, intelligent, word-loving woman.”

Such intergenerational connections, forged over black-and-white grids, can have long-term implications.

“I first started doing crosswords as a child while visiting my Grandma Pat,” said Neil Padrick Wilson, a claims analyst in Tacoma, Wash. “She would sit at the big dining room table, dipping toast in her coffee. I would dip toast in my hot chocolate and we would work through a puzzle together. It got me to think, it got me to learn and it got me to know her better.”

Puzzles became so important to Mr. Wilson that he began to create them, and a crossword he made recently ran in The Times.

While not all enthusiasts go on to construct puzzles, it’s not uncommon for an early habit to persist.

“Rituals are often key in bonding with others, particularly family rituals,” said Ray Bepko, a clinical psychologist in Clinton, N.Y. “Pastimes and hobbies are very much a part of this and impact our adult relationships.”

That seems to be at least one reason people continue or develop a solving habit in adulthood, Dr. Bepko said. “Accessing this deep emotional connection is a source of comfort and reassurance anytime, particularly in difficult moments.”

Of course, puzzles are games, and they’re meant to be fun — especially in the addictive “aha!” moments that many solvers describe.

Yet it was a role that Ms. Fowler had been preparing for her whole life. The Peter Pan libertines met their match in a sweet Stoic.

She had what she calls an “unconventional upbringing,” the second child of seven in a small town in rural Arizona called Yarnell. Her father was an evangelical Assemblies of God preacher who sold pay phones on weekdays and, with his wife, home-schooled Susan and her siblings. She ended up never going to high school.

“So I was kind of on my own,” she says. “I tried to read the classics, would go to the library a lot, tried to teach myself things. But didn’t really have any direction. I really had this dream that someday I could be educated.”

She read Plutarch’s “Lives.” “The Stoics were really what changed me,” she says. “Because their whole thing was about, ‘You don’t have control over a lot of the things that determine your life, so all you can do is focus on becoming the best person that you can be.’ And that really spoke to me because I did feel, especially during my teenage years, that my life was really out of my control. I really wished that I could just learn and do all the fun things and cool extracurriculars that I thought everybody else my age was doing.”

Ms. Fowler worked as a stable hand and a nanny to help support her family. “And I would tell myself, in the times when I would be really, really sad, ‘Once I get out of here, I’m going to do something great.’ And I would just pray at night, like, ‘God, please just let me get out, give me opportunities to get out. I promise I’ll do good with it.’”

At 16, she began “freaking out” about her future. “I had this really intense resolve. I would call universities and community colleges and say, ‘I really want to go to college? How do I get to college. What do I do?’ And they would say, ‘You have to get an application. You have to get letters of recommendation.’ It was terrifying. I had no idea what I was doing.”

She figured out how to take the SAT and ACT. She made a list of all the books she had read and at the top wrote, “Susan Fowler’s Home School” and sent it off to Arizona State University.

“And they actually gave me a full scholarship,” she says, the wonder still in her voice.

The college balked at letting her take math and physics to study astronomy, given her lack of high-school prerequisites. “And I was like, ‘No! I didn’t come this far, now that I’ve found something I really loved, to have my dream smashed,’” Ms. Fowler says.

She applied to the top 10 colleges as a transfer student and was accepted at the University of Pennsylvania, where she was told she could study physics and given help with the steep tuition.

After a rough first semester, advisers tried to steer her away from physics. So she walked into the office of Penn’s president, Amy Gutmann, and left a message with her assistant: In a commencement speech, Ms. Gutmann had said that the school would help students fulfill their dreams.

“I heard back directly from the president herself, and she was like, ‘You are right. This is a place for people to fulfill their dreams.’” She told Ms. Fowler she could get back to her whiteboards, and after that, it was “fantastic.”

The Memo That Roared

The essay that shook Silicon Valley was called “Reflecting on One Very, Very Strange Year at Uber,” and Ms. Fowler began by noting that it was “a strange, fascinating, and slightly horrifying story.” Published on Feb. 19, it rocked the world’s most valuable start-up, challenging the mantra that great disrupters are above the law. The blog post was notable for its dispassionate tone, as the young engineer who had left the company after a year walked the reader through everything that had gone very, very wrong in the brozilla culture of kegs, sexual coarseness and snaky competition.

Ms. Fowler was on her first day with her new engineering team when her manager sent her a string of messages over the company chat system.

“He’s telling me that he’s in an open relationship and that his girlfriend is getting laid all the time, but he just can’t because he’s at work all the time,” she says, reprising her blog post with me. “And he’s trying really hard not to get in trouble at work, but he’s really looking for a woman to have sex with. And I was like, ‘What the hell? This can’t be real. How stupid does he have to be?’ But it turned out he’d been getting away with this for so long, he didn’t care anymore. And I feel like so many of these men, they believe that the only reason women get into these jobs is to get a guy.”

Ms. Fowler took screen shots and reported the manager to human resources, thinking, “They’ll do the right thing.” But they didn’t, explaining that the manager was “a high performer” and it was his first offense, something Ms. Fowler later discovered to be untrue.

“Somehow I’m supposed to be like, ‘Oh, he’s a high performer? Never mind. How dare I?’” she says, laughing.

She wrote that H.R. told her she could either find another team to work on or stay on that man’s team and expect a poor performance review. Another manager told her that if she reported stuff to H.R., he could fire her. Amid the manic, sexist behavior, the number of female engineers in the division Ms. Fowler was part of dwindled to less than 6 percent — too few, the company said, to merit ordering them the same black leather jackets they were ordering for the men.

When Ms. Fowler earned some money from “Production-Ready Microservices,” a book on engineering she wrote, she went out to Madewell and bought herself a black leather jacket.

“I didn’t really care if they branded me a troublemaker,” she says, “because I hadn’t gotten that far in my life and overcome all these things to get treated inappropriately. I wasn’t going to take it. I’d worked so hard. I deserved so much better. And I was, like, ‘No. That’s not O.K. You don’t get to do that.’”

In her memo, she says, “I knew I had to be super-careful about how I said it if I wanted anybody to take it seriously. A lot of women have been whistle-blowers in the past, and a lot of them have just gotten torn down and treated terribly. One of the things that kept popping up was this idea that if you do whistle-blow about sexual harassment, then that is what will define the rest of your life. And I kind of struggled with this. But then, to me, I realized, you know what? No. Stepping back, just being in my little Stoicism Susan bubble, if what people know you for is bringing light to an issue about bad behavior, about bad stuff going on and laws not being followed and people being treated inappropriately, why wouldn’t I want that? That’s a badge of honor.

“And I wasn’t just standing up for myself. I felt like I was standing up for everyone else that I was seeing at Uber who was mistreated. It was an extremely demoralizing environment. I would see people who would get harassed or made fun of or bullied and they would go report it, and they would just get ground down by upper management and H.R. And so I felt like, if I can take this on despite the consequences, then I should do it.”

Like women in Hollywood I talked to after the Weinstein collapse, Ms. Fowler thought the new outspokenness in Silicon Valley on sexual harassment may have been spurred by the election of President Trump.

“The second Trump won, I felt super-powerless and I thought, ‘Oh my God, no one’s looking out for us,’” she says. “They have the House, they have the Senate, they have the White House. And so we have to take it back ourselves. We have to be the ones doing the work.”

The only woman on the board then, Arianna Huffington, who had vowed that the culture of “brilliant jerks” must end, had been trying to help Mr. Kalanick by advising him to sleep more and meditate. But he caused another kerfuffle when he chose to meditate in the lactation room.

When Ms. Fowler’s memo exploded, Ms. Huffington oversaw the investigation by Eric Holder, reached out and talked to employees, and said she wanted to “hold the leadership team’s feet to the fire.” Uber later fired 20 people, including senior executives.

“So I was disappointed in her because I expected her to be an advocate,” Ms. Fowler says, noting that Ms. Huffington appeared on TV after the blog post to insist that there’s no “systemic problem” at Uber.

“I had two friends who went to her and Liane Hornsey, who’s the head of H.R., and reported various harassment discrimination,” Ms. Fowler says. “And then I was told that many other women were doing the same thing. And then Arianna went on TV that same week and said, there’s no ‘systemic problem.’ Which I was like, ‘No, a whole bunch of people just went to you this week.’” Ms. Fowler adds that the company’s C.T.O., Thuan Pham, who knew about her complaints, is still in the same job.

Ms. Huffington told me that she agreed that the problem was “systemic sexism,” but that she did not believe there was “systemic sexual harassment.” But, she added, “there should be zero tolerance for even one case of sexual harassment.”

“I was totally supportive of having a full investigation of her claims,” Ms. Huffington says. “That’s why we brought in a former attorney general to investigate. I don’t think you can do a lot more than that.”

Ms. Fowler is not so sure. “The one interaction we had was right after I published the blog, when I started getting calls from friends and family and even acquaintances I hadn’t talked to in years and years who were getting calls about private investigators asking about it,” she says “And I was pretty sure that this was coming from Uber or someone close to Uber. So I sent an email to some of the members of the Uber board because I was like, ‘Look, I don’t know if you’re responsible for this, but hey, if you’re doing this, please stop.’

“And Arianna responded and she was like, ‘Travis has assured me that he did not do this.’ And I replied, asking her, ‘O.K., well, then, could you please go and say publicly, “Whoever’s doing this, stop,” if somebody is?’”

Ms. Huffington told me that “the board had a complete assurance from management that nothing was done like that or would be.”

Speaking to The Wall Street Journal earlier this month, Ms. Hornsey, who joined Uber a month after Ms. Fowler left and a month before the famous blog post, was asked if she had ever reached out to Ms. Fowler.

“I have said, very publicly, ‘Thank you’ to her because she raised some stuff that did lead to change,” she said. “I don’t know whether there would be any benefit in meeting her. I’m seriously working for my employees today; she’s an ex-employee.”

Ms. Fowler tweeted a screen shot of that part of the interview, saying: “Oooh burn” and “She really, really doesn’t like me.”

On the advice of a friend, Ms. Fowler got private security for the first few weeks after she published her incendiary essay.

She thinks Silicon Valley needs to get rid of forced arbitration. “When you join these companies, they make you sign away your constitutional right to sue,” she says.

Ms. Fowler has taken that to the Supreme Court, and as is her wont, is studying the syllabuses of Columbia Law School so she can learn more about her rights.

She now has a job at Stripe as the editor of its tech publication. And she’s working with Verve, a Hollywood talent agency, developing a movie based on her experiences, described by the agency to me as “Erin Brockovich” meets “The Social Network.”

Meanwhile, Ms. Fowler is still reading the Stoics (while Mr. Kalanick is still wrestling with the board about who should control the company he started). “I think, right now especially, with Trump in the White House, who knows what’s going on with North Korea? Then we have natural disasters happening. It just feels like you’re being tossed around on the ocean and there’s nothing. What I keep going back to and what keeps me going, is trying to do good in whatever little spot of the world we can influence, no matter how small.”

As we leave, I ask Ms. Fowler if she knows the baby’s sex.

“A girl,” she says, smiling radiantly. “I’m so excited. Now I’m just like, ‘Got to make this world better so she doesn’t have to deal with these things.’”

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Solvers are naturally curious when entries appear frequently or on the same day in different puzzles. Do constructors and editors really get together in secret, Oreo-fueled meetings to compare notes? Are repetitions committed deliberately, to send messages to puzzle solvers?

The answer is no, there aren’t enough Oreos in the world to make them do that. Any commonalities between puzzles, be they entries like OWIE or even an entire theme, are purely coincidental.

I bring this up because Damon Gulczynski, the constructor of today’s puzzle, explains in his notes below that a theme very similar to his own ran in The Wall Street Journal recently, and the truth is, these things happen all the time. It’s not because of laziness on the part of the constructor. More than one person can have the same great idea, and because editors work at different companies and don’t consult each other, sometimes identical entries or themes run close together.

Today’s puzzle by Mr. Gulczynski is a fresh, three dimensional take on an interesting topic.

“Shannon, Rosie the Riveter has nothing on you,” commented a woman from Vermont.","I did my best to convince Shannon that I would protect her identity until she’d received her final paycheck from the company. It was a risky promise. Nobody knew when that would be.

“I’m a stranger and you have no reason to trust me,” I wrote her on Facebook. “But I do want to tell the story of Rexnord and I want to tell it all the way through. I want to find out six months from now or even a year from now what happened to everybody. I want to follow certain people to see where they ended up. I’d love for you to be one of them.”

Luckily, Shannon did walk through the door at Cracker Barrel, wearing her signature blue eyeliner. She sat down to lunch and told me the story of her life, which was unlike anything I had ever heard.

It was a tale of overcoming sexual abuse and domestic violence to become the first female “heat treat” operator at the plant‚ responsible for hardening with fire the small rings of steel that would eventually be joined together, one inside the other, to form bearings. Yet Shannon didn’t view herself as a victim or a survivor. She was simply a single mom trying to make it.

I followed Shannon and several of her co-workers until September, making eight trips to Indianapolis over a period of eight months. Many of the workers were at the factory seven days a week. They didn’t have much free time to talk. Sometimes I drove to work with Shannon and hopped out of the car just before she got to the factory. Sometimes I met her at the end of her shift — at 10 p.m. — at a Burger King nearby and drove home with her. A few times, I fell asleep waiting for her to get home after her shift.

The reality that Shannon and her co-workers showed me flew in the face of so many assumptions I had about class, free trade and globalization.

I had always been told that unskilled jobs moved abroad. Yet Shannon’s job was complicated. It had taken her years to master. Could I do what she did? I honestly wasn’t sure.

I had always been told that automation, not trade, was the reason factory workers like Shannon were losing their jobs. But the two are intimately linked, as U.S. factories trying to compete with cheap labor overseas are forced to automate to stay profitable. Far from seeing herself as a competitor to machines, Shannon viewed herself as a loving caretaker of the machines she’d spent years learning to operate and repair.

I had always been told by economists, diplomats and academics that workers like Shannon were the few who had to be sacrificed so that the rest of us could be better off: They were the martyrs of globalization. But the more I delved into economic theory, the more I began to question whether people like Shannon were really “the few.” Our economy is designed for (and by) people with college degrees — a credential that two-thirds of American adults lack.

For those of us who are lucky enough to have graduated from good colleges, globalization and unfettered trade have expanded our horizons and boosted our incomes, as the world opened up to our talent and capital. We rarely think about the downsides to our fellow Americans, the most vulnerable among us. Too often, we just repeat the ubiquitous platitude, “The factories are never coming back.”

Getting to know Shannon and her co-workers helped me understand why so many Americans feel let down by both major political parties in this country. But this story has also given me a huge amount of hope that, despite our many differences, Americans still really do care about one another.

After the article ran, people from all walks of life reached out to me, to Shannon and to The New York Times.

“Shannon, Rosie the Riveter has nothing on you,” commented a woman from Vermont. “If ever we are to succeed as a country again, it is because of people like you. Your tenacity, grit, love, humanity, devotion to family and work ethic are what make America thrive.”

A man who identified himself as a former manager in tech manufacturing, from Dallas, wrote: “I have seen this story play out over and over again. It is going to take a new breed of committed, smart and courageous leaders both political and in business to turn around this mess.”

A judge in California sent me a message saying that the story “affirmed for me how we as Americans are all in this together and should behave that way more.”

Many conservatives were aghast. TV pundits hyperventilated about hyperinflation, and even seemingly more respectable voices denounced the Fed’s actions. In 2010 a who’s who of conservative economists and pundits published an open letter warning that the Fed’s policies would cause inflation and “debase the dollar.”

But it never happened. In fact, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation has consistently fallen short of its target of 2 percent a year.

Now, every economist makes bad forecasts now and then — if you don’t, you’re not taking enough risks. I’ve certainly made my share, including a bad market call on election night — which I retracted three days later, acknowledging that my political dismay had gotten the better of my analytical judgment. But I always try to face up to my mistakes and learn from them.

But I guess I’m just old fashioned that way. Four years after that open letter to Bernanke, Bloomberg tracked down many of the signatories to ask what they had learned. None of them — not one — was even willing to admit having been wrong.

So what happens to economists who never admit mistakes, and never change their views in the light of experience? The answer, apparently, is that they get put on the short list to be the new Fed chair.

Consider, for example, the case of Stanford’s John Taylor (one of the signatories of that open letter). Unlike some of the other names on the rumored list, he’s a highly cited academic economist.

Since the financial crisis, however, he has repeatedly demanded that the Fed raise interest rates in line with a policy rule he devised a quarter-century ago. Failing to follow that rule was supposed to cause inflation, which it hasn’t — but seven years of being consistently wrong hasn’t inspired any rethinking on his part.

What it has inspired is a descent into increasingly strange reasons the Fed should raise rates despite low inflation. Easy money, he declared, was part of a conspiracy to “bail out fiscal policy,” that is, an effort to help President Barack Obama. Or maybe it was like the monetary equivalent of rent control, discouraging lending the way rent control discourages building apartments — a bizarre analysis that had colleagues scratching their heads.

What these ever-odder interventions had in common was that they always offered some reason wrong was right — why Taylor had been right to warn against easy-money policies even though higher inflation, the problem he predicted as a result of these policies, never materialized. And never, ever, an admission that maybe something was wrong with his initial analysis.

Again, everyone makes forecast errors. If you’re consistently wrong, that should certainly count against your credibility; track records matter. But it’s much worse if you can never bring yourself to admit past errors and learn from them.

That kind of behavior makes it all too likely that you’ll keep making the same mistakes; but more than that, it shows something wrong with your character.

SONDHEIM HAS CERTAINLY followed his own advice in this regard: His choice of subject matter over the last half-century of work demolishes any notions of the kinds of stories musical theater can tell. From a violent barber (“Sweeney Todd” with Hugh Wheeler) to ancient Roman farce (1962’s “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,” with librettists Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart) to fractured fairy tales (“Into the Woods” with James Lapine). Within this vast terrain, he and his collaborators have also radically experimented with the musical theater form: See the diptych structure of “Sunday in the Park With George,” also with Lapine, in which each act takes place a century apart, or the unprecedented “Company” (1970), with a book by George Furth, a meditation on commitment and monogamy, which Sondheim describes as a “non-plot” musical.” Here he is, arriving at the form of “Follies,” his legendary 1971 musical with librettist James Goldman about a reunion of retired performers from a 1930s Ziegfeldesque revue: “You start with the subject matter and some content and it takes form. If you’re going to say, ‘O.K., it’s a reunion party,’ well, hello, don’t try to give it a plot. And if you don’t give it a plot, what’s going to hold it together? Uh-oh. That’s what’s dangerous and that’s what’s scary about it.”

We gravitate toward the subject of surprise, both for the audience and for the playwright.

Sondheim: That was a big lesson from Peter Shaffer.9 We went to see a play once about the mad queen of Spain and in the first act there were two rapes, an evisceration, a fire and something horrifying with a child, I don’t remember. And at the end of the first act I said, “This is so much my kind of thing. Why am I bored?” He said, “There’s no surprise.” And I thought, “Put that on your bathroom mirror.” Surprise: if it’s in the lyric, the unexpected word, the unexpected note, the unexpected incident. The unexpected, the unexpected, that’s what theater is about. If you had to patent one thing in the theater, it’s surprise.

Miranda: Can you think of any times you’ve surprised yourself in the writing process?

Sondheim: Oh, come on, as a writer you’re always surprised when you think of the right note or the right word. You think, “Oh, I didn’t know I could — oh, that’s good!” You know, writing’s full of surprises for oneself. It comes with the territory, but this is a different kind of thing. This is surprising the audience —

Sondheim bats the question away. He’s either uninterested in recounting a specific time that he surprised himself while writing, or there have been so many that it’s impossible to pick: It comes with the territory.

Two years ago, I interviewed Sondheim and John Weidman together for a PBS documentary, but my favorite moment from the interview never aired. We were on the subject of “Finishing the Hat” from “Sunday in the Park With George,” one of Sondheim’s most celebrated songs, and maybe the greatest song ever written about the self-induced spell of the creative process.10 In this excerpt from that interview, just as in his work, Sondheim’s collaborator brought out the best in him:

Weidman: Do you remember you called me the night you finished that song?

Sondheim (smiling): Was I excited?

Weidman: You were ... beyond excited. I mean, it’s like you needed to call somebody. I may have been number 17 on the list, but I could hear it in your voice, you said, “I just wrote this song.”

Sondheim: Yeah, I remember, I wanted to tell everybody. [Laughs.] I wanted to tell everybody. I was really pleased.

Miranda: I love the story you told about the making of it in your book, about being inspired by a party game you were creating for Phyllis Newman’s party,11 and realizing you’d spent the entire night in a sort of trance —

Sondheim: I started planning that game at 8 o’clock in the evening, and when I looked up, it was 7 o’clock in the morning. I’m exaggerating, but not by much. Time had disappeared. That’s what happens — you must know that yourself. You must know that the great thing about writing and creating is, time disappears. You are in the moment, and the moment can go for eight hours or for two minutes, or whatever, until the phone rings, or you know, you have to go get something to eat.

PRESENT DAY again — I’m trying to give Sondheim credit for expanding the scope of the American musical, and he is passing on the credit to his mentor Oscar Hammerstein instead.

Miranda: Something that’s so essential about your work is that I think you have expanded the terrain of what musical theater can be. The notion of, “This is a musical, that’s not a musical,” is BS. It’s carried entirely by the passion of the creators.

Sondheim: Yeah, but Oscar invented that with “Oklahoma!” He took a play that was about homosexuality in the West and turned it into a sunny musical. Because he saw something in it that was beyond what Lynn Riggs12 had written, about the opening of territories, the promise of America. He saw that which anybody else reading that play would not have seen.

Miranda: O.K. But it gets back to the notion of, “If I can find myself in the work, others will see themselves.” So it’s about not being afraid of specificity.

Sondheim lights up.

Sondheim: Absolutely! That’s exactly what he taught me, when he criticized my poetic Hammerstein lyrics when I was starting out.13 He said, “That’s not what you feel. Don’t write what I feel. Write what you feel.” Oh! It had never occurred to me to write what I felt. And Oscar was the one who taught everyone to do that.

Write what you feel. Or as George’s muse, Dot, says to him in “Sunday,” “Anything you do,/Let it come from you./Then it will be new.”

And then for a moment you let in the depth and intensity and range of Stephen Sondheim’s feeling for the past half-century. That Tony and Maria of “West Side Story” first fell in love as Sondheim sharpened his Blackwing pencils, finding the words for their doomed romance at age 25. That Mrs. Lovett of “Sweeney Todd” hatched her diabolical plans from this writing couch as Sondheim talked to himself. That within Sondheim, somewhere, is both Georges Seurat and Fosca, Pseudolus and Mama Rose, John Wilkes Booth and Madame Armfeldt, Charley Kringas and Little Red Riding Hood. He has served up vodka stingers for Joanne (“Company”) and chrysanthemum tea for the Shogun (“Pacific Overtures”). Sixty years of iconic theatrical moments, and they exist as a result of the specific way Stephen Sondheim feels. Line by line, note by note, surprise by surprise.

And if you’re Sondheim, there are days like today, when you feel under the weather and the day is full of distractions. But there are also nights when you write “Finishing the Hat,” and you’re so proud of what you’ve made that you have to call a friend and say, “I just wrote this song.”

But none of RT’s social media activities or its presence in cable and satellite TV lineups has delivered the impact of its YouTube channel.
RT launched its YouTube page in March 2007, roughly four months after Google paid $1.65 billion for the fledgling video site.
His personal YouTube channel has earned more than 60 million views.
Today, RT ranks among the top news channels on YouTube for views, subscribers and “engagement” such as comments or likes.","As the presidential election heated up in the spring of 2016, RT consistently featured negative stories about Mrs. Clinton, according to United States intelligence officials. That included claims of corruption at her family foundation and ties to Islamic extremism, frequent coverage of emails stolen by Russian operatives from Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, and accusations that she was in poor physical and mental health.

“More than half of American adults say they watch YouTube, and younger viewers are moving to YouTube at staggering numbers,” said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russia’s exploitation of social media platforms based in the United States. “YouTube is a target-rich environment for any disinformation campaign — Russian or otherwise — that represents a long-term, next-generation challenge.”

Much like the Russian-controlled pages on Facebook, RT’s YouTube videos comply with YouTube’s community guidelines, which cover things like nudity, copyright violations and promoting violence against a group based on race or religion. But not propaganda.

YouTube carries “a wide variety of news channels” that represent “an array of viewpoints across the political spectrum,” said a spokesman for the company, Chris Dale.

RT’s reach on YouTube — 2.2 million subscribers, just slightly behind CNN — stemmed from a long and mutually beneficial relationship between the news channel and the video site, according to current and former RT employees and technology industry analysts.

YouTube had the vast audience and global reach that RT needed as it set out to become a worldwide alternative news source with influence and viewers beyond Russia’s own borders. RT has YouTube channels in a number of foreign languages including Arabic, Spanish, German, French and Chinese.

“RT management did view YouTube as hugely important to spreading content,” said Liz Wahl, a former correspondent in the United States for RT who quit on the air in 2014 over concerns that the network was whitewashing the Russian annexation of Crimea. “Traditional television ratings weren’t important because the aim was to get the messaging out through various digital and social platforms.”

The Russian channel was among the first news organizations to recognize YouTube’s power and developed content intended to perform well on the platform. RT uploads videos frequently, sprinkling in buzzy viral videos of disasters — plane crashes, tsunamis, a meteor strike — to earn likes and longer watch times, which YouTube’s algorithm rewards with better placement among search results and recommendations.

The viral videos, which were often borrowed from other sources, help to build up RT’s subscribers, and they became part of the Kremlin’s audience for more political content.

“People come for the click-bait material,” said Bret Schafer, an official at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, the Washington-based public policy research group. “And they eventually land on videos that the Kremlin wants them to see.”

While much of RT’s traffic stems from nonpolitical videos, the channel’s political and foreign affairs content ranks highly in many YouTube searches. Searches on topics on which the Kremlin is typically eager to promote its point of view — American intervention in Syria, the Ukrainian civil war or the rise of Germany’s far-right AfD party — will often turn up an RT video as one of the top results.

YouTube also provided RT with the kind of perks it reserved for big publishers, including custom backgrounds for its channel in the early days and a “check mark” that designated RT as a verified news source. Until recently, RT was also among a select group of news organizations included in Google’s “preferred” news lineup, granting them access to guaranteed revenue from premium advertisers. Those advertisers, in effect, subsidized Russia’s international propaganda arm.

Google dropped RT from the preferred lineup last month. Andrea Faville, a Google spokeswoman, said the decision was unrelated to the congressional inquiry, and that RT had been dropped as part of a “standard algorithmic update.” But Google also noted that it was not placing any other limits on RT: The channel could still sell regular ads on its videos and the status downgrade only applied in the United States. Google later clarified that RT was downgraded in other markets, but it would not say which ones.

Kirill Karnovich-Valua, RT’s deputy editor in chief, said the organization had not been informed of Google’s decision and it was puzzled about why it was dropped despite being “one of the most watched YouTube channels in the world.”

“This speaks to the unprecedented political pressure increasingly applied to all RT partners and relationships in a concerted effort to push our channel out of the U.S. market entirely, and by any means possible,” Mr. Karnovich-Valua wrote in an email.

Last month, RT said the Justice Department had demanded that a private company affiliated with RT America register as a “foreign agent” — a term that dates back to a law originally enacted in 1938 to deter Nazi propaganda. On Thursday, after the deadline set by American officials had passed, an RT spokeswoman said that the news organization was “doing everything possible for RT to avoid having to register.” Registration could impose voluminous disclosure requirements on RT, a particular burden for a media organization producing frequent content.

Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, responded in more forceful terms: Should the United States impose restrictions on Russian media, Mr. Putin said last week, Russian would act “symmetrically and quite swiftly.”

RT’s use of other technology platforms is also under investigation. Last month, officials at Twitter told a Senate Intelligence Committee that three RT accounts targeting an American audience — with a combined following of roughly six million users — had spent $274,100 to promote tweets in 2016.

But none of RT’s social media activities or its presence in cable and satellite TV lineups has delivered the impact of its YouTube channel. RT launched its YouTube page in March 2007, roughly four months after Google paid $1.65 billion for the fledgling video site. At the time, YouTube was better known for pirated content and videos of cute animals than news programming, but RT caught on quickly.

The Russian channel recruited talent from within the burgeoning world of YouTube-born media stars, people who had already shown a knack for creating viral or popular video content.

One RT contributor, the British blogger Graham Phillips, built a large following on YouTube with videos from Ukraine’s civil war, many of them critical of Ukraine’s central government. RT often featured Mr. Phillips and at one point employed him as a part-time freelancer before he was arrested and deported by Ukrainian authorities. His personal YouTube channel has earned more than 60 million views.

Another RT contributor, Lori Harfenist, began her career on public-access television in New York City, and eventually moved her self-produced show, “The Resident,” to YouTube. Ms. Harfenist was one of the platform’s first revenue-sharing partners, according to a biography on Ms. Harfenist’s personal website.

Ms. Harfenist was eventually recruited by RT, which began featuring her on segments with titles like “America is a Hypocrite.” During the presidential campaign, RT’s Twitter account promoted a video from her that claimed the existence of an anti-Semitic conspiracy involving Hillary Clinton, Google and the Illuminati. (She later claimed the segment was meant as satire.) Ms. Harfenist did not respond to emails and Facebook messages seeking comment.

Today, RT ranks among the top news channels on YouTube for views, subscribers and “engagement” such as comments or likes. The most-watched clips on RT are not political or anti-establishment videos, they are snackable content. A clip of a homeless man with a gifted voice for radio is the most popular video on RT, viewed 40 million times since it was uploaded six years ago.

Mr. Karnovich-Valua said RT’s primary aim is to provide an alternative point of view on current events so its audience can get a full picture of world events. “Where relevant, RT does present a Russian perspective on current events, but we don’t promote the Russian point of view, we explain it alongside with presenting others,” he said.

Some lawmakers, including Mr. Warner, have called for tighter regulation and disclosure requirements for political advertising on social media platforms. Yet RT’s embrace of YouTube shows how difficult it could be to limit foreign influence.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle.
PhotoFew have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said.
A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Photo

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Photo

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

(He tells his court-appointed lawyer that he merely aimed at Kim’s “water-buffalo”-sized posterior.) But after he lands in 24-hour protective custody, one hour of which is spent each day in a cage in the jail yard, he meets his philosophical match. There in the next cage is Lucius Jenkins, a serial murderer and self-described paranoid schizophrenic trying to avoid extradition to Florida and probable execution there.

The moral argument between these two men forms the heart of the play, as Lucius, who says he found God in prison, confronts Angel, who long ago lost God outside it. That Lucius (Edi Gathegi) is generally sunny and witty despite having killed eight people plays with our loyalties. He is the one who reaches out, shares cigarettes, warns about the Monday soup and recites the names of the books of the Old Testament, backward, while doing deep knee bends and lunges. Angel, on the other hand, acquires the nickname of Droopy Dog.

When the psychopath is an acute thinker about responsibility and the atheist a tantrum-prone man-child hoping to avoid it, we have trouble deciding how to invest our emotions. That is exactly where Mr. Guirgis, who won a 2015 Pulitzer Prize for “Between Riverside and Crazy,” wants us: in a confused crouch that renders us vulnerable to deeper questioning. He then mercilessly exploits that vulnerability by adding a contrasting pair of guards to the mix: one, named Charlie, a good-natured patsy; the other, Valdez, a by-the-rules sadist.

“Don’t be a God-fearing man,” Valdez warns Lucius, “be a Valdez-fearing man.”

So where is God — where is good — in the criminal justice system? The questions don’t so much hover over “Jesus Hopped the ‘A’ Train” as yank at it with gale force. There is nothing abstract about them: Mr. Guirgis says that the play began in his own attempt to rescue a friend from the Unification Church. Perhaps it is to keep the drama from flying into pieces, therefore, that he clamps the procedural frame so firmly in place around the prisoners’ debates. Their scenes together alternate with ones in which Angel’s lawyer, Mary Jane Hanrahan, must break through his perverse resistance in order to prepare him for court.

As long as these interviews maintain the play’s furiously Socratic tone, they enhance the idea that making good choices in an evil world is nearly beyond the human skill set. But in a series of monologues that pull further back from the action, Hanrahan’s reflections on the case, and on her own investment in it, dissipate the tension. This slight flaw in the writing is exacerbated by a few awkward directorial choices, including a “Law & Order”-like chung-chung sound effect between scenes. This leads you to expect Jerry Orbach, or a neat denouement that Mr. Guirgis is not about to provide.

But Mark Brokaw’s staging on a simple set by Riccardo Hernandez, sensitively lit by Scott Zielinski, is otherwise evenhanded and clean, as if not wanting to leave any fingerprints. He has rightly focused instead on shaping the cast into a superlative ensemble despite a series of setbacks: Both Mr. Carvajal and Mr. Gathegi, who are excellent, were late replacements. That’s astonishing, as their roles are killers in more ways than one. The others — Stephanie DiMaggio as Hanrahan, Erick Betancourt as Charlie and especially Ricardo Chavira as the terrifying Valdez — support them, and the play’s whipsawing arguments, handily.

Those arguments are eternal, as the frequent biblical references suggest. But they are also particular to our time and place, perhaps even more so now that the United States is the world’s largest jailer than they were in 2000.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said.
Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls.
“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said.
“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said.","Having spent 15 years photographing child marriages around the world, Stephanie Sinclair is uniquely positioned to understand its lasting impact on communities and, especially, on the girls who were forced to wed against their will. “You can’t expect individuals who have been through significant abuse to just act normal as soon as they get out of that situation,” she said. “They need to be nurtured, to be given the time and the tools to heal.”

With this in mind, Ms. Sinclair last year started the Tehani Photo Workshop — named after an 8-year-old Yemeni bride — in partnership with the Samburu Girls Foundation. The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said. Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls. “The independence that comes with a such a career, the knowledge you acquire through meeting other people, and the freedom the camera gives you to express yourself can’t be underplayed,” she said. “Instinctively, I knew that a photo workshop could nurture the girls in a unique way.”

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

Photo

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

But selling off landmarks also comes with risks. Many old-line retailers have struggled to strike a balance between cashing out their valuable real estate and holding on to historic buildings that have come to define their brands.

It is a difficult task that Lord & Taylor is now undertaking.

Founded by the English merchant Samuel Lord in 1826, the department store was once a favored retailer of high society. When its Fifth Avenue flagship opened in February 1914, it drew 75,000 visitors, who were treated to music from a pipe organ on the seventh floor and could choose to dine in one of three restaurants on the top floor.

But as the company moved into the mass market in subsequent decades, it lost much of its luster.

It was under Richard Baker, a veteran real estate investor, that Lord & Taylor recovered. Mr. Baker led a 2006 takeover of the department store company, and used that as a springboard for further acquisitions, from the Canadian chain Hudson’s Bay to Saks to the e-commerce outlet Gilt Groupe. He is now chairman and interim chief executive of Hudson’s Bay.

But as the retail industry has been battered by the tidal waves of e-commerce, Hudson’s Bay has seen its stock price fall by nearly a third over the past year. Retail sales at Hudson’s Bay were down about 1 percent in the first half of the year. As of Monday’s close, the retailer had a market capitalization of roughly $1.7 billion, or a tenth of WeWork’s private market valuation.

Hudson’s Bay has faced enormous pressure to sell its trove of real estate holdings — including its crown jewel, the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store farther up Fifth Avenue. That property was appraised recently at about $3.7 billion.

One of Hudson’s Bay’s shareholders, the real estate investment firm Land and Buildings Investment Management, has pushed for the company to sell the Saks store, suggesting it might be desirable to a hotel developer or as bricks and mortar space for Amazon.

“The path to maximizing the value of Hudson’s Bay lies in its real estate, not its retail brands,” Jonathan Litt, the founder of Land and Buildings Investment Management, wrote in a letter to the board of Hudson’s Bay in June.

That pressure apparently has had an impact. Last week, the department store operator said that its chief executive, Gerald Storch, had stepped down and that he would be replaced on an interim basis by Mr. Baker.

And Tuesday’s announcement acknowledges Mr. Litt’s criticism to some extent. Beyond the Lord & Taylor building sale, Hudson’s Bay struck agreements to lease some of its other retail space to WeWork, including in Hudson’s Bay stores in Canada.

WeWork’s partner in its real estate joint venture, Rhône Capital, will also invest $500 million in Hudson’s Bay. (The joint venture, WeWork Property Advisors, will eventually take over some of that holding.)

All told, that will give Hudson’s Bay more than $1 billion in fresh capital to pay down debt and bolster its cash holdings. The $850 million purchase price for the building is about 30 percent higher than an appraisal made in July 2016.

“This partnership places H.B.C. at the forefront of dynamic trends reshaping the way current and future generations live, work and shop: the sharing economy and urban and suburban mixed-use real estate planning,” Mr. Baker said in a statement.

For WeWork, the deal is a sign of the fast-growing start-up’s ambitions.

Originally created as a provider of shared working spaces, the company has increasingly pitched itself as reinventing how work is done. That vision has drawn backers like SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate, which invested $4.4 billion in WeWork this year.

The Hudson’s Bay deals are meant to give WeWork prime real estate, particularly in Midtown Manhattan, with a way to blend street-level retail space alongside upper-floor real estate more useful for shared office space.

“Retail is changing, and the role that real estate has to play in the way that we shop today must change with it,” Adam Neumann, WeWork’s co-founder and chief executive, said in a statement. “The opportunity to develop this partnership with H.B.C. to explore this trend was too good to pass up.”

While WeWork normally leases space in commercial buildings, it set up WeWork Property Advisors to buy some property outright. Among the advantages of such arrangements is that the start-up would be able to enjoy any rise in the value of the real estate where it sets up its co-working spaces.

Since the late 1990s, an estimated 16,000 people have enrolled in courses offered by Nxivm (pronounced Nex-e-um), which it says are designed to bring about greater self-fulfillment by eliminating psychological and emotional barriers. Most participants take some workshops, like the group’s “Executive Success Programs,” and resume their lives. But other people have become drawn more deeply into Nxivm, giving up careers, friends and families to become followers of its leader, Keith Raniere, who is known within the group as “Vanguard.”

Both Nxivm and Mr. Raniere, 57, have long attracted controversy. Former members have depicted him as a man who manipulated his adherents, had sex with them and urged women to follow near-starvation diets to achieve the type of physique he found appealing.

Now, as talk about the secret sisterhood and branding has circulated within Nxivm, scores of members are leaving. Interviews with a dozen of them portray a group spinning more deeply into disturbing practices. Many members said they feared that confessions about indiscretions would be used to blackmail them.

Mark Vicente, a filmmaker and former top Nxivm official, said that after hearing about the secret society, he confronted Mr. Raniere.

“I said, ‘Whatever you are doing, you are heading for a blowup,’” Mr. Vicente said.

Several former members have asked state authorities to investigate the group’s practices, but officials have declined to pursue action.

In July, Ms. Edmondson filed a complaint with the New York State Department of Health against Danielle Roberts, a licensed osteopath and follower of Mr. Raniere, who performed the branding, according to Ms. Edmondson and another woman. In a letter, the agency said it would not look into Dr. Roberts because she was not acting as Ms. Edmondson’s doctor when the branding is said to have happened.

Separately, a state police investigator told Ms. Edmondson and two other women that officials would not pursue their criminal complaint against Nxivm because their actions had been consensual, a text message shows.

State medical regulators also declined to act on a complaint filed against another Nxivm-affilated physician, Brandon Porter. Dr. Porter, as part of an “experiment,” showed women graphically violent film clips while a brain-wave machine and video camera recorded their reactions, according to two women who took part.

The women said they were not warned that some of the clips were violent, including footage of four women being murdered and dismembered.

“Please look into this ASAP,” a former Nxivm member, Jennifer Kobelt, stated in her complaint. “This man needs to be stopped.”

In September, regulators told Ms. Kobelt they concluded that the allegations against Dr. Porter did not meet the agency’s definition of “medical misconduct,” their letter shows.

Mr. Raniere and other top Nxivm officials, including Lauren Salzman, did not respond to repeated emails, letters or text messages seeking comment. Dr. Roberts and Dr. Porter also did not respond to inquiries.

Former members said that, inside Nxivm, they are being portrayed as defectors who want to destroy the group.

It is not clear how many women were branded or which Nxivm officials were aware of the practice.

A copy of a text message Mr. Raniere sent to a female follower indicates that he knew women were being branded and that the symbol’s design incorporated his initials.

“Not initially intended as my initials but they rearranged it slightly for tribute,” Mr. Raniere wrote, (“if it were abraham lincolns or bill gates initials no one would care.)”

From the Message Below is an excerpt of a text message Mr. Raniere sent to a female follower, which suggested that he knew women were being branded and that the symbol’s design incorporated his initials. “... Not intended initially as my initials but they rearranged it slightly for tribute (if it were abraham lincolns or bill gates initials no one would care). The primary meaning and design of the brand symbol has nothing to do with my initials ...”

Joining the Sisterhood

Ms. Edmondson, who lives in Vancouver and helped start Nxivm’s chapter there, was thrilled when Lauren Salzman arrived in January to teach workshops.

The women, both in their early 40s, were close and Ms. Edmondson regarded Ms. Salzman as a confidante and mentor.

“Lauren was someone I really looked up to as a rock star within the company,” said Ms. Edmondson, an actress who joined Nxivm about a decade ago.

During her visit, Ms. Salzman said she had something “really amazing” she wanted to share. “It is kind of strange and top secret and in order for me to tell you about it you need to give me something as collateral to make sure you don’t speak about it,” Ms. Edmondson recalled her saying.

The proposition seemed like a test of trust. After Ms. Edmondson wrote a letter detailing past indiscretions, Ms. Salzman told her about the secret sorority.

She said it had been formed as a force for good, one that could grow into a network that could influence events like elections. To become effective, members had to overcome weaknesses that Mr. Raniere taught were common to women — an overemotional nature, a failure to keep promises and an embrace of the role of victim, according to Ms. Edmondson and other members.

Submission and obedience would be used as tools to achieve those goals, several women said. The sisterhood would comprise circles, each led by a “master” who would recruit six “slaves,” according to two women. In time, they would recruit slaves of their own.

“She made it sound like a bad-ass bitch boot camp,” Ms. Edmondson said.

Ms. Edmondson and others said that during training, the women were required to send their master texts that read “Morning M” and “Night M.” During drills, a master texted her slaves “?” and they had 60 seconds to reply “Ready M.”

Trainees who failed had to pay penalties, including fasting, or could face physical punishments, two women said.

In March, Ms. Edmondson arrived for an initiation ceremony at Ms. Salzman’s home in Clifton Park, N.Y., a town about 20 miles north of Albany where Mr. Raniere and some followers live. After undressing, she was led to a candlelit ceremony, where she removed a blindfold and saw Ms. Salzman’s other slaves for the first time. The women were then driven to a nearby house, where the branding took place.

In the spring, the sorority grew as women joined different circles. Slaves added compromising collateral every month to Dropbox accounts, and a Google Document was used to list a timetable for recruiting new slaves, several women said.

Around the same time, an actress, Catherine Oxenberg, said she learned her daughter had been initiated into the sorority.

“I felt sick to my stomach,” said Ms. Oxenberg, who starred in the 1980s television series “Dynasty.”

Ms. Oxenberg had become increasingly concerned about her 26-year-old daughter, India, who looked emaciated from dieting. She told her mother that she had not had a menstrual period for a year and that her hair was falling out.

Ms. Oxenberg said she invited her daughter home in late May to try to get her away from the group.

When Ms. Oxenberg confronted her about the sorority, her daughter defended its practices.

“She said it was a character-building experience,” Ms. Oxenberg said.

‘Humans Can Be Noble’

By the time the secret group was taking shape, Mark Vicente, the filmmaker, had been a faithful follower of Mr. Raniere for more than a decade.

Mr. Vicente said he had been contacted by Ms. Salzman’s mother, Nancy, a co-founder of Nxivm who is known as “Prefect,” after the 2004 release of a documentary he co-directed that explored spirituality and physics.

Soon, Mr. Vicente was taking courses that he said helped him expose his fears and learn strategies that made him feel more resolute.

View all New York Times newsletters.

He also made a documentary called “Encender el Corazón,” or “Ignite the Heart,” which lionized Mr. Raniere’s work in Mexico.

“Keith Raniere is an activist, scientist, philosopher and, above all, humanitarian,” Mr. Vicente says in the film.

Mr. Raniere has used those words to describe himself. On his website, he said he spoke in full sentences by age 1, mastered high school mathematics by 12 and taught himself to play “concert level” piano. At 16, he entered Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.

Before Nxivm, he helped run a company called Consumers’ Buyline Inc., which offered discounts to members on groceries and other products.

In the mid-1990s, several state attorneys general investigated it as a suspected pyramid scheme; Mr. Raniere and his associates agreed to shut it down.

Through Nxivm, Mr. Raniere transformed himself into a New Age teacher with long hair and a guru-like manner of speaking.

“Humans can be noble,” he says on his website. “The question is: will we put forth what is necessary?”

By many accounts, Mr. Raniere sleeps during the day and goes out at night to play volleyball or take female followers for long walks. Several women described him as warm, funny and eager to talk about subjects that interested them.

Others saw a different side. Nxivm sued several former members, accusing them of stealing its trade secrets, among other things.

Mr. Vicente said he was aware of the negative publicity, including a 2012 series by The Albany Times-Union that described alleged abuses inside Nxivm.

Mr. Vicente’s views began to change this year after his wife was ostracized when she left Nxivm and he heard rumors about the secret sorority.

Mr. Vicente said he got evasive answers when he asked Mr. Raniere about the group. Mr. Raniere acknowledged giving “five women permission to do something,” but did not elaborate, other than to say he would investigate, Mr. Vicente said.

Mr. Vicente said he suspected Mr. Raniere was lying to him and might have done so before. Suddenly, self-awareness techniques he had learned felt like tools that had been used to control him.

“No one goes in looking to have their personality stripped away,” he said. “You just don’t realize what is happening.”

Followers Start to Flee

In May, Sarah Edmondson began to recoil from her embrace of the secret society.

Her husband, Anthony Ames, who was also a Nxivm member, learned about her branding and the couple both wanted out.

Before quitting, Mr. Ames went to Nxivm’s offices in Albany to collect money he said the group owed him.

He had his cellphone in his pocket and turned on its recorder.

On the recording, Mr. Ames tells another member that Ms. Edmondson was branded and that other women told him about handing over collateral. “This is criminal,” Mr. Ames says.

The voice of a woman — who Mr. Ames said is Lauren Salzman — is heard trying to calm him. “I don’t think you are open to having a conversation,” she said.

“You are absolutely right, I’m not open to having a conversation,” he replied. “My wife got branded.”

A few days later, many of Mr. Raniere’s followers learned of the secret society from a website run by a Buffalo-area businessman, Frank R. Parlato Jr. Mr. Parlato had been locked in a long legal battle with two sisters, Sara and Clare Bronfman, who are members of Nxivm and the daughters of Edgar Bronfman, the deceased chairman of Seagram Company.

In 2011, the Bronfman sisters sued Mr. Parlato, whom they had hired as a consultant, alleging he had defrauded them of $1 million.

Four years later, in 2015, the Justice Department indicted him on charges of fraud and other crimes arising from alleged activities, including defrauding the Bronfmans. Mr. Parlato has denied the claims and the case is pending.

Mr. Parlato started a website, The Frank Report, which he uses to lambaste prosecutors, Mr. Raniere and the Bronfmans. In early June, Mr. Parlato published the first in a torrent of salacious posts under the headline, “Branded Slaves and Master Raniere.”

A Nxivm follower, Soukaina Mehdaoui, said she reached out to Mr. Raniere after reading the post. Ms. Mehdaoui, 25, was a newcomer to Nxivm, but the two had grown close.

She said Mr. Raniere told her the secret sorority began after three women offered damaging collateral to seal lifetime vows of obedience to him.

While Ms. Mehdaoui had joined the sorority, the women in her circle were not branded. She was appalled.

“There are things I didn’t know that I didn’t sign up for, and I’m not even hearing about it from you,” she texted Mr. Raniere.

Mr. Raniere texted back about his initials and the brand.

By then, panic was spreading inside Nxivm. Slaves were ordered to delete encrypted messages between them and erase Google documents, two women said. To those considering breaking away, it was not clear whom they could trust and who were Nxivm loyalists.

Late one night, Ms. Mehdaoui met secretly with another Nxivm member. They took out their cellphones to show they were not recording the conversation.

Both decided to leave Nxivm, despite concerns that the group would retaliate by releasing their “collateral” or suing them.

Ms. Mehdaoui said that when she went to say goodbye to Mr. Raniere, he urged her to stay.

“Do you think, I’m bad, I don’t agree with abuses,” she recalled him saying. He said the group “gives women tools to be powerful, to regain their power for the sake of building love.”

Nxivm recently filed criminal complaints with the Vancouver police against Ms. Edmondson and two other women accusing them of mischief and other crimes in connection with the firm’s now-closed center there, according to Ms. Edmondson. The women have denied the allegations. A spokesman for the Vancouver police declined to comment.

Ms. Edmondson and other former followers of Mr. Raniere said they were focusing on recovering.

Q. How do people die from diabetes?

A. People who have diabetes cannot regulate their blood sugar levels and if the disease isn’t tightly controlled, blood sugar can spike to abnormally high levels, a condition called hyperglycemia, or dip below normal, a condition called hypoglycemia. Both conditions are potentially life-threatening and can lead to coma and death if not promptly treated.

But complications resulting from the disease are a more common cause of death. Heart disease strikes people with diabetes at significantly higher rates than people without diabetes, “and we don’t fully know why,” said Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. People with diabetes develop heart disease at younger ages and are nearly twice as likely to die of heart attack or stroke as people who do not have diabetes.

People with Type 2 diabetes, which is the more common form of the disease, are more likely to have elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity, Dr. Gabbay said, all risk factors for cardiovascular disease. “The good news,” he said, “is that a lot of treatments, like those for lowering cholesterol, are even more effective at lowering risk in people with diabetes than in people without.” Some new classes of diabetes medications used for Type 2 diabetes have also been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk, he said.

People with Type 1 diabetes are also at increased risk for heart disease, though the reasons are less clear.

Both types of diabetes can also lead to other long-term complications, like kidney disease, that may result in premature death. Problems like vision loss, nerve damage and infections that may lead to amputations can increase the likelihood of injuries and accidents. Good disease management starting early in the disease process helps people avoid some of these complications, Dr. Gabbay said.

MONDAY PUZZLES — If you make odd connections between things as I do, the crossword might bring out different things for you. Jennifer Nutt, who wrote today’s lovely Monday crossword, probably did not have this in mind when she created it, but her puzzle brought this up for me, so I’m going to tell you a story.

The first time I visited Cape Town, I took the ferry to Robben Island to see the prison — now a museum — where former South African president Nelson Mandela and many others who resisted the National Party during the apartheid era were held. It’s the kind of thing that is expected of first-time visitors (“Oh, you must go!”) and I’m a student of history, so I climbed aboard the boat and off I went.

Cape Town is a very windy city because of its location between the mountains and the sea, and on that day, the wind was working against the ferry as it made its way across the water. With no warning, a pod of humpback whales appeared in the water at the front of the boat, and skimmed over the water toward the island, almost as if to lead us in. When we slowed down, they would loop back and continue to guide us. It was a very touching sight, almost as if they were saying, “Follow us. There are secrets to be told here.” Once we were close to the shore, they dispersed and made their way back out to sea.

The tour, which is more a heartbreaking example of man’s inhumanity to man than a tourist trap curiosity, lasted about an hour and included talks by both former prisoners and the Afrikaaner guards who had held them captive. They had returned to educate mostly foreign visitors about a relatively recent period in history (1948 — 1994) where a nationalist government had succeeded in discriminating despicably against black Africans and criminalizing interaction between the races. There were also a surprising number of white South Africans in our group.

Mr. Taylor, speaking earlier this month at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, suggested he might embrace that tradition.","Mr. Powell, who joined the Fed in 2012, has generally supported the Fed’s expansive efforts to stimulate growth. Analysts regard him as likely to continue the Fed’s gradual unwinding of that campaign, although perhaps pressing to raise interest rates a little more quickly.

“Our view is Powell is the G.O.P. version of Yellen, with the added kicker of wanting to reduce regulation,” said Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at RBC Capital Markets. He said Mr. Powell was “the easy choice if you want to maintain continuity.”

But some Republicans in Congress and some of Mr. Trump’s advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, want to overhaul the central bank, beginning right at the top.

Mr. Taylor has been one of the Fed’s most outspoken critics in recent years, repeatedly arguing that its stimulus campaign has done little good, considerable harm and should be ended as soon as possible. He also advocates structural reforms to prevent a repeat.

He says the Fed helped to cause the 2008 financial crisis and then impeded recovery. “One clear lesson from this historical experience is that the Fed should normalize policy and get back to the kind of policy that worked well in the past,” he said in March.

Mr. Taylor’s signature proposal is that the central bank should adopt a policy rule — a mathematical formula to guide the movement of its benchmark rate. Mr. Taylor, who developed the first such rule in the early 1990s, argues that this would make monetary policy more predictable and thus more effective.

Because such rules are calibrated in normal times, that approach could have curtailed the Fed’s stimulus campaign. Mr. Taylor’s rule, for example, suggests the Fed by now should have raised its benchmark rate to around 3.5 percent. The rate currently sits between 1 percent and 1.25 percent.

Mr. Powell, along with most Fed officials, argues that policy rules are useful benchmarks, but human judgment is indispensable. “Simple policy rules are widely thought to be both interesting and useful, but to represent only a small part of the analysis needed to assess the appropriate path for policy,” he said in February. “I am unable to think of any critical, complex human activity that could be safely reduced to a simple summary equation.”

Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Fed, estimated last year that if the Fed had followed Mr. Taylor’s rule, 2.5 million more Americans would still have been unemployed, “enough to fill all 31 N.F.L. stadiums at the same time.”

Mr. Taylor also favors restraints on other aspects of the Fed’s post-crisis response, including the bond-buying campaign it undertook known as quantitative easing.

Mr. Taylor warned repeatedly at the time that the purchases would result in inflation. “We’ve got a high inflation down the road for sure,” he said in June 2010. “When it will come, I can’t predict. But unless there’s a change in policy we’re going to have inflation like back in the 1970s, or even more.”

Instead, inflation has been persistently sluggish.

Mr. Taylor has since argued the purchases did no good and that the Fed should be restricted from buying mortgage bonds, because that provides support for a particular kind of borrowing — a decision that belongs to fiscal policymakers.

He also wants to reverse a recent change in the mechanics of monetary policy. The Fed bought bonds from banks by increasing the reserves those banks hold at the Fed. That surge in reserve balances made it impossible to raise rates by limiting the availability of reserves, the traditional method, so instead the Fed paid banks not to use the reserves.

Mr. Taylor wants the Fed to revert to the minimalist mechanics.

Mr. Powell, by contrast, has defended the utility of the bond-buying campaign and argued that the new mechanics allow the Fed to control interest rates more effectively.

Theorizing about changing monetary policy is far easier than acting on it and academics who become policymakers often adopt a more pragmatic approach. Ben S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, argued in the early 2000s that Japan should consider drastic actions to revive inflation. When he confronted weak inflation as Fed chairman, he did not attempt to pursue those policies.

Mr. Taylor, speaking earlier this month at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, suggested he might embrace that tradition. “I don’t think of policy rules as tying central bankers’ hands,” he said. “I’ve never thought of rules as tying central bankers’ hands. To me, they are ways of making monetary policy better.”

Mr. Taylor also could find himself constrained by the Federal Open Market Committee, the group that sets Fed policy. As chairman he would set the committee agenda and run its meetings. Importantly, he would also direct the work of the Fed’s staff, which produces the forecasts and background materials that undergird policy decisions.

Still, Mr. Trump has an opportunity to markedly reshape the Fed. There are currently just four members of the seven-member board, including Ms. Yellen and Mr. Powell. Mr. Trump’s first pick for the board, Randal K. Quarles, the Fed’s vice chairman of supervision, has expressed support for Mr. Taylor’s approach to monetary policy. The remaining member, Lael Brainard, whose term expires in 2026, has said the Fed should take a cautious approach to raising rates.

Still, five regional presidents also vote at each policy meeting, which would help blunt any rapid change in approach.

“There’s a lot of continuity at the Fed,” John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a recent interview. “None of us are going anywhere, meaning the presidents. We have a deep bench of very professional staff and so I think that the idea that suddenly the Fed turns on a dime if certain positions change is not really accurate. It’s a consensus-driven organization.”",Trump’s Fed Finalists Offer a Clear Choice: Status Quo or Significant Change,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/trump-fed-powell-taylor-yellen.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Since the congress’s 2,300 delegates are carefully chosen for loyalty, very few oppose changes once they are proposed by the leadership.

What do these changes really mean?

A key phrase here is “new era,” one that Mr. Xi has used throughout the congress, which began last week. Mr. Xi has described Chinese history since 1949 as divided into two eras: the three decades after Mao seized power in a revolution that established a unified People’s Republic and ended nearly a century of civil war and foreign invasions, and the three decades after Deng took power in 1978 and refocused China on developing its economy.

Mr. Xi has signaled he is launching China into a new, third era. In his report to the congress, Mr. Xi suggested that if Mao made China independent, and Deng made it prosperous, he would make it strong again. Restoring China to greatness is a central message of “Xi Jinping Thought,” and a goal that has already guided Mr. Xi’s policies of building up the military, strengthening domestic controls and raising China’s profile in global affairs.

To underline that point, the congress also added a second mention of Mr. Xi’s ideas to the constitution: his call to modernize and strengthen China’s armed forces.

By enshrining Mr. Xi’s ideas as “a new component of the party’s guide for action,” the party is putting Mr. Xi on a doctrinal pedestal alongside Mao and Deng. Until Tuesday, those were the only two Chinese leaders whose names appeared in the constitution’s list of fundamental doctrines, which mentions “Mao Zedong Thought” and “Deng Xiaoping Theory.” Adding Mr. Xi by name also raises him above his two most recent predecessors, the former presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao: Their ideas are on the list of doctrines, but not their names.

In the near future, Chinese people are likely to refer to Mr. Xi’s doctrine of a reinvigorated China as simply “Xi Jinping Thought,” a flattering echo of “Mao Zedong Thought.”

Does this mean Mr. Xi is as powerful as Mao was in his day?

It’s not that simple. After he came to power in 2012, Mr. Xi surprised many people with how quickly and forcefully he asserted control. This included putting his imprint on two of China’s most powerful institutions, the party and the military, which he did using a sweeping anticorruption drive.

But the basis of his rule is different from Mao’s, and even Deng’s. Both of those leaders were founders of the People’s Republic, and hardened revolutionaries whose decades of fighting and self-sacrifice gave them a charisma and authority that Mr. Xi simply cannot replicate. For all his power, Mr. Xi does not have the almost godlike presence that Mao once had.

On the other hand, the Chinese economy, state and military are much more powerful now than they were under Mao, or even under Deng, which gives Mr. Xi far more global clout than his predecessors.

What other decisions did the party congress make?

The congress finished on Tuesday with several other major steps. Most important, the delegates voted in a new Central Committee, a council of 204 senior central and local officials who usually meet once a year to approve broad policy priorities.

There was a notable absence on that list: Wang Qishan.

Mr. Wang, 69, was the enforcer in Mr. Xi’s drive to root out corruption and strengthen discipline in the party. He has passed the usual retirement age for the committee, but party insiders had said that Mr. Xi might try to keep him in a senior position. His absence from the list means he will probably retire.

How will changing the party constitution affect how China is run?

Mr. Xi’s vision of a resurgent China will now permeate all party indoctrination in schools, the media and government agencies. With the conclusion of the congress, the party and the Chinese news media will begin a national drive to promote its decisions, and especially the elevation of Mr. Xi.

But many Chinese people will also closely watch the announcement on Wednesday of new members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the party’s top rung of power, for signs of how far Mr. Xi can get his way in promoting political allies. That will be a sign of how much power he really has behind the welter of propaganda.",China Enshrines ‘Xi Jinping Thought.’ What Does That Mean?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-constitution.html

Speaking of putting one’s life on the line, Sgt. La David T. Johnson was the soldier killed early this month in Niger, along with three other American servicemen. Trump, after consulting John F. Kelly, his chief of staff, elected to call the soldier’s widow, Myeshia Johnson, to express his condolences, a risky undertaking for a man who knows nothing of dignity. The president, predictably, blew it.

He said Sergeant Johnson knew what he signed up for. (Trump denies this, but Kelly confirmed the president used these words.)

Wilson, the congresswoman, is a family friend of the Johnsons. She listened to the call. She told reporters about the offense given to the widow. This enraged Trump, who deployed his “wacky” epithet, and upset Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general whose son was killed in Afghanistan. Kelly unwisely decided to come to the defense of his boss.

Kelly’s speech the other day was moving at the outset in its description of ritual and loss. He spoke of “the most important phone calls” for any grieving family. His gravitas was a reminder of all that has been lost in the tacky Trump White House. But then he descended into gross, unprofessional calumny.

Alluding to Wilson’s speech at the dedication in 2015 of an F.B.I. building in South Florida, named for two fallen agents, Kelly described the congresswoman as an “empty barrel” who was “making the most noise.” He falsely accused her of bragging about securing $20 million for the building and of saying she’d twisted President Barack Obama’s arm for funding.

Semper Fi. Well, Semper Fi-ish. Kelly owes Wilson an apology.

There’s a video of Wilson’s speech. She’s wearing a red hat. She’s brash. Kelly evidently found her tone inappropriate. But she did what people do at a ribbon-cutting ceremony, acknowledging lawmakers of both parties, and did not utter the words attributed to her by Kelly.

“Empty barrel” is interesting. Barrels are often locked in the dark in cellars and warehouses. They evoke guns, too. Wilson is black. The Johnsons are black. This is a president who laces contempt for African-Americans into everyday discourse. Lying about them, disparaging them, dehumanizing them, is just business as usual. Why should a four-star general bestir himself over getting his facts wrong or describing a black woman as a barrel?

Because Kelly has some notion of the American idea, knows the military depends on equal value being given to every life, and must understand that when truth dies America is lost.

The empty-barrel bone-spur bozo at the White House can’t apologize or get that. It’s beyond him.

Here’s McCain speaking this month on the America that’s bigger than Trump:

“To refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain ‘the last best hope of earth’ for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history. We live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil.”

While Hungary, Slovakia and Poland have taken the authoritarian route, the Czech Republic, with its more secular, democratic grounding, long seemed like the best hope for a bridge between the two sides. But the victory by Ano and its billionaire leader, Andrej Babis, make that unlikely.

People who know Mr. Babis’s business style warn that he is a ruthless businessman, more interested in expanding his personal power than in furthering the common good. Apart from an empire in agricultural industry, he owns several newspapers and a radio station. After allegations of tax fraud, he was removed as minister of finance in May. There are also investigations into claims that Mr. Babis illegally received European Union subsidies for one of his hotels.

Yet all of this does not seem to impair his popularity. On the contrary, in the eyes of many Czechs it makes Mr. Babis one of them, a guy who stands up against the bigotry and double standards of the establishment, or, as one slogan goes, against the Prague “coffeehouse thugs.” Almost 30 years after the Velvet Revolution of 1989, the heritage of freedom fighters like Vaclav Havel has been replaced by the chauvinism of the underdog.

Of course, a certain disillusionment with the promises of the West is understandable. When today’s Visegrad states joined the European Union 13 years ago, they expected stability. Instead they joined a club that soon slipped into permanent crisis mode, first over the future of the eurozone and then over the mass influx of migrants. Freedom, it turned out, did not mean security — just new insecurities. To many Central Europeans, it was shocking to learn that you could be part of the West and still fear being left behind.

Along with that shock came a lack of cultural preparedness for the new competitiveness. Forty years of Communism left people with an immense distrust of one another and of the political class. The era of totalitarianism was never really processed. Even young Czechs, who did not experience Communist rule as adults (if at all), describe their society as being shot through with distrust, leaving them wary of their neighbors.

Czech society places a premium on scapegoating and victimization, says Erik Tabery, the editor in chief of Respekt, a newsmagazine based in Prague. In his book “The Left Nation,” Mr. Tabery argues that the Czech Republic needs a more proactive, cooperative foreign policy that will push the country farther into the West. But he admits that positions like this have left him and like-minded colleagues very lonely in Prague.

It is true that Western Europe has cared too little for its new Eastern members since they joined the union, and it is understandable that many there feel treated like second-class Europeans. The West never took seriously the different experiences and legacies east of the Elbe River. American soldiers never set foot there after 1945, nor was there a 1968 generation to force a phase of messy, republican puberty.

The episode doesn’t beat around the booby-trapped bush, placing the newly allied forces on a collision course with Negan and his Saviors that comes to a head before the end credits roll. After outfitting their cars with protective plating — a sight reminiscent of the caravans of covered wagons common in early America, the latest example of the show’s continuing fixation on Western imagery — the protagonist band takes the fight to Negan and offers him one last chance of surrender. He, rather impolitely, rebuffs them.

A full-on firefight breaks out once the Hilltop folks pledge their allegiance to Maggie over the craven Gregory, and everyone reaffirms that the time for diplomacy has long since passed. And that’s only one prong of this episode’s multiple-front climax, a carefully orchestrated set piece synchronizing the long-awaited Negan showdown with an elaborate scheme executed by Daryl and his skeleton crew.

While Rick brings an active offensive to Negan, Daryl joins forces with Morgan, Carol and Tara in order to round up and funnel the zombies toward the enemy compound. Nicotero capitalizes on this thread for some of the hour’s more striking photography; one diagonally bisected frame shows Carol and a Twizzler-snacking Tara casually lounging on a roof while zombies swarm below them.

In the sequence most likely to inspire cheers among fans, Daryl lures the undead herd in the direction of the fray by using a trail of ignited gas cans. Valiantly sharpshooting each target from his motorcycle, tearing on unfazed by the explosions like the post-apocalyptic cowboy he is — that’s the “Walking Dead” that fans were demanding more of during last season’s doldrums. Just when stringing along a patient, devoted fan base appeared to emerge as this show’s modus operandi, the writers have recommitted to shorter-term gratification. If moving chess pieces around the board is to be an episode’s main work, it’s got to have its fun doing so.

The conflict between Rick and Negan will clearly provide the backbone of the season to come, this hour’s skirmish being the opening salvo in a longer and more grueling campaign. The friction between the two groups of humans even threatens to eclipse the zombies themselves, turning the decomposing mob into a variable that one camp can direct against the other. The impending encounters between the armies have tilted the show’s entire axis, instantly creating new partnerships and altering the overall dynamics of power. (“We all just met each other,” one young soldier states. They have no choice but to place faith in one another.)

The days ahead look dark and lethal. There’s no way Negan will be bested as easily as he seemed to be during this episode’s brief run-in, and the tricks up his sleeve are sure to be grisly. On “The Walking Dead,” a new season guarantees a few things: some major character deaths, long passages of unbearably charged silence, gallows wisdom about the value of life.

A Few Thoughts While We Survey the Wreckage

• As fans online have already noted from a preview clip, this episode’s footage of Carl wandering though a zombie-remains-strewn auto graveyard in search of fuel mirrors a similar scene from the show’s pilot, shot for shot. While Nicotero has confirmed that he mounted the homage as a special treat for the show’s hundredth episode, there’s something to be said here about Carl’s inheriting cycles of violence and tragedy from his father. Throughout the series, Rick has been motivated by the hope of leaving a better world for his son. This may be the season he accepts that his dream has become impossible.

• The episode is dedicated to the memory of two men: John Bernecker, a 33-year-old stuntman who tragically died in an accident while shooting the new season in July; and filmmaker George Romero, whose zombie ur-text “Night of the Living Dead” laid much of the rusted, blood-spattered track this program has followed.

• Gabriel is left in dire straits at the conclusion of the episode, escaping the zombie horde only to find himself trapped with Negan in a grim “out of the frying pan, into the fire” scenario. Whether Negan’s line about Gabriel having worn the proper pants for soiling himself amuses or not will vary by viewer.",‘The Walking Dead’ Season Premiere Recap: A World at War,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/arts/television/the-walking-dead-recap-mercy-season-8-premiere.html

Two years ago, Volkswagen admitted that it had used software to illegally evade diesel emissions in the United States, and studies by multiple European governments have since found that BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen took advantage of European Union loopholes to weaken a car’s emissions controls outside of test environments.

Even as it faced new scrutiny in Europe, Volkswagen moved a step closer to putting the emissions scandal behind it in the United States, as the automaker received approval from federal and California regulators for its proposed repairs to reduce harmful emissions from 38,000 diesel-powered sport utility vehicles.

The approval, issued jointly on Friday by the Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board and disclosed Monday, will spare Volkswagen from the expense of buying back the affected models.

In addition, owners will receive roughly $7,000 to $16,000 each, depending on the vehicle’s year and model.

Volkswagen is awaiting approval for proposed repairs to passenger cars with the same engine. Last year, it reached a separate settlement requiring it to buy back 475,000 vehicles with 2.0-liter engines that emit unsafe levels of pollutants.

That settlement was part of about $25 billion in fines and other costs that Volkswagen has agreed to pay to address claims brought by consumers, regulators and states in connection with the company’s scheme to evade federal emissions rules with so-called defeat devices in diesel vehicles.

The Democrats will clearly have the money to compete in expensive markets like Los Angeles and New York. They’ve posted staggering fund-raising totals in many of the best-educated districts, often outpacing longtime Republican congressman. If anything, Democrats might have the opposite problem in these well-educated areas: too many viable candidates.

In Orange County, Calif., Democratic challengers have outraised Republican incumbents by a two-to-one margin this year, even though the Republicans got a head start before their Democratic challengers entered the race. But there’s a catch: There are 15 Democratic candidates who have raised more than $100,000 in just those four districts, setting up a series of costly primaries that might ultimately prove detrimental to the party’s general election chances. There’s a similar pattern in well-educated districts across the county.

The abundance of Democratic challengers in these well-educated districts is a reflection of huge enthusiasm. In these areas, there’s no shortage of well-to-do and well-connected political novices looking to “do something” about Mr. Trump’s presidency, just as there was no shortage of well-educated Democrats lining up for the Jan. 21 Women’s March or donating to the campaign of Jon Ossoff in Georgia’s Sixth District special election.

Few established politicians are standing in the way of these political newcomers. The Democratic bench is quite weak in these traditionally Republican and often heavily gerrymandered areas. There are no obvious contenders strong enough to clear the field.

The enthusiasm among well-educated Democrats and the relative lack of success recruiting established politicians in working-class areas has occasionally led to an odd mismatch: affluent, liberal types running in working-class districts. Take Josh Harder, who worked for a San Francisco venture capital firm but is now running in California’s typically competitive 10th district in the Central Valley, or ex-Obama administration officials like Elissa Slotkin, Lauren Baer and Andy Kim, who are running in middle-class districts in Michigan, Florida and New Jersey.

The good news for Democrats is that they don’t need perfect recruits to pull off big wins if it’s a so-called wave election year. Mr. Ossoff was a true political novice and still came close to winning, and the 2006 and 2010 wave midterm elections are full of examples of fairly weak recruits who pulled off important victories.

Insure Yourself

Weddings today can be as expensive as a car, sometimes even more, so protect your investment. Purchase wedding insurance. It isn’t very expensive, Ms. Gregoli said, but it may protect against any unexpected events. It starts at about $150 for a basic policy, but rates go up based on such things as location, the number of guests and whether the event is inside or outside in a tent. The total cost of the wedding will also affect the rate: A $10,000 even is going to carry a lower premium than one costing $150,000.

Insurance can offer peace of mind. For example, if the space you booked for your wedding is destroyed by a hurricane or fire, a good insurance policy will cover the costs of rescheduling and reimburse you for any lost deposits. (It will even cover things like losing the rings before the wedding or if a bride’s gown is lost in baggage.)

Find Out Who’s in Charge

If there is an extreme event — an act of terrorism, say, something weather-related, or a fire — don’t rely on hotel wedding planners. Often, the general manager will have clearer answers, Ms. Gregoli said.

One month after Hurricane Maria passed over Anguilla, Ms. Gregoli and one of her couples had a conference call with the general manager at a resort on the island. They needed to know specifics about the damage: Is it landscaping and trees that were hardest hit — or is there structural damage? Would the ferry dock be rebuilt in time to accept guests? Lucky for this particular bride and groom, the general manager confirmed all repairs would be finished for their June 2018 nuptials. But another one of Ms. Gregoli’s clients, whose wedding was booked in December at the Ritz Carlton in St. Thomas, in the United States Virgin Islands, wasn’t as fortuitous. That couple had to reschedule for the following year.

Read contracts carefully. In an extreme event, what is the wedding site’s obligation to keep you informed?

Sonia Byck-Barwick of Paradise Ridge Vineyards, which was devastated in the early days of the wildfires in Santa Rosa, Calif., asserted that refunding any and all deposits the winery had collected for upcoming weddings was a top priority. Weddings were a major part of the boutique winery’s business; it had 24 already booked for 2018, plus 8 to 10 in the remainder of 2017 (including one on Oct. 14).

Backup Plan

Have an alternate plan. If you can’t make it to your destination is there somewhere you can marry locally?

Roya Soleimani and Andrew Charles Winner, who live in San Francisco, had planned their wedding for Oct. 15 at Chardonnay Golf Club in Napa County. They hoped to stick to their original plans until the preceding Thursday, when Mr. Winner’s brother, a firefighter in San Rafael, Calif., engaged in fighting the blaze, told them it was time to call it.

“I was researching the best respiratory masks to buy for our guests and vendors,” said Ms. Soleimani, 32, a corporate communications manager at Google.org. “We were starting to realize that the idea of celebrating in Napa, when all of this was going on, just didn’t feel right.” (The couple is quick to point out that their original venue and vendors offered full refunds, nearly across the board.)

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — I like to think of myself as a “word person” — someone who knows and loves words — but every once in a while, that perception gets jolted. As in most areas of life, we soon learn that no matter how smart we think we are, there are always those who are smarter. There are word people and then there are people who really, really know their words.

I bring this up because I was fortunate to have a few rounds of email correspondence with one of the constructors of today’s puzzle — he happens to be making his New York Times Crossword debut. Each time he wrote, I found myself running to the dictionary to look up at least one of the words that flowed effortlessly from his fingers. And the thing is, he wasn’t doing it to look smart. John Lithgow just is smart.

But at least I now know what a “Savoyard” is. If that makes no sense to you right now, wait until you get to 41D.

中国女性史诗小说《喜福会》的作者谭恩美(Amy Tan)在近期出版的回忆录中提到了她的祖母，一位死于可能是故意吸食鸦片过量的“concubine”。这个词通常被翻译为“妾”。在韦氏词典里，它的含义是：

A woman with whom a man cohabits without being married: such as

a：one having a recognized social status in a household below that of a wife

b：a mistress

一个与一名男性同居，但非对方妻子的女人：比如

a：一个家庭里社会地位被认为低于妻子的女人。

b：一个情妇

妾是一个男人的性伴侣，被期望为他生儿育女，却得不到妻子一般的地位认可和继承权。

中国的历史里有许多著名的妾室，比如清朝晚期的慈禧，她是咸丰皇帝的妃子，在作家张戎的笔下，她是一位开启了现代中国的“concubine”。另一位被赋予这个名称的女人是汉末的虞姬。陈凯歌导演的电影《霸王别姬》的英文译名为“Farewell, My Concubine”, 正是这部电影将这个过时的英文词语介绍给了许多观众，一些人也把这个形象与一个落后的中国联系了起来。

Heart disease strikes people with diabetes at significantly higher rates than people without diabetes, “and we don’t fully know why,” said Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston.
People with diabetes develop heart disease at younger ages and are nearly twice as likely to die of heart attack or stroke as people who do not have diabetes.

Q. How do people die from diabetes?

A. People who have diabetes cannot regulate their blood sugar levels and if the disease isn’t tightly controlled, blood sugar can spike to abnormally high levels, a condition called hyperglycemia, or dip below normal, a condition called hypoglycemia. Both conditions are potentially life-threatening and can lead to coma and death if not promptly treated.

But complications resulting from the disease are a more common cause of death. Heart disease strikes people with diabetes at significantly higher rates than people without diabetes, “and we don’t fully know why,” said Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. People with diabetes develop heart disease at younger ages and are nearly twice as likely to die of heart attack or stroke as people who do not have diabetes.

People with Type 2 diabetes, which is the more common form of the disease, are more likely to have elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity, Dr. Gabbay said, all risk factors for cardiovascular disease. “The good news,” he said, “is that a lot of treatments, like those for lowering cholesterol, are even more effective at lowering risk in people with diabetes than in people without.” Some new classes of diabetes medications used for Type 2 diabetes have also been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk, he said.

People with Type 1 diabetes are also at increased risk for heart disease, though the reasons are less clear.

Both types of diabetes can also lead to other long-term complications, like kidney disease, that may result in premature death. Problems like vision loss, nerve damage and infections that may lead to amputations can increase the likelihood of injuries and accidents. Good disease management starting early in the disease process helps people avoid some of these complications, Dr. Gabbay said.

Nearly a month has passed since Stephen Paddock opened fire on a country music festival at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more — yet the shooting continues to confound the public and investigators alike. Little is known about Mr. Paddock’s motives. And investigators have revised parts of the timeline of the shooting on three occasions, raising further questions about what exactly happened.



During continuing investigations into major events, traditional reporting often relies in part on official statements from law enforcement officers. But in this case, faced with shifting reports, The New York Times wanted to try to establish a timeline independent of that offered by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.

The Times’s video unit, where I am a producer focused on visual and open data investigations, turned to a relatively new technique: investigative video reporting, or so-called video forensics, pioneered and developed by a small community of human rights groups and niche social journalism outlets over the last decade. Its greatest value is in documenting hard-to-reach places like war zones, but the tools can be used wherever there’s an abundance of visual evidence. (In May, a Times video debunked Syria and Russia’s claims about a chemical weapons attack; in June, another video identified 24 men, including members of the Turkish president’s security detail, who attacked protesters outside the Turkish ambassador’s Washington residence.)

The approach makes use of every available piece of data in a given set of video files: the videos themselves and every pixel we see in the images, but also the audio tracks and the metadata — timestamps, geolocation information — embedded in the files. The files can come from social media uploads or submissions from witnesses themselves (most cellphone videos log the hour, minute and second they were recorded in file data).

The process can be as simple as comparing a video with Google Street View to identify camera location or extracting file data with a smartphone app — or as difficult as analyzing each frame of a video and the amplitude and frequency of every second of audio.

For our video investigation on the Mandalay Bay shooting, published over the weekend, I gathered and annotated dozens of videos and audio clips recorded at various locations — inside the festival, at the hotel itself and on Las Vegas Boulevard and Giles Street, where the police responded and concertgoers fled. And I searched social platforms and downloaded clips that were verified by wire services, ending up with well over an hour of footage and two hours of police scanner and fire scanner audio.","Reporting on Las Vegas, Pixel by Pixel",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/insider/reporting-on-las-vegas-pixel-by-pixel.html

As a result of the violation, race officials said, they reworked the rules to establish clearer standards for what constitutes a violation and for how a musher’s culpability can be proved or disproved. The revision to the regulation, known as Rule 39, stipulates penalties for violations, including disqualification or even a ban from future competition.

According to the committee’s statement that identified Seavey, he denied that he had administered the drug and said that doing so would have been irrational since he was aware of the testing. He said that Tramadol, in his opinion, would not give him a competitive advantage, according to the statement.

But in his video, Seavey went further, calling the proceedings “a cancer” on the sport and saying he believes the positive test was the result of a malicious attack from either another musher or from one of the protest groups that wants to harm the Iditarod. He said he was told in April about the positive result and had tried to work with the board to make the information public in order to exonerate himself but that the board would not work with him. He also said he expected ramifications for speaking up.

“I fully expect that after this I will be banned from the Iditarod based on the gag rule,” he said, making reference to a rule he claimed prevents mushers from discussing internal matters.

The committee initially kept Seavey’s identity secret, but after an emergency session on Monday they reversed course and named him because of a “level of unhealthy speculation involved in this matter.”

The pressure had come largely from the Iditarod Official Finishers Club, which issued a statement signed by 83 current and former competitors demanding the identity of the musher in question be revealed.

“It is unacceptable that multiple dogs tested positive for a drug in a single musher’s team and that that information was only recently made public when it was known since shortly after the team finished,” the statement said.

That it was a member of the Seavey family adds a great deal of weight to the issue, considering their importance to the race’s history. Dallas Seavey, 30, was the youngest musher to win the Iditarod when he captured the 2012 title, and he also won in 2014, 2015 and 2016. His father has three titles, as well as the world record time.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

Photo

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

Photo

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

That investor was angered at how poorly his business was doing and wanted to get back at Mr. Guo, according to Mr. Guo and his lawyers.
In 2015, a court convicted Mr. Guo for illegally occupying farmland and sentenced him to two years in prison, according to court documents.
Most of the assets have been returned to Mr. Guo, according to Mr. Zhang.
Mr. Guo said the authorities had not returned $450,000 in cash, six villas in Kunming and three apartments in Chongqing.","“They are getting nervous about how powerful these companies are becoming,” said Gary Rieschel, founder of Qiming Venture Partners, a Seattle-based venture capital company that invests in Chinese start-ups. Citing China’s two biggest internet companies, he added, “You look at the most valuable companies in the world, and after Amazon, Google and Facebook, you then have Tencent and Alibaba.”

China is showing signs that it is aware of unease in the private sector, which could become a problem as the country looks for new ways to grow. In an unusual move in September, China’s top leaders sought to assure entrepreneurs that it would support and protect their rights, a statement that cheered Mr. Guo.

“The central government’s policy is very positive,” Mr. Guo said. “But what is key is the issue of enforcement. The gap between the central government and local governments is still quite large.”

The government has also made it easier for small businesses to get loans and stepped up the country’s once-weak intellectual property laws. In a speech at the opening of the Communist Party Congress on Wednesday, Mr. Xi said the party would “inspire and protect the spirit of entrepreneurship.”

Private businesses have become a major driver of China’s development. They underpin its thriving internet scene and its growing consumer culture. Economists generally say China should give private businesses a greater role in a country that still relies on bloated state-run industries.

At the same time, China’s business tycoons have become a powerful constituency. The country now has 647 billionaires in American dollar terms, according to The Hurun Report, which tracks wealth in China.

But the political environment remains perilous for many. Two prominent Chinese businessmen — Xiao Jianhua and Wu Xiaohui — have not been seen in months since they were taken away for questioning. Guo Wengui, a billionaire developer who has accused Chinese officials of corruption, is seeking political asylum in the United States. Last year, party officials put Ren Zhiqiang, an outspoken property tycoon, on probation as a party member for one year after he criticized Mr. Xi’s propaganda policies.

“Clearly, there’s been a willingness to let these guys flourish but, at the same time, a desire to neutralize them as an independent political force,” said Arthur Kroeber, a founding partner of the Beijing-based research firm Gavekal Dragonomics.

Analysts say the state intervention has resulted in entrepreneurs’ losing confidence in China’s future. Private-sector investment has been weak, and many tycoons have parked their money abroad should they run afoul of the government.

Many others choose to simply lie low. “The savvy entrepreneurs have already worked out which way the wind is blowing,” said Rupert Hoogewerf, Hurun’s chairman.

Mo Shaoping, a prominent human rights lawyer who represents Guo Junwen, said many of his entrepreneur clients were insecure. Looming over them is the fear that the government might make them pay for their “original sin” — crimes including bribery and fraud related to actions they took before China more clearly codified what is legal and what is not.

Mr. Mo is skeptical about the government’s claim to protect entrepreneurs, citing the lack of enforcement of private property rights. “In reality, the implementation of it has been terrible,” he said. “It’s equivalent to wastepaper.”

Mr. Guo was one of China’s new generation of entrepreneurs. In 1990, he toured the United States and was struck by its trappings of middle-class comfort. After that trip, he set up a computer company.

To register it, Mr. Guo had to go to 28 government departments to get his documents stamped with official seals, he said. He struggled to get bank loans at a time when the government was lending mostly to state-owned companies.

He set up a real estate company in 1993 and moved into hotel management four years later, owning four hotels across China. His company, Chongqing Xiya Industrial Group, employed more than 3,000 people.

He also built ties to government officials, but he felt he could not bridge the deep mistrust.

“Some officials who encounter entrepreneurs avoid us like we are the god of plague,” Mr. Guo said.

His troubles began in 2008 after he sold a real estate project to a politically connected buyer in Kunming. That investor was angered at how poorly his business was doing and wanted to get back at Mr. Guo, according to Mr. Guo and his lawyers. Officials in Kunming did not respond to requests for comment, and Mr. Guo’s account of the dispute could not be independently verified.

In 2014, prosecutors in Kunming impounded the company’s hotels and real estate projects. In 2015, a court convicted Mr. Guo for illegally occupying farmland and sentenced him to two years in prison, according to court documents. He lost an appeal but was released in January 2016 for time served.

Zhang Dongshuo, Mr. Guo’s other lawyer, said the asset seizure violated Chinese law because the court never convicted his client of fraud. Most of the assets have been returned to Mr. Guo, according to Mr. Zhang. Mr. Guo said the authorities had not returned $450,000 in cash, six villas in Kunming and three apartments in Chongqing.

A party member for more than three decades, before he went into business, Mr. Guo said he was encouraged by the government’s talk about entrepreneur rights. He said he looked forward to the day the party would elevate businesspeople to be senior politicians, citing President Trump as an example.

“Look at Trump, a businessman who could even become president,” Mr. Guo said. “For us to be like America in recognizing the importance of entrepreneurs, I think we still need a little more time.”",China’s Entrepreneurs Squirm Under Xi Jinping’s Tightening Grip,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/world/asia/china-xi-business-entrepreneurs.html

SPECIAL POST — A team from Japan won the 26th World Puzzle Championship, which ended Saturday in Bangalore, India. The U.S.A. and Germany finished second and third.

The three-day competition — a companion to the World Sudoku Championship, held earlier in the week — drew 169 contestants from 27 countries. Over three days, the competitors tackled more than 300 pencil-and-paper puzzles involving logic, numbers and pictures. There were no crosswords or other puzzles testing vocabulary or knowledge, so everyone could compete on an equal basis irrespective of language or nationality.

In some rounds, lasting up to 60 minutes, the puzzles were so challenging that many contestants scored zero points. Three example puzzles from the competition, not the hardest ones, appear below.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Once again, we have a lesson in paying attention and reading clues or any notes associated with the puzzle carefully. There’s got to be a reason the Across clues are so ... terse.

You did see the note, right? It says “The one-word Across clues all have an unusual relationship with their answers.” No kidding. That unusual relationship is for you to deduce, and when you do, prepare for a fun “Aha!” moment.

Today’s puzzle isn’t all that difficult once you get the hang of the theme, and the crossings are relatively gentle. If you’ve been looking forward to training your brain to think of alternate meanings in clues, this one by Alex Eaton-Salners might be just the Thursday puzzle for you.

Today’s Theme

It took me a while to get the hang of this one, but once I did, the rest of the puzzle fell quickly.

The Across clues in Mr. Eaton-Salners’s puzzle are all homophones, one of two or more words pronounced alike but different in meaning or derivation or spelling. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out which homophone of the Across clue (if there is more than one) is really the clue to be solved, and then you solve it.

As a result of the violation, race officials said, they reworked the rules to establish clearer standards for what constitutes a violation and for how a musher’s culpability can be proved or disproved. The revision to the regulation, known as Rule 39, stipulates penalties for violations, including disqualification or even a ban from future competition.

According to the committee’s statement that identified Seavey, he denied that he had administered the drug and said that doing so would have been irrational since he was aware of the testing. He said that Tramadol, in his opinion, would not give him a competitive advantage, according to the statement.

But in his video, Seavey went further, calling the proceedings “a cancer” on the sport and saying he believes the positive test was the result of a malicious attack from either another musher or from one of the protest groups that wants to harm the Iditarod. He said he was told in April about the positive result and had tried to work with the board to make the information public in order to exonerate himself but that the board would not work with him. He also said he expected ramifications for speaking up.

“I fully expect that after this I will be banned from the Iditarod based on the gag rule,” he said, making reference to a rule he claimed prevents mushers from discussing internal matters.

The committee initially kept Seavey’s identity secret, but after an emergency session on Monday they reversed course and named him because of a “level of unhealthy speculation involved in this matter.”

The pressure had come largely from the Iditarod Official Finishers Club, which issued a statement signed by 83 current and former competitors demanding the identity of the musher in question be revealed.

“It is unacceptable that multiple dogs tested positive for a drug in a single musher’s team and that that information was only recently made public when it was known since shortly after the team finished,” the statement said.

That it was a member of the Seavey family adds a great deal of weight to the issue, considering their importance to the race’s history. Dallas Seavey, 30, was the youngest musher to win the Iditarod when he captured the 2012 title, and he also won in 2014, 2015 and 2016. His father has three titles, as well as the world record time. His wife, Jen, ran the race in 2009, and his grandfather, Dan, competed in the first two Iditarod races in 1973 and 1974.

Season 3, Episode 6: ‘A. Malcolm’

In a show in which a single relationship is the crux of the story, every scene that puts the two main characters together carries weight. And since “Outlander” waited half a season — and 20 years in story time — to bring Jamie and Claire back together, our expectations were through the roof. The success of this episode depends almost entirely on how you feel about their reunion.

For me, that reunion was most interesting when dealing with perspective. We open with a glimpse of Jamie’s everyday life, complete with an amorous landlady and a meditative printmaking montage. It’s an interesting move because it recasts Claire’s return not as a triumph for her, but as an interruption for him. A welcome one, of course (our hero wouldn’t swoon otherwise), but after 20 years, it would be harder to believe a passionate embrace than to believe the fond, loaded awkwardness between them. They’ve lived so long apart that this is, in some ways, less a reunion than a renegotiation.

Caitriona Balfe does a great job with a thankless task. Claire has been the de facto villain of the season so far. Jamie has built a life despite her absence, while her life has mostly happened around his absence. And opening the episode with Jamie means looking at her romantic hopes from a certain remove. In the face of Jamie’s reserve, Balfe plays Claire as restless, nervous and jealous by turns. It offers us a chance to sympathize with her without making her particularly sympathetic — quite a trick, but it works. Balfe sells it, and while we know “Outlander” won’t let her suffer long at Jamie’s hands, we also want her to feel, just for a while, what it’s like to worry that the person you love doesn’t love you back anymore.

Don’t worry: Jamie does. But his reluctance works without its feeling as if the show were dragging out the big clinch. He has more secrets from Claire than she does from him, and after trying so hard to accept her loss and move on, we see how painful it is to accept such a seismic shift in his life, however welcome. Jamie attempts some Santa-level faux cheerfulness about Brianna, but that’s because he palpably doesn’t know how to reach the old comfort they shared. Their awkwardness is so overwhelming that, despite Claire’s obvious longing, he eventually has to ask point-blank why she came back.

Parallels to their wedding night are everywhere, from the impersonal lodgings to the intimacy of sharing a meal. (It’s not helped by voice-over about “savoring each other as much as the meal,” and the aside that they “began to know each other again” seems a little too convenient, but it’s still a nice callback.) And when things turn amorous, the first-time awkwardness lingers a moment — their charming nose-knocking also feels like an echo of their wedding jitters.","‘Outlander’ Season 3, Episode 6: Time Doesn’t Matter",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/arts/television/outlander-recap-a-malcolm-reunion.html

To do that, they must contain the revenue losses from reducing tax rates, both over the next decade and in the years to follow.

The party’s most difficult fights will be over how to do that — by some combination of eliminating popular tax breaks and employing accounting maneuvers, such as setting some tax cuts to expire, in order to reduce revenue losses.

Mr. Corker stands as a possible impediment to that plan. A longstanding opponent of rising federal deficits, the senator has said he will not vote for any tax bill that would increase the federal debt by a dollar. But on Thursday, the House is expected to give final approval to a budget blueprint that would protect a 10-year, $1.5 trillion tax measure from a Democratic filibuster.

A Treasury Department report released on Friday showed that the budget deficit for fiscal 2017 grew by $80 billion, to $666 billion, as federal spending eclipsed revenues and economic growth remained tepid. At the same time, Congress is contemplating what the president has promised would be the largest tax cut in history.

The protracted Tuesday-morning brawl quickly spread from taxes and debt to foreign policy and the president’s fitness for office.

Mr. Corker said Mr. Trump was “absolutely not” a role model for the children in America.

“I don’t know why he lowers himself to such a low, low standard and is debasing our country,” Mr. Corker said in a CNN interview, suggesting that he will soon convene hearings to examine the ways Mr. Trump “purposely has been breaking down relationships around the world.”

“It’s unfortunate that our nation finds itself in this place,” he added.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Corker have been locked in a public feud for weeks. Mr. Corker has said that Mr. Trump runs his White House like a reality TV show, and Mr. Trump has responded by mocking Mr. Corker’s height, calling him “Liddle’ Bob.”

Mr. Trump has made declarations about the tax plan while the legislation is still being drafted. On Monday, Mr. Trump said the plan would not include any changes to how much Americans can save in tax-deferred retirement plans like 401(k) accounts.

“Hopefully the White House will step aside and let that occur in a normal process,” Mr. Corker said on NBC’s “Today.”

Any tax plan would need all the Republican support Mr. Trump can get in the Senate, and his fight with Mr. Corker puts that support in jeopardy.

“I think it’s fine for him to come over,” Mr. Corker said of the president’s visit to Capitol Hill. “I do look at these things as more of a photo op. They’re not really about substance, but more power to him.”

The Republicans have promised the most sweeping revision of the tax code in decades, a challenging task that has already met Democratic opposition. Some supporters of the tax overhaul are concerned Mr. Trump’s streaming comments on the plan could hurt chances of getting it approved.","Trump and Corker Escalate Battle Over Taxes, in Personal Terms",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/trump-corker-feud-dog-catcher.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mr. Zarate, an immigrant from Mexico, had accrued multiple felonies. He had been deported five times since entering the United States as a youth.

Yet less than three months before the shooting, a San Francisco jail released Mr. Zarate without alerting federal agents who wanted him for questioning.

The San Francisco sheriff, Ross Mirkarimi, cited the city’s sanctuary policies.

After Ms. Steinle’s death, that decision drew condemnation from political leaders in both parties. The sheriff was ousted in a re-election campaign.

The debate over sanctuary policies has only intensified under the Trump administration and led California lawmakers to reassert the divide between the local police and federal authorities.

Ms. Steinle’s family members have said they are not opposed to the idea of sanctuary policies, but want to close loopholes that allow people like Mr. Zarate to walk free.

Those matters won’t feature in his murder trial. On Monday, a city prosecutor argued that Mr. Zarate brought a gun to the pier that summer day intending to kill, according to news accounts from inside the courtroom.

A public defender countered that Mr. Zarate had found the weapon only moments before the killing and accidentally fired a bullet that ricocheted off the pavement before striking Ms. Steinle.

Jim Steinle, Kate Steinle’s father, was the first witness.

In emotional testimony before a packed courtroom, The Associated Press reported, he described walking with his daughter as she was shot in the back. She collapsed into his arms, he recounted, and said, “Help me, dad.” She died hours later at a hospital.

Mr. Zarate’s trial is expected to last at least four weeks.

It may be autumn, but the heat isn’t quitting.

Temperature records fell like dominoes in Southern California on Monday.

A sampling, according to National Weather Service figures:

— Ramona, San Diego County, hit 101 degrees, up from a record of 97 in 2003

— Downtown Los Angeles, 102 degrees, up from 98 in 1965

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

— Riverside, 102 degrees, up from 101 in 1959

— Santa Maria Airport, 102 degrees, up from 98 in 1965

The records alas could be short-lived. The weather service expected the heat to dial up higher still on Tuesday.

With forecasts also calling for strong Santa Ana winds, fire officials said they were bracing for extreme fire danger.

At 5:08 p.m. in Dodger Stadium, when the first pitch is scheduled for Game 1 of the World Series, the temperature is expected to be about 97 degrees, which would be a record high for a Series game.

That’s bad news for the starting pitchers, Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers and Dallas Keuchel of the Astros.

Research has shown baseballs travel farther in hot weather.

The larger point, though, is that Trumpism is fueled by a sense of economic anxiety that has exploded into fury, and there is no curing that until growth in the real economy (not just the stock market) resumes and creates a genuine sense of mobility and opportunity. If the rich benefit disproportionately it is only because they pay a disproportionate share of taxes.

Gail: The rich pay more taxes, but if they get a cut, they’re more likely to just sock it away. It’s the non-rich who go out and use the new income to buy stuff. That in turn gins up the economy.

Bret: So here is where we get to the root of our differences on taxes. When the rich “sock it away,” that only means that they are spending or investing, which is to say, putting the money into the real economy just like everyone else. They create jobs when they build a second home or become angel investors in a promising start-up or reinvest in their own businesses. Yes, it’s “trickle down” economics. No doubt most of our readers agree with me entirely!

That being said, I’m sorry that this isn’t the kind of bipartisan tax reform we had under Reagan in 1981 or 1986, when Democratic senators like Bill Bradley and congressmen like Dan Rostenkowski and Dick Gephardt were backers of the legislation.

The result is that the only reform we can get now, to avoid a presumptive Democratic filibuster, is through the parliamentary shenanigan known as budget reconciliation. And budget reconciliation requires that tax reform not add to the deficit, which leads to some pretty bad ideas, like a border tax or slashing the 401(k) deductibility limit to balance the books.

Right now there’s a modest, sensible bipartisan health care plan floating around that the Senate could pass right away if Donald Trump would get behind it. But he keeps changing his mind.

I’m interested in your complaint about how the current rules require that tax reform not add to the deficit. Do you think the deficit isn’t a problem?

Bret: I only worry about deficits in extended periods of slow growth. Nobody thinks of Carter-era stagflation as a prosperous time for the United States, but the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio was low: just under 31 percent in 1980 as opposed to around twice that in the middle of the Clinton boom. And there are times when the government has legitimate reasons to spend a lot of money and pile on debt, like winning World War II under Roosevelt or the Cold War under Reagan. We should never hold public prosperity hostage for the sake of a statistical artifact dear mostly to anally retentive deficit scolds preaching “The end is nigh!”

But I think you’ve put your finger on something essential. Bipartisanship is moribund under this president because he’s thrashed the concept and possibility of trust in politics. There was a brief ray of hope last month when he seemed ready to strike a deal on DACA, but that seems to have collapsed, too.

Speaking of trust, do you trust General Kelly?

Gail: Do you remember those days of yore when everybody presumed Trump wouldn’t blow up the planet because he had those three sensible generals hovering in the background? Generals who were undoubtedly working out a plan among themselves for how to put a lid on the president if he tried to drop a bomb on North Korea?

Seems so quaint now. As out of date as the theory that Ivanka and Jared would turn him into a social moderate so their New York friends wouldn’t give them the cold shoulder.

How about you?

Bret: Trump single-handedly destroys the theory of containment. Nothing and nobody contains him. And he tarnishes everything and everyone around him. He’s like a hyper-empowered schlemiel — I’m using the Yiddish word for the guy who proverbially spills his borscht all over you — while turning the rest of us into his schlimazels, the ones who get spilled on.

The latest political fiasco involving Trump’s condolence calls is such a case in point. This should be the one thing every president ought to be able to get right. But Trump couldn’t help but turn an accusatory political finger at Barack Obama, which was wrong on fact, wretched as principle and dumb as politics. And then Kelly, for whom I used to have nothing but admiration, soiled his own moment by defending the president and needlessly pointing an accusatory finger at Representative Frederica Wilson, which once again turned out to be wrong on fact, wretched as principle and dumb as politics.

When did people forget when to know how to leave well enough alone? Like, you know, Bill O’Reilly.

Gail: Yow, I’m not sure the concept of “let alone” is one O’Reilly ever mastered.

But about Trump — we’re seeing more and more outcry from traditional Republicans. George W. Bush made a powerful speech last week. Senator Corker from Tennessee has done everything but picket the White House. John McCain has been incredible. But none of it seems to have any impact on the base. Really coming to dread that base.

What do you think is going to happen to the party? Will it be Bannonized? Split in two?

Bret: I fear the worst. The only people who seem to be standing up to Bannon are either retiring, retired or gravely ill. But where’s Paul Ryan? What about Mitch McConnell? Watching him standing alongside Trump in that Rose Garden ceremony the other day was like watching a hostage video. “Stockholm syndrome” is something conservatives used to accuse liberals of suffering from. Ha! Today it’s the so-called establishment Republicans who have fallen in love with their mad captor.

Gail: Yeah, if he wasn’t around, they’d be forced to give up their good office space to the other side.

Bret: All parties have their extremists; every political persuasion has its fanatical tendency. Republicans have spent the past 60 or so years trying to dissociate themselves from their nativist, isolationist, ethnonationalist wing only to fall right back into it. It’s like a man falling off the wagon after decades of sobriety.

I don’t think the party of Reagan will survive Trumpism. Those of us who subscribe to some version or another of moderate conservatism are going to have to find a new political home, either alongside centrist, Clinton-style Democrats — who, I hope, will hold the Democratic reins in 2020 — or in an entirely new party, the Party of Sanity. As someone once said to somebody, 4,000 or so years ago, surely there must be 10 good people left in this wicked city.

Gail: I suspect that in a Trump-free world, the moderate Republicans and the Clinton-style Democrats would notice they still have a lot — not in common. Such as taxes. But it’s amazing how the current occupant of the White House has managed to bring us together.

Should we thank him? O.K., I guess not.

Happy United Nations Day, Bret. And next week it’s Halloween. Who are you going trick-or-treating as?

As the sun set in the shantytown of La Perla in Old San Juan, Ramón Marrero, 79, slumped onto the unwashed cot inside his brother’s tool shed, where he had lived since Maria claimed his home.

A single light bulb illuminated the other contents of the bare, musty room: two plastic chairs piled with clothes, canned fruit and vegetables, and a single gas burner.

Mr. Marrero, a community elder known to his neighbors as Don Ramón, draped a towel over his bare back to fend off the mosquitoes. Earlier, he had walked to the post office to charge his cellphone and mobile battery pack.

The only electricity he had seen since the storm came from an extension cord connected to a shared generator donated by Luis Fonsi, the Puerto Rican pop singer who filmed the video for the hit song “Despacito” in La Perla.

Mr. Marrero was hesitant to plug in the light bulb or his electric fan — only one could be used at a time — because he was afraid to overheat the machine or take energy from his neighbors.

Residents of the barrio say they were left to clear garbage and other debris on their own after the storm because municipal workers had failed to show up. Like Mr. Marrero, they were using fallen branches to fuel bonfires for cooking.

Lorel Cubano, the director of a local nonprofit, said most of the aid the neighborhood had received was from private citizens and celebrities like Mr. Fonsi. “The government hasn’t arrived here,” she said.

Fear in the Darkness

Georgia Lopez Ortiz, 92, is one of many elderly residents of the Luis Lloréns Torres housing project who have been too scared to walk outside since Maria wiped out the streetlights. The notoriously crime-ridden development is the largest in the Caribbean, and is dominated by rival gangs. Residents say it has become even more dangerous in the dark.

Ms. Ortiz’s washing machine does not work, so she has been hand-washing clothes in a bucket. She cannot cook, so her daughters bring her food every few days.

When aid groups visit, she throws a rope through the security bars that enclose her patio, and uses it to pull up packages of water and dried goods.

Raquel Mercado, 69, lives in a cramped one-room apartment with her 37-year-old son. Her car has not worked since it was flooded during the storm, so she has not been able to get to a bank to withdraw cash or to a pharmacy to refill her prescriptions.

She is selling snacks out of her apartment to bring in some money.

“What else is there to do?” Ms. Mercado said. “We’re stuck here.”

Baseball, Wine and Long-term Guests

A baseball game blared from speakers connected to a projector screen in Maricarmen del Llano’s living room. The adults drank red wine as they cleaned up from a dinner of fried chicken and mashed potatoes.

Even in the well-off parts of the island, though, life is not quite normal.

For the last month, seven extended family members, including a newborn, have been living with Ms. del Llano, a school psychologist; her husband, a veterinarian; and their two children, ages 7 and 9.

The whole house is running off a powerful generator. Overnight, they use the machine to run air-conditioning in each bedroom.

Tangie Sobrino, Ms. del Llano’s cousin and the newborn’s mother, is getting ready to move back home with her husband, a lawyer, and their two other young children. They were preparing to purchase a $5,200 generator.

“Our reality is not the norm,” Ms. Sobrino said, referring to the many Puerto Ricans for whom recovery was much further off.

From Good Life to Discomfort

The storm also revealed what had been carefully hidden cracks in the upper echelons of Puerto Rican society, which has been imploding during a decade-long recession.

Inside her two-story home with multiple balconies and a pool, Maria Julia Martinez’s stainless-steel refrigerator, espresso machine and toaster oven have been gathering dust. The family’s flooring business had tanked in recent years, and they could not use the appliances because they did not have $2,000 to fix their broken generator in the backyard.

They have a much smaller generator that could support a couple of small appliances at a time, but to save gas money and prevent it from breaking down, the family runs the machine only at night. They use a propane camping stove and a barbecue to prepare food.

When Ms. Martinez’s husband cranked on the small generator one night last week, she ran off to do a couple of laundry loads on the efficiency cycle. Afterward, the entire family, including their pets, went to sleep on mattresses set up on the floor of their upstairs master bedroom. A small air-conditioning unit in the room provided a respite from the rest of their home, which felt like a dark and steamy cave all day and night.

“This is living in hell,” Ms. Martinez said. She acknowledged that despite their discomfort, her family was still much better off than most people on the island. “I feel bad for feeling bad.”

A New Level of Poverty

Inside the elementary school classroom that has become their temporary home, Iris Perez and her two adult daughters sat in plastic chairs, slapping mosquitoes on their exposed arms and legs and staring blankly, as if it was too hot to speak.

Like nearly half of Puerto Ricans, they had been living in poverty before the storm. But Maria swept away their ocean-side home, and banished them to a new level of destitution.

This emergency shelter was better than the last; here there were showers and the family had the classroom to itself. Before, the women — along with Ms. Perez’s brother, son-in-law, and two young granddaughters — had slept next to other families and bathed with cups of water, filled up in the bathroom sinks.

Hand-washed clothing hung from fluorescent lights on the ceiling. A bookshelf had become a medicine cabinet, with deodorant and baby shampoo stacked in front of school books. Filing cabinets were diaper changing stations.

Nashali Reyes, Ms. Perez’s oldest daughter, was seven months pregnant, and worried about contracting the Zika virus. Her 2-year-old daughter Charyliz bobbed around the classroom with a blanket and bottle in her hands, seemingly unbothered by the bug bites on her face, which had become swollen and infected because she was allergic.

“It doesn’t matter what we do,” Ms. Reyes said, gesturing to a bottle of repellent. They had to keep the windows and doors open, they said, to maintain a livable, if extremely uncomfortable, temperature.

A message written on a whiteboard reminded them to keep their temporary home clean. “Welcome,” it said in Spanish, “God has blessed you.”

Communal Living

Felix Cruz was holding court for his neighbors at a dining table in his garage. His home had been transformed into a motel and soup kitchen of sorts, because of his two extra bedrooms and large furniture, including a couple of sofa beds where people were crashing.

Most of the neighborhood’s residents are retired and living on fixed incomes. They cook and eat communally using a 40-year-old gas stove that has been dragged out of storage and scraped clean of cockroach eggs and mold.

They have been cramming their food into a small freezer in Mr. Cruz’s backyard, opening it as little as possible to preserve the cold air.

The neighbors pooled money to pay for gas to power a small generator that could support a couple of fans, and are eating two meals a day, usually rice and whatever meat is on sale.

They eat on fine china, even though doing dishes in the dark is a pain, to try to distract themselves from their discomfort.

“It was difficult before because food was expensive, electricity was expensive, and now it’s even worse,” Mr. Cruz said. He pointed to Alma Gonzalez, 67, one of the neighbors he said had become like family. “When she has money, she pays. When I have money, I pay. That’s life.”",‘Like Going Back in Time’: Puerto Ricans Put Survival Skills to Use,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-coping.html

奥运火炬定于今日在希腊点燃，开启下一届冬季奥运会的倒数。

这一火焰将向东传递5000英里（约合8000公里）到韩国，于11月1日——2018年奥运会开始前100天——抵达目的地。

从仁川开始，火炬将穿越韩国，途经9个道、8座大城市，然后抵达平昌郡，参加2月9日的开幕式。

点燃火炬的仪式可追溯至远古奥运会，但奥运火炬是在1928年阿姆斯特丹奥运会上首次进行现代亮相的。火炬传递则是从1936年的柏林奥运会开始。

火炬由主办国设计。时报于2010年注意到：“现代奥运会在设计师和建筑师中也变成了对运动员来说一样的全球性竞争。每届奥运会都被赋予了能产生一个标识的期望，一幢标志性的建筑——还有一个具有特色的火炬，能象征当地传统和国家特色。”

The script especially brings to mind Jordan Harrison’s “Marjorie Prime,” seen in New York in 2015 (and made into a recent movie), in which replicants become comforters for the old and lonely; and Penelope Skinner’s “The Ruins of Civilization” (2016), which concerns a husband-dominated, stay-at-home woman of tomorrow yearning for a child.

Like “Ruins,” “After the Blast” intimates that the lot of womankind will not have improved radically, though neither work approaches the retrogressive horrors of “The Handmaid’s Tale.” A third-generation descendant of select Americans who make up an underground colony after the earth’s surface becomes unlivable, Anna stays at home and mopes while her brilliant scientist husband, Oliver (William Jackson Harper of TV’s “The Good Place”), toils for the betterment of the upper earth’s ecology.

If only this couple could receive approval to conceive a child from the population-monitoring government, Anna might find a raison d’être. But she fails to meet the happiness quotient expected of parents-to-be, nor is she a willing conformist in an assembly-line culture.

She’s suspicious, for instance, of the virtual-reality chips with which the underground colonists have been implanted. These allow people to simulate experiences — like visiting the seashore or tasting flavorful food — that their regulated environment does not offer naturally. Indulging in these vivid visions is known as simming, and even Oliver, it turns out, does it on the q.t.

Ms. Kazan — a vivid actress and the screenwriter of the charmingly fantastical “Ruby Sparks” — has fulfilled the first criterion of persuasive futurist fiction: She’s created a slyly detailed alternate universe that is both an extrapolation of the world we know today and its own consistent entity.

Daniel Zimmerman’s sets are alarmingly, soothingly bland, suggesting an interior decorating collaboration between Ikea and Apple. And the cast — which also includes Eboni Booth and Ben Horner as Oliver and Anna’s best friends — subtly conveys a cautious and subdued population, which has learned to neither hope nor ask for too much.

Perhaps the anodyne factor of this wan new world accounts for the lack of tension in “After the Blast.” But it’s also true that the characters often seem to have little existence beyond their functions as avatars of a new social order.

The relationship between Oliver and Anna, in particular, never acquires the heat to make us feel anxious when it’s in jeopardy. And the revelation of an act of betrayal that Anna uncovers in the play’s final scenes fails to land with the intended impact.

We feel most invested in Anna’s friendship with Arthur (voiced by Will Connolly), who is ultimately, of course, just an extension of her lonely self. Pausing to think about the implications of that is perhaps the best way to register the warning in a play in which reality, as we have traditionally known and sensed it, is increasingly in retreat.",Review: Romancing the Bot in Zoe Kazan’s ‘After the Blast’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/theater/review-romancing-the-bot-in-zoe-kazans-after-the-blast.html

It cut interest rates to zero and “printed money” on a huge scale — not literally, but it bought trillions of dollars’ worth of bonds by creating new bank reserves.

Many conservatives were aghast. TV pundits hyperventilated about hyperinflation, and even seemingly more respectable voices denounced the Fed’s actions. In 2010 a who’s who of conservative economists and pundits published an open letter warning that the Fed’s policies would cause inflation and “debase the dollar.”

But it never happened. In fact, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation has consistently fallen short of its target of 2 percent a year.

Now, every economist makes bad forecasts now and then — if you don’t, you’re not taking enough risks. I’ve certainly made my share, including a bad market call on election night — which I retracted three days later, acknowledging that my political dismay had gotten the better of my analytical judgment. But I always try to face up to my mistakes and learn from them.

But I guess I’m just old fashioned that way. Four years after that open letter to Bernanke, Bloomberg tracked down many of the signatories to ask what they had learned. None of them — not one — was even willing to admit having been wrong.

So what happens to economists who never admit mistakes, and never change their views in the light of experience? The answer, apparently, is that they get put on the short list to be the new Fed chair.

Consider, for example, the case of Stanford’s John Taylor (one of the signatories of that open letter). Unlike some of the other names on the rumored list, he’s a highly cited academic economist.

Since the financial crisis, however, he has repeatedly demanded that the Fed raise interest rates in line with a policy rule he devised a quarter-century ago. Failing to follow that rule was supposed to cause inflation, which it hasn’t — but seven years of being consistently wrong hasn’t inspired any rethinking on his part.

What it has inspired is a descent into increasingly strange reasons the Fed should raise rates despite low inflation. Easy money, he declared, was part of a conspiracy to “bail out fiscal policy,” that is, an effort to help President Barack Obama. Or maybe it was like the monetary equivalent of rent control, discouraging lending the way rent control discourages building apartments — a bizarre analysis that had colleagues scratching their heads.

What these ever-odder interventions had in common was that they always offered some reason wrong was right — why Taylor had been right to warn against easy-money policies even though higher inflation, the problem he predicted as a result of these policies, never materialized. And never, ever, an admission that maybe something was wrong with his initial analysis.

Again, everyone makes forecast errors. If you’re consistently wrong, that should certainly count against your credibility; track records matter. But it’s much worse if you can never bring yourself to admit past errors and learn from them.

That kind of behavior makes it all too likely that you’ll keep making the same mistakes; but more than that, it shows something wrong with your character. And men with that character flaw should never be placed in positions of policy responsibility.",The Doctrine of Trumpal Infallibility,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/opinion/federal-reserve-john-taylor.html

For hours, muffled screams and the smell of burning tissue filled the room.

“I wept the whole time,” Ms. Edmondson recalled. “I disassociated out of my body.”

Since the late 1990s, an estimated 16,000 people have enrolled in courses offered by Nxivm (pronounced Nex-e-um), which it says are designed to bring about greater self-fulfillment by eliminating psychological and emotional barriers. Most participants take some workshops, like the group’s “Executive Success Programs,” and resume their lives. But other people have become drawn more deeply into Nxivm, giving up careers, friends and families to become followers of its leader, Keith Raniere, who is known within the group as “Vanguard.”

Both Nxivm and Mr. Raniere, 57, have long attracted controversy. Former members have depicted him as a man who manipulated his adherents, had sex with them and urged women to follow near-starvation diets to achieve the type of physique he found appealing.

Now, as talk about the secret sisterhood and branding has circulated within Nxivm, scores of members are leaving. Interviews with a dozen of them portray a group spinning more deeply into disturbing practices. Many members said they feared that confessions about indiscretions would be used to blackmail them.

Mark Vicente, a filmmaker and former top Nxivm official, said that after hearing about the secret society, he confronted Mr. Raniere.

“I said, ‘Whatever you are doing, you are heading for a blowup,’” Mr. Vicente said.

Several former members have asked state authorities to investigate the group’s practices, but officials have declined to pursue action.

In July, Ms. Edmondson filed a complaint with the New York State Department of Health against Danielle Roberts, a licensed osteopath and follower of Mr. Raniere, who performed the branding, according to Ms. Edmondson and another woman. In a letter, the agency said it would not look into Dr. Roberts because she was not acting as Ms. Edmondson’s doctor when the branding is said to have happened.

Separately, a state police investigator told Ms. Edmondson and two other women that officials would not pursue their criminal complaint against Nxivm because their actions had been consensual, a text message shows.

State medical regulators also declined to act on a complaint filed against another Nxivm-affilated physician, Brandon Porter. Dr. Porter, as part of an “experiment,” showed women graphically violent film clips while a brain-wave machine and video camera recorded their reactions, according to two women who took part.

The women said they were not warned that some of the clips were violent, including footage of four women being murdered and dismembered.

“Please look into this ASAP,” a former Nxivm member, Jennifer Kobelt, stated in her complaint. “This man needs to be stopped.”

In September, regulators told Ms. Kobelt they concluded that the allegations against Dr. Porter did not meet the agency’s definition of “medical misconduct,” their letter shows.

Mr. Raniere and other top Nxivm officials, including Lauren Salzman, did not respond to repeated emails, letters or text messages seeking comment. Dr. Roberts and Dr. Porter also did not respond to inquiries.

Former members said that, inside Nxivm, they are being portrayed as defectors who want to destroy the group.

It is not clear how many women were branded or which Nxivm officials were aware of the practice.

A copy of a text message Mr. Raniere sent to a female follower indicates that he knew women were being branded and that the symbol’s design incorporated his initials.

“Not initially intended as my initials but they rearranged it slightly for tribute,” Mr. Raniere wrote, (“if it were abraham lincolns or bill gates initials no one would care.)”

From the Message Below is an excerpt of a text message Mr. Raniere sent to a female follower, which suggested that he knew women were being branded and that the symbol’s design incorporated his initials. “... Not intended initially as my initials but they rearranged it slightly for tribute (if it were abraham lincolns or bill gates initials no one would care). The primary meaning and design of the brand symbol has nothing to do with my initials ...”

Joining the Sisterhood

Ms. Edmondson, who lives in Vancouver and helped start Nxivm’s chapter there, was thrilled when Lauren Salzman arrived in January to teach workshops.

The women, both in their early 40s, were close and Ms. Edmondson regarded Ms. Salzman as a confidante and mentor.

“Lauren was someone I really looked up to as a rock star within the company,” said Ms. Edmondson, an actress who joined Nxivm about a decade ago.

During her visit, Ms. Salzman said she had something “really amazing” she wanted to share. “It is kind of strange and top secret and in order for me to tell you about it you need to give me something as collateral to make sure you don’t speak about it,” Ms. Edmondson recalled her saying.

The proposition seemed like a test of trust. After Ms. Edmondson wrote a letter detailing past indiscretions, Ms. Salzman told her about the secret sorority.

She said it had been formed as a force for good, one that could grow into a network that could influence events like elections. To become effective, members had to overcome weaknesses that Mr. Raniere taught were common to women — an overemotional nature, a failure to keep promises and an embrace of the role of victim, according to Ms. Edmondson and other members.

Submission and obedience would be used as tools to achieve those goals, several women said. The sisterhood would comprise circles, each led by a “master” who would recruit six “slaves,” according to two women. In time, they would recruit slaves of their own.

“She made it sound like a bad-ass bitch boot camp,” Ms. Edmondson said.

Ms. Edmondson and others said that during training, the women were required to send their master texts that read “Morning M” and “Night M.” During drills, a master texted her slaves “?” and they had 60 seconds to reply “Ready M.”

Trainees who failed had to pay penalties, including fasting, or could face physical punishments, two women said.

In March, Ms. Edmondson arrived for an initiation ceremony at Ms. Salzman’s home in Clifton Park, N.Y., a town about 20 miles north of Albany where Mr. Raniere and some followers live. After undressing, she was led to a candlelit ceremony, where she removed a blindfold and saw Ms. Salzman’s other slaves for the first time. The women were then driven to a nearby house, where the branding took place.

In the spring, the sorority grew as women joined different circles. Slaves added compromising collateral every month to Dropbox accounts, and a Google Document was used to list a timetable for recruiting new slaves, several women said.

Around the same time, an actress, Catherine Oxenberg, said she learned her daughter had been initiated into the sorority.

“I felt sick to my stomach,” said Ms. Oxenberg, who starred in the 1980s television series “Dynasty.”

Ms. Oxenberg had become increasingly concerned about her 26-year-old daughter, India, who looked emaciated from dieting. She told her mother that she had not had a menstrual period for a year and that her hair was falling out.

Ms. Oxenberg said she invited her daughter home in late May to try to get her away from the group.

When Ms. Oxenberg confronted her about the sorority, her daughter defended its practices.

“She said it was a character-building experience,” Ms. Oxenberg said.

‘Humans Can Be Noble’

By the time the secret group was taking shape, Mark Vicente, the filmmaker, had been a faithful follower of Mr. Raniere for more than a decade.

Mr. Vicente said he had been contacted by Ms. Salzman’s mother, Nancy, a co-founder of Nxivm who is known as “Prefect,” after the 2004 release of a documentary he co-directed that explored spirituality and physics.

Soon, Mr. Vicente was taking courses that he said helped him expose his fears and learn strategies that made him feel more resolute.

He also made a documentary called “Encender el Corazón,” or “Ignite the Heart,” which lionized Mr. Raniere’s work in Mexico.

“Keith Raniere is an activist, scientist, philosopher and, above all, humanitarian,” Mr. Vicente says in the film.

Mr. Raniere has used those words to describe himself. On his website, he said he spoke in full sentences by age 1, mastered high school mathematics by 12 and taught himself to play “concert level” piano. At 16, he entered Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.

Before Nxivm, he helped run a company called Consumers’ Buyline Inc., which offered discounts to members on groceries and other products.

In the mid-1990s, several state attorneys general investigated it as a suspected pyramid scheme; Mr. Raniere and his associates agreed to shut it down.

Through Nxivm, Mr. Raniere transformed himself into a New Age teacher with long hair and a guru-like manner of speaking.

“Humans can be noble,” he says on his website. “The question is: will we put forth what is necessary?”

By many accounts, Mr. Raniere sleeps during the day and goes out at night to play volleyball or take female followers for long walks. Several women described him as warm, funny and eager to talk about subjects that interested them.

Others saw a different side. Nxivm sued several former members, accusing them of stealing its trade secrets, among other things.

Mr. Vicente said he was aware of the negative publicity, including a 2012 series by The Albany Times-Union that described alleged abuses inside Nxivm.

Mr. Vicente’s views began to change this year after his wife was ostracized when she left Nxivm and he heard rumors about the secret sorority.

Mr. Vicente said he got evasive answers when he asked Mr. Raniere about the group. Mr. Raniere acknowledged giving “five women permission to do something,” but did not elaborate, other than to say he would investigate, Mr. Vicente said.

Mr. Vicente said he suspected Mr. Raniere was lying to him and might have done so before. Suddenly, self-awareness techniques he had learned felt like tools that had been used to control him.

“No one goes in looking to have their personality stripped away,” he said. “You just don’t realize what is happening.”

Followers Start to Flee

In May, Sarah Edmondson began to recoil from her embrace of the secret society.

Her husband, Anthony Ames, who was also a Nxivm member, learned about her branding and the couple both wanted out.

Before quitting, Mr. Ames went to Nxivm’s offices in Albany to collect money he said the group owed him.

He had his cellphone in his pocket and turned on its recorder.

On the recording, Mr. Ames tells another member that Ms. Edmondson was branded and that other women told him about handing over collateral. “This is criminal,” Mr. Ames says.

The voice of a woman — who Mr. Ames said is Lauren Salzman — is heard trying to calm him. “I don’t think you are open to having a conversation,” she said.

“You are absolutely right, I’m not open to having a conversation,” he replied. “My wife got branded.”

A few days later, many of Mr. Raniere’s followers learned of the secret society from a website run by a Buffalo-area businessman, Frank R. Parlato Jr. Mr. Parlato had been locked in a long legal battle with two sisters, Sara and Clare Bronfman, who are members of Nxivm and the daughters of Edgar Bronfman, the deceased chairman of Seagram Company.

In 2011, the Bronfman sisters sued Mr. Parlato, whom they had hired as a consultant, alleging he had defrauded them of $1 million.

Four years later, in 2015, the Justice Department indicted him on charges of fraud and other crimes arising from alleged activities, including defrauding the Bronfmans. Mr. Parlato has denied the claims and the case is pending.

Mr. Parlato started a website, The Frank Report, which he uses to lambaste prosecutors, Mr. Raniere and the Bronfmans. In early June, Mr. Parlato published the first in a torrent of salacious posts under the headline, “Branded Slaves and Master Raniere.”

A Nxivm follower, Soukaina Mehdaoui, said she reached out to Mr. Raniere after reading the post. Ms. Mehdaoui, 25, was a newcomer to Nxivm, but the two had grown close.

She said Mr. Raniere told her the secret sorority began after three women offered damaging collateral to seal lifetime vows of obedience to him.

While Ms. Mehdaoui had joined the sorority, the women in her circle were not branded. She was appalled.

“There are things I didn’t know that I didn’t sign up for, and I’m not even hearing about it from you,” she texted Mr. Raniere.

Mr. Raniere texted back about his initials and the brand.

By then, panic was spreading inside Nxivm. Slaves were ordered to delete encrypted messages between them and erase Google documents, two women said. To those considering breaking away, it was not clear whom they could trust and who were Nxivm loyalists.

Late one night, Ms. Mehdaoui met secretly with another Nxivm member. They took out their cellphones to show they were not recording the conversation.

Both decided to leave Nxivm, despite concerns that the group would retaliate by releasing their “collateral” or suing them.

Ms. Mehdaoui said that when she went to say goodbye to Mr. Raniere, he urged her to stay.

“Do you think, I’m bad, I don’t agree with abuses,” she recalled him saying. He said the group “gives women tools to be powerful, to regain their power for the sake of building love.”

Nxivm recently filed criminal complaints with the Vancouver police against Ms. Edmondson and two other women accusing them of mischief and other crimes in connection with the firm’s now-closed center there, according to Ms. Edmondson. The women have denied the allegations. A spokesman for the Vancouver police declined to comment.

Ms. Edmondson and other former followers of Mr. Raniere said they were focusing on recovering.

Mumler.

Mumler, Manseau’s protagonist, is one of my favorite characters in the literature of the era. He took some of the most compelling spirit photographs of the 1860s that subjects swore contained images of their late beloved. The photos are compelling because of their weirdness; compelling because we, too, are almost seduced by the spirit images in them. We know that he was a fraud, but we don’t know what kind of fraud. Self-deceived true believer, confidence man or a blend of both? And the persistent mystery is, of course, how Mumler created these photographs. Do I believe in spirit photography? I blushingly confess I do not. I do not believe that spirits are recorded on photographic plates. But if we grant that this phenomenon does not result from some paranormal process, then how do we explain it? And how did Mumler keep his method hidden from the many witnesses and onlookers who hoped to expose him?

The trial of William Mumler, liberally excerpted in Part III of the book, is a landmark in the histories of photography and of America. It all started when the Irish immigrant and ardent Catholic Patrick V. Hickey encountered Mumler and his photographs at a meeting of the Photographic Section of the American Institute, held at New York’s Cooper Union. Suspicious of Mumler’s heretical trade, he visited him at his studio the following day. Hickey remained unconvinced about the verity of Mumler’s art, and went to the city marshal’s office to file a grievance. Marshal Joseph Tooker, Mayor A. Oakley Hall’s “confidant and crony,” took the case, visiting Mumler’s studio under the alias William Wallace and arresting Mumler after Tooker failed to recognize the apparition who appeared with him in Mumler’s photograph. A battle between science and spirituality, the case reads as a forerunner of the Scopes trial. On one hand, we could simply call it a foregone conclusion: There are no spirits, hence there are no spirit photographs. If, however, you refrain from that assumption, the debate becomes much stickier. What do you do when a desire to believe overwhelms common sense and a preponderance of evidence? Experts presented seven techniques Mumler might have used in faking his photographs, then other experts attested that they had seen Mumler using none of them.

The trial featured an array of extraordinary characters like Elbridge T. Gerry, Abraham Bogardus and Jeremiah Gurney. But in the end, it was P.T. Barnum whose testimony about “humbugs” may have saved Mumler from further incarceration and obloquy (not that he didn’t suffer his fair share of the latter anyway). Barnum’s equivocation about which came first, seeing or believing, cinched the deal for Mumler’s acquittal. Manseau takes us inside the judge’s head immediately after Barnum’s testimony. “‘However I might believe that trick and deception has been practiced by the prisoner, as I sit here in my capacity of magistrate, I am compelled to decide,’ he added with a note of resignation, ‘that the prosecution has failed to prove the case.’”

Manseau has created an exceptional story of how photography intersects with the hope that some heretofore unexplored scientific process will reveal something about the nature of man and our limitations. It is one of the persistent myths of mankind that death isn’t final — that photography, which transcends time and space, can show a way around death.

Several great moments in American history are mentioned casually, but we still feel their importance. There’s the account of then-senator Abraham Lincoln selecting Brady to be his portraitist for the 1860 election. “Lincoln did not look much like a statesman as he stood in Brady’s posing room. The photographer drew up Lincoln’s collar to shorten the appearance of his neck, and determined that he could put his artists to work taming Lincoln’s hair after the image had been developed. They also might smooth the crags in his face — whatever might be done to make him appear more presidential. As a final touch, Brady placed Lincoln’s hand on a book, as if the senator were already taking the oath of office.” Thereafter, Brady persuaded Mary Todd Lincoln to be photographed in March 1861. “Mrs. Lincoln thought she looked too stern and matronly, and that her hands were too big. As he had with her husband, Brady posed his nervous subject, finding the best possible angle with which to display her profile. He then carefully arranged her hands to seem more dainty.” The result of all these artistic adjustments was immensely pleasing to the future first lady. “Half fantasy, half reality, it was one of her favorite photographs of herself.” Perhaps most photography fits this description.

I tracked down the source of Manseau’s Kafka epigraph, that line characterizing photography as a tool of misrepresentation and tergiversation. It’s in Gustav Janouch’s “Conversations With Kafka,” and the full exchange tells a different story. “The drawing is wonderful. It is full of truth,” Kafka repeats again and again. Janouch, his interlocutor, asks: “Do you mean that it is true to life as a photograph is?” Kafka replies: “What are you thinking of? Nothing can be so deceiving as a photograph.

The ozone hole, a seasonal thinning of the ozone layer in the atmosphere over Antarctica that allows harmful ultraviolet rays to reach the Earth’s surface, had recently been detected, but whether it was a natural phenomenon or caused by human activity remained under debate.

Dr. de Zafra and other researchers, led by Susan Solomon of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, were able to confirm that chlorofluorocarbons, used in refrigerants and as propellants in aerosol cans, were causing chemical reactions in the atmosphere that depleted ozone.

“Bob and his colleagues were the first to measure chlorine monoxide in the region of the ozone hole over Antarctica in 1986,” Dr. Solomon, now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an email. “They showed that this chemical was present in much larger amounts than at other latitudes, and this and subsequent work firmly established that the ozone hole is due to human production of chlorofluorocarbon chemicals.

“These chemicals are now no longer produced anywhere in the world,” she added, “and the Antarctic ozone hole is expected to heal slowly over the next 50 years or so. Bob’s work was key in helping save the planet’s ozone layer.”

Louisa Emmons, now a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, was one of Dr. de Zafra’s graduate students then and made three trips to McMurdo with him, as well as joining him for field work in Hawaii and Greenland.

“Bob always loved those expeditions as an opportunity to focus on making measurements and figuring out what those observations told us about how the atmosphere worked,” Dr. Emmons said by email. He put in long hours, she said, but also liked to explore the exotic locales with students and other colleagues, hiking up the steep Observation Hill next to the McMurdo Station or cross-country skiing out on the ice shelf.

Among the honors and accolades accumulated by Dr. de Zafra over the years was an unusual one: In 1999 — Ms. Atwell thought it might have been a sort of retirement present — a ridge in the Cook Mountains of Antarctica was named after him by the United States Board of Geographic Names.

Dr. de Zafra’s first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Julia M. Phillips-Quagliata, whom he married in 1981.

Dr. de Zafra had bought and renovated two historic buildings in Setauket — one was his home — and in recent years had purchased a third, which he was still rehabilitating at his death. He served on various civic boards and was a leader in preserving the history of the Setauket area. The area’s claims to fame include being the center of the Culper spy ring, which George Washington deployed against the British and which was the subject of the recently concluded AMC series “Turn.”

Mr. Englebright said that just as Dr. de Zafra had helped sound the alarm on ozone depletion, he had also alerted him and many others to preservation issues.

“He was my sentinel on so many community projects,” Mr. Englebright said.","Robert de Zafra, Who Made Key Findings on Ozone, Dies at 85",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/obituaries/robert-de-zafra-who-made-key-findings-on-ozone-dies-at-85.html

So it’s not surprising that we humans are unable to make something like time or the marking of time bend to our collective wills. For centuries, different countries used different calendars, and even the old Julian calendar had its problems.

That is why, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII ordered that everyone stop messing around and use one calendar. Even then, the later a country switched over, the more days had to be dropped in order to stay in sync with the vernal equinox and the winter solstice. This resulted in a lot of confusion for a while, including the month of September 1752 in North America, which looked like this and which children across the continent still whisper about as “The Best Start to the School Year Ever.”

On Monday, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, questioned companies’ statements that their plants were back in operation: “We understand that manufacturing is running at minimal levels, and certainly far from full production,” Dr. Gottlieb said in prepared remarks published Monday by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

He is scheduled to be questioned by the committee on Tuesday. In his prepared statement, Dr. Gottlieb said many plants are running at below 50 percent capacity, “with many firms operating around 20 percent capacity, and some even less. We have found no firm operating above 70 percent of their normal operation.”

In a recent interview, Dr. Gottlieb said he was worried that if conditions don’t improve, more shortages — of both drugs and medical devices — might follow by early next year.

Pharmaceutical products made in Puerto Rico account for nearly 10 percent of all drugs consumed by Americans, and about 80 firms make medical products there, the F.D.A. has said.

“I don’t think we’ve dealt with a situation where we’ve had so many simultaneous impacts to what are very important facilities,” Dr. Gottlieb said. So far, “we have been able to mitigate these issues, but it’s been all hands on deck at the F.D.A., and there’s been close calls.”

Dr. Gottlieb says the F.D.A. is watching the supply of about 30 drugs that are made on the island, in addition to medical devices. Most companies are still running on diesel generators, and manufacturers that have been able to connect to the power grid are still encountering an unpredictable supply of electricity, he said.

Cathy Denning, the senior vice president of sourcing operations at Vizient, which negotiates with medical companies on behalf of its member hospitals, said several device manufacturers, including Medtronic, which makes surgical staples, and Stryker, which makes orthopedic surgery products, were shipping reduced supplies of some products to hospitals because of Hurricane Maria. “We here at Vizient had an ‘aha’ moment when we realized how much manufacturing actually takes place in Puerto Rico,” she said.

Last week, a Johnson & Johnson executive told investors that the company couldn’t rule out “intermittent” shortages of some formulations of its products, although he noted that many were made elsewhere. Johnson & Johnson makes Tylenol and the H.I.V. drug Prezista in Puerto Rico, as well as other products.

The F.D.A. has been supplying logistical help to companies, providing fuel for the generators and assisting with moving finished products off the island. Dr. Gottlieb said some companies had gotten down to a 24-hour supply of diesel fuel, and representatives for the medical-device industry had said some generators were beginning to break down, requiring emergency repair.

Pharmacists at half a dozen hospitals, from Utah to North Carolina, said in interviews that the fluid bag shortage had had a domino effect, leading to scarcities of a range of products as administrators race to stock up on the supplies they need to keep their hospitals running smoothly. Even products like empty bags and plastic tubing, which are also made by Baxter in Puerto Rico, have been hard to come by, some said.

“With drug shortages, it is often a race to see who can find a supply of the drug on shortage and also any alternatives,” said Philip J. Trapskin, who is the program manager of medication use strategy and innovation at UW Health, the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s health system. “We have been able to get what we need to avoid disruptions in patient care, but the mix of products is not ideal and there are no guarantees we will continue to get the supplies we need.”

Baxter recently announced that the F.D.A. had allowed it to import bags from the company’s factories in Ireland and Australia, and said production in Puerto Rico was slowly resuming. The company, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., said it was also helping its employees on the island, including distributing generators and propane-powered cooktops for the workers’ use. “While the storm devastated the island in a day, the recovery will take time,” the company said in a statement.

Baxter did not provide a timeline for when the bags would be back in stock, and pharmacists said they anticipated that the bags might not be available for many more weeks or months. “This is a big deal for hospitals across the country,” said Scott Knoer, the chief pharmacy officer at the Cleveland Clinic. “We’re really still trying to get the information we need to manage it.”

Baxter has been rationing its supply, shipping limited orders of the bags filled with saline and dextrose to hospitals based on a percentage of what the institutions typically use. “We are getting small amounts, but it is nowhere what we need in order to take care of patients,” said Jeff Rosner, who oversees pharmacy contracting and purchasing at the Cleveland Clinic.

The impact has rippled throughout the clinic’s normal operations. Alternatives, such as injecting some drugs into an IV — known as an “IV push” — take more time for nurses, which divert them from attending to other needs. And the method is not appropriate for some drugs. “This has repercussions,” Mr. Knoer said.

The pharmacists said the shortage had not yet affected patient care, although some of the alternatives require that employees learn new systems or adopt complex practices that can introduce human error. If the shortage persists, some said elective procedures, like knee replacements, might be postponed.

It is a predicament that is all too familiar. While Hurricane Maria caused the latest problem, drug shortages have plagued the nation’s hospital system for years. The affected products are typically longstanding staples, like epinephrine or morphine, and are often sterile injectable drugs that sell for low profit margins. In 2014, a shortage of large saline bags, which were manufactured by Baxter and are not currently scarce, led to state and federal investigations into its business practices.

Even the Mini-Bags have previously been in short supply, and pharmacists said shipments of the small bags had been unpredictable before the hurricane.

“It’s like, do we have any great faith this company is going to be able to turn this shortage around, when they haven’t been able to effectively turn around the shortages they had in existence before?” said Debby Cowan, the pharmacy manager at Angel Medical Center, a small hospital in Franklin, in North Carolina’s Smoky Mountains.

Like Dr. Gottlieb, many of the hospital administrators said their eye was on the horizon. With so many drug companies manufacturing products in Puerto Rico, Mr. Rosner said, “I am fearful that this may not be the end of the shortages — it may only be the beginning.”",U.S. Hospitals Wrestle With Shortages of Drug Supplies Made in Puerto Rico,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/health/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-drug-shortage.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Since the congress’s 2,300 delegates are carefully chosen for loyalty, very few oppose changes once they are proposed by the leadership.

What do these changes really mean?

A key phrase here is “new era,” one that Mr. Xi has used throughout the congress, which began last week. Mr. Xi has described Chinese history since 1949 as divided into two eras: the three decades after Mao seized power in a revolution that established a unified People’s Republic and ended nearly a century of civil war and foreign invasions, and the three decades after Deng took power in 1978 and refocused China on developing its economy.

Mr. Xi has signaled he is launching China into a new, third era. In his report to the congress, Mr. Xi suggested that if Mao made China independent, and Deng made it prosperous, he would make it strong again. Restoring China to greatness is a central message of “Xi Jinping Thought,” and a goal that has already guided Mr. Xi’s policies of building up the military, strengthening domestic controls and raising China’s profile in global affairs.

To underline that point, the congress also added a second mention of Mr. Xi’s ideas to the constitution: his call to modernize and strengthen China’s armed forces.

By enshrining Mr. Xi’s ideas as “a new component of the party’s guide for action,” the party is putting Mr. Xi on a doctrinal pedestal alongside Mao and Deng. Until Tuesday, those were the only two Chinese leaders whose names appeared in the constitution’s list of fundamental doctrines, which mentions “Mao Zedong Thought” and “Deng Xiaoping Theory.” Adding Mr. Xi by name also raises him above his two most recent predecessors, the former presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao: Their ideas are on the list of doctrines, but not their names.

In the near future, Chinese people are likely to refer to Mr. Xi’s doctrine of a reinvigorated China as simply “Xi Jinping Thought,” a flattering echo of “Mao Zedong Thought.”

Photo

Does this mean Mr. Xi is as powerful as Mao was in his day?

It’s not that simple. After he came to power in 2012, Mr. Xi surprised many people with how quickly and forcefully he asserted control. This included putting his imprint on two of China’s most powerful institutions, the party and the military, which he did using a sweeping anticorruption drive.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But the basis of his rule is different from Mao’s, and even Deng’s. Both of those leaders were founders of the People’s Republic, and hardened revolutionaries whose decades of fighting and self-sacrifice gave them a charisma and authority that Mr. Xi simply cannot replicate. For all his power, Mr. Xi does not have the almost godlike presence that Mao once had.

View all New York Times newsletters.

On the other hand, the Chinese economy, state and military are much more powerful now than they were under Mao, or even under Deng, which gives Mr. Xi far more global clout than his predecessors.

What other decisions did the party congress make?

The congress finished on Tuesday with several other major steps. Most important, the delegates voted in a new Central Committee, a council of 204 senior central and local officials who usually meet once a year to approve broad policy priorities.

There was a notable absence on that list: Wang Qishan.

Mr. Wang, 69, was the enforcer in Mr. Xi’s drive to root out corruption and strengthen discipline in the party. He has passed the usual retirement age for the committee, but party insiders had said that Mr. Xi might try to keep him in a senior position. His absence from the list means he will probably retire.

Photo

How will changing the party constitution affect how China is run?

Mr. Xi’s vision of a resurgent China will now permeate all party indoctrination in schools, the media and government agencies. With the conclusion of the congress, the party and the Chinese news media will begin a national drive to promote its decisions, and especially the elevation of Mr. Xi.

But many Chinese people will also closely watch the announcement on Wednesday of new members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the party’s top rung of power, for signs of how far Mr. Xi can get his way in promoting political allies. That will be a sign of how much power he really has behind the welter of propaganda.",China Enshrines ‘Xi Jinping Thought.’ What Does That Mean?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-constitution.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

这种冲突的民族主义幽灵也贯穿在阿普尔鲍姆的新书《红色饥荒：斯大林对乌克兰的战争》之中，该书详细讲述了于1933年达到顶峰的大饥荒，据估计，它导致500多万苏联人死亡，其中390多万为乌克兰人。斯大林从之前几年开始，无情地强迫数百万独立的小农进入新的集体农场，他确信这样能够提高生产力，养活苏联的城市。那些农民当然拒绝放弃自己的土地，纷纷屠杀和吃掉被要求跟他们一起带走的家畜，他们被带去集体农场后——有时是被枪逼着去的——几乎毫无劳动积极性。

The most recent idea to get caught in the game of legislative whack-a-mole was a proposal to dramatically lower the cap on the amount that workers can set aside in their 401(k) retirement accounts. Currently workers under 50 can set aside up to $18,000 a year without having to pay taxes up front on that money. House Republicans were discussing lowering that to $2,400.

This creates both practical and political problems. Lowering the cap on 401(k) contributions would save only a sliver of the $1.5 trillion in lost revenue from the tax cuts that Republicans are pushing. What is more, such plans are widely used by middle-class taxpayers that Republicans say they are trying to help. The idea died a quick death on Monday when President Trump said he would not let it happen.

Raising income taxes on the rich

The tax framework released by the “Big Six” Republican tax working group last month — the six lead negotiators from the House, Senate and Trump administration — called for three tax brackets with a top rate of 35 percent, down from 39.6 percent today. The plan kept open the option of creating an additional tax bracket for top earners to ensure the tax code remained progressive. No guidance was given on what that tax rate would be or what income level it would apply to.

Lawmakers, now facing criticism that their plan is a giveaway to the rich, are considering adding that additional bracket, potentially keeping it at the current 39.6 percent rate or slightly lowering or raising it.

While Mr. Trump says that many of his wealthy friends have encouraged him to raise their taxes to help the middle class, doing so would be a break with Republican orthodoxy. Republican leaders in Congress have been hesitant to raise tax rates on anyone because the party’s brand is largely built around the idea that the economy does best when people have more money to spend.

Cutting corporate taxes — gradually

A big reduction in the corporate tax rate is the centerpiece of a plan that Republicans argue will trigger robust economic growth, create incentives for businesses to stay in the United States and prompt businesses to pay more to their workers. But cutting the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, while getting rid of the corporate alternative minimum tax, would cost nearly $2 trillion over 10 years. So Republicans have been talking about the possibility of a temporary tax cut or getting to the lower rate gradually, over a period of years.

Temporary or gradual tax cuts would be less costly, but they could also pack less punch for accelerating economic growth. Companies say that they are less likely to make long-term investment plans if they think their tax rates will eventually start climbing again. A phased-in tax cut would likely encourage businesses to time their investments accordingly, meaning that growth would remain sluggish in the near-term. Since Republicans are counting on rapid economic growth to pay for their tax cuts, anything that inhibits this could be counterproductive.

Grappling with a global minimum tax

Multinational corporations have been salivating at the prospect of a switch from a “worldwide” tax system to a territorial system, where profits earned abroad are not taxed by the United States. Such a switch, they contend, would make American companies more competitive with their counterparts around the world and spur hiring at home.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The fear — and the coming fight — is over a proposed “global minimum tax” that would be paired with the new system. In theory, this would protect the tax base from being eroded by companies having even more incentive to do business overseas. However, firms fear that such a tax would continue to make them less competitive than their global counterparts and mean that the tax system is not truly territorial.

Curbing the deductibility of corporate interest

For months, House Republicans pitched a plan to eliminate the deductibility of corporate interest in exchange for allowing companies to immediately write-off equipment expenses. The latest plan would allow companies to immediately expense their equipment purchases for five years and only partially deduct interest they pay on loans.

However, compromises come with their own sets of problems. Making expensing temporary could lead to an investment hangover after five years. Firms that rely heavily on debt are bracing for a big fight if the curbs on deductibility prove overly onerous. Ultimately they may get their way, as Mr. Trump’s industry – real estate – prizes the deduction.",Tax Cuts Are Coming.

Rohingya Muslims do not belong in Myanmar, and they never have, he said. Their fertility allowed them to overwhelm the local Buddhist population. But now, somehow, many Rohingya seemed to be gone.

“We thank the Lord Buddha for this,” said U Thu Min Gala, the 57-year-old abbot of the Damarama Monastery in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State in western Myanmar. “They stole our land, our food and our water. We will never accept them back.”

An overwhelming body of published accounts has detailed the Myanmar Army’s campaign of killing, rape and arson in Rakhine, which has driven more than 600,000 Rohingya out of the country since late August, in what the United Nations says is the fastest displacement of a people since the Rwanda genocide.

Mr. Zarate, an immigrant from Mexico, had accrued multiple felonies. He had been deported five times since entering the United States as a youth.

Yet less than three months before the shooting, a San Francisco jail released Mr. Zarate without alerting federal agents who wanted him for questioning.

The San Francisco sheriff, Ross Mirkarimi, cited the city’s sanctuary policies.

After Ms. Steinle’s death, that decision drew condemnation from political leaders in both parties. The sheriff was ousted in a re-election campaign.

The debate over sanctuary policies has only intensified under the Trump administration and led California lawmakers to reassert the divide between the local police and federal authorities.

Ms. Steinle’s family members have said they are not opposed to the idea of sanctuary policies, but want to close loopholes that allow people like Mr. Zarate to walk free.

Those matters won’t feature in his murder trial. On Monday, a city prosecutor argued that Mr. Zarate brought a gun to the pier that summer day intending to kill, according to news accounts from inside the courtroom.

A public defender countered that Mr. Zarate had found the weapon only moments before the killing and accidentally fired a bullet that ricocheted off the pavement before striking Ms. Steinle.

Jim Steinle, Kate Steinle’s father, was the first witness.

In emotional testimony before a packed courtroom, The Associated Press reported, he described walking with his daughter as she was shot in the back. She collapsed into his arms, he recounted, and said, “Help me, dad.” She died hours later at a hospital.

Mr. Zarate’s trial is expected to last at least four weeks.

It may be autumn, but the heat isn’t quitting.

Temperature records fell like dominoes in Southern California on Monday.

A sampling, according to National Weather Service figures:

— Ramona, San Diego County, hit 101 degrees, up from a record of 97 in 2003

— Downtown Los Angeles, 102 degrees, up from 98 in 1965

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

— Riverside, 102 degrees, up from 101 in 1959

— Santa Maria Airport, 102 degrees, up from 98 in 1965

The records alas could be short-lived. The weather service expected the heat to dial up higher still on Tuesday.

With forecasts also calling for strong Santa Ana winds, fire officials said they were bracing for extreme fire danger.

At 5:08 p.m. in Dodger Stadium, when the first pitch is scheduled for Game 1 of the World Series, the temperature is expected to be about 97 degrees, which would be a record high for a Series game.

That’s bad news for the starting pitchers, Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers and Dallas Keuchel of the Astros.

Research has shown baseballs travel farther in hot weather.

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

But selling off landmarks also comes with risks. Many old-line retailers have struggled to strike a balance between cashing out their valuable real estate and holding on to historic buildings that have come to define their brands.

It is a difficult task that Lord & Taylor is now undertaking.

Founded by the English merchant Samuel Lord in 1826, the department store was once a favored retailer of high society. When its Fifth Avenue flagship opened in February 1914, it drew 75,000 visitors, who were treated to music from a pipe organ on the seventh floor and could choose to dine in one of three restaurants on the top floor.

But as the company moved into the mass market in subsequent decades, it lost much of its luster.

It was under Richard Baker, a veteran real estate investor, that Lord & Taylor recovered. Mr. Baker led a 2006 takeover of the department store company, and used that as a springboard for further acquisitions, from the Canadian chain Hudson’s Bay to Saks to the e-commerce outlet Gilt Groupe. He is now chairman and interim chief executive of Hudson’s Bay.

But as the retail industry has been battered by the tidal waves of e-commerce, Hudson’s Bay has seen its stock price fall by nearly a third over the past year. Retail sales at Hudson’s Bay were down about 1 percent in the first half of the year. As of Monday’s close, the retailer had a market capitalization of roughly $1.7 billion, or a tenth of WeWork’s private market valuation.

Hudson’s Bay has faced enormous pressure to sell its trove of real estate holdings — including its crown jewel, the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store farther up Fifth Avenue. That property was appraised recently at about $3.7 billion.

One of Hudson’s Bay’s shareholders, the real estate investment firm Land and Buildings Investment Management, has pushed for the company to sell the Saks store, suggesting it might be desirable to a hotel developer or as bricks and mortar space for Amazon.

“The path to maximizing the value of Hudson’s Bay lies in its real estate, not its retail brands,” Jonathan Litt, the founder of Land and Buildings Investment Management, wrote in a letter to the board of Hudson’s Bay in June.

That pressure apparently has had an impact. Last week, the department store operator said that its chief executive, Gerald Storch, had stepped down and that he would be replaced on an interim basis by Mr. Baker.

And Tuesday’s announcement acknowledges Mr. Litt’s criticism to some extent. Beyond the Lord & Taylor building sale, Hudson’s Bay struck agreements to lease some of its other retail space to WeWork, including in Hudson’s Bay stores in Canada.

WeWork’s partner in its real estate joint venture, Rhône Capital, will also invest $500 million in Hudson’s Bay. (The joint venture, WeWork Property Advisors, will eventually take over some of that holding.)

All told, that will give Hudson’s Bay more than $1 billion in fresh capital to pay down debt and bolster its cash holdings. The $850 million purchase price for the building is about 30 percent higher than an appraisal made in July 2016.

“This partnership places H.B.C. at the forefront of dynamic trends reshaping the way current and future generations live, work and shop: the sharing economy and urban and suburban mixed-use real estate planning,” Mr. Baker said in a statement.

For WeWork, the deal is a sign of the fast-growing start-up’s ambitions.

Originally created as a provider of shared working spaces, the company has increasingly pitched itself as reinventing how work is done. That vision has drawn backers like SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate, which invested $4.4 billion in WeWork this year.

The Hudson’s Bay deals are meant to give WeWork prime real estate, particularly in Midtown Manhattan, with a way to blend street-level retail space alongside upper-floor real estate more useful for shared office space.

“Retail is changing, and the role that real estate has to play in the way that we shop today must change with it,” Adam Neumann, WeWork’s co-founder and chief executive, said in a statement. “The opportunity to develop this partnership with H.B.C. to explore this trend was too good to pass up.”

While WeWork normally leases space in commercial buildings, it set up WeWork Property Advisors to buy some property outright. Among the advantages of such arrangements is that the start-up would be able to enjoy any rise in the value of the real estate where it sets up its co-working spaces.

He had been thinking carefully about it for months. But now, right now, he wished to get it down on paper and make sure that those of us he’d appointed to edit his work posthumously understood his intentions.

He wanted this to be a book of scientific essays, distinct from his neurological case histories and memoirs; he felt these were some of his strongest pieces of writing from the past two decades. (One of them, “Mishearings,” was among the final suite of essays he wrote for The Times.) Topping the list were two he had written for The New York Review of Books on Charles Darwin — unique takes on Darwin, both delightful and erudite: one on his research on flowers, the other on his studies of “the humble” earthworm (Darwin’s last book).

To say that Darwin was Oliver Sacks’s greatest hero somehow doesn’t do justice to the admiration he felt for him. I suppose there isn’t a single word that fits. There are only Oliver’s own words — as in these, from the book:

It is often felt that Darwin, more than anyone, banished “meaning” from the world — in the sense of any overall divine meaning or purpose.…. [And yet] evolutionary theory provided, for many of us, a sense of deep meaning and satisfaction that belief in a divine plan had never achieved. The world that presented itself to us became a transparent surface, through which one could see the whole history of life. The idea that it could have worked out differently, that dinosaurs might still be roaming the earth or that human beings might never have evolved, was a dizzying one. It made life seem all the more precious and a wonderful, ongoing adventure.

Oliver saw his own life and career in a similar way: neither predictable nor predetermined but susceptible to the unexpected, to new experiences, which he embraced openly, hungrily. Of course he knew that he had certain intellectual and creative gifts, but he also felt fortunate that chance had favored him, as it sometimes does in nature. Who would have thought, for instance, that a book about people with neurological disorders and the odd title “The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat” would become a best seller in the mid-1980s and send Dr. Oliver Sacks off on the path it did? He certainly didn’t, and he knew it could all have turned out very differently. In the end, he was truly grateful for the life he’d had.

On that long August afternoon a little more than two years ago, Oliver completed his notes for the book he knew he would not see. He titled it “The River of Consciousness” — the title of one of the 10 essays — and dedicated it to his longtime friend and editor at The New York Review of Books, Bob Silvers. He wrote a letter to Mr. Silvers to share this news, and within days, he received a tender letter back. (Mr. Silvers died this year.) With that, I think he felt he had done everything he could.

Oliver spent his last few days and nights at home listening to music — Bach and Mozart; dictating last letters to loved ones; and, when not sleeping, listening as a small circle of friends took shifts reading aloud to him at his bedside from his favorite books.","Oliver Sacks, a Composer and His Last Work",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/opinion/oliver-sacks-a-composer-and-his-last-work.html

That has changed in recent weeks as negotiations with Canada and Mexico have become rockier, prompting industry leaders to organize and speak out. The next round of trade talks were postponed until mid-November to give the parties more time to resolve their differences.

Bill Lane of the Trade Leadership Coalition, which advocates preserving Nafta, said that until recently businesses had been largely silent on Nafta because they did not want to undercut other policy priorities, such as rewriting the tax code to secure a lower corporate tax rate.

“But they also realize it doesn’t matter what the tax rate is if you’re not competitive, and Nafta makes North American manufacturing competitive,” Mr. Lane said.

Businesses argue that the administration’s proposed changes to Nafta would reduce the certainty the agreement gives them over their future operating environment — a key consideration when investing long term. They say other proposals the United States seeks would increase their regulatory burden and costs. In an age where capital is mobile and businesses move around the world to increase their profits by a few percentage points, they argue that tighter restrictions could push manufacturing out of North America altogether.

The administration’s proposals for reforming Nafta including adding a clause that would terminate the agreement after five years unless the three countries voted to continue it, as well as setting a higher threshold for the proportion of automobiles and other goods that must be made in North America and the United States to benefit from favorable tariffs. Other provisions would make it easier for American businesses to levy punitive tariffs on Canadian and Mexican products, helping to wall off the United States’ market from what the administration describes as unfair competition.

In remarks to the press after the fourth round of Nafta talks, Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative in charge of the talks, acknowledged that the administration’s current strategy involves rolling back some of the advantages enjoyed by businesses under the pact, with the aim of redistributing those benefits elsewhere.

Mr. Lighthizer described his objective as getting “back to the days where there was a substantial majority of people in both parties that voted for these trade agreements.” But in order to get to that point, he said, “everybody has to give up a little bit of candy.”

“I think it’s possible to take a little bit of the sugar away, and have them say yeah, we’re still doing pretty well,” Mr. Lighthizer said of American businesses. “I understand that everybody that’s making money likes the rules where they are, that’s how it works. They can make a little less money or make more money in a different way, and we can get the trade deficit down.”

In the final analysis, Mr. Lighthizer said, he believed businesses would support the revised agreement.

So far, however, many businesses have expressed firm opposition to the proposals. Speaking in Mexico City earlier this month, Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that several proposals on the table could “doom the entire deal” and that the chamber would send an “army” of lobbyists to Capitol Hill to try to stop them.

Among the biggest opponents of the administration’s changes is the automobile industry. Under the administration’s proposed changes, 85 percent of the value of an automobile would need to be manufactured in North America to benefit from Nafta’s zero tariffs, up from 62.5 percent currently. The proposals would also require half of the value of cars manufactured in Canada or Mexico to be sourced from the United States.

According to Matt Blunt, the president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Ford, General Motors and Fiat-Chrysler, these restrictions would probably encourage companies to ignore Nafta altogether, prompting them to make automobiles outside of the United States and pay a tariff to import them. That would essentially create a tax on the auto industry and harm its competitiveness, Mr. Blunt argued.

On Wednesday, the American auto manufacturers, parts suppliers and dealers announced they would form a coalition called Driving American Jobs to fight to preserve Nafta.

Hun Quach, a lobbyist for the retail industry who planned to visit the Senate on Tuesday, said retailers saw opportunities to update and improve Nafta in a number of areas. But her group, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, was concerned about tighter regulations for apparel and textiles, the introduction of more uncertainty into the deal through a sunset clause, and more protectionist trade cases by the United States that would block imports from Canada and Mexico, she said.

“Anyone doing business within the Nafta region would like to have certainty to know that their supply chains they build over decades will remain in place,” Ms. Quach said.",‘Army’ of Lobbyists Hits Capitol Hill to Defend Nafta,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/nafta-lobby-congress.html

For example, you can’t have a civil conversation with people who are intent on destroying the rules that govern conversation itself. It’s fruitless to engage with people who are impervious to facts. There are some ideas — like racism — that are so noxious they deserve no recognition in any decent community. There are some people who are so consumed by enmity that the only thing they deserve is contempt.

You’re not going to change these people’s minds anyway. If you give them an opening, you’re just going to give them room to destroy the decent etiquette of society. Civility is not a suicide pact. As Benjamin DeMott put it in a famous 1996 essay for the Nation, “When you’re in an argument with a thug, there are things much more important than civility.”

And yet the more I think about it, the more I agree with the argument Yale Law professor Stephen L. Carter made in his 1998 book “Civility.” The only way to confront fanaticism is with love, he said. Ask the fanatics genuine questions. Paraphrase what they say so they know they’ve been heard. Show some ultimate care for their destiny and soul even if you detest the words that come out of their mouths.

You engage fanaticism with love, first, for your own sake. If you succumb to the natural temptation to greet this anger with your own anger, you’ll just spend your days consumed by bitterness and revenge. You’ll be a worse person in all ways.

You’ll teach the world something about you by the way you listen. You may even learn something; a person doesn’t have to be right to teach you some of the ways you are wrong.

Second, you greet a fanatic with compassionate listening as a way to offer an unearned gift to the fanatic himself. These days, most fanatics are not Nietzschean supermen. They are lonely and sad, their fanaticism emerging from wounded pride, a feeling of not being seen.

If you make these people feel heard, maybe in some small way you’ll address the emotional bile that is at the root of their political posture.

A lot of the fanaticism in society is electron-thin. People in jobs like mine get a lot of nasty emails, often written late at night after libations are flowing. But if we write back to our attackers appreciatively, and offer a way to save face, 90 percent of the time the next email is totally transformed. The brutal mask drops and the human being instantly emerges.

Finally, it’s best to greet fanaticism with love for the sake of the country. As Carter points out, the best abolitionists restrained their natural hatred of slaveholders because they thought the reform of manners and the abolition of slavery were part of the same cause — to restore the dignity of every human being.

We all swim in a common pool. You can shut bigots and haters out of your dining room or your fantasy football league, but when it comes to national political life, there’s nowhere else to go. We have to deal with each other.

Civility, Carter writes, “is the sum of the many sacrifices we are called to make for the sake of living together.”

You don’t have to like someone to love him. All you have to do is try to imitate Martin Luther King, who thrust his love into his enemies’ hearts in a way that was aggressive, remorseless and destabilizing.

The push to modernize the way fares are paid comes during a disastrous year for the subway system, with delays on every line, rush-hour malfunctions that have strangled the system, and worse: a train derailed in Manhattan in mid-June, injuring dozens of people and raising concerns over whether the subway was even safe. Service deteriorated so much that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency that month.

The challenges involved with making the trains run have to do with the outdated infrastructure in the tunnels and along the tracks, not the somewhat less-antiquated infrastructure of the MetroCard system.

Officials see the new payment system as a way to make getting into subway stations and onto buses faster, though that could bring more passengers into a system that is already straining to handle the millions it carries every day.

The new system will replace the MetroCard, but MetroCards will not be phased out until 2023 — 30 years after they replaced tokens for subways and buses. Until 2023, passengers can pay their fares the new way or with a MetroCard. The new system will also process fares for the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North commuter lines, which are also operated by the transportation authority.

The most obvious difference will be what passengers do to go through a subway turnstile or board a bus: wave or tap a smartphone or a credit or debit card, instead of swipe a MetroCard.

The system will work through apps like Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay as well as “contactless cards” — credit or debit cards with embedded chips that rely on a wireless technology known as near field communication, or N.F.C.

“The millennial generation, those who are more prone to new technology, will be our greatest users in the early stages,” Mr. Lhota said. He added that card issuers “are going to want to be a part of it” and would add the near-field technology “when they realize that 5.8 to 6 million people in New York City are getting on the subway every day.”

Mr. Lhota said another potential advantage was that fare readers could be installed near the back doors on buses to “allow for all-door boarding.” That would let buses pull away from bus stops sooner than they do now, reducing travel times.

The transit agency is hiring the same company that designed the system in London, which is also the company that developed MetroCards a generation ago. In London, the card that riders use is called the Oyster. In New York, the name has yet to be determined.

The new system will not mean the end of the flat fare that has defined the New York subway system since it opened in 1904. Fares on the London Underground are based on distance, as they are in other cities that use similar technology, like Washington. But Mr. Lhota said he was not contemplating changing the fare structure for the subways. (The Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North do charge by distance, using zones that usually include several stations.)

The reaction from transit advocates to the MetroCard’s eventual demise was generally positive.

“First things first: moving to a modern fare system is a convenience for riders,” said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance. “It allows them to benefit from the extraordinary innovations the private sector is undertaking these days.” But he said the new system would also benefit the transit agency, which has run its own currency system since the subways were brand new more than a century ago.

“The digital payment world has moved so quickly in the last 20 years that the M.T.A. has been left completely behind,” Mr. Raskin said. “Switching to a system that can take advantage of that means the M.T.A. shouldn’t end up in a situation where in 10 years it’s out of date. It can take advantage of every new innovation that’s yet to come.”

Thomas K. Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban policy group, praised the move, predicting that ridership would increase once the new fare system was widely available, just as it did after the MetroCard was introduced.

He called the new fare system “a real win-win and an important step for the M.T.A. to be taking.”

The transit agency has been talking for years about replacing the MetroCard, which made its debut when Bill Clinton was president. The basic fare then was $1.25 — $1.50 less than it is now and $1.75 less than with a single-ride MetroCard.

The transit agency ran a pilot program for a successor to the MetroCard in 2006. Officials hoped to do away with MetroCards by 2012 and believed that contactless bank cards would be the way to the future. But while such cards were popular in Europe, they did not immediately catch on in this country.

The transit authority sought bids for the new system and chose Cubic Transportation Systems, the company behind the MetroCard, from among five proposals. Monday’s vote by the transit authority’s finance committee sends the new fare payment plan to the agency’s board for a final decision on Wednesday.

Cubic signed a licensing deal in 2016 with Transport for London, the transit agency for greater London, that allowed Cubic to take the technology developed for London to other cities.

But calls about New York’s new fare payment system, once it is installed, will be answered nearly 400 miles away, in Buffalo. Cubic plans to open a call center there, putting jobs in an area that is struggling economically but is important politically to state officials like Mr. Cuomo, who controls the transit agency.",New York to Replace MetroCard With Modern Way to Pay Transit Fares,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/nyregion/metrocard-subway-new-york.html

The State Department said it has already cut off travel waivers allowing current and former senior military leaders into the country and was considering further actions to impose economic measures against those responsible for atrocities against Myanmar’s ethnic minority.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration threatened on Monday to take punitive actions against Myanmar unless it pulls back from its violent military campaign against Rohingya Muslims, expressing what it called “our gravest concern” over a crisis that has killed or displaced hundreds of thousands of people.

The State Department said it has already cut off travel waivers allowing current and former senior military leaders into the country and was considering further actions to impose economic measures against those responsible for atrocities against Myanmar’s ethnic minority. The department said that all military units involved in operations against the Rohingya were ineligible for American aid.

“The government of Burma, including its armed forces, must take immediate action to ensure peace and security; implement commitments to ensure humanitarian access to communities in desperate need; facilitate the safe and voluntary return of those who have fled or been displaced in Rakhine State; and address the root causes of systematic discrimination against the Rohingya,” the department said in a statement issued Monday night, using the former name for Myanmar.

The American warning came as the United Nations said the Rohingya Muslims who have fled deadly persecution in Myanmar to Bangladesh would soon exceed one million.

The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”",A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/your-money/paying-for-college/payback-college-loans.html

A sunny and enthusiastic personality, Mr. Lithgow calls his crossword puzzle collaboration with the veteran New York Times constructor Brendan Emmett Quigley an “exhilarating experience.”

France can be a notoriously expensive vacation destination — particularly if you have got your sights set on Paris or the French Riviera. Are luxury seekers on a limited budget out of luck? Not at all, said Joelle Kolich, the director of See Travel, a Bordeaux-based company selling luxury trips to the country.

Here are some of Ms. Kolich’s tips for a luxurious but budget-friendly vacation in France:

Ditch That Rental Car and Take the Train Forget renting a car (or, worse, relying on a private driver to get around), said Ms. Kolich. Instead, use the TGV, the country’s high-speed train system. “The TGV has lots of routes and is affordable and clean,” she said, “whereas the cost of a car, even a rental, adds up fast.” Ms. Kolich regularly books the TGV for her clients at favorable prices — for example, 45 euros (about $54) from Paris to Bordeaux.

Don’t Limit Yourself to Michelin-Starred Restaurants France’s many Michelin-starred restaurants aren’t the only places to enjoy high-quality, multicourse meals. “Wherever you go in France, you’ll find small restaurants where up-and-coming, talented chefs serve inventive cuisine,” Ms. Kolich said. One example is Racines, in Bordeaux. It’s a favorite of Ms. Kolich’s, and a three-course dinner showcasing seasonal produce starts at 29 euros a person.

They found that eight of ten large uprisings happened within two years of a volcanic eruption.
“It really gives us pause for the future because volcanic eruptions will continue, and they will come at unpredictable times,” Dr. McCormick said.","As less water is absorbed into the clouds, less rain falls into seas and lakes. And if a volcano erupts in the Northern Hemisphere, especially at high latitudes, the cooling effect may tamper with the summertime heating that controls monsoon winds over Africa.

When rainfall is reduced and monsoons are suppressed, the Nile fails to flood as usual, starving the crops that depend on its water.

“We guess there was a lot of fear when the Egyptians see the Nile not flooding that year,” said Joseph Manning, a historian from Yale and co-author on the study. “There was fear about what’s going to happen. ‘Are we going to starve like last time when there was no flood three years in a row?’”

That fear could have fueled riots. But to establish a connection between volcanoes and revolts in ancient Egypt, the team first had to determine the dates for when the volcanoes erupted.

They did that by looking at ice core data from Greenland and Antarctica, which contain trapped sulfur from ancient volcanic eruptions. The scientists then turned to papyrus records to figure out when the Nile River failed to flood as usual.

But the records from the Ptolemaic period were all qualitative, not quantitative. So the team turned to the Nilometer record, which contains measurements taken by large instruments built during Egypt’s early Islamic period to monitor the Nile River’s annual flood level.

The researchers used the data from the Nilometer record to gain measurements from 622 A.D. to 1902 A.D., and identified 60 eruptions between those years. On average the Nile flood level was nearly nine inches lower during eruption years, the team discovered.

This suggested a pattern that may have existed during the Ptolemaic Period, as well.

After confirming a link between volcanic eruptions and poor Nile flooding, the team then matched the dates of Ptolemaic eruptions with papyrus records of well-known rebellions. They found that eight of ten large uprisings happened within two years of a volcanic eruption.

More Reporting on Archaeology

The biggest of these, the 20-year Theban revolt, began in 207 B.C., followed a large tropical eruption two years earlier. A papyrus report from this time indicated that most of the farmers were killed and the land had gone dry.

In their paper, the researchers were careful to clarify that volcanoes alone were not the cause of Egyptian revolts. Rather, the natural disasters set off a reaction that mixed other ingredients — like heavy taxation, ethnic conflict and disease — to incite social unrest.

“You have all of these things coalescing at a time, and you can image it’s a powder keg,” said Dr. Ludlow. “All of it puts a strain on the social system and can just ignite into revolt against the Ptolemaic Greek elites.”

Not every eruption in that period was linked to a revolt. The river failed to flood in the years following massive eruptions in 46 and 44 B.C. during Cleopatra’s reign, but her food allocation policies may have helped avert uprisings.

Kyle Harper, a professor of classics at the University of Oklahoma who has studied environmental change and the fall of the Roman Empire, said the new paper was compelling and that it showed a strong link between volcanic forces and their effects on the Nile River. He added that he would like to see if the analysis could be extended to Egypt’s Roman and early Islamic periods.

But Kevin Anchukaitis, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arizona, said that the study had some shortcomings. For instance, he called the variability in the Nile River flooding during eruption years relatively small. The study also did not account for weather effects like El Niño during that period, he said.

Dr. Ludlow responded by saying that the study shows that the flood levels are consistently lower following eruptions, and that larger eruptions produced a correspondingly greater drop in flood levels.

To Michael McCormick, a professor of history at Harvard, the study offers a note of caution as we face climatic changes in the future.

“It really gives us pause for the future because volcanic eruptions will continue, and they will come at unpredictable times,” Dr. McCormick said. “It is sobering to see how this may have had an effect on a very productive economy in the ancient world, and we need to reflect on how it may affect us.”",Volcanoes Helped Violent Revolts Erupt in Ancient Egypt,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/science/volcanoes-ancient-egypt-revolts.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Broadly speaking, it is a protectionist policy that limits foreign competition in shipping. Without it, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has argued, thousands of American jobs would be outsourced.

What are the arguments for and against repeal?

Opponents of the Jones Act, on both sides of the aisle, argue that it serves special interests and unfairly burdens some Americans in the process.

“If the government wants to subsidize the continuation of a maritime industry, it should do it with a direct subsidy, not these indirect methods that impose large costs on the territories, particularly Puerto Rico,” said Barry P. Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the left-leaning think tank.

The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank, has said that the law amounts to little more than a “legislative gift to the shipping industry.” And, in introducing a bill last month to repeal the law, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, argued that it had outlived its purpose.

In 2013, the World Trade Organization described the Jones Act as “the most restrictive” protectionist shipping or transport law in the world, calling it an “anomaly” in the otherwise open market of the United States. Even China, which has similar restrictions in place, lacks a requirement that vessels be made locally, the organization noted.

In arguing for a longer-term waiver, Puerto Rican officials say they need all the help they can get. “It couldn’t hurt. It couldn’t hurt to have it,” Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told CBS News on Oct. 9, a day after the waiver expired.

Without it, the nation would either have to build its own expensive fleet to carry cargo or “pay exorbitant prices” for naval vessels and rely on foreign carriers to move critical military supplies, the Lexington Institute, a Washington-area policy research group, said in a 2011 report.

“Ninety years after it became law, the Jones Act continues to be vital to national security needs,” it concluded.

What would repeal look like?

Many studies have found that repealing the Jones Act would contribute hundreds of millions of dollars annually to the American economy. It would also eliminate a policy that has been blamed for driving up gas prices, moving some Texas oil to refineries abroad, and, reportedly, a decision by at least one Hawaiian cattle rancher’s to put his cows on a plane.

But the effect of repeal may be complicated for Puerto Rico. While it may have increased costs for some goods there, it also created a “discrete” and predictable market between the mainland United States and the island, according to a 2013 report by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office.

Under the Jones Act, a handful of American shippers provide regular service to Puerto Rico, bringing perishable goods like dairy, meat and agricultural products as well as other supplies, the report found. Foreign carriers typically operate on longer, global routes, with less-reliable service.

Repealing the law would probably lead to the outsourcing of shipbuilding and associated jobs, the report said. Loosening its requirements would make it easier for foreign carriers to compete, most likely pushing down shipping costs, according to the report.

But the effect on prices would depend on other factors, including how the government regulated those new carriers and what business decisions they made in response to the new opportunity in Puerto Rico.

“So many factors influence freight rates and product prices that the independent effect and associated economic costs of the Jones Act cannot be determined,” the agency concluded, after reviewing research and interviewing shipping industry experts.

In a 2012 report on the economic challenges facing Puerto Rico, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York acknowledged the complications associated with repeal, but suggested that a temporary reprieve from the Jones Act — for, say, five years — could help clarify its effects.

“Trends in shipping costs, volumes, and business practices could be monitored,” the bank wrote. “At the end of the period, a review could assess the costs and benefits to determine if this exemption should be made permanent.”",Would Repealing the Jones Act Help Puerto Rico?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/jones-act-puerto-rico.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

While Hungary, Slovakia and Poland have taken the authoritarian route, the Czech Republic, with its more secular, democratic grounding, long seemed like the best hope for a bridge between the two sides. But the victory by Ano and its billionaire leader, Andrej Babis, make that unlikely.

People who know Mr. Babis’s business style warn that he is a ruthless businessman, more interested in expanding his personal power than in furthering the common good. Apart from an empire in agricultural industry, he owns several newspapers and a radio station. After allegations of tax fraud, he was removed as minister of finance in May. There are also investigations into claims that Mr. Babis illegally received European Union subsidies for one of his hotels.

Yet all of this does not seem to impair his popularity. On the contrary, in the eyes of many Czechs it makes Mr. Babis one of them, a guy who stands up against the bigotry and double standards of the establishment, or, as one slogan goes, against the Prague “coffeehouse thugs.” Almost 30 years after the Velvet Revolution of 1989, the heritage of freedom fighters like Vaclav Havel has been replaced by the chauvinism of the underdog.

Of course, a certain disillusionment with the promises of the West is understandable. When today’s Visegrad states joined the European Union 13 years ago, they expected stability. Instead they joined a club that soon slipped into permanent crisis mode, first over the future of the eurozone and then over the mass influx of migrants. Freedom, it turned out, did not mean security — just new insecurities. To many Central Europeans, it was shocking to learn that you could be part of the West and still fear being left behind.

Along with that shock came a lack of cultural preparedness for the new competitiveness. Forty years of Communism left people with an immense distrust of one another and of the political class. The era of totalitarianism was never really processed. Even young Czechs, who did not experience Communist rule as adults (if at all), describe their society as being shot through with distrust, leaving them wary of their neighbors.

Czech society places a premium on scapegoating and victimization, says Erik Tabery, the editor in chief of Respekt, a newsmagazine based in Prague. In his book “The Left Nation,” Mr. Tabery argues that the Czech Republic needs a more proactive, cooperative foreign policy that will push the country farther into the West. But he admits that positions like this have left him and like-minded colleagues very lonely in Prague.

It is true that Western Europe has cared too little for its new Eastern members since they joined the union, and it is understandable that many there feel treated like second-class Europeans. The West never took seriously the different experiences and legacies east of the Elbe River. American soldiers never set foot there after 1945, nor was there a 1968 generation to force a phase of messy, republican puberty.

49A: Do you get tripped up by clues where the first word is actually a proper name? “Banks of Chicago” sounds as if it refers to places in Chicago where you can keep your money, but we’ve got only a five-letter slot. The constructor and editors have sneakily used the capital-letter-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence rule against you. “Banks” refers to the baseball player ERNIE Banks.

Constructor Notes

I guess I can say with a smile that this is just an O.K. puzzle. This worked only because I was able to find 4 four-letter synonyms for O.K. that could be clued otherwise, which is why “so-so,” at first an obvious synonym, wasn’t included. I also wanted to include a gunfighter on each side. Fun fact: Kirk Douglas, who played Doc Holliday in the 1957 movie, celebrated his centennial last year.

As a candidate, Donald Trump promised regular people, “I will be your voice,” and attacked the drug industry for “getting away with murder” in setting high prices for lifesaving medications. But as president, he has declared war on regulatory programs protecting the health, safety and economic rights of consumers. He has done so in disregard of evidence that such protections help the economy and financial well-being of the working-class voters he claims to champion.

Already his aggressive actions exceed those of the Reagan administration in returning the country to the “Let the buyer beware” days of the 1950s.

Though Mr. Trump is brazen in his opposition to consumer protections, many of his most damaging attacks are occurring in corners of the bureaucracy that receive minimal news coverage. His administration, for instance, wants to strip the elderly of their right to challenge nursing home abuses in court by allowing arbitration clauses in nursing home contracts. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has announced that it is canceling a proposed rule intended to reduce the risk of sleep apnea-related accidents among truck drivers and railway workers.

And the Environmental Protection Agency is busy weakening, repealing and under-enforcing protections, including for children, from toxic exposure. Scott Pruitt, the director, went against his agency’s scientists to jettison an imminent ban on the use of chlorpyrifos, an insecticide widely used on vegetables and fruits. Long-accumulated evidence shows that the chemical is poisoning the drinking water of farm workers and their families.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — The romantic in Ned White emerges today with a 76-word puzzle that plays around with a popular phrase.

Today’s Theme

I managed to solve the revealer, HEAD OVER HEELS, before I figured out the theme, which may or may not have helped me.

The theme itself places phrases used to designate people as the “head” of something (NUMERO UNO at 13A, for example) on top of phrases used to call someone a “heel” (SCOUNDREL at 17A), thus giving us HEAD OVER HEELS. I liked this idea, and Mr. White does it well, except I had trouble locating the central pair because they were staggered at 56A (BIG WHEEL) and 42A (DIRTY RAT).

8A: Yes, a five-letter entry for “One of the Obamas” could be either SASHA or MALIA. But check those crossings. They’re not all easy, but perhaps you knew that a SPORE was “One of billions in a puffball” at 8D.

The larger point, though, is that Trumpism is fueled by a sense of economic anxiety that has exploded into fury, and there is no curing that until growth in the real economy (not just the stock market) resumes and creates a genuine sense of mobility and opportunity. If the rich benefit disproportionately it is only because they pay a disproportionate share of taxes.

Gail: The rich pay more taxes, but if they get a cut, they’re more likely to just sock it away. It’s the non-rich who go out and use the new income to buy stuff. That in turn gins up the economy.

Bret: So here is where we get to the root of our differences on taxes. When the rich “sock it away,” that only means that they are spending or investing, which is to say, putting the money into the real economy just like everyone else. They create jobs when they build a second home or become angel investors in a promising start-up or reinvest in their own businesses. Yes, it’s “trickle down” economics. No doubt most of our readers agree with me entirely!

That being said, I’m sorry that this isn’t the kind of bipartisan tax reform we had under Reagan in 1981 or 1986, when Democratic senators like Bill Bradley and congressmen like Dan Rostenkowski and Dick Gephardt were backers of the legislation.

The result is that the only reform we can get now, to avoid a presumptive Democratic filibuster, is through the parliamentary shenanigan known as budget reconciliation. And budget reconciliation requires that tax reform not add to the deficit, which leads to some pretty bad ideas, like a border tax or slashing the 401(k) deductibility limit to balance the books.

Gail: Bill Bradley once told me that he got interested in tax reform because when he was a basketball player he was a depreciable asset. Maybe our problem now is that we can’t write off any members of the Senate.

Bret: Love the Bill Bradley line. Good thing depreciation doesn’t apply to newspaper columnists. We just get better with age, like wine. Uh, right?

Gail: We’re all walking Bordeaux.

But about those taxes — we’re obviously not going to get a bipartisan deal as long as a certain president is in the White House. Right now there’s a modest, sensible bipartisan health care plan floating around that the Senate could pass right away if Donald Trump would get behind it. But he keeps changing his mind.

I’m interested in your complaint about how the current rules require that tax reform not add to the deficit. Do you think the deficit isn’t a problem?

Bret: I only worry about deficits in extended periods of slow growth. Nobody thinks of Carter-era stagflation as a prosperous time for the United States, but the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio was low: just under 31 percent in 1980 as opposed to around twice that in the middle of the Clinton boom. And there are times when the government has legitimate reasons to spend a lot of money and pile on debt, like winning World War II under Roosevelt or the Cold War under Reagan. We should never hold public prosperity hostage for the sake of a statistical artifact dear mostly to anally retentive deficit scolds preaching “The end is nigh!”

But I think you’ve put your finger on something essential. Bipartisanship is moribund under this president because he’s thrashed the concept and possibility of trust in politics. There was a brief ray of hope last month when he seemed ready to strike a deal on DACA, but that seems to have collapsed, too.

Speaking of trust, do you trust General Kelly?

Gail: Do you remember those days of yore when everybody presumed Trump wouldn’t blow up the planet because he had those three sensible generals hovering in the background? Generals who were undoubtedly working out a plan among themselves for how to put a lid on the president if he tried to drop a bomb on North Korea?

Seems so quaint now. As out of date as the theory that Ivanka and Jared would turn him into a social moderate so their New York friends wouldn’t give them the cold shoulder.

How about you?

Bret: Trump single-handedly destroys the theory of containment. Nothing and nobody contains him. And he tarnishes everything and everyone around him. He’s like a hyper-empowered schlemiel — I’m using the Yiddish word for the guy who proverbially spills his borscht all over you — while turning the rest of us into his schlimazels, the ones who get spilled on.

The latest political fiasco involving Trump’s condolence calls is such a case in point. This should be the one thing every president ought to be able to get right. But Trump couldn’t help but turn an accusatory political finger at Barack Obama, which was wrong on fact, wretched as principle and dumb as politics. And then Kelly, for whom I used to have nothing but admiration, soiled his own moment by defending the president and needlessly pointing an accusatory finger at Representative Frederica Wilson, which once again turned out to be wrong on fact, wretched as principle and dumb as politics.

When did people forget when to know how to leave well enough alone? Like, you know, Bill O’Reilly.

Gail: Yow, I’m not sure the concept of “let alone” is one O’Reilly ever mastered.

But about Trump — we’re seeing more and more outcry from traditional Republicans. George W. Bush made a powerful speech last week. Senator Corker from Tennessee has done everything but picket the White House. John McCain has been incredible. But none of it seems to have any impact on the base. Really coming to dread that base.

What do you think is going to happen to the party? Will it be Bannonized? Split in two?

Bret: I fear the worst. The only people who seem to be standing up to Bannon are either retiring, retired or gravely ill. But where’s Paul Ryan? What about Mitch McConnell? Watching him standing alongside Trump in that Rose Garden ceremony the other day was like watching a hostage video. “Stockholm syndrome” is something conservatives used to accuse liberals of suffering from. Ha! Today it’s the so-called establishment Republicans who have fallen in love with their mad captor.

Gail: Yeah, if he wasn’t around, they’d be forced to give up their good office space to the other side.

Bret: All parties have their extremists; every political persuasion has its fanatical tendency. Republicans have spent the past 60 or so years trying to dissociate themselves from their nativist, isolationist, ethnonationalist wing only to fall right back into it. It’s like a man falling off the wagon after decades of sobriety.

I don’t think the party of Reagan will survive Trumpism. Those of us who subscribe to some version or another of moderate conservatism are going to have to find a new political home, either alongside centrist, Clinton-style Democrats — who, I hope, will hold the Democratic reins in 2020 — or in an entirely new party, the Party of Sanity. As someone once said to somebody, 4,000 or so years ago, surely there must be 10 good people left in this wicked city.

Gail: I suspect that in a Trump-free world, the moderate Republicans and the Clinton-style Democrats would notice they still have a lot — not in common. Such as taxes. But it’s amazing how the current occupant of the White House has managed to bring us together.

Should we thank him? O.K., I guess not.

Happy United Nations Day, Bret. And next week it’s Halloween. Who are you going trick-or-treating as?

Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 12. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

The unusual heat in Los Angeles also comes amid a period of extreme weather events around the country, such as the devastating hurricanes that have hit Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida; temperatures of over 100 degrees in Portland in August and San Francisco last month; and the wildfires that have raged through parts of California.

“For Angelinos, October is Santa Ana season,” said William Patzert, a climatologist with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is about 10 miles northeast of Dodger Stadium.

Santa Ana winds blow toward the Pacific Ocean when a high-pressure system builds over the Great Basin desert in Nevada. That pushes winds through the high desert and three mountain passes — Cajon, Banning and Santa Clarita River — at speeds ranging from 30 to 50 miles per hour.

“As they drop down into the basin where Dodger Stadium is, they tend to heat up and dry out,” Patzert said. “What we’re expecting in the next couple days is record-breaking heat.”

This could be not-so-welcome news for the starting pitchers in Game 1, Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers and Dallas Keuchel of the Astros.

Dodger Stadium, which sits in Chavez Ravine in the hills just above downtown Los Angeles, is one of baseball’s more pitcher-friendly ballparks — especially at night. This is due to not only the stadium’s dimensions, with its ample 385-foot power alleys, but also Los Angeles’s weather patterns. Normally, mornings bring an offshore flow, as warm air is carried out toward the ocean.

In the afternoon, the winds often shift, bringing in a moist, heavier marine layer that benefits pitchers, weighing down long drives that might normally leave the ballpark. If that marine air is absent, replaced by warm, dry and thin air from the Santa Ana winds, it could be a boon for lineups with plenty of pop. The Astros were second in the American League with 238 home runs, while the Dodgers were fourth in the National League with 221.

Keuchel, though, did not seem to mind.

“This weather is always beautiful,” he said Monday. “It’s that dry heat.”

Asked if it was hot enough to make him consider shaving his bushy, chest-length beard, Keuchel laughed.

“Well, if it’s hot enough for four wins, I’ll shave it for sure,” he said.

For a long time, weather was less of an issue in the World Series. Until the postseason was expanded in 1969, the World Series wrapped up much earlier in October. And until 1971, when Commissioner Bowie Kuhn persuaded NBC to begin broadcasting some World Series games at night, postseason games were played exclusively during the day.

Kuhn, sensitive to criticism over the move away from traditional day baseball, sat in the stands without an overcoat during Game 2 of the 1976 World Series, even though others around him shivered as they watched the Yankees play the Reds in Cincinnati. In 1979, Kuhn prohibited the Baltimore Orioles and Pittsburgh Pirates from wearing ski caps during warm-ups or in the dugout, even though it was 41 degrees at the start of Game 1.

After Kuhn was long gone, the postseason calendar kept expanding. Division series were added in 1995 to supplement the league championship series that had begun 26 years before. And then a wild-card game was added for each league in 2012.

The extended postseason action has created the opportunity for more bone-chilling nights when the Series takes place in cities like Boston, New York, Denver, Detroit, Chicago or Philadelphia.

After a frigid 2006 World Series, when the St. Louis Cardinals and the Detroit Tigers improvised to keep warm when the temperature dipped below 40 degrees, the New Era apparel company persuaded Major League Baseball to allow it to develop three types of cold-weather accouterments: knit ski caps, balaclavas and fleece-lined baseball caps with ear flaps, which drew comparison to cartoon character Elmer Fudd’s hunting cap.

The gear came in handy in 2008, when the Phillies and Tampa Bay Rays had to play in wet, windy and cold conditions in Philadelphia.

Dodgers outfielder Curtis Granderson pondered the weather’s effects on the postseason in 2006, when he played for the Tigers. “Since spring training, outside of maybe the first few weeks in April, it’s been nice weather all season,” he recalled thinking that year. “Now we’re trying to determine the best teams in baseball and it’s anywhere from 20 to 50 degrees colder than you’ve been playing all season long? Has anyone thought about this?”

You once had a cupcake and cheese ball business.

I was making cupcakes, and then they became really popular. But I always wanted to sell them for a dollar, and everyone else was charging $3 or $4. Then butter went up, and then I got a cockroach problem. So I moved on to cheese balls. And then I got a huge mouse problem, and I was like, “I’m done with making food inside my apartment.”

The cupcakes are gone?

I’ll do it for a special request. Like if there’s a school charity, I’ll say: “You get two dozen cupcakes, but my rules are only vanilla, I’ll leave it with my doorman, you pick it up, you don’t call me, maybe I’ll put pokes on it, maybe not, maybe jimmies on it, maybe not.” And they’re like, “Lady, we don’t even want your stupid cupcakes.” I’m so awful — because I do it because I want to do it, not because I have to do it. When I have to do it, I don’t want to play anymore.

And the cheese balls? They’re such a rarity in New York.

That’s why I brought them back! I mean, it’s a ball of cheese that you can use over a period of four or five days. You just have to reshape it and roll it in more nuts, and nobody will ever know.

You’re a rabbit lover.

I’m on my third rabbit. I’ve had her for three years, and her name’s Tina, and she’s got a deformed paw. She’s seven pounds and the bossiest one I’ve ever had. She’ll stop me in a hallway where I can’t get past her, or, if I’m sitting down, she’ll get behind me and nibble on my back. She’s just in my face a lot.

So you’re a real homebody?

I’m not a shut-in, but I do work a lot on my home, and I’m surrounded by everything that I love. And I think about people who have lost their places with the flooding and fires, and I look around my apartment and think, “God, I would hate to lose that taxidermied chipmunk or cluster of wax flowers.” I’m always amazed by people who don’t do anything to their house. They’re renting their apartment, so they don’t want to paint or put holes in the wall so they’ll get their deposit back. And the way I look at it is, “Oh, it’s only going to cost me $1,500 to trash my place.”",Amy Sedaris Is the Hostess With the Mostess.

Some principals have chosen to introduce science- and math-based creativity classes or experiential learning projects, while one Shanghai administrator simply lets out school early a day a week to encourage kids to “explore.”

“Students must develop a personality,” Dai Chong, a Beijing schoolteacher, said, uttering a priority unthinkable two decades ago for a nation of rote-learning math fanatics.

As Mr. Dai ushered me through the hallways of Beijing National Day School, I noted practices that seemed more American than Chinese: Rankings were not be posted. Textbooks were left at school instead of toted home for study. Class sizes had been whittled down to a maximum of 25. A mental health club was advertised as a release valve for academic pressure. Choice was also on the menu — students could pick electives such as swimming, rock climbing and Frisbee.

“We have found traditional authoritarian Chinese teaching has many ill effects and deviates from the essence of education, which is to serve individuals,” Mr. Dai said. “Our teachers are like friends.”

An abrupt reversal, indeed, for a school that at one time didn’t provide hot water for showers because cold water would enhance “willpower and endurance.”

Reformers are also loosening the shackles of entrance-exam testing. Some students in Shanghai will have two chances at the college entrance exam, while universities are beginning to consider volunteering, interviews and regular high school tests as part of the admissions process.

For all its faults, the Chinese system provides some benefits that critics tend to dismiss. It imparts an early foundation of knowledge that can prepare a child for lifelong success. Cognitive scientists say that real learning doesn’t happen unless knowledge is imprinted on long-term memory. Once children lock away key information, they can free up the active memory for thinking deeply — and for being creative.

And the system produces success stories. On the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 2012 problem-solving test, students in Shanghai — a pilot district where reforms are tested — finished sixth, well above the O.E.C.D. average. And highly skilled Chinese can thrive in environments that encourage originality and entrepreneurship.

When such skilled Chinese emigrate, the results are impressive: Ethnic Chinese immigrants are founding Silicon Valley start-ups and are securing American patents at a disproportionate rate. China is a global leader in industries like artificial intelligence, drone manufacturing and mobile payments. China’s start-up sector has produced nearly as many tech unicorns as the United States (and surpassed Europe) so far this year.

Significant obstacles stand in the way of reform. Deeply rooted authoritarianism and exam pressure dampen individual will, as does the Communist Party’s increasingly heavy political agenda in the classroom. How can China’s leadership cultivate critical-thinking skills while also pushing political indoctrination?

Further, change is largely confined to urban Chinese schools with the will, special designation or clout to experiment, while rural students are more likely to founder in a system that perpetuates inequality. Meanwhile, families with the financial means continue to prefer secondary and university education abroad.

A Spooky Ondes Martenot

The otherworldly ondes Martenot is a far-out electronic instrument invented in 1928. It’s still something of a rarity, despite being championed by Messiaen, the composers of film soundtracks and, more recently, Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead, and it’s practically a character in “The Exterminating Angel.”

The opera, like the film it’s based on, is about a group of wealthy guests who assemble for a chic dinner party — and then find themselves inexplicably unable to leave, prevented by some mysterious force. The ondes, with its spooky swoops and slides and eerie timbre, represents that strange force; Mr. Adès said that it could be considered the voice of the exterminating angel.

The part was written specifically for Cynthia Millar, a leading ondes player, who will perform it at the Met. She described the sound as “very beguiling and also very terrifying.”

It will be a rare outing for an ondes in the pit of the Met, where it was used in Samuel Barber’s “Antony and Cleopatra,” which opened the new opera house at Lincoln Center half a century ago but has seldom (if ever) been heard there since. Ms. Millar said that Mr. Adès’s writing for the ondes differed from that of other composers.

“Although this is a generalization, on the whole the music that Messiaen has written for the instrument is in the character of a seraphic, superhuman soprano, wishing good to the world,” she said. “That’s not the case here.”

Rock, Paper and a Salad Bowl

The score calls several times for a door to be slammed, so Gregory Zuber, the Met’s principal percussionist, coordinated with the Met’s carpentry shop, which built him a small door attached to an easel-like frame that stands along the back wall of the pit.

Mr. Adès said that he was drawn by both the symbolism and sound of the slamming door. “The actual door in the story is open,” he said. “They could walk through it at any time. This is a crucial thing to grasp. But the symbolic door slams at several points.”

An unusually large battery of percussion instruments lines the Met’s pit for “The Exterminating Angel,” including a pair of rocks to bang together, paper to be torn, a maraca filled with metal bottle caps, a wooden salad bowl substituting for a wooden instrument used in processions, and an array of cowbells.

“The cowbells are stand-ins for pitched saucepans, which are not readily available,” Mr. Zuber said.

Mr. Adès said that he was a percussionist when he was a student. “If I were not doing what I’m doing these days,” he said, sitting in the front row of the opera house and looking down at a pit full of odd instruments, “I’d be very, very happy down there where Greg and his colleagues are.”",Hear the Surreal Instruments of the Met’s New Opera,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/arts/music/hear-the-surreal-instruments-of-the-mets-new-opera.html

But manufacturers have not gone quietly in the city. They have mounted several legal challenges, arguing that e-cigs do not qualify because technically they do not emit smoke. The most recent challenge to New York City’s ban was rejected this year in the New York State Court of Appeals, which found that the inclusion of e-cigs in the law was valid.

Jeff Seyler, the executive vice president of the American Lung Association’s Northeast region, said, “This new law not only protects public health by restricting the use of e-cigarettes and the public’s exposure to smoke-cigarette emissions,” but it also shields children, for whom the products are “just another tool reeling them into a dangerous and often lifetime of addiction to nicotine.”

But proponents of devices like e-cigs and vaporizers — larger, cellphone-size gadgets — say they are a safer alternative to cigarettes and may help with smoking cessation. Studies so far have been limited and short term, and are not conclusive on either front.

At Long Island Vape, in Huntington Station, N.Y., the owner, Aman Singh, said the rules were unnecessary — the social mores that govern cigarette smokers already are in play when it comes to vapers, he said. “Our customers they know that they can’t be walking through a store vaping, or sitting at a bar vaping,” he said. “They don’t feel like doing it anyway because its obnoxious.”

Mr. Singh acknowledged that the product he sells may be a health risk, but he says it is a lesser evil; most customers use it as way to quit traditional cigarettes, he said.

“We’re out here trying to help people,” he said, adding he worries about the impact ever-tighter strictures on e-cigarettes would have on his customers. “I think people will start smoking cigarettes again.”",New York State Bans Vaping Anywhere Cigarettes Are Prohibited,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/nyregion/new-york-bans-vaping-ecigs-bars-restaurants.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Heart disease strikes people with diabetes at significantly higher rates than people without diabetes, “and we don’t fully know why,” said Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston.
People with diabetes develop heart disease at younger ages and are nearly twice as likely to die of heart attack or stroke as people who do not have diabetes.

Q. How do people die from diabetes?

A. People who have diabetes cannot regulate their blood sugar levels and if the disease isn’t tightly controlled, blood sugar can spike to abnormally high levels, a condition called hyperglycemia, or dip below normal, a condition called hypoglycemia. Both conditions are potentially life-threatening and can lead to coma and death if not promptly treated.

But complications resulting from the disease are a more common cause of death. Heart disease strikes people with diabetes at significantly higher rates than people without diabetes, “and we don’t fully know why,” said Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. People with diabetes develop heart disease at younger ages and are nearly twice as likely to die of heart attack or stroke as people who do not have diabetes.

People with Type 2 diabetes, which is the more common form of the disease, are more likely to have elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity, Dr. Gabbay said, all risk factors for cardiovascular disease. “The good news,” he said, “is that a lot of treatments, like those for lowering cholesterol, are even more effective at lowering risk in people with diabetes than in people without.” Some new classes of diabetes medications used for Type 2 diabetes have also been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk, he said.

People with Type 1 diabetes are also at increased risk for heart disease, though the reasons are less clear.

Both types of diabetes can also lead to other long-term complications, like kidney disease, that may result in premature death. Problems like vision loss, nerve damage and infections that may lead to amputations can increase the likelihood of injuries and accidents. Good disease management starting early in the disease process helps people avoid some of these complications, Dr. Gabbay said.

And before that was “The Beguiled,” with Sofia Coppola, and “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” which was shot last summer in Cincinnati and, of Mr. Farrell’s recent films, has perhaps affected him the most.

Written by Mr. Lanthimos with Efthymis Filippou, the film is far darker than “The Lobster,” and suffused with an increasingly claustrophobic dread. Mr. Farrell adopted a monotone for the part similar to that of his “Lobster” role, but the characters’ similarity ends there.

David, his “Lobster” character, was doughy, inward, guileless and desperately lonely, all of which felt especially poignant coming from a live wire like Mr. Farrell, who said he felt great liberation in being so contained. “There was no attempt and no desire, as written, to be in any way cool, any way interesting, any way suave,” he said. But Steven, the heart surgeon he played in “Killing,” is cunning and arrogant, and by the end of the production, Mr. Farrell said, he felt very depressed.

“It’s a gift to have that kind of relationship, it’s easier to go further and explore other things,” Mr. Lanthimos said. “This was a challenge, something more different and complex and dark, and I knew he had the understanding and tone.”

For all his work on big films, Mr. Farrell has long preferred smaller films anyway and the specific stories they can tell. When Martin McDonagh approached him to play a hit man for “In Bruges,” basically throwing him a lifeline, he almost turned down the part. He’d been in a string of bad movies and was still feeling the lingering burn of his Alexander the Great movie. (Among the sharper barbs: “He seems like a moody sad sack that I wouldn’t follow to the grocery store much less into battle.”) He worried his name might scare people away.

Mr. McDonagh persuaded him anyway. “The character needed to be lovable and appealing even though he’s done something horrific and unforgivable, and it’s easy to love Colin, and to believe that sense of guilt he showed so well,” Mr. McDonagh wrote by email. “Also, I don’t think he ever really didn’t want to do the part for a second!”

For Mr. Farrell, it was a shaky time. He was scant months out of rehab, having finally caved to his family’s pressures to get straight. Asked what hastened his bottoming out, Mr. Farrell quipped, “Just existing.” But really, he added, it was the intensity of sudden fame, which came fast after Joel Schumacher cast him in “Tigerland” (2000) and then “Phone Booth” (2002).

“Getting all these platitudes and things being said about you, and all these gifts, it wasn’t in my DNA to believe any of this stuff,” he said. “You try and match the hype, but I never believed it.”

Mr. Farrell is from Castleknock, a relatively well-to-do Dublin suburb, and studied at the Gaiety School of Acting in Dublin before landing a role in 1998 on the BBC soap “Ballykissangel.” He took the Irish national commandment of not getting ahead of yourself to Hollywood, “foolishly and understandably,” he now says, equating personal change with betraying his roots.

“I remember making a promise to myself, ‘Don’t change, don’t change, remember where you come from,’” he said, “But change is inevitable. You don’t change, you get sickness, your life will fall apart on the inside.”

His antics filled gossip pages, but he swears many of them were lost to blackouts. I asked about the time he kissed a reporter on camera on the red carpet, and his eyes widened. “Did I? Who? Which one?” he asked. “I swear to God, I lost so much time.” A little while later, a button on my blouse popped, and as I quickly refastened it, he steadfastly held my gaze, and then pointed to his eyes. “I kept right here, the whole time,” he teased. “Back in the day I would’ve leaned in for a kiss, obviously.”

The exchange was light and playful, and the interview took place before The New York Times published its exposé on the producer Harvey Weinstein, whose reported sexual misconduct Mr. Farrell would later denounce as “atrocious.” In our chat, though, Mr. Farrell did address the latitude given to stars.

“The one thing that fame asks you to do, I have learned, is to police yourself,” he said. “You get away with murder, you get away with mistreating people, you won’t be called out on things you really should be called out with, you really do.”

He was glad that those days were behind him, he said, not least because sobriety has made him a much better dad. His first son, James Padraig, was born in 2003 (James’s mother is the model Kim Bordenave), and initially Mr. Farrell figured he’d be his son’s friend. “’Cause that’s what a 6-month-old grub needs,” he cracked, “a 27-year-old drunk, high friend.” He had his second son, Henry, with his former girlfriend the actress Alicja Bachleda-Curus. Mr. Farrell shares custody of his sons, and says he can’t think of a decision he has made in the last dozen or so years without thinking about how it would impact them.

Now his life centers on the boys, his home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, yoga (“I said I love it, I didn’t say I’m doing it”), and saunas (“very purifying”).

“He was a wild guy, and now I think he’s channeled all of that into his family, and his work,” said the director Dan Gilroy, who said he cast Mr. Farrell in “Roman Israel” in part because he knew he could hold his own with Denzel Washington.

Mr. Farrell said he planned to take a long break, and he was open to what’s next, be it action heroes, even though he loathes guns (“Hate em!”) or, in the vein of Mr. Lanthimos’s films, more unsexy roles, even if he might be somewhat alone in characterizing them that way.

Last year, about $260,000 was earmarked for football; this year the total so far is $302,000, Ms. Dwyer said.

In general, current students are more enthusiastic than battle-hardened alumni. “I don’t know about you, but I’ve found my heroes,” wrote Joseph Siegel, a sophomore, recently in the Columbia Daily Spectator. “The titanic athletes in their helmets and pads, the wide expanse of the stadium, the goal posts and lights scraping into the sky; for all this, I see no substitute.”

Some alumni are simply coming to grips with their own changing perceptions.

“The pure joy of Columbia football is that we’re not supposed to be good,” said Sahil Godiwala, Columbia College class of 1999. A New York-based lawyer, he vividly remembers the coverage on the student-run radio station WKCR-FM.

“I got hooked on the broadcasts,” Mr. Godiwala recalled. “The announcers lost all semblance of professionalism and talked about the games as if they were a comedy show. They conveyed the surrealness of the situation. If we had a win, it was because some freak accident happened. We would get a fumble on the goal line or something like that.”

“My feelings as an alumnus are very different from when I was a student,” said Stephen Holtje, Columbia College class of 1983.

Today, Mr. Holtje is manager of the record label ESP-Disk and has a different slant. “I no longer need to be hip and ironic,” he said. “When they’re losing, it means nothing and I don’t notice. But when they win, it’s like this amazing blessing out of nowhere.”

Mr. Holtje dismissed any notions that Columbia’s current football prowess might overshadow the university’s emphasis on academics. “It’s sufficiently obvious that we will not be Ohio State,” he said, “so we don’t have to worry — even if we have an undefeated season.”

But Mr. Passaro, among others, is not satisfied. For him, today’s Lions symbolize a cheerful, rah-rah Columbia that he derides as “Princeton on the Hudson.” To his mind, the authentic Columbia is the scrappy institution of higher learning he attended in the 1970s — when New York was bankrupt, the Baker Field stadium was rotting and the Lions were reassuringly predictable bums.

“Whatever this miraculous thing is that you’re telling me about, I don’t understand it and I don’t like it,” Mr. Passaro said. “My Columbia was a happily bohemian place and I wish it were still.”",Columbia Football Keeps Winning.

But I’ve never seen these before.”Amy Adams Greats Cover Claes Oldenburg is featured on one of the covers of T's Oct. 22 Greats issue.
Art didn’t really grab Oldenburg until he was an adult.
“The Art Institute of Chicago was a mystery to me back in those years,” he said.
“Where I’d go was the Field Museum and look at things rather than looking at art.","Yet when compared to the ice-cold irony of Warhol’s silkscreens or the colorful exuberance of paintings by James Rosenquist, Tom Wesselmann or Rosalyn Drexler, Oldenburg’s work, especially his enduring innovation — rendering sculpture literally soft, through re-creations of everyday things (ice cream cones, typewriters, toilets) that sag from the wall or bag on the floor — looked, and still look, like marvelous reprobates. In the Pop room of any museum gallery, they smirk and slouch and revel in playing at art, seeming to be both the comedians and the clinical depressives.

The latter half of his career, after he grew restless with the art world and moved into cartoonish public sculpture, collaborating with his second wife, the art historian Coosje van Bruggen (who died in 2009), has somewhat obscured his outré spirit — in part because many of the outdoor works, funny and toylike, have become so civically beloved. “Spoonbridge and Cherry,” a red cherry balanced on an enormous spoon, made in steel and aluminum and installed in 1988 in the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden, is among the most photographed artworks in America, the backdrop for untold thousands of silly selfies. Its fans would likely blanch to learn that among Oldenburg’s early public-art proposals was an idea even creepier than the hole: speakers that would have broadcast a piercing nightly scream through the streets of Manhattan at 2 a.m. As he wrote in one of the lesser-quoted passages from his most famous piece of writing, 1961’s half-satirical manifesto “I Am For …”: “I am for the art that comes up in fogs from sewer holes in winter. I am for the art that splits when you step on a frozen puddle. I am for the worm’s art inside the apple.”

THESE WORDS in mind, you don’t fully expect what greets you when you walk into the studio and home Oldenburg has kept on the still-gritty far west side of SoHo since 1971, a five-story warehouse where naval propellers were once manufactured. Inside, it’s as immaculate and organized as a museum. Surfaces gleam and light falls beautifully on the maquettes for public sculpture that line the walls. Slim in khakis and tennis shoes, Oldenburg was sitting in one of the large office spaces with an assistant and wasn’t able to get up to greet me. A fall last year broke his hip, forcing him to get around with a cane or by propelling himself across the floors on rolling office chairs. His daughter, Maartje Oldenburg, who spent most of her childhood in this rambling building and is now an expert on his career, had arrived just as I did, and we convened at a big table her father had piled with boxes of files, like a lawyer preparing for a deposition.

“I guess I was always an archivist,” he said, smiling, surveying the spread, his glasses and ponderous forehead giving him an owllike bearing.

Unlike some overexamined artists of his generation, Oldenburg enjoys interviews, and he had been through this routine dozens of times before. But today he seemed to be in the mood for some serious retrospection: The first drawings he pulled from a folder were ones he made in middle school and high school in Chicago, where his father, Gosta, a Swedish diplomat, had moved the family in 1936 from Oslo upon being posted to the United States as a consul.

His daughter looked over the profusion of drawings protected by plastic sleeves and said: “I always think I’ve seen everything that’s here. But I’ve never seen these before.”

Growing up in wartime Chicago gave Oldenburg, a bookish child of Europe, a firm purchase on America’s brashness, inseparable from its boorishness and brutality. That sense informed the ragtag, anxious nature of his early pieces, work that seems to gain political relevance with each passing year. His childhood drawings — schematics of war planes, storyboard cartoons, caricatures of classmates — aren’t anything special. But they immediately reveal three things: He was a preternaturally talented draftsman from the start; he was always wickedly funny; and he has always had an engineer’s passion for the built world. It’s no accident that many of his best drawings over the years have taken the form of grandly elaborate blueprints and architectural renderings, making him a charter member of what I like to think of as the schematic school of late Modernism (other members would include Bruce Nauman, Lee Lozano and Chris Burden).

Art didn’t really grab Oldenburg until he was an adult. “The Art Institute of Chicago was a mystery to me back in those years,” he said. “Where I’d go was the Field Museum and look at things rather than looking at art. I think I’ve really always been more interested in things than in anything else.”

At Yale, which he entered in 1946, he was drawn to literature and studied with the formalist critic Cleanth Brooks, but he was an eccentric student at best. “I actually left once before I graduated,” he said. “One day, I just got on a train and came to New York and sat on a park bench in front of City Hall and read ‘Moby-Dick.’ ” His early 20s were spent in a peripatetic drift that was equally Kerouacian: cub reporter in Chicago, sent to find bodies floating in the river; ad agency stint drawing insects for an insecticide company; dishwasher in Oakland, where he traded drawings for rent. In San Francisco he met the poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and in Los Angeles he feared for his life. “I sat next to two guys at a diner who were plotting a murder, honest to God. L.A. was really a terrifying place for me that first time.”

But his wandering, he said, gave him the courage to try New York. He moved there in 1956, and it was as if the city had been waiting for him. The Abstract Expressionist revolution was running low on gas. The year before, Robert Rauschenberg had made “Bed,” one of his first so-called combines, a melding of painting and sculpture, by drawing and splashing paint on his pillow and his patchwork quilt and stretching them on a wooden frame. Not long before, Jasper Johns had begun his edge-to-edge American flags, rendering an icon not as an image in a painting but as an object in itself. Formal orthodoxies were being detonated in studios all over Manhattan, and Oldenburg could feel the tremors.

“I felt like the Ab Ex painters weren’t saying very much, and I wanted work that would say something, be messy, be a little mysterious,” he said. “Nineteen fifty-nine was the turning point. I was painting these brushy paintings — figurative — and then, thankfully, it all just fell apart.”

Drawing on a longstanding interest in the primitivism of Jean Dubuffet and thinkers about ritual and symbolism like Sigmund Freud and his pupil Wilhelm Stekel, he began making raw pieces that seemed to come straight from the id. They included the first iterations of Ray Gun, a mutable symbol for himself roughly in the shape of a toy laser pistol, a form that continues to fascinate him to this day. (On a visit to the studio’s second floor, he came across a piece of cardboard with three ray-gun shapes on it that appeared to be old raisin cookies nibbled into shape and then glued down. “Not sure what this was for,” he said, looking it over quizzically.) His other alter-ego, my favorite, is a geometrically minimalist mouse head that evokes Mickey and the reels of a film projector, as well as a kind of twilight-zone Modernist future. This symbol took its most improbable physical form in his “Mouse Museum.” An obsessive collection of small pieces and punning found objects (plastic bananas in conversation with dildos), the museum was born in his studio and eventually came to inhabit a snug, vitrine-filled, gallery-size structure shaped like the mouse head, designed by him and van Bruggen; the collection has been periodically exhibited, including a showing at Documenta 5 in Kassel, Germany, in 1972.

In the space of less than five years, in the short-lived but highly fertile gallery scene that sprung up in the East Village and at the legendary Green Gallery on 57th Street, he helped birth not only Pop Art but performance art as well, in maniacal productions with sculpture as props, staged with his first wife, Patty, now Patty Mucha, and compatriots who would later go on to fame as well, like Lucas Samaras and Carolee Schneemann. At one of these performances, “World’s Fair II” (1962), Oldenburg hung a soft sculpture depicting an upside-down New York City skyline from the ceiling in front of an audience in a rented storefront. Many performances consisted of the artist and Patty rolling around or dancing on a debris-covered floor. Writing at the time, the poet Frank O’Hara observed that Oldenburg “actually does what is most often claimed wrongly in catalog blurbs: transform his materials into something magical and strange.”

AS HE APPROACHES his ninth decade, Oldenburg has slowed his once-furious pace of productivity, but he is still at work on public projects and large-scale sculpture. He’s finishing a private commission in California called “Dropped Bouquet,” a colorful maquette of which sits in his studio, and he’ll have a show of new works at Pace Gallery this month in N.Y.C. His energy — some of which goes into a stationary bike he is using to strengthen his legs — remains remarkable. Nearing the end of the third hour of our interview, he kept trying and failing to bring it to a close, spotting other things to talk about, ferrying me up and down in the building’s creaky old freight elevator, big enough to fit a small car.

“I like living in the studio,” he said. “You have the ability to see everything. And you can always change things any way you want them.”

Unlike some other old masters of the New York downtown scene (Jasper Johns, who now lives in Connecticut; Rauschenberg, who died in 2008 and spent much of the later part of his life in Florida) Oldenburg has remained resolutely in the city that nourished his work, with only a couple of periods away in Los Angeles and France, where he and van Bruggen bought and renovated a chateau.

“I don’t get out as much anymore, but I feel like the city is here when I want it,” he said. His daughter, who remembers the scavenged toys she and her brother were allowed to choose from the heaping garbage barrels her father amassed for his work, told me, “It’s always kind of a mystery to me how things still work their way in here. He’s very good at keeping things that he wants to use for later.”

As if to prove her point, he took us to see some small assemblage works he has been tinkering with, simple but unruly arrangements of inconsequential junk on small metal shelves. One in progress consisted of not much more than a cardboard figure of a pinup girl, a brown foam Berenstain Bears novelty headband, some paint-dipped stirrers and a piece of red rope. It looked unaccountably like a deconstructed view of Cezanne’s bathers.

“I put things here and I look at them for a long time and if they don’t belong, well, they’ll get up and walk.” He stared intently at a small plastic toy ladybug, perched tentatively on the edge of the conglomeration. “I told her to get lost,” he said, “but she’s still here.” Hopefully, he added, “Maybe she’ll stay.”",Claes Oldenburg Is (Still) Changing What Art Looks Like,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/t-magazine/claes-oldenburg.html

More important, the doctors thought surgery had a good chance of eliminating the need for a lifelong implanted shunt to drain excess fluid from his brain. The devices often need replacing, which requires more surgery, and they can lead to infection.

Mrs. Royer acknowledged there was no guarantee that her son would be free of a shunt. But she said she and her husband had “happiness and peace” after deciding to go for the surgery.

On Sept. 26, the day before the operation, Mr. and Mrs. Royer and her parents met with the medical team at Texas Children’s.

With more than a dozen doctors and nurses in the conference room, it was standing room only. All would be involved in the operation.

Dr. Belfort reviewed the test results, telling the group that the fetus had a “significant lesion” involving much of his lower back. But he added, “He’s able to do the gas pedal. That’s a great thing. There’s a lot of function to save.”

Addressing Mrs. Royer, he said: “This is experimental surgery, with no guarantee. You are the person who will take the risk for another person. There is no mandate for you to do this. Nobody will think less of you if change your mind, and you can change your mind until the last minute, until you go to sleep.”

Early the next morning, with Mrs. Royer under general anesthesia, the surgery began in an overheated operating room ideal for the fetus but sweltering for doctors and nurses in caps, gloves and surgical gowns.

During the standard prenatal surgery for spina bifida, surgeons cut open the woman’s abdomen and uterus to reach the fetus. But the newer, experimental approach is different.

Dr. Belfort opened Mrs. Royer’s lower abdomen, but not her uterus. Instead, he eased the uterus out of her body and inserted the fetoscope, and then, through another slit, surgical tools. The doctors drained out the amniotic fluid and pumped in carbon dioxide to keep the uterus expanded, giving them room to work and allowing them to see better and cauterize when needed.

They gave the fetus an anesthetic injection and then, guided by images on the video screens, began to operate on him, tugging skin and membranes over the naked spinal cord and sewing them tightly shut with five stitches to seal out amniotic fluid.

Because the defect was so large, they made “relaxing incisions” along his sides, to loosen the skin so they could pull it across his back. The cuts would heal, though they would leave scars.

Every few minutes, a pediatric cardiologist called out the fetal heart rate, which held steady at a normal rate of about 150 beats a minute. When the surgery was finished, the doctors replaced the amniotic fluid with saline.

The surgery took three hours. The standard, open operation is faster and easier, but Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead think their method will prove safer for both the mother and the fetus.

With the open procedure, the cut into the uterus increases the risk of early labor and premature birth, which puts the fetus at risk for a host of complications.

The incision also raises the risk of uterine rupture during labor, and requires that the mother give birth by cesarean section, which is generally riskier for women than a vaginal birth.

The scarring on the uterus from the two operations makes it likely that she will need cesareans for future births, and also increases the risk of placental problems that can be life-threatening. The small slits for the fetoscopes are thought to reduce these risks.

To develop their fetoscopic procedure, Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead operated on sheep and spent several hundred hours over the course of two years practicing on a simulator that they had created. It consisted of a rubber kickball, about the size of a basketball — like a uterus at 24 weeks of pregnancy — with a doll inside, wrapped in chicken skin that they cut to mimic the defect in spina bifida.

They would insert fetoscopes into the ball and, eyes on the monitor, work together to sew up the chicken skin. They completed more than 30 simulated operations, including two sessions in an operating room, with a full surgical team assembled. They still use the simulator at least twice a month to keep up their skills, Dr. Belfort said.

They operated on their first patient in July 2014. In August, in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, they reported on their first 28 cases. So far, the results have been good, though the numbers are small.

No fetuses have died, few have needed shunts, and some of the mothers have been able to have vaginal deliveries. Their pregnancies appear to last longer, coming closer to full-term than with the open procedure. More research is needed, but other medical centers have begun adopting the technique. Surgeons at Johns Hopkins have used it to treat five patients, and Dr. Belfort is helping to train colleagues at Stanford.

Doctors who practice the open procedure are critical, and warn that the carbon dioxide pumped into the uterus may harm the fetus and cause neurological problems. Dr. Belfort said there has been no evidence of harm. But time will tell.

Mrs. Royer, who will stay in an apartment in Houston for the rest of her pregnancy, had a painful recovery from the surgery. But she has no regrets.

“It’s not done by any means, but I definitely feel it’s the right thing for us,” she said. “Seeing the ultrasound and how good he’s doing, moving his ankles and feet, it’s such a happy moment.

“I can’t imagine going on further in the pregnancy not knowing every day what damage is being done and if he’s getting worse. It’s such a relief to move forward.”

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.



The photographs will be on view in an exhibit at Morrison Hotel Gallery, New York, from Nov. 9, 2017.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — People don’t believe me when I tell them that there is always a way into a puzzle, even the late week ones, but it’s true. What seems to happen is that some solvers quickly scan the list of clues on, say, a Friday puzzle,, see nothing that they know on the first pass, and decide that they can’t solve it. Many times, they give up and walk away.

But take a moment to think about this logically: What would be the point of making and editing a puzzle that no one can solve? It would be like building a house with no door or windows. It might be an interesting feat, but it’s ultimately unwelcoming. So the constructor and the editors always make sure that a porch light is left on for solvers, even if that light is in a different spot for different people.

COLUMBIA COUNTY, N.Y., a two-hour drive north from Manhattan, is a bucolic vision of rural America — lush rolling farmland, cow-dotted hillsides, stalwart red barns. The Hudson River School artists of the mid-19th century captured the visual splendor of the region, including the English-born painter Thomas Cole, who first encountered upstate New York in 1825 and once remarked that “the Hudson for natural magnificence is unsurpassed.” Though primarily agricultural, the area has long attracted gentlemen farmers: Over the years, various Livingstons, Rockefellers and Roosevelts have made homes here.

In modern times, however, the county has also been distinguished by its outsize share of gay artists and writers, refugees from the city. Gore Vidal was a pioneer, purchasing Edgewater, his mansion on the Hudson River, in 1950. It was here that he threw his legendary parties, with guests ranging from Saul Bellow to Shirley MacLaine. (Vidal called the Hudson River — which connects the region to New York City — “a splendidly convenient boulevard.”) In the decades after Vidal left to begin life as an expatriate, he would be replaced by successive generations of gay artists: Ellsworth Kelly moved here in 1970; the director-producer team James Ivory and Ismail Merchant in 1975; the poet John Ashbery in 1978.

The more recent gay artists and thinkers are hidden in plain sight: There’s the photographer Lyle Ashton Harris and the writer Wayne Koestenbaum, and a few years ago the New York contemporary art dealer Jack Shainman opened the School, a museum-quality exhibition hall in a renovated 1929 high school in the town of Kinderhook. (Nick Cave and El Anatsui have had solo shows here.) The creative director Simon Lince lives with his husband, Cary Leibowitz, the artist known as Candyass, in a 1795 farmhouse in Ghent, flamboyantly redesigned by architects Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, with a sign hung over the back balcony that reads “Linceowitz.” Franklin Tartaglione, a painter, bought an old concrete-block sheepshearing mill in 1986, and, over the last 30 years, he and his husband, the writer Dave King, have transformed it into a thoroughly original residence — part Brutalist structure, part Edith Wharton mansion, part homestead.

In addition to creative renovations, more and more contemporary houses by formidable architects like Michael Bell, Steven Harris and Joel Sanders are popping up. My husband and I bought land here in 2002 and hired Bell, whose minimalist work we had seen in a 1999 exhibit at MoMA called “The Un-Private House.” In the years since, we have watched the region become — both slowly and all at once — a gay utopia, a place where art is made and taste is manifest and our sexual proclivities are taken for granted. Columbia County, like all gay utopias, has its own aesthetic — one foot in the avant-garde, another in the historical.

THE IDEA OF A GAY UTOPIA, an invented queer homeland, is not a new one. There are and have been gay communities in almost every major American city for decades. And there are de facto gay resort towns across the country, such as Palm Springs and Provincetown, which are defined by their distinctive natural beauty: The latter, at the farthest tip of the Cape Cod peninsula, has the feel of a sleepy New England fishing village gone disco; the former is a lavish desert enclave sprawled along the base of several spectacular mountain ranges. While Provincetown is residually bohemian and Palm Springs outwardly conventional, both offer the same promise of protection, a camaraderie of shared otherness. They are a safety zone for their residents, who invented these communities, in part, to partition themselves from the judgments of mainstream America.

The precursor for the modern gay American utopia was 1920s and ’30s Nollendorfplatz, the Berlin neighborhood that the writer Christopher Isherwood discovered when he moved to the city in 1929, and which he eventually immortalized in “The Berlin Stories,” collected in 1945. Here were eccentric figures in drag, torch singers like Marlene Dietrich and legendary venues — “dens of pseudo-vice,” Isherwood called them — like the Eldorado, known for its sexually fluid parties. Nollendorfplatz, like every gay utopia that followed, was borne from necessities both sexual and political. The neighborhood was a shelter from persecution and censure, and beyond the parties and openness and extraordinary characters, it was an environment in which gays were finally able to recognize themselves and experience basic human dignity — in society, if not from the law.

For years, I considered my personal Nollendorfplatz the Fire Island Pines, a Dionysian Mount Olympus off the southern shore of Long Island where unparalleled sexual freedom was enjoyed with celebratory abandon. A decade before I started going there in the ’70s, before the word “gay” had even entered my lexicon, I was an alienated teenager lying on my bed in the suburbs of Florida in a state of despair about my future. Where in the world would I find a place for a homosexual like me — a word I was too ashamed to utter aloud. On Dec. 15, 1973, the American Psychiatric Association removed “homosexuality” from its list of psychiatric disorders. It was front-page news across the country.

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.

And Tang zong and Song zu

Had little poetry in their souls;

And Genghis Khan

Proud son of heaven for a day,

Knew only shooting eagles, bow outstretched.

All are past and gone!

For truly great men

Look to this age alone.

But however self-confident Mao’s early dreams of glory, his supreme leadership was far from preordained. On the eve of his coming out as a Marxist at age 27, he was an unsophisticated provincial nationalist. He gloomily dismissed the chances of the new Chinese republic surviving, wondered about Hunan becoming an American state and advocated that all of the Chinese provinces should become separate countries.

It was only in November 1920 that he admitted defeat: The Hunanese did not have the vision to appreciate his ideas. He wrote to his activist friends in the provincial capital to say that he would henceforth be a socialist. He was just in time.

Communist cells had been organized in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities, and in mid-1921, the first congress of the Chinese Communist Party was held. Mao, who had quickly organized a Communist group in Hunan, achieved the cachet of being one of only 12 delegates to attend. He was thus an early tiger.

The Soviet agents who funded and masterminded the organization of the early C.C.P. reported to the Comintern, the agency for spreading Soviet ideas and influence abroad. With memories of defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5, and competing with Japan for influence in Manchuria, the Soviets needed a strong China as an ally against Japanese expansionism.

The fledgling C.C.P. was too weak. The Soviets decided to bolster the well known revolutionary who had helped bring down the Manchu dynasty but had then been pushed aside by warlords: Sun Yat-sen.

They provided him with funds, reorganized his Nationalist party, known as the K.M.T., and helped him to train an army. C.C.P. members were instructed by Comintern agents to back the K.M.T., and even become members, but to retain their allegiance to the Communists. The plan was for the C.C.P. to take over the K.M.T. from within after the Chinese warlords were conquered by this united front.

Most of the C.C.P. leadership opposed the Comintern policy; they thought collaboration with the “bourgeois” K.M.T. would demoralize their members. But the piper called the tune, and they joined the K.M.T., few more readily than Mao.

Two events set Mao off on a new, career-shaping course. The first was Chiang Kai-shek’s attack on the Communist Party. By 1927, after Sun Yat-sen’s death, Chiang Kai-shek had taken over the leadership of the K.M.T., and he had conquered much of the southern half of the country. Aware of the Soviets’ long-term aim for a C.C.P. takeover of the K.M.T., he short-circuited the plan in May 1927 by ordering the slaughter of Communists, mainly in Shanghai. Communist leaders scattered in flight.

The other event was Mao’s experience with peasant power. After the death of their parents, Mao and his two brothers owned a valuable property back in their home village that had been built up by their father. The family had made the transition from poor to rich peasants. And though he had grown up surrounded by the miseries of rural life, as a fledgling Communist, Mao had been focusing on the urban proletariat until Moscow, realizing that China was different, ordered more attention be paid to the peasantry.

Mao became active in peasant affairs, and his transformative experience was witnessing and chronicling an uprising in his native Hunan. In a famous passage, he rejected allegations that the peasants had gone too far:

A revolution is not the same as inviting people to dinner or writing an essay or painting a picture or embroidering a flower; it cannot be anything so refined, so calm and gentle.

Witnessing the bloodshed in the Hunanese countryside, Mao was discovering his other persona. As the scholar-diplomat Richard Solomon first pointed out, Mao reveled in “luan,” or upheaval. When young, Mao had written that for change to come about, China must be “destroyed and reformed.” He now realized that only the peasantry could bring that about. Mao would be the monkey king to lead that destruction.

The primary source for the monkey king is the classic Chinese novel “The Journey to the West.” Ostensibly about the famous Chinese monk Xuan Zang, who made the arduous crossing of the Himalayas to seek out original Buddhist scriptures in India, “Journey” is a fantastical tale in which Sun Wukong, the monkey king, plays a major role as the monk’s escort. In the early 1960s, when the C.C.P.’s quarrel with the Soviet Communist Party was underway, Mao praised the monkey king:

A thunderstorm burst over the earth,

So a devil rose from a heap of white bones.

The deluded monk was not beyond the light,

But the malignant demon must wreak havoc.

The Golden Monkey wrathfully swung his massive cudgel

And the jade-like firmament was cleared of dust.

Today, a miasmal mist once more rising,

We hail Sun Wu-kung, the wonder-worker.

Mao then rose from guerrilla chief in the late 1920s to a party leader in the mid-1930s on the Long March, the flight of the C.C.P. from the southeast to the northwest to escape Chiang Kai-shek’s attacks. This was an epic event in Communist annals because it took a year, covered some 6,000 miles and reduced the 85,000 who had set out to a mere 8,000 by the time they reached the northwest. He absorbed two lessons: All power grew out of the barrel of a gun; and most of the time peasants were very difficult to organize because they had fields to tend and families to feed.

From the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s, Mao played his tiger role. He led an increasingly strong and efficient party and army that survived the anti-Japanese war and then defeated Chiang and the K.M.T. in the civil war of the late 1940s. From 1949 until 1956, Mao presided over the installation of the Communist dictatorship in China, rooting out all opposition, real or imagined, and transforming the ownership of the means of production from private hands to socialist control.

It was then that he dabbled in the monkey business for the first time. From the point of view of a dutiful C.C.P. cadre, “monkey business” could be defined as any measure that would disrupt the party’s standard operating procedures. Cadres did not appreciate it when Mao in 1956 exhorted intellectuals to “Let a hundred flowers bloom” and a year later again encouraged intellectuals to criticize the conduct of the party. As members of the ruling elite, the cadres resented being criticized, and Mao, having promised that the criticisms would only be like a light rain, quickly wound up the campaigns when they turned into a typhoon, and purged the critics.

Mao truly became the monkey king by starting the Cultural Revolution in 1966 to dispel the “miasmal mist” of Soviet-style “revisionism” from the C.C.P. Now, it was the youth of China, not the peasants, who were to be his agents of destruction, as major party and government departments were trashed and their officials humiliated and purged.

For Mao, the Cultural Revolution ended in 1969 with the appointment of a new, and hopefully more revolutionary, leadership. But though he had dealt the age-old bureaucratic system of China a terrible blow, he knew that it could rise again from the ashes. He always emphasized that China would have to experience regular Cultural Revolutions.

But when Mao’s chosen successor, Hua Guofeng, repeated that dictum, he sealed his fate. Deng Xiaoping and his fellow survivors did not want any more monkey kings plunging the party and the country into chaos again.

And yet today, China’s current ruler, Xi Jinping, with his relentless anticorruption drive to make officials more honest, has unleashed another Cultural Revolution against the bureaucracy, albeit one that is controlled from the center not from the streets.

This is the action of a monkey king. There is no chaos today, but there surely is widespread fear and resentment as his mighty cudgel claims more victims.

The 19th Communist Party Congress currently underway will confirm that Mr. Xi is top tiger, the most powerful ruler since Mao. But Mr. Xi will have to ensure that his alternate persona as monkey king does not loom too large. As the revolutionary founder, Mao could never have been toppled.

Last year, about $260,000 was earmarked for football; this year the total so far is $302,000, Ms. Dwyer said.

In general, current students are more enthusiastic than battle-hardened alumni. “I don’t know about you, but I’ve found my heroes,” wrote Joseph Siegel, a sophomore, recently in the Columbia Daily Spectator. “The titanic athletes in their helmets and pads, the wide expanse of the stadium, the goal posts and lights scraping into the sky; for all this, I see no substitute.”

Some alumni are simply coming to grips with their own changing perceptions.

“The pure joy of Columbia football is that we’re not supposed to be good,” said Sahil Godiwala, Columbia College class of 1999. A New York-based lawyer, he vividly remembers the coverage on the student-run radio station WKCR-FM.

“I got hooked on the broadcasts,” Mr. Godiwala recalled. “The announcers lost all semblance of professionalism and talked about the games as if they were a comedy show. They conveyed the surrealness of the situation. If we had a win, it was because some freak accident happened. We would get a fumble on the goal line or something like that.”

“My feelings as an alumnus are very different from when I was a student,” said Stephen Holtje, Columbia College class of 1983.

Today, Mr. Holtje is manager of the record label ESP-Disk and has a different slant. “I no longer need to be hip and ironic,” he said. “When they’re losing, it means nothing and I don’t notice. But when they win, it’s like this amazing blessing out of nowhere.”

Mr. Holtje dismissed any notions that Columbia’s current football prowess might overshadow the university’s emphasis on academics. “It’s sufficiently obvious that we will not be Ohio State,” he said, “so we don’t have to worry — even if we have an undefeated season.”

But Mr. Passaro, among others, is not satisfied. For him, today’s Lions symbolize a cheerful, rah-rah Columbia that he derides as “Princeton on the Hudson.” To his mind, the authentic Columbia is the scrappy institution of higher learning he attended in the 1970s — when New York was bankrupt, the Baker Field stadium was rotting and the Lions were reassuringly predictable bums.

“Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself.","The video is now TED’s second-most popular, having been seen, to date, by some 43 million viewers. In the years after the talk, Cuddy became a sought-after speaker, a quasi celebrity and, eventually, the author of a best-selling book, “Presence,” in 2015. The power pose became the sun salutation for the professional woman on the cusp of leaning in. Countless hopefuls, male and female, locked themselves in bathroom stalls before job interviews to make victory V’s with their arms; media trainers had their speakers dutifully practice the pose before approaching the stage. Cuddy has gone on to give talks on power and the body (including power posing) and stereotyping to women’s groups in Australia, at youth homeless shelters, to skin-care workers by the thousands, to employees at Target and agents at State Farm Insurance. Cuddy’s fans approach her in airports, on ski slopes in Telluride, in long lines after her talks, to hug or to thank her, filled with their own power-posing stories — sharing how bold body language helped them get their jobs or win some match or confront a bully at work.

But since 2015, even as she continued to stride onstage and tell the audiences to face down their fears, Cuddy has been fighting her own anxieties, as fellow academics have subjected her research to exceptionally high levels of public scrutiny. She is far from alone in facing challenges to her work: Since 2011, a methodological reform movement has been rattling the field, raising the possibility that vast amounts of research, even entire subfields, might be unreliable. Up-and-coming social psychologists, armed with new statistical sophistication, picked up the cause of replications, openly questioning the work their colleagues conducted under a now-outdated set of assumptions. The culture in the field, once cordial and collaborative, became openly combative, as scientists adjusted to new norms of public critique while still struggling to adjust to new standards of evidence.

Cuddy, in particular, has emerged from this upheaval as a unique object of social psychology’s new, enthusiastic spirit of self-flagellation — as if only in punishing one of its most public stars could it fully break from its past. At conferences, in classrooms and on social media, fellow academics (or commenters on their sites) have savaged not just Cuddy’s work but also her career, her income, her ambition, even her intelligence, sometimes with evident malice. Last spring, she quietly left her tenure-track job at Harvard.

Some say that she has gained fame with an excess of confidence in fragile results, that she prized her platform over scientific certainty. But many of her colleagues, and even some who are critical of her choices, believe that the attacks on her have been excessive and overly personal. What seems undeniable is that the rancor of the critiques reflects the emotional toll among scientists forced to confront the fear that what they were doing all those years may not have been entirely scientific.

One of the seminal social-psychology studies, at the turn of the 20th century, asked a question that at the time was a novel one: How does the presence of other people change an individual’s behavior? Norman Triplett, a psychologist at Indiana University, found that when he asked children to execute a simple task (winding line on a fishing rod), they performed better in the company of other children than they did when alone in a room. Over the following decades, a new discipline grew up within psychology to further interrogate group dynamics: how social groups react in certain circumstances, how the many can affect the one.

The questions grew even more profound, using experiments to tease out universal susceptibilities, raising the possibility that behavior was more easily swayed by outside forces than personality researchers previously believed. The field reached a moment of unusual visibility in the mid-20th century, as practitioners, many of them Jewish refugees or first-generation immigrants from Europe, explored, post-World War II, the way group pressures or authority figures could influence human behavior. In one simple study on conformity in 1951, the social psychologist Solomon Asch found that people would agree that one drawn line matched the length of another — even if it clearly did not — if others around them all agreed that it did. In subsequent years, researchers like Stanley Milgram (who tested how people weighed their consciences against the demands of authority) and Philip Zimbardo (who observed the effect of power on students assigned as either prison guards or prisoners) rejected the traditional confines of the lab for more theatrical displays of human nature. “They felt the urgency of history,” says Rebecca Lemov, a professor of the history of science at Harvard. “They really wanted to make people look.”

Since the late 1960s, the field’s psychologists have tried to elevate the scientific rigor of their work, introducing controls and carefully designed experiments like the ones found in medicine. Increasingly complex ideas about the workings of the unconscious yielded research with the charm of mesmerists’ shows, revealing unlikely forces that seem to guide our behavior: that simply having people wash their hands could change their sense of culpability; that people’s evaluations of risk could easily be rendered irrational; that once people have made a decision, they curiously give more weight to information in its favor. Humans, the research often suggested, were reliably mercurial, highly suggestible, profoundly irrational, tricksters better at fooling ourselves than anyone else.

Already relatively accessible to the public, the field became even more influential with the rise of behavioral economics in the 1980s and 1990s, as visionaries like Richard Thaler, (who won the Nobel Prize in economics this month) found applications for counterintuitive social-psychology insights that could be used to guide policy. In 2000, Malcolm Gladwell, the author of the best-selling “Tipping Point,” applied irresistible storytelling to the science, sending countless journalists to investigate similar terrain and inspiring social psychologists to write books of their own. In 2006, Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard, published the best seller “Stumbling on Happiness” — a book that tried to explain why we plan so poorly for our own future. That same year, TED started airing its first videos, offering a new stage for social psychologists with compelling findings, ideally surprising ones. The field was experiencing a visibility unknown since the midcentury; business schools, eager for social psychologists’ insights into leadership and decision-making, started pursuing social psychologists, with better pay and more funding than psychology graduate schools could offer.

This moment of fizziness for the discipline was already underway when Cuddy arrived at Princeton’s graduate program in 2000, transferring there to follow her adviser, Susan Fiske, with whom she first worked at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She moved to Princeton with her husband at the time — they later divorced — and in her second year there, she had a child. Her academic work continued to thrive as she collaborated with Fiske on research on stereotyping, which found that groups of people (for example of a particular ethnicity) who were judged as nice were assumed to be less competent and vice versa. (“Just Because I’m Nice Don’t Assume I’m Dumb,” was the headline of a Harvard Business Review article by Cuddy.) Fiske and Cuddy’s resulting papers are still heavily cited, formulating a framework for stereotyping that proved hugely influential on the field.

And yet, especially early on at Princeton, Cuddy felt uncertain of her place there. She feared that her brain simply could not function at a high-enough level to power her through the program. Cuddy suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident the summer after her sophomore year in college, when a friend of hers fell asleep at the wheel while Cuddy was asleep in the back seat. In the months after the accident, Cuddy was told she should not expect to finish college; her fog was so deep that she remembers being retaught how to shop for groceries. Even after Cuddy recovered, her friends told her that she had changed, that she was not the same person — but she could not remember who she had been before. It took her four years and multiple false starts before she could return to college. Even after she was accepted to graduate school at University of Massachusetts, she confessed to Fiske that she feared she would not be able to keep up with the work.

Cuddy was trained as a ballet dancer — in between her stints at college, she danced as an apprentice with the Colorado Ballet — but her interest in studying the body and its relationship to power did not begin until 2009, her first year as a teacher at Harvard Business School. At the invitation of her department chair, she joined a small circle of academics meeting with Joe Navarro, a former F.B.I. agent who had written a book about body language. The invited parties, which included Dana Carney, a professor at Columbia University who studied body language and power, all spoke briefly about their work. In the conversation that followed, Navarro pointed out that Cuddy’s own body language, during her presentation, signaled insecurity: She was fiddling with her necklace, wrapping her arms around her torso.

Carney and Cuddy had been noticing the same kinds of body language in their female students, who performed well on written materials but lost points, compared with their male counterparts, on class participation. Their body language was constricted; they raised their hands with their elbows cradled in their other hands; they made themselves physically small; they spoke less often.

The two researchers wondered whether people whose physical cues looked like their female students’ — self-protective, insecure — would feel more powerful or even change their behavior if they simply adopted more expansive body positions.

Carney and Cuddy brainstormed a research project to test this question. At Columbia, Carney recruited students, telling them that they were part of a study intended to measure the effects of placing an electrocardiograph’s electrodes either above or below the heart. In the study of 42 subjects that they eventually published, experimenters arranged half the students into positions associated with high power (leaning back in a chair with feet crossed on a desk, for example) and half the students into positions associated with low power (like crossing arms in front of the body). Before and after the poses, experimenters took saliva swabs from the students to measure how the positions affected cortisol and testosterone levels. They also asked the students to report (before and after the poses) how in charge and powerful they felt on a scale of one to four (a measurement known as “self-reported feelings of power”). And they measured whether that feeling had what researchers call a “downstream effect” — a resulting behavior. People who feel power, the literature suggests, are more likely to engage in a range of certain behaviors, including risk-taking; so the experiment also measured the subjects’ willingness to bet on a roll of the dice.

“I remember how happy we were when Dana called me with the results,” Cuddy says. “Everything went in the direction it was supposed to.” The abstract that they eventually wrote — that their editors approved — reflects the incautious enthusiasm that characterized the era: “That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful, has real-world, actionable implications.”

In 2014, on a podcast called “Story Collider,” Cuddy connects the study that made her so famous with the accident that subtly shifted her identity. After the crash, she recalled, she felt as if she were merely passing for herself, an inauthentic version of who she used to be. It made sense, then, that she ended up “studying how people can become their aspirational selves,” she said. “How can you become a self that you are not now?”

The year that Amy Cuddy published her power-posing paper, Joseph Simmons, who attended graduate school at Princeton with Cuddy, was starting to think about his own seminal paper, one that would, unknown to either of them, have as much influence on her life as it would on his own; it would, in fact, change not just their lives but the field as they knew it, with wildly differing consequences for each of them.

Cuddy and Simmons, each of whom came from working-class backgrounds, had been fond of each other at Princeton, even if they did not socialize often: Cuddy was a new mother, and Simmons was five years younger and heavily committed to his softball team. Simmons considered Cuddy a friend, someone he was always happy to see at a party, despite their obvious differences: Cuddy, who used to follow the Grateful Dead, would have been the one dancing at the party, while Simmons would have been the one laughing with his close friend, a fellow graduate student named Leif Nelson, about the latest buzzy journal article that seemed, to them, ridiculous.

Having arrived at Princeton wide-eyed, straight from Mount St. Mary’s College in Maryland, Simmons, within a few years, appeared to some of his classmates to have lost some of his idealism about academia; maybe he exhibited his idealism about science in a way that could be mistaken for cynicism. Simmons had an unusual interest in statistics, the way its airtight logic could neatly prove, or disprove, the worth of an extravagant idea. He and Nelson were endlessly critical of other studies’ findings, an intellectual exercise they enjoyed and considered essential. The two of them, Nelson says, were “into thinking about subtleties in data collection and analysis.”

After finishing a postdoctoral program at Princeton, Simmons lost touch with Cuddy, who was by then teaching at Northwestern. He remained close to Nelson, who had befriended a behavioral scientist, also a skeptic, Uri Simonsohn. Nelson and Simonsohn kept up an email correspondence for years. They, along with Simmons, took particular umbrage when a prestigious journal accepted a paper from an emeritus professor of psychology at Cornell, Daryl Bem, who claimed that he had strong evidence for the existence of extrasensory perception. The paper struck them as the ultimate in bad-faith science. “How can something not be possible to cause something else?” Nelson says. “Oh, you reverse time, then it can’t.” And yet the methodology was supposedly sound. After years of debating among themselves, the three of them resolved to figure out how so many researchers were coming up with such unlikely results.

Over the course of several months of conference calls and computer simulations, the three researchers eventually determined that the enemy of science — subjectivity — had burrowed its way into the field’s methodology more deeply than had been recognized. Typically, when researchers analyzed data, they were free to make various decisions, based on their judgment, about what data to maintain: whether it was wise, for example, to include experimental subjects whose results were really unusual or whether to exclude them; to add subjects to the sample or exclude additional subjects because of some experimental glitch. More often than not, those decisions — always seemingly justified as a way of eliminating noise — conveniently strengthened the findings’ results. The field (hardly unique in this regard) had approved those kinds of tinkering for years, underappreciating just how powerfully they skewed the results in favor of false positives, particularly if two or three analyses were underway at the same time. The three eventually wrote about this phenomenon in a paper called “False-Positive Psychology,” published in 2011. “Everyone knew it was wrong, but they thought it was wrong the way it’s wrong to jaywalk,” Simmons recently wrote in a paper taking stock of the field. “We decided to write ‘False-Positive Psychology’ when simulations revealed it was wrong the way it’s wrong to rob a bank.”

Simmons called those questionable research practices P-hacking, because researchers used them to lower a crucial measure of statistical significance known as the P-value. The P stands for probable, as in: How probable is it that researchers would happen to get the results they achieved — or even more extreme ones — if there were no phenomena, in truth, to observe? (And no systematic error.) For decades, the standard of so-called statistical significance — also the hurdle to considering a study publishable — has been a P-value of less than 5 percent.

To examine how easily the science could be manipulated, Simmons and Simonsohn ran a study in which they asked 20 participants their ages (and their fathers’ birthdays). Half the group listened to the Beatles song “When I’m Sixty-Four”; the other listened to a control (the instrumental music “Kalimba”). Using totally standard methodology common to the field, they were able to prove that the participants who listened to the Beatles song were magically a year and a half younger than they were before they had heard the music. The subject heading of the explanation: “How Bad Can It Be? A Demonstration of Chronological Rejuvenation.” It was witty, it was relatable — everyone understood that it was a critique of the fundamental soundness of the field.

“We realized entire literatures could be false positives,” Simmons says. They had collaborated with enough other researchers to recognize that the practice was widespread and counted themselves among the guilty. “I P-hacked like crazy all through my time at Princeton, and I still couldn’t get interesting results,” Simmons says.

The paper generated its fair share of attention, but it was not until January 2012, at a tense conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology in San Diego, that social psychologists began to glimpse the iceberg looming ahead — the sliding furniture, the recriminations, the crises of conscience and finger-pointing and side-taking that would follow. At the conference, several hundred academics crowded into the room to hear Simmons and his colleagues challenge the methodology of their field. First, Leslie John, then a graduate student, now an associate professor at the Harvard School of Business, presented a survey of 2,000 social psychologists that suggested that P-hacking, as well as other questionable research practices, was common. In his presentation, Simonsohn introduced a new concept, a graph that could be used to evaluate bodies of research, using the P-values of those studies (the lower the overall P-values, the better). He called it a P-curve and suggested that it could be used, for example, to evaluate the research that a prospective job candidate submitted. To some, the implication of the combined presentations seemed clear: The field was rotten with the practice, and egregious P-hackers should not get away with it.

Journal-paper presentations on statistics are usually unremarkable affairs, but this one precipitated a sequence of exchanges so public that the field had to take notice. The first took place during that event, with Norbert Schwarz, an eminent social psychologist, in the audience. Schwarz, as he listened, grew furious: He believed that the methodology of the survey was flawed, and he indignantly objected to the idea of the P-curve as a kind of litmus test aimed at individuals. He would not let these ideas go uncontested; he interrupted loudly from the front row, violating standard academic etiquette. “The whole room was like, ‘Oh, my God, what just happened?’ ” recalls Brian Nosek, a social psychologist who now runs the Center for Open Science, intended to encourage and normalize replications. Others quietly thanked Schwarz for bravely speaking up.

Not content to stop there, Schwarz followed up four days later with an open letter to 5,000 members of the society’s listserv, explaining in further detail, and with some condescension, his reservations. Although Simonsohn was angry, he still hoped to cool down the conversation. He emailed Schwarz asking if they could talk, so that they could come to a sort of understanding, in the name of science, and release a joint statement. Schwarz agreed but told Simonsohn, over the course of several email exchanges, that he needed more time. Simonsohn lost patience after three weeks: He posted large parts of the email exchange on his personal website, then posted a blistering attack on Schwarz on the society’s listserv, filled with bold caps and underlines, in which he said, among other things, that he knew firsthand that Schwarz had engaged in P-hacking.

“I regret it,” Simonsohn says now about posting the emails. Since then, Simmons, Simonsohn and Nelson say they have given a lot of thought to codes of conduct for communicating responsibly when conveying concerns about a scientist’s work. But the academic blowup between Simonsohn, then a relative unknown in social psychology, and Schwarz, the standard-bearer, signaled from the beginning that leaders on each side would ignore the norms of scientific discourse in an effort to discredit the other. One imminent shift in methods would bring another shift — one of tone — that would affect the field almost as drastically.

After 2012, questions of methodology started dominating every social-psychology conference, as did the topic of replications. Across disciplines, a basic scientific principle is that multiple teams should independently verify a result before it is accepted as true. But for the majority of social-psychology results, even the most influential ones, this hadn’t happened. Brian Nosek, who started the Reproducibility Project (now called the Center for Open Science), an effort to test 100 important social-psychology papers, said that recognition of potential flawed methodology only fueled interest in his project. “The paper shone a light on how easily things could go wrong,” Nosek says. “Knowing that possibility in concept made the Reproducibility Project a test case in some people’s mind of ‘Does it?’ ”

For years, researchers treated journal articles, and their authors, with a genteel respect; even in the rare cases where a new study explicitly contradicted an old one, the community assumed that a lab error must account for the discrepancy. There was no incentive to replicate, in any case: Journals were largely not interested in studies that had already been done, and failed replications made people (maybe even your adviser) uncomfortable.

But in the years after that Society of Personality and Social Psychology conference, a sense of urgency propelled a generation of researchers, most of them under 40, to re-examine the work of other, more established researchers. And politeness was no longer a priority. “All of a sudden you have people emailing other people, asking for their data and then writing blog posts accusing them of shoddy practices,” says Eli Finkel, a social psychologist at Northwestern. “That was unheard-of. Now it was happening all the time.” Some blog posts took on the impact of journal articles, as interested parties weighed in with an impromptu peer review. In 2014, Psychological Science started giving electronic badges, an extra seal of approval, to studies that made their data and methodologies publicly available and preregistered their design and analysis ahead of time, so that researchers could not fish around for a new hypothesis if they turned up some unexpected findings.

Not surprisingly, replicators sometimes encountered the kind of outraged resistance that Simmons and Simonsohn initially did. The same month that Simmons and Simonsohn gave their talk, Stéphane Doyen, a social psychologist in Belgium, published a paper challenging a classic study in the field of priming, which holds that small cues, like exposure to certain words, can subconsciously trigger behaviors. The original study found that research subjects walked more slowly after being exposed to words associated with old age; the replicators found no such effect and titled their journal article “Behavioral Priming: It’s All in the Mind; but Whose Mind?” John Bargh, a professor at Yale, a luminary who published the original study, responded with a combative post on Psychology Today’s blog, claiming that discrepancies in the experiment design accounted for the difference and calling the researchers “incompetent or ill informed.” When other priming studies failed to replicate later that year, the Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, who discussed priming in his book “Thinking Fast and Slow,” wrote a letter to social psychologists who studied the effect, urging them to turn their attitude around. “To deal effectively with the doubts, you should acknowledge their existence and confront them straight on,” he wrote.

The intention of replicators was now unassailably noble — who could argue with better science? — but there was also, for the first time, status to be found in topplings, as journals started publishing more replications, many of which received lavish press attention. It was also inevitable that those being challenged would read envy into their attackers’ motivations. (In a tweet, Gilbert described those he deemed the worst offenders as “shameless little bullies.”)

Jay Van Bavel, a social psychologist at New York University, has tweeted openly about a published nonreplication of one of his studies and believes, as any scientist would, that replications are an essential part of the process; nonetheless, he found the experience of being replicated painful. “It is terrifying, even if it’s fair and within normal scientific bounds,” he says. “Because of social media and how it travels — you get pile-ons when the critique comes out, and 50 people share it in the view of thousands. That’s horrifying for anyone who’s critiqued, even if it’s legitimate.”

The field, clearly, was not moving forward as one. “In the beginning, I thought it was all ridiculous,” says Finkel, who told me it took him a few years before he appreciated the importance of what became known as the replication movement. “It was like we had been having a big party — what big, new, fun, cool stuff can we discover? And we forgot to double-check ourselves. And then the reformers were annoyed, because they felt like they had to come in after the fact and clean up after us. And it was true.”

In August 2014, the day before her second marriage, Amy Cuddy learned that a replication of her 2010 study led by a 34-year-old economist at the University of Zurich named Eva Ranehill had failed to yield the same results. “I remember thinking, Oh, bummer,” Cuddy says. But she was not distraught; often there was some perfectly good reason for a discrepancy in two studies of the same concept.

There were several key differences — Ranehill’s sample size, at 200, was much bigger, and she had designed a double-blind setup. Ranehill had her subjects hold two poses for three minutes each. She did not find an increase in either risk-taking behavior or the expected hormone changes.

Cuddy thought it was likely that the difference in time — six minutes of standing versus two — was a crucial one and probably accounted for the disparity in the results. “It’s not a crazy thing to test,” Cuddy says. “I guess under the theory that more is better? But it could go the other way — three minutes is a really, really long time to be holding a pose like that. It seems likely to me that it would be really uncomfortable, but sure, study it, and let’s see.”

She was relieved to see that the “feelings of power” finding had replicated. But Ranehill used language in her write-up that played down that finding’s importance. Although in one study of her own, Cuddy also played down the finding, she has otherwise consistently, in interviews, been enthusiastic about the idea that a body posture could change someone’s feelings. “We’re psychologists,” she says. “We try to change how people feel.” She also, at the time of the Ranehill replication, still anticipated that other research would probably show downstream effects — more risk taking, or more competitiveness, or better performance in job interviews.

By the time Cuddy got word of Ranehill’s replication, she had given her TED talk, developed a significant speaking career and was writing a book. Simmons had received tenure at Wharton and was writing, with Simonsohn, a blog called Data Colada, in which they sometimes tried to replicate other people’s work. By 2014, there was near-unanimous agreement the Data Colada team had profoundly changed the field’s research techniques for the better. But for the average researcher, an email from someone at Data Colada signaled unpleasantness ahead. “It’s like the police knocking on your door in the middle of the night,” one psychologist said.

In the wake of Ranehill’s failed replication, Cuddy and Carney set to work on a response. Carney, who is now a tenured associate professor of management at the University of California, Berkeley, tried to chart a P-curve of all 33 studies they were mentioning in their paper (which was already under review). Carney sent the paper and the P-curve to Nelson for some feedback, but he sent it on to Simmons and Simonsohn, as they were the experts.

The letter Simmons wrote back to Carney was polite, but he argued that her P-curve had not been executed correctly. He and Simonsohn had each executed P-curves of the 33 studies, and each found that it was flat, suggesting that the body of literature it reflected did not count as strong evidence. He did write that “conceptual points raised before that section are useful and contribute to the debate” but that they should take the P-curve out. “Everybody wins in that case.” According to Cuddy, she and Carney thought the P-curve science was not as settled as Simmons believed it to be. But afraid of public recrimination, they did exactly as he said — they took out the P-curve.

A few weeks after the paper was published, Cuddy learned from Simmons and Simonsohn that they were writing a blog post on the paper. A mutual friend of Cuddy and Simmons’s from graduate school, Kenworthey Bilz, a professor of law at the University of Illinois, tried to reassure Cuddy. “He’ll say his piece, and you’ll say yours, and that will be the end of it,” Bilz told Cuddy. “It’s not like you’re going to become the poster girl for this kind of thing.”

Cuddy was at her home office in Boston when she received an email from Simmons and Simonsohn. They showed her a draft of the post they planned to put online criticizing the paper; they invited feedback on anything the authors felt was incorrect or unfair. “We embrace trying to be as civil as possible but understanding that at some point you are going to say, ‘You were wrong,’ ” Simonsohn said. “People won’t like that, no matter how you much you dress it up. It’s not something people want to hear.”

The post criticized the new paper, as well as the 2010 study. It showed Simmons and Simonsohn’s own unfavorable P-curve and essentially argued that the original published findings on hormones and risk-taking were probably a result of chance. They did not include a feelings-of-power measure in the P-curve they showed. But the blog post did mention in its last footnote that there was a significant effect of power posing on “self-reported power,” although the language made it clear that it didn’t count for much: Simmons believes that self-reports of power generally reflect what is called a demand effect — a result that occurs when subjects intuit the point of the study. Cuddy believes that studies can be constructed to minimize that risk and that demand effects are often nuanced.

Cuddy responded to Simonsohn with a few points that they incorporated into the post but said she preferred to write a longer response in a context in which she felt more comfortable.

Cuddy felt ill when Simmons and Simonsohn published the post with the headline: “Reassessing the Evidence Behind the Most Popular TED Talk.” As illustration, they used a picture of Wonder Woman. Cuddy felt as if Simmons had set them up; that they included her TED talk in the headline made it feel personal, as if they were going after her rather than the work.

The post, which Simonsohn distributed to his email list of hundreds, quickly made the rounds. “People were sending me emails like I was dying of cancer,” Cuddy says. “It was like, ‘We send our condolences,’ ‘Holy crap, this is terrible’ and ‘God bless you; we wish we could do something, but obviously we can’t.’ ” She also knew what was coming, a series of events that did, in fact, transpire over time: subsequent scrutiny of other studies she had published, insulting commentary about her work on the field’s Facebook groups, disdainful headlines about the flimsiness of her research. She paced around, distraught, afraid to look at her email, afraid not to. She had just put together a tenure package and worried that the dust-up would be a continuing distraction.

Cuddy did not like seeing her work criticized in a non-peer-reviewed format, but she wrote a bland statement saying, essentially, that she disagreed with their findings and looked forward to “more progress on this important topic.” Carney reassured Cuddy in the months after the Data Colada post that their paper would eventually be vindicated — of course the effects were real; someone would prove it eventually.

Eventually, the Data Colada post caught the eye of another influential blogger, Andrew Gelman, a professor of statistics and political science at Columbia University, whose interest in Cuddy’s work would prove durable, exacting and possibly career-changing for Cuddy. Gelman wields his sizable influence on the field from afar, on his popular blog andrewgelman.com, where he posts his thoughts on best statistical practices in the sciences, with a frequent emphasis on what he sees as the absurd and unscientific. Gelman, who studied math and physics at M.I.T. before turning to statistics, does not believe that social psychology is any more guilty of P-hacking than, say, biology or economics. But he has devoted extensive attention to the field, especially in more recent years, in part because of the way the media has glorified social-psychology research. He is respected enough that his posts are well read; he is cutting enough that many of his critiques are enjoyed with a strong sense of schadenfreude.

Four months after the Data Colada post, Gelman, with a co-author, published an article in Slate about Carney and Cuddy’s 2010 study, calling it “tabloid fodder.” Eventually, Cuddy’s name began appearing regularly in the blog, both in his posts and in comments. Gelman’s writing on Cuddy’s study was coolly dismissive; it bothered him that Cuddy remained fairly silent on the replication and the Data Colada post. For all he knew, Cuddy was still selling the hormone effect in her speaking gigs and in her best-selling book, “Presence,” which he had not read. Had he looked, he would have been annoyed to see that Cuddy did not include a mention of the Ranehill replication. But he might have been surprised to see how little of the book focused on power posing (just a few pages).

On his site, Cuddy’s name, far from the only one he repeatedly invoked, became a go-to synecdoche for faulty science writ large. When he saw that Cuddy had been invited to speak at a conference, he wondered why the organizers had not invited a bunch of other famous figures he clearly considered bad for science, including Diederik Stapel, who had been accused of outright fraud.

His site became a home for frequently hostile comments from his followers. “She has no serious conception of ‘science,’ ” one posted. Another compared Cuddy to Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos chief executive under investigation for misleading investors. Though Gelman did encourage his readers to stick to the science, he rarely reined anyone in. In one exchange in July 2016, a commenter wrote, “I’ve wondered whether some of Amy Cuddy’s mistakes are due to the fact that she suffered severe head trauma as the result of a car accident some years ago.” Gelman replied, “A head injury hardly seems necessary to explain these mistakes,” pointing out that her adviser, Fiske, whom he has also criticized, had no such injury but made similar errors.

Gelman, whom I met in his office in late June, is not scathing in person; he is rather mild, soft-spoken even. Gelman was vague when asked if he felt there was anything unusual about the frequency of his comments on Cuddy (“People send me things, and I respond,” he said). He said it was Cuddy who was unrelenting. He later emailed me to make sure I was aware that she attacked him and Simmons and Simonsohn on a private Facebook page, without backing up her accusations with evidence; he was still waiting for a clear renunciation of the original 2010 paper on the hormonal effects of power posing. “I would like her to say: ‘Jeez, I didn’t know any better. I was doing what they told me to do. I don’t think I’m a bad person, and it didn’t get replicated’ — rather than salvaging as much as she can.”

Gelman considers himself someone who is doing others the favor of pointing out their errors, a service for which he would be grateful, he says. Cuddy considers him a bully, someone who does not believe that she is entitled to her own interpretation of the research that is her field of expertise.

Cuddy has asked herself what motivates Gelman. “Why not help social psychologists instead of attacking them on your blog?” she wondered aloud to me. “Why not come to a conference or hold a seminar?” When I asked Gelman if he would ever consider meeting with Cuddy to hash out their differences, he seemed put off by the idea of trying to persuade her, in person, that there were flaws in her work.

“I don’t like interpersonal conflict,” he said.

On Sept. 26, 2016, Amy Cuddy woke up and checked her phone to find a chilling text from a friend. “I’m so sorry,” it said. “Are you O.K.?” She felt a familiar dread, something closer to panic. For the past year, she had mostly stopped going to social-psychology conferences, feeling a chill from her community. Another social psychologist had told her that a graduate student asked if she really was friends with Cuddy. When she responded, “Yes,” the young woman asked, “Why?”

It was the kind of information Cuddy wished she did not have; her closest friends were told to stop passing on or commenting about that kind of thing, but acquaintances still did it. She felt adrift in her field. She worried about asking peers to collaborate, suspecting that they would not want to set themselves up for intense scrutiny. And she felt betrayed, not just by those who cut her down on social media, in blog posts, even in reviews (one reviewer called her “a profiteer,” not hiding his contempt), but also by some of those who did not publicly defend her. She was not wrong to think that at least in some cases, it was fear, rather than lack of support for her, that kept people from speaking up. Two tenured psychology professors at Ivy League universities acknowledged to me that they would have publicly defended some of Cuddy’s positions were they not worried about making themselves targets on Data Colada and elsewhere.

Two days before Cuddy received that text from a friend, Gelman once again posted about the power-posing research, but this time he issued a challenge to Dana Carney. “When people screw up or cheat in their research, what do their collaborators say?” he wondered in the post. For Carney, he wrote, “it was not too late.” Unknown to Cuddy and Gelman, Carney had already linked, in her C.V., to Simmon and Simonsohn’s critique of that first, influential 2010 study, but she hadn’t made the kind of statement or gesture that Gelman expected from Cuddy.

That morning of the troubling text, Cuddy logged onto her computer and discovered that Carney had posted on her website a document (then quickly published on New York magazine’s site) that seemed intended to distance its author forever, in every way, from power posing. “I do not believe that ‘power pose’ effects are real,” she said. Not only had she stopped studying power poses, “I discourage others from studying power poses.”

She listed a number of methodological concerns she had, in retrospect, about the 2010 paper, most of which, Cuddy says, Carney had never raised with her. In an email a few months earlier, Carney had clearly told Cuddy that she thought the study’s data was flimsy, the sample was tiny, the effects were barely there. But Cuddy said she had never received notice that this kind of renunciation was coming. Carney declined to comment for this article, but Nelson, who is in her department, said she was clearly in a tough position, saddled with all the negatives of the work — the hit to her reputation — with none of the upside: the speaking fees and the positive feedback from teary fans who no doubt fuel Cuddy’s conviction in the research.

For much of the scientific world, Carney’s statement was an act of integrity and bravery. “Whoa! This is how to do it!” tweeted Michael Inzlicht, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Toronto who had eloquently written about his own crisis of confidence about his field of research, ego depletion.

To Cuddy, Carney’s post seemed so sweeping as to be vague, self-abnegating. Even Simonsohn, who made clear his support for Carney’s decision, thought the letter had a strangely unscientific vehemence to it. “If I do a bad job proving there’s a ninth planet, I probably shouldn’t say there’s a ninth planet,” he says. “But I shouldn’t say there is no ninth planet, either. You should just ignore the bad study and go back to base line.”

Cuddy wrote a lengthy response to Carney that New York magazine published. (New York, Slate and The Atlantic have closely reported on the replication movement.) Then she stopped taking phone calls and went almost completely offline. She found that she couldn’t eat; at 5-foot-5, Cuddy went down to 100 pounds.

Less than two weeks after Carney’s disavowal, Cuddy got on a plane so she could meet her commitment to speak to a crowd of 10,000 in Las Vegas. As frail as she had been since her accident, she headed to an arena in Las Vegas and roused the crowd, a tiny woman on a giant stage, taking up space, making herself big, feeling the relief of feeling powerful.

When I emailed Joe Simmons in July and asked to meet with him, he readily agreed but warned me that he does not check his email often. “I had to take email off my phone,” he explained when we met at a coffee shop across the river from Wharton. A lot of his work these days was stressful — sometimes the emailer was angry, sometimes he was — so if he looked at his phone before bed, “that was it — I wouldn’t sleep all night.”

When Simmons and I met, I asked him why he eventually wrote such a damning blog post, when his initial correspondence with Carney did not seem particularly discouraging. He and Simonsohn, he told me, had clearly explained to Cuddy and Carney that the supporting studies they cited were problematic as a body of work — and yet all the researchers did was drop the visual graph, as if deliberately sidestepping the issue. They left in the body of literature that Simmons and Simonsohn’s P-curve discredited. That apparent disregard for contrary evidence was, Simmons said, partly what prompted them to publish the harsh blog post in the first place.

But the email that Simmons and Simonsohn had sent was, in fact, ambiguous: They had explicitly told her to drop the P-curve and yet left the impression that the paper was otherwise sound. At my request, Simmons looked back at his original email. I watched as he read it over. “Oh, yeah,” he said quietly. He had a pained look on his face. “We did say to drop the graph, didn’t we?” He read it over again, then sat back. “I didn’t remember that. This may be a big misunderstanding about — that email is too polite.”

Cuddy and Carney had taken their advice literally. Simmons stood by his analysis but recognized that there was confusion at play in how they interpreted the events that transpired. Simmons says he harbored no ill will toward Cuddy before criticizing her paper; if anything, he remembered her warmly. “She was great,” he said, smiling at the memory. “We published the blog post despite my history with Amy. Because I realized that once we pulled the trigger on this. … ” He did not finish the sentence. Cuddy had, in fact, become the poster girl for this kind of work, which even he thought was not fair. “The original study wasn’t particularly egregious,” he said. “It was published in 2010 before anyone was thinking about this.”

For a moment, the scientist allowed the human element to factor into how he felt about his email response to that paper. “I wish,” he said, “I’d had the presence of mind to pick up the phone and call Amy.”

The public nature of the attacks against Cuddy have reverberated among social psychologists, raising questions about the effects of harsh discourse on the field and particularly on women. Earlier this year at the conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology, there was a presentation of a 2016 survey of 700 social psychologists, assessing their perceptions of the influence of social media on their careers. The subsequent conversation on popular Facebook groups was so combative that Alison Ledgerwood, a social psychologist at the University of California, Davis, felt the need to respond in a blog post. In it, she argued that if scientists keep having hostile conversations on social media, women are more likely to be driven away from the field. (Women in the profession, the survey presented at the conference reported, participated less than their male colleagues in social-media discussions.)

Even people who believe that the methodological reforms are essential say its costs to science are real. “It’s become like politics — we’ve created two camps of people who shouldn’t be in two camps in the first place,” says Jay Van Bavel, the social psychologist at N.Y.U. “It’s perceived slights and defensiveness, and everybody has some history or grievance — and it will never end because there is that history of perceived grievances, of one of your colleagues who has been put through it, or criticized your friend in a public forum. It’s terrible for science. It’s not good.”

If Amy Cuddy is a victim, she may not seem an obvious one: She has real power, a best-selling book, a thriving speaking career. She did not own up fully to problems in her research or try to replicate her own study. (She says there were real hurdles to doing so, not least of which was finding a collaborator to take that on.) But many of her peers told me that she did not deserve the level of widespread and sometimes vicious criticism she has endured. “Amy has been the target of mockery and meanness on Facebook, on Twitter, in blog posts — I feel like, Wow, I have never seen that in science,” Van Bavel says. “I’ve only been in it for 15 years, but I’ve never seen public humiliation like that.”

As a result, the breadth of the accusations — how diffuse they are — could easily be mistaken for the depth of her scientific missteps, which at the outset were no different from those of so many of her peers. “We were all being trained to simplify, to get our message out there — there were conferences and panels on how to do it,” says Richard Petty, a social psychologist at Ohio State. “One of the ironies is that Amy just did it more successfully.”

I was surprised to find that some of the leaders in the replication movement were not Cuddy’s harshest critics but spoke of her right to defend her work in more measured tones. “Why does everyone care so much about what Amy says?” Brian Nosek says. “Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself. Leif Nelson, one of the three pioneers of the movement, says Cuddy is no different from most other scientists in her loyalty to her data. “Authors love their findings,” he says. “And you can defend almost anything — that’s the norm of science, not just in psychology.” He still considers Cuddy a “very serious psychologist”; he also believes the 2010 paper “is a bunch of nonsense.” But he says, “It does not strike me as at all notable that Amy would defend her work. Most people do.”

Every researcher has a threshold at which he or she is convinced of the evidence; in social psychology, especially, there is no such thing as absolute proof, only measures of probability. In recent months, Cuddy reached the threshold needed to alter her thinking on the effect of hormones. She mentioned, at a psychology conference where she was presenting her work, that a study had recently been conducted on power posing. “They found no hormonal effects,” she said before taking a breath. “That study is done very well, and I trust those results.” Although 11 new papers have recently been published that do not show the downstream effects of power posing on behaviors, Cuddy is still fighting for power posing. The research, she says, still shows its effect on feelings of power: At the conference, she presented a comprehensive meta-analysis, a version of which, she says, she will soon publish, with a strong P-curve supporting that, and she also presented a P-curve suggesting that power posing had a robust effect on self-evaluations, emotions and moods.

Cuddy now seems ready to move on to a new phase. We met near her home in Newton, Mass., in August. Cuddy, smiling, fresh from physical therapy for a torn ACL, was in a tennis skirt, looking young and more lighthearted than I had ever seen her. She had abandoned the dream of tenure. She was planning a new project, a new book, she told me. It was coming together in her mind: “Bullies, Bystanders and Bravehearts.” It would be personal; there would be research; she would write, and she would talk, and she would interview people who had suffered fates worse than her own and bounced back. She would tell their stories and hers, and because she is a good talker, people would listen.",When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html

In his township school, 10 children shared a single textbook. For high school, he talked his way into a technical school reserved for Indians. After graduation, he bagged groceries, then moved into Johannesburg and took a job delivering antique furniture. He volunteered for a government-run youth league. That eventually turned into a staff position for President Zuma, overseeing youth affairs.

Two years ago, he started his own consulting business. He secures contracts from local governments, advising them on how to manage their infrastructure. Soon, he was rich.

The ranks of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires expanded to 17,300 from 6,200 from 2007 to 2015, according to New World Wealth, a consultant based in Johannesburg. What many of these people have in common are lucrative ties to government.

For example, you can’t have a civil conversation with people who are intent on destroying the rules that govern conversation itself. It’s fruitless to engage with people who are impervious to facts. There are some ideas — like racism — that are so noxious they deserve no recognition in any decent community. There are some people who are so consumed by enmity that the only thing they deserve is contempt.

You’re not going to change these people’s minds anyway. If you give them an opening, you’re just going to give them room to destroy the decent etiquette of society. Civility is not a suicide pact. As Benjamin DeMott put it in a famous 1996 essay for the Nation, “When you’re in an argument with a thug, there are things much more important than civility.”

And yet the more I think about it, the more I agree with the argument Yale Law professor Stephen L. Carter made in his 1998 book “Civility.” The only way to confront fanaticism is with love, he said. Ask the fanatics genuine questions. Paraphrase what they say so they know they’ve been heard. Show some ultimate care for their destiny and soul even if you detest the words that come out of their mouths.

You engage fanaticism with love, first, for your own sake. If you succumb to the natural temptation to greet this anger with your own anger, you’ll just spend your days consumed by bitterness and revenge. You’ll be a worse person in all ways.

If, on the other hand, you fight your natural fight instinct, your natural tendency to use the rhetoric of silencing, and instead regard this person as one who is, in his twisted way, bringing you gifts, then you’ll defeat a dark passion and replace it with a better passion. You’ll teach the world something about you by the way you listen. You may even learn something; a person doesn’t have to be right to teach you some of the ways you are wrong.

Second, you greet a fanatic with compassionate listening as a way to offer an unearned gift to the fanatic himself. These days, most fanatics are not Nietzschean supermen. They are lonely and sad, their fanaticism emerging from wounded pride, a feeling of not being seen.

If you make these people feel heard, maybe in some small way you’ll address the emotional bile that is at the root of their political posture.

A lot of the fanaticism in society is electron-thin. People in jobs like mine get a lot of nasty emails, often written late at night after libations are flowing. But if we write back to our attackers appreciatively, and offer a way to save face, 90 percent of the time the next email is totally transformed. The brutal mask drops and the human being instantly emerges.

Finally, it’s best to greet fanaticism with love for the sake of the country. As Carter points out, the best abolitionists restrained their natural hatred of slaveholders because they thought the reform of manners and the abolition of slavery were part of the same cause — to restore the dignity of every human being.

We all swim in a common pool. You can shut bigots and haters out of your dining room or your fantasy football league, but when it comes to national political life, there’s nowhere else to go. We have to deal with each other.

Civility, Carter writes, “is the sum of the many sacrifices we are called to make for the sake of living together.”

You don’t have to like someone to love him. All you have to do is try to imitate Martin Luther King, who thrust his love into his enemies’ hearts in a way that was aggressive, remorseless and destabilizing.

I taught my first class at Columbia University’s M.F.A. program this month, and even though I’ve been teaching college writing since 1993, I initially felt a little intimidated by the school’s regal campus. That, and regretful.

I enjoyed going to college at the University of Michigan, an hour from home, but my secret humiliation is: I was the type of mediocre student I now disdain. As a freshman, I cared about my friends, my boyfriend and my poetry. Or, I cared about what my boyfriend thought of my friends, what my friends thought of him, and what they thought of my poetry about him. Here’s what I wish I’d known and done differently:

A’S ARE COOL AND COME WITH PERKS As a student, I saw myself as anti-establishment, and I hated tests; I barely maintained a B average. I thought only nerds spent weekends in the library studying. Recently I learned that my niece Dara, a sophomore at New York University with a 3.7 G.P.A. (and a boyfriend), was offered a week of travel in Buenos Aires as part of her honors seminar. I was retroactively envious to learn that a 3.5 G.P.A. or higher at many schools qualifies you for free trips, scholarships, grants, awards, private parties and top internships. At 20, I was too busy freaking out when said boyfriend disappeared (after sleeping with one of said friends). Students certainly don’t need to strive obsessively for perfection, but I should have prioritized grades, not guys.

SHOW UP AND SPEAK UP If a class was boring or it snowed, I’d skip. My rationale was that nobody in the 300-person lecture hall would notice and I could get notes later. Attendance barely counted. When I went, I’d sit quietly in back. Yet as a teacher, I see that the students who come weekly, sit in front, and ask and answer questions get higher grades and frankly, preferential treatment. After 15 weeks, I barely know the absentees or anyone Snapchatting the term away on their iPhones. It’s not just that these students flush $300 down the toilet every time they miss my class; participating can actually lead to payoffs. I reward those who try harder with recommendations, references, professional contacts and encouragement.

CLASS CONNECTIONS CAN LAUNCH YOUR CAREER As an undergrad, I rarely visited my professors during office hours. I didn’t want to annoy teachers with what I considered triviality. Besides, I thought I knew everything already. In graduate school, on the other hand, I went to the readings of a professor I admired. Eventually, I’d go to his office just to vent. Once, after I complained about a dead-end job, he recommended me for a position at The New Yorker, jump-starting my career.

On Monday, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, questioned companies’ statements that their plants were back in operation: “We understand that manufacturing is running at minimal levels, and certainly far from full production,” Dr. Gottlieb said in prepared remarks published Monday by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

He is scheduled to be questioned by the committee on Tuesday. In his prepared statement, Dr. Gottlieb said many plants are running at below 50 percent capacity, “with many firms operating around 20 percent capacity, and some even less. We have found no firm operating above 70 percent of their normal operation.”

In a recent interview, Dr. Gottlieb said he was worried that if conditions don’t improve, more shortages — of both drugs and medical devices — might follow by early next year.

Pharmaceutical products made in Puerto Rico account for nearly 10 percent of all drugs consumed by Americans, and about 80 firms make medical products there, the F.D.A. has said.

“I don’t think we’ve dealt with a situation where we’ve had so many simultaneous impacts to what are very important facilities,” Dr. Gottlieb said. So far, “we have been able to mitigate these issues, but it’s been all hands on deck at the F.D.A., and there’s been close calls.”

Dr. Gottlieb says the F.D.A. is watching the supply of about 30 drugs that are made on the island, in addition to medical devices. Most companies are still running on diesel generators, and manufacturers that have been able to connect to the power grid are still encountering an unpredictable supply of electricity, he said.

Cathy Denning, the senior vice president of sourcing operations at Vizient, which negotiates with medical companies on behalf of its member hospitals, said several device manufacturers, including Medtronic, which makes surgical staples, and Stryker, which makes orthopedic surgery products, were shipping reduced supplies of some products to hospitals because of Hurricane Maria. “We here at Vizient had an ‘aha’ moment when we realized how much manufacturing actually takes place in Puerto Rico,” she said.

Last week, a Johnson & Johnson executive told investors that the company couldn’t rule out “intermittent” shortages of some formulations of its products, although he noted that many were made elsewhere. Johnson & Johnson makes Tylenol and the H.I.V. drug Prezista in Puerto Rico, as well as other products.

The F.D.A. has been supplying logistical help to companies, providing fuel for the generators and assisting with moving finished products off the island. Dr. Gottlieb said some companies had gotten down to a 24-hour supply of diesel fuel, and representatives for the medical-device industry had said some generators were beginning to break down, requiring emergency repair.

Pharmacists at half a dozen hospitals, from Utah to North Carolina, said in interviews that the fluid bag shortage had had a domino effect, leading to scarcities of a range of products as administrators race to stock up on the supplies they need to keep their hospitals running smoothly. Even products like empty bags and plastic tubing, which are also made by Baxter in Puerto Rico, have been hard to come by, some said.

“With drug shortages, it is often a race to see who can find a supply of the drug on shortage and also any alternatives,” said Philip J. Trapskin, who is the program manager of medication use strategy and innovation at UW Health, the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s health system. “We have been able to get what we need to avoid disruptions in patient care, but the mix of products is not ideal and there are no guarantees we will continue to get the supplies we need.”

Baxter recently announced that the F.D.A. had allowed it to import bags from the company’s factories in Ireland and Australia, and said production in Puerto Rico was slowly resuming. The company, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., said it was also helping its employees on the island, including distributing generators and propane-powered cooktops for the workers’ use. “While the storm devastated the island in a day, the recovery will take time,” the company said in a statement.

Baxter did not provide a timeline for when the bags would be back in stock, and pharmacists said they anticipated that the bags might not be available for many more weeks or months. “This is a big deal for hospitals across the country,” said Scott Knoer, the chief pharmacy officer at the Cleveland Clinic. “We’re really still trying to get the information we need to manage it.”

Baxter has been rationing its supply, shipping limited orders of the bags filled with saline and dextrose to hospitals based on a percentage of what the institutions typically use. “We are getting small amounts, but it is nowhere what we need in order to take care of patients,” said Jeff Rosner, who oversees pharmacy contracting and purchasing at the Cleveland Clinic.

The impact has rippled throughout the clinic’s normal operations. Alternatives, such as injecting some drugs into an IV — known as an “IV push” — take more time for nurses, which divert them from attending to other needs. And the method is not appropriate for some drugs. “This has repercussions,” Mr. Knoer said.

The pharmacists said the shortage had not yet affected patient care, although some of the alternatives require that employees learn new systems or adopt complex practices that can introduce human error. If the shortage persists, some said elective procedures, like knee replacements, might be postponed.

It is a predicament that is all too familiar. While Hurricane Maria caused the latest problem, drug shortages have plagued the nation’s hospital system for years. The affected products are typically longstanding staples, like epinephrine or morphine, and are often sterile injectable drugs that sell for low profit margins. In 2014, a shortage of large saline bags, which were manufactured by Baxter and are not currently scarce, led to state and federal investigations into its business practices.

Even the Mini-Bags have previously been in short supply, and pharmacists said shipments of the small bags had been unpredictable before the hurricane.

“It’s like, do we have any great faith this company is going to be able to turn this shortage around, when they haven’t been able to effectively turn around the shortages they had in existence before?” said Debby Cowan, the pharmacy manager at Angel Medical Center, a small hospital in Franklin, in North Carolina’s Smoky Mountains.

Like Dr. Gottlieb, many of the hospital administrators said their eye was on the horizon. With so many drug companies manufacturing products in Puerto Rico, Mr. Rosner said, “I am fearful that this may not be the end of the shortages — it may only be the beginning.”",U.S. Hospitals Wrestle With Shortages of Drug Supplies Made in Puerto Rico,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/health/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-drug-shortage.html

After several minutes, the agents arrest Mr. Bolanos, removing a paintbrush from one hand and a cellphone from the other and then placing his hands behind his back and handcuffing him. He is walked to a car outside.

An ICE public affairs officer, Yasmeen Pitts O’Keefe, said later that Mr. Bolanos was released from custody pending further investigation. She said in a statement that the matter had been referred to the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility and the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General.

“The agency is reviewing this incident,” Ms. Pitts O’Keefe said. She did not reply to a request for further comment on Monday.

In their letter to Elizabeth Godfrey, a deputy field office director for ICE, Mr. Wyden and Mr. Merkley wrote that people “do not lose their constitutional protection from warrantless search and seizure simply because ICE believes they may be immigrants.”

The senators asked Ms. Godfrey for an explanation of the policies that led to Mr. Bolanos’s arrest and questioned whether the behavior of the agents conformed to guidelines. Mr. Cardenas said on Monday that Mr. Bolanos planned to speak with a lawyer before talking publicly about the episode.

It was the latest encounter to bring ICE under criticism for its agents’ practices during arrests in Oregon and across the country. The letter from the senators said that the encounter with Mr. Bolanos came about two weeks after ICE responded to their questions about the targeting of an American citizen in Hillsboro, Ore.

In that episode last month, according to an account by the American Civil Liberties Union, a man, Isidro Andrade-Tafolla, and his wife were stopped by ICE agents as the couple left the Washington County Courthouse.

Mr. Andrade-Tafolla was asked to show his identification by agents who did not identify themselves, but who showed him a photograph. Mr. Andrade-Tafolla said that it was not him in the photograph, and that the only resemblance was skin color.

“That confusion about who is who with unidentified ICE agents could literally become deadly,” Sheriff Pat Garrett of Washington County said at a news conference last month after Mr. Andrade-Tafolla was stopped. He said sheriffs in Oregon had expressed concern to ICE about other circumstances in which agents did not identify themselves or drove in unmarked cars.

“We have heard story after story,” Representative Suzanne Bonamici said at the news conference in September.

On Friday, after Mr. Bolanos was arrested, she wrote in a joint letter with Representative Earl Blumenauer, a fellow Democrat, that the agents’ behavior was inappropriate.

“Without a response, we will assume that an investigation into the Washington County incident is not underway,” the lawmakers said. “Now after this most recent incident, it is even more disturbing to witness ICE agents act inappropriately again, only a month later.”

Mat Dos Santos, the legal director for the A.C.L.U. of Oregon, said in an interview over the weekend that the arrest of Mr. Bolanos, as seen in the video, was “flagrantly unconstitutional.”

“I hope that they review this incident and realize just how bad it is and how plainly illegal this arrest was and reprimand and retrain officers on how to conduct an arrest legally,” he added.

“I don’t have a lot of hope for that,” he said. “It’s an agency that operates largely in secret and with little public oversight.”",ICE Arrested a Man in Oregon Without a Warrant.

As the sun set in the shantytown of La Perla in Old San Juan, Ramón Marrero, 79, slumped onto the unwashed cot inside his brother’s tool shed, where he had lived since Maria claimed his home.

A single light bulb illuminated the other contents of the bare, musty room: two plastic chairs piled with clothes, canned fruit and vegetables, and a single gas burner.

Mr. Marrero, a community elder known to his neighbors as Don Ramón, draped a towel over his bare back to fend off the mosquitoes. Earlier, he had walked to the post office to charge his cellphone and mobile battery pack.

The only electricity he had seen since the storm came from an extension cord connected to a shared generator donated by Luis Fonsi, the Puerto Rican pop singer who filmed the video for the hit song “Despacito” in La Perla.

Mr. Marrero was hesitant to plug in the light bulb or his electric fan — only one could be used at a time — because he was afraid to overheat the machine or take energy from his neighbors.

Residents of the barrio say they were left to clear garbage and other debris on their own after the storm because municipal workers had failed to show up. Like Mr. Marrero, they were using fallen branches to fuel bonfires for cooking.

Lorel Cubano, the director of a local nonprofit, said most of the aid the neighborhood had received was from private citizens and celebrities like Mr. Fonsi. “The government hasn’t arrived here,” she said.

Fear in the Darkness

Georgia Lopez Ortiz, 92, is one of many elderly residents of the Luis Lloréns Torres housing project who have been too scared to walk outside since Maria wiped out the streetlights. The notoriously crime-ridden development is the largest in the Caribbean, and is dominated by rival gangs. Residents say it has become even more dangerous in the dark.

Ms. Ortiz’s washing machine does not work, so she has been hand-washing clothes in a bucket. She cannot cook, so her daughters bring her food every few days.

When aid groups visit, she throws a rope through the security bars that enclose her patio, and uses it to pull up packages of water and dried goods.

Raquel Mercado, 69, lives in a cramped one-room apartment with her 37-year-old son. Her car has not worked since it was flooded during the storm, so she has not been able to get to a bank to withdraw cash or to a pharmacy to refill her prescriptions.

She is selling snacks out of her apartment to bring in some money.

“What else is there to do?” Ms. Mercado said. “We’re stuck here.”

Baseball, Wine and Long-term Guests

A baseball game blared from speakers connected to a projector screen in Maricarmen del Llano’s living room. The adults drank red wine as they cleaned up from a dinner of fried chicken and mashed potatoes.

Even in the well-off parts of the island, though, life is not quite normal.

For the last month, seven extended family members, including a newborn, have been living with Ms. del Llano, a school psychologist; her husband, a veterinarian; and their two children, ages 7 and 9.

The whole house is running off a powerful generator. Overnight, they use the machine to run air-conditioning in each bedroom.

Tangie Sobrino, Ms. del Llano’s cousin and the newborn’s mother, is getting ready to move back home with her husband, a lawyer, and their two other young children. They were preparing to purchase a $5,200 generator.

“Our reality is not the norm,” Ms. Sobrino said, referring to the many Puerto Ricans for whom recovery was much further off.

From Good Life to Discomfort

The storm also revealed what had been carefully hidden cracks in the upper echelons of Puerto Rican society, which has been imploding during a decade-long recession.

Inside her two-story home with multiple balconies and a pool, Maria Julia Martinez’s stainless-steel refrigerator, espresso machine and toaster oven have been gathering dust. The family’s flooring business had tanked in recent years, and they could not use the appliances because they did not have $2,000 to fix their broken generator in the backyard.

They have a much smaller generator that could support a couple of small appliances at a time, but to save gas money and prevent it from breaking down, the family runs the machine only at night. They use a propane camping stove and a barbecue to prepare food.

When Ms. Martinez’s husband cranked on the small generator one night last week, she ran off to do a couple of laundry loads on the efficiency cycle. Afterward, the entire family, including their pets, went to sleep on mattresses set up on the floor of their upstairs master bedroom. A small air-conditioning unit in the room provided a respite from the rest of their home, which felt like a dark and steamy cave all day and night.

“This is living in hell,” Ms. Martinez said. She acknowledged that despite their discomfort, her family was still much better off than most people on the island. “I feel bad for feeling bad.”

A New Level of Poverty

Inside the elementary school classroom that has become their temporary home, Iris Perez and her two adult daughters sat in plastic chairs, slapping mosquitoes on their exposed arms and legs and staring blankly, as if it was too hot to speak.

Like nearly half of Puerto Ricans, they had been living in poverty before the storm. But Maria swept away their ocean-side home, and banished them to a new level of destitution.

This emergency shelter was better than the last; here there were showers and the family had the classroom to itself. Before, the women — along with Ms. Perez’s brother, son-in-law, and two young granddaughters — had slept next to other families and bathed with cups of water, filled up in the bathroom sinks.

Hand-washed clothing hung from fluorescent lights on the ceiling. A bookshelf had become a medicine cabinet, with deodorant and baby shampoo stacked in front of school books. Filing cabinets were diaper changing stations.

Nashali Reyes, Ms. Perez’s oldest daughter, was seven months pregnant, and worried about contracting the Zika virus. Her 2-year-old daughter Charyliz bobbed around the classroom with a blanket and bottle in her hands, seemingly unbothered by the bug bites on her face, which had become swollen and infected because she was allergic.

“It doesn’t matter what we do,” Ms. Reyes said, gesturing to a bottle of repellent. They had to keep the windows and doors open, they said, to maintain a livable, if extremely uncomfortable, temperature.

A message written on a whiteboard reminded them to keep their temporary home clean. “Welcome,” it said in Spanish, “God has blessed you.”

Communal Living

Felix Cruz was holding court for his neighbors at a dining table in his garage. His home had been transformed into a motel and soup kitchen of sorts, because of his two extra bedrooms and large furniture, including a couple of sofa beds where people were crashing.

Most of the neighborhood’s residents are retired and living on fixed incomes. They cook and eat communally using a 40-year-old gas stove that has been dragged out of storage and scraped clean of cockroach eggs and mold.

They have been cramming their food into a small freezer in Mr. Cruz’s backyard, opening it as little as possible to preserve the cold air.

The neighbors pooled money to pay for gas to power a small generator that could support a couple of fans, and are eating two meals a day, usually rice and whatever meat is on sale.

They eat on fine china, even though doing dishes in the dark is a pain, to try to distract themselves from their discomfort.

“It was difficult before because food was expensive, electricity was expensive, and now it’s even worse,” Mr. Cruz said. He pointed to Alma Gonzalez, 67, one of the neighbors he said had become like family. “When she has money, she pays. When I have money, I pay.

More important, the doctors thought surgery had a good chance of eliminating the need for a lifelong implanted shunt to drain excess fluid from his brain. The devices often need replacing, which requires more surgery, and they can lead to infection.

Mrs. Royer acknowledged there was no guarantee that her son would be free of a shunt. But she said she and her husband had “happiness and peace” after deciding to go for the surgery.

On Sept. 26, the day before the operation, Mr. and Mrs. Royer and her parents met with the medical team at Texas Children’s.

With more than a dozen doctors and nurses in the conference room, it was standing room only. All would be involved in the operation.

Dr. Belfort reviewed the test results, telling the group that the fetus had a “significant lesion” involving much of his lower back. But he added, “He’s able to do the gas pedal. That’s a great thing. There’s a lot of function to save.”

Addressing Mrs. Royer, he said: “This is experimental surgery, with no guarantee. You are the person who will take the risk for another person. There is no mandate for you to do this. Nobody will think less of you if change your mind, and you can change your mind until the last minute, until you go to sleep.”

Early the next morning, with Mrs. Royer under general anesthesia, the surgery began in an overheated operating room ideal for the fetus but sweltering for doctors and nurses in caps, gloves and surgical gowns.

During the standard prenatal surgery for spina bifida, surgeons cut open the woman’s abdomen and uterus to reach the fetus. But the newer, experimental approach is different.

Dr. Belfort opened Mrs. Royer’s lower abdomen, but not her uterus. Instead, he eased the uterus out of her body and inserted the fetoscope, and then, through another slit, surgical tools. The doctors drained out the amniotic fluid and pumped in carbon dioxide to keep the uterus expanded, giving them room to work and allowing them to see better and cauterize when needed.

They gave the fetus an anesthetic injection and then, guided by images on the video screens, began to operate on him, tugging skin and membranes over the naked spinal cord and sewing them tightly shut with five stitches to seal out amniotic fluid.

Because the defect was so large, they made “relaxing incisions” along his sides, to loosen the skin so they could pull it across his back. The cuts would heal, though they would leave scars.

Every few minutes, a pediatric cardiologist called out the fetal heart rate, which held steady at a normal rate of about 150 beats a minute. When the surgery was finished, the doctors replaced the amniotic fluid with saline.

The surgery took three hours. The standard, open operation is faster and easier, but Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead think their method will prove safer for both the mother and the fetus.

With the open procedure, the cut into the uterus increases the risk of early labor and premature birth, which puts the fetus at risk for a host of complications.

The incision also raises the risk of uterine rupture during labor, and requires that the mother give birth by cesarean section, which is generally riskier for women than a vaginal birth.

The scarring on the uterus from the two operations makes it likely that she will need cesareans for future births, and also increases the risk of placental problems that can be life-threatening. The small slits for the fetoscopes are thought to reduce these risks.

To develop their fetoscopic procedure, Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead operated on sheep and spent several hundred hours over the course of two years practicing on a simulator that they had created. It consisted of a rubber kickball, about the size of a basketball — like a uterus at 24 weeks of pregnancy — with a doll inside, wrapped in chicken skin that they cut to mimic the defect in spina bifida.

They would insert fetoscopes into the ball and, eyes on the monitor, work together to sew up the chicken skin. They completed more than 30 simulated operations, including two sessions in an operating room, with a full surgical team assembled. They still use the simulator at least twice a month to keep up their skills, Dr. Belfort said.

They operated on their first patient in July 2014. In August, in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, they reported on their first 28 cases. So far, the results have been good, though the numbers are small.

No fetuses have died, few have needed shunts, and some of the mothers have been able to have vaginal deliveries. Their pregnancies appear to last longer, coming closer to full-term than with the open procedure. More research is needed, but other medical centers have begun adopting the technique. Surgeons at Johns Hopkins have used it to treat five patients, and Dr. Belfort is helping to train colleagues at Stanford.

Doctors who practice the open procedure are critical, and warn that the carbon dioxide pumped into the uterus may harm the fetus and cause neurological problems. Dr. Belfort said there has been no evidence of harm. But time will tell.

Mrs. Royer, who will stay in an apartment in Houston for the rest of her pregnancy, had a painful recovery from the surgery. But she has no regrets.

“It’s not done by any means, but I definitely feel it’s the right thing for us,” she said. “Seeing the ultrasound and how good he’s doing, moving his ankles and feet, it’s such a happy moment.

“I can’t imagine going on further in the pregnancy not knowing every day what damage is being done and if he’s getting worse. It’s such a relief to move forward.”

Some franchise fans have criticized the new series for breaking with the optimistic tone of past series.
The creators of a work like “Star Trek: Discovery” have to keep multiple audiences in mind.","This is great. But it’s not really my gig. As the chief television critic for a general-interest newspaper, as I’ve been for just over two years, my job is to be a grazer, a sampler, a dabbler. I don’t believe that there’s a hierarchy of fandom — that fans who have logged more eyeball-hours supporting a franchise are more authentic than other fans, and thus have greater ownership of the story.

So I write for the center of the “Star Trek” bell curve: the fan who may have seen a lot of the previous programs, or a little, or none at all, but who’s interested in “Discovery.” (This, by the way, is probably fine for the “Trek” superfan, who in today’s vast media cosmos can find plenty of more-targeted reviews from the standpoint of completists.)

Of course, “Star Trek” isn’t just any story. It’s part of our national mythology, a continuing megastory whose characters come to represent our abstract ideals. It would be malpractice for a TV critic not to know anything about “Star Trek.” I’d watched each of the series, more (“Deep Space Nine”) or less (sorry, “Enterprise”).

This kind of question — how much does the source material matter? — comes up more often as pop culture has become dominated by adaptations (“Game of Thrones”), revivals (“The X-Files”), reboots (“Dynasty”), sequels (“Fuller House”), prequels (“Young Sheldon”) and remakes of adaptations (“The Tick”).

It’s as if we were trapped in a time loop reliving the past … not unlike the “Star Trek: The Next Generation” crew in the episode “Cause and Effect.”

My philosophy is that any work needs to stand on its own: If I need to have read the source book to really “get” a TV series, then it’s not a good series. It’s not an iron rule, of course. Good luck understanding “Twin Peaks: The Return” if you didn’t see the original. (Then again, good luck even if you did see the original.)

Likewise, part of what I need to ask about a show like “Discovery” is: If it weren’t associated with this brand, would I want to watch any more of it? To an extent, my job is to know something about “Star Trek,” but simultaneously make myself forget it.

I address some of these meta-questions in my review of “Discovery,” which I wrote after watching six episodes. Some franchise fans have criticized the new series for breaking with the optimistic tone of past series. I don’t have that problem, although I had other issues. Franchises stay vital by remaking themselves for their times, not by pledging allegiance to the past. Just as Batman could be a camp icon in the 1960s and a brooding antihero in the 21st century, so can “Trek” complicate itself for the era of complex TV.

Of course, it’s not just critics who have to think about this. The creators of a work like “Star Trek: Discovery” have to keep multiple audiences in mind. After all, CBS was probably counting on the passionate “Trek” fan base to drive subscriptions to its All Access streaming service.

But a franchise also needs new fans to grow. If you become too beholden to callbacks and timelines, you risk becoming less a storyteller and more of a custodian.

Eugene Smith Memorial Fund’s 2017 grant in Humanistic Photography for his project on the European migrant and refugee crisis.

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Photo

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

FRIDAY PUZZLE — There are two kinds of people: Those who like their crosswords knotty and difficult, and those who pray for mercy just so they can make some headway. Eventually, and with enough practice, the mercy-seekers become the challenge-seekers. And then they claim that they have given up on doing the early week puzzles, because those are way too easy.

It’s a fair point. For some solvers, the Monday and Tuesday puzzles don’t present much of a challenge, but those puzzles are not really for them. They are for the people still getting the hang of solving, and for the ones who can appreciate a good, straightforward theme.

Don’t say “No, I would never do that”: I’ve seen you on Twitter.

I have news for those solvers: Today’s puzzle is not that hard, which, of course, is a totally subjective call. I didn’t find it hard. But I’ve also been solving every single day for a very long time. Maybe I’m just on the wavelength of the constructor, Peter Wentz. But it’s easy to make this puzzle fall. Sorry. Maybe Saturday will be harder.

But none of RT’s social media activities or its presence in cable and satellite TV lineups has delivered the impact of its YouTube channel.
RT launched its YouTube page in March 2007, roughly four months after Google paid $1.65 billion for the fledgling video site.
His personal YouTube channel has earned more than 60 million views.
Today, RT ranks among the top news channels on YouTube for views, subscribers and “engagement” such as comments or likes.","As the presidential election heated up in the spring of 2016, RT consistently featured negative stories about Mrs. Clinton, according to United States intelligence officials. That included claims of corruption at her family foundation and ties to Islamic extremism, frequent coverage of emails stolen by Russian operatives from Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, and accusations that she was in poor physical and mental health.

“More than half of American adults say they watch YouTube, and younger viewers are moving to YouTube at staggering numbers,” said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russia’s exploitation of social media platforms based in the United States. “YouTube is a target-rich environment for any disinformation campaign — Russian or otherwise — that represents a long-term, next-generation challenge.”

Much like the Russian-controlled pages on Facebook, RT’s YouTube videos comply with YouTube’s community guidelines, which cover things like nudity, copyright violations and promoting violence against a group based on race or religion. But not propaganda.

YouTube carries “a wide variety of news channels” that represent “an array of viewpoints across the political spectrum,” said a spokesman for the company, Chris Dale.

RT’s reach on YouTube — 2.2 million subscribers, just slightly behind CNN — stemmed from a long and mutually beneficial relationship between the news channel and the video site, according to current and former RT employees and technology industry analysts.

YouTube had the vast audience and global reach that RT needed as it set out to become a worldwide alternative news source with influence and viewers beyond Russia’s own borders. RT has YouTube channels in a number of foreign languages including Arabic, Spanish, German, French and Chinese.

“RT management did view YouTube as hugely important to spreading content,” said Liz Wahl, a former correspondent in the United States for RT who quit on the air in 2014 over concerns that the network was whitewashing the Russian annexation of Crimea. “Traditional television ratings weren’t important because the aim was to get the messaging out through various digital and social platforms.”

The Russian channel was among the first news organizations to recognize YouTube’s power and developed content intended to perform well on the platform. RT uploads videos frequently, sprinkling in buzzy viral videos of disasters — plane crashes, tsunamis, a meteor strike — to earn likes and longer watch times, which YouTube’s algorithm rewards with better placement among search results and recommendations.

The viral videos, which were often borrowed from other sources, help to build up RT’s subscribers, and they became part of the Kremlin’s audience for more political content.

“People come for the click-bait material,” said Bret Schafer, an official at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, the Washington-based public policy research group. “And they eventually land on videos that the Kremlin wants them to see.”

While much of RT’s traffic stems from nonpolitical videos, the channel’s political and foreign affairs content ranks highly in many YouTube searches. Searches on topics on which the Kremlin is typically eager to promote its point of view — American intervention in Syria, the Ukrainian civil war or the rise of Germany’s far-right AfD party — will often turn up an RT video as one of the top results.

YouTube also provided RT with the kind of perks it reserved for big publishers, including custom backgrounds for its channel in the early days and a “check mark” that designated RT as a verified news source. Until recently, RT was also among a select group of news organizations included in Google’s “preferred” news lineup, granting them access to guaranteed revenue from premium advertisers. Those advertisers, in effect, subsidized Russia’s international propaganda arm.

Google dropped RT from the preferred lineup last month. Andrea Faville, a Google spokeswoman, said the decision was unrelated to the congressional inquiry, and that RT had been dropped as part of a “standard algorithmic update.” But Google also noted that it was not placing any other limits on RT: The channel could still sell regular ads on its videos and the status downgrade only applied in the United States. Google later clarified that RT was downgraded in other markets, but it would not say which ones.

Kirill Karnovich-Valua, RT’s deputy editor in chief, said the organization had not been informed of Google’s decision and it was puzzled about why it was dropped despite being “one of the most watched YouTube channels in the world.”

“This speaks to the unprecedented political pressure increasingly applied to all RT partners and relationships in a concerted effort to push our channel out of the U.S. market entirely, and by any means possible,” Mr. Karnovich-Valua wrote in an email.

Last month, RT said the Justice Department had demanded that a private company affiliated with RT America register as a “foreign agent” — a term that dates back to a law originally enacted in 1938 to deter Nazi propaganda. On Thursday, after the deadline set by American officials had passed, an RT spokeswoman said that the news organization was “doing everything possible for RT to avoid having to register.” Registration could impose voluminous disclosure requirements on RT, a particular burden for a media organization producing frequent content.

Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, responded in more forceful terms: Should the United States impose restrictions on Russian media, Mr. Putin said last week, Russian would act “symmetrically and quite swiftly.”

RT’s use of other technology platforms is also under investigation. Last month, officials at Twitter told a Senate Intelligence Committee that three RT accounts targeting an American audience — with a combined following of roughly six million users — had spent $274,100 to promote tweets in 2016.

But none of RT’s social media activities or its presence in cable and satellite TV lineups has delivered the impact of its YouTube channel. RT launched its YouTube page in March 2007, roughly four months after Google paid $1.65 billion for the fledgling video site. At the time, YouTube was better known for pirated content and videos of cute animals than news programming, but RT caught on quickly.

The Russian channel recruited talent from within the burgeoning world of YouTube-born media stars, people who had already shown a knack for creating viral or popular video content.

One RT contributor, the British blogger Graham Phillips, built a large following on YouTube with videos from Ukraine’s civil war, many of them critical of Ukraine’s central government. RT often featured Mr. Phillips and at one point employed him as a part-time freelancer before he was arrested and deported by Ukrainian authorities. His personal YouTube channel has earned more than 60 million views.

Another RT contributor, Lori Harfenist, began her career on public-access television in New York City, and eventually moved her self-produced show, “The Resident,” to YouTube. Ms. Harfenist was one of the platform’s first revenue-sharing partners, according to a biography on Ms. Harfenist’s personal website.

Ms. Harfenist was eventually recruited by RT, which began featuring her on segments with titles like “America is a Hypocrite.” During the presidential campaign, RT’s Twitter account promoted a video from her that claimed the existence of an anti-Semitic conspiracy involving Hillary Clinton, Google and the Illuminati. (She later claimed the segment was meant as satire.) Ms. Harfenist did not respond to emails and Facebook messages seeking comment.

Today, RT ranks among the top news channels on YouTube for views, subscribers and “engagement” such as comments or likes. The most-watched clips on RT are not political or anti-establishment videos, they are snackable content. A clip of a homeless man with a gifted voice for radio is the most popular video on RT, viewed 40 million times since it was uploaded six years ago.

Mr. Karnovich-Valua said RT’s primary aim is to provide an alternative point of view on current events so its audience can get a full picture of world events. “Where relevant, RT does present a Russian perspective on current events, but we don’t promote the Russian point of view, we explain it alongside with presenting others,” he said.

Some lawmakers, including Mr. Warner, have called for tighter regulation and disclosure requirements for political advertising on social media platforms. Yet RT’s embrace of YouTube shows how difficult it could be to limit foreign influence.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Yes, hi, remember yesterday, when I said that you might as well solve the Friday because it wasn’t as hard as you would imagine it to be and besides, the Saturday puzzle would be much harder? Well, they don’t pay me the medium-sized bucks for nothing. Today’s puzzle by Samuel A. Donaldson and Brad Wilber is a real ... let’s just call it a learning experience, O.K.?

The bottom line on this very worthy puzzle: It’s tough, but it’s not tougher than you. Forget the horse-drawn carriage at 15A and the sainted archbishop of Canterbury at 19A for a second and drop in REID for TARA of the “Sharknado” films. There is no shame in knowing that. It will help you get the crossings. Maybe. If you know that Adobe makes the software that creates PDFs, put that in at 27A. Now you’ve got _ _ _ _ RP at 1D, which is a musical note. That’s got to be a SHARP note, right? Fill that in to help you get started on the northwest. You can come back for the first letter later. Now continue on like that until you get your toehold.

As tough as it is, it is also as close to a perfect Saturday crossword as they come. The grid is pristine, even if you are not familiar with some of the answers. The entries fluctuate between highly entertaining (HOSTESS TWINKIES) and hard to reach without help (IMARETS, which I feel like I should have known), but each of them are exquisite gems and they are all clued nearly perfectly. It just may take some reliance on outside references. The cluing is ramped up to 11, as evidenced, for one, by “Jet launcher” for GEYSER. That Kellogg brand at 40A is EGGO, of course.

Kudos to Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Wilber for debuting seven fabulous entries, the best of which, in my opinion, is COSMIC JOKE.

Theorizing about changing monetary policy is far easier than acting on it and academics who become policymakers often adopt a more pragmatic approach.
Mr. Taylor, speaking earlier this month at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, suggested he might embrace that tradition.","Mr. Powell, who joined the Fed in 2012, has generally supported the Fed’s expansive efforts to stimulate growth. Analysts regard him as likely to continue the Fed’s gradual unwinding of that campaign, although perhaps pressing to raise interest rates a little more quickly.

“Our view is Powell is the G.O.P. version of Yellen, with the added kicker of wanting to reduce regulation,” said Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at RBC Capital Markets. He said Mr. Powell was “the easy choice if you want to maintain continuity.”

But some Republicans in Congress and some of Mr. Trump’s advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, want to overhaul the central bank, beginning right at the top.

Mr. Taylor has been one of the Fed’s most outspoken critics in recent years, repeatedly arguing that its stimulus campaign has done little good, considerable harm and should be ended as soon as possible. He also advocates structural reforms to prevent a repeat.

He says the Fed helped to cause the 2008 financial crisis and then impeded recovery. “One clear lesson from this historical experience is that the Fed should normalize policy and get back to the kind of policy that worked well in the past,” he said in March.

Mr. Taylor’s signature proposal is that the central bank should adopt a policy rule — a mathematical formula to guide the movement of its benchmark rate. Mr. Taylor, who developed the first such rule in the early 1990s, argues that this would make monetary policy more predictable and thus more effective.

Because such rules are calibrated in normal times, that approach could have curtailed the Fed’s stimulus campaign. Mr. Taylor’s rule, for example, suggests the Fed by now should have raised its benchmark rate to around 3.5 percent. The rate currently sits between 1 percent and 1.25 percent.

Mr. Powell, along with most Fed officials, argues that policy rules are useful benchmarks, but human judgment is indispensable. “Simple policy rules are widely thought to be both interesting and useful, but to represent only a small part of the analysis needed to assess the appropriate path for policy,” he said in February. “I am unable to think of any critical, complex human activity that could be safely reduced to a simple summary equation.”

Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Fed, estimated last year that if the Fed had followed Mr. Taylor’s rule, 2.5 million more Americans would still have been unemployed, “enough to fill all 31 N.F.L. stadiums at the same time.”

Mr. Taylor also favors restraints on other aspects of the Fed’s post-crisis response, including the bond-buying campaign it undertook known as quantitative easing.

Mr. Taylor warned repeatedly at the time that the purchases would result in inflation. “We’ve got a high inflation down the road for sure,” he said in June 2010. “When it will come, I can’t predict. But unless there’s a change in policy we’re going to have inflation like back in the 1970s, or even more.”

Instead, inflation has been persistently sluggish.

Mr. Taylor has since argued the purchases did no good and that the Fed should be restricted from buying mortgage bonds, because that provides support for a particular kind of borrowing — a decision that belongs to fiscal policymakers.

He also wants to reverse a recent change in the mechanics of monetary policy. The Fed bought bonds from banks by increasing the reserves those banks hold at the Fed. That surge in reserve balances made it impossible to raise rates by limiting the availability of reserves, the traditional method, so instead the Fed paid banks not to use the reserves.

Mr. Taylor wants the Fed to revert to the minimalist mechanics.

Mr. Powell, by contrast, has defended the utility of the bond-buying campaign and argued that the new mechanics allow the Fed to control interest rates more effectively.

Theorizing about changing monetary policy is far easier than acting on it and academics who become policymakers often adopt a more pragmatic approach. Ben S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, argued in the early 2000s that Japan should consider drastic actions to revive inflation. When he confronted weak inflation as Fed chairman, he did not attempt to pursue those policies.

Mr. Taylor, speaking earlier this month at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, suggested he might embrace that tradition. “I don’t think of policy rules as tying central bankers’ hands,” he said. “I’ve never thought of rules as tying central bankers’ hands. To me, they are ways of making monetary policy better.”

Mr. Taylor also could find himself constrained by the Federal Open Market Committee, the group that sets Fed policy. As chairman he would set the committee agenda and run its meetings. Importantly, he would also direct the work of the Fed’s staff, which produces the forecasts and background materials that undergird policy decisions.

Still, Mr. Trump has an opportunity to markedly reshape the Fed. There are currently just four members of the seven-member board, including Ms. Yellen and Mr. Powell. Mr. Trump’s first pick for the board, Randal K. Quarles, the Fed’s vice chairman of supervision, has expressed support for Mr. Taylor’s approach to monetary policy. The remaining member, Lael Brainard, whose term expires in 2026, has said the Fed should take a cautious approach to raising rates.

Still, five regional presidents also vote at each policy meeting, which would help blunt any rapid change in approach.

“There’s a lot of continuity at the Fed,” John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a recent interview. “None of us are going anywhere, meaning the presidents. We have a deep bench of very professional staff and so I think that the idea that suddenly the Fed turns on a dime if certain positions change is not really accurate. It’s a consensus-driven organization.”",Trump’s Fed Finalists Offer a Clear Choice: Status Quo or Significant Change,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/trump-fed-powell-taylor-yellen.html

Between June and August this year, it was exceptionally hot and dry across southern Europe. In Spain, temperatures soared above 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) in July. In Italy, rainfall was 30 percent below normal levels — and in parts of the country, much lower still.

Scientists with the World Weather Attribution program, a group dedicated to the study of extreme weather, concluded last month that the “the chances of seeing a summer as hot as 2017” had increased tenfold since the early 1900s, and the chances of a heat wave like the one that hit the region for three days in August, nicknamed Lucifer, had risen by four times.

“We found a very clear global warming fossil fuel fingerprint,” said Heidi Cullen, a climatologist who heads the program.

Ask Italian olive growers about the weather this year and you hear a wide range of answers. It rained on one hill. It didn’t rain on the neighboring one. One olive variety made it through the heat; another didn’t. Even in one orchard, one tree hung heavy with fruit; another barely had any.

Many said they would have to invest in irrigation. The one upside of the heat, they all said, was that the olive fly withered, too.

On an unseasonably warm Monday in October, Ms. Contini Bonacossi and her brother, Filippo, took me through their family estate, known as Capezzana, in the hills northwest of Florence. Here and there, tiny, dried-up olives lay on the ground. A few trees were bare. But many were drooping with fruit: fat, purple-green olives, the sight of which made Filippo exceedingly happy.

“He is very excited,” Ms. Contini Bonacossi said of her brother. She was less so. Capezzana would produce 20 percent less oil this year; as Capezzana’s sales chief, she would have to ration it out to her loyal customers.

Ms. Guidobaldi, for her part, was taking no chances. She started harvesting in late September, the earliest ever on the estate. It was still scorching hot. What if a freakish storm came and knocked the olives down?

“Bellissimo,” she said, caressing the olives she had saved. “I don’t have children. These are my children. You can’t just ignore them one year and then come back the next year and everything is O.K.”

On the southern edge of Tuscany, in a valley of scraggly oak, Riccardo Micheli didn’t have the luxury of saving his trees with water trucks.

Unlike Ms. Guidobaldi’s conventional farm, Mr. Micheli ran his, the Agricola Nuova Casenovole, according to biodynamic principles: he used no pesticides and left much of his land to wilderness.

‘It is cruelty.’ Some of the most impressive teenagers I’ve ever met came from a program called Leda, which identifies academic superstars from low-income families. One of Leda’s superstars is named Viviana Andazola Marquez, whose college essay was featured in The Times in 2014 and who’s now a senior at Yale.

On Oct. 12, her father, Melecio Andazola Morales, had an appointment at a federal immigration office in Denver. He believed it was the last step in the process to earn his green card. Instead, agents detained him, and he now faces deportation.

“We filed the correct paperwork, paid the fees and lined up all his references, only for my dad to be dragged out of a little office and locked up,” Viviana writes in today’s Times. “What happened to him is not an appropriate application of the law — it is cruelty.”

You can read more about Melecio’s case in this Denver Post story or at this GoFundMe page.

Our driverless future. Many responses to my column on driverless cars focused on their potential benefits for the elderly and disabled. It’s an excellent point, and one I did not make in the column.

“They could be a godsend for disabled and elderly drivers who, lacking decent public transportation options, sometimes continue to drive even if they are not really able to control a heavy, complex, potentially life-threatening piece of machinery,” wrote Lawyermom, in the column’s comments section.

Another commenter wrote: “I love to drive, but doggone it, at 66 I worry that my reactions aren’t sharp and I know my eyes, even with glasses, aren’t as good as they used to be. And the headlights at night cause me no end of concern. I’m an aging boomer, and there’s a lot of us, and I know darned well I’m not the only boomer having these problems.”

What happened to him is not an appropriate application of the law — it is cruelty. It’s not just my dad’s story. Under President Trump, every undocumented person living in the United States is a target, a deportation priority. This is a grave national security mistake. As this administration creates more distrust and fear in our communities, it is not encouraging people to be honest with law enforcement agents. Undocumented people want to cooperate with the law, but there is no path for them to do so without jeopardy of detainment or removal.

So many families like mine are threatened by a deeply flawed immigration system in the United States, which is basically enforced in an ad hoc manner.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said.
Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls.
“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said.
“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said.","Having spent 15 years photographing child marriages around the world, Stephanie Sinclair is uniquely positioned to understand its lasting impact on communities and, especially, on the girls who were forced to wed against their will. “You can’t expect individuals who have been through significant abuse to just act normal as soon as they get out of that situation,” she said. “They need to be nurtured, to be given the time and the tools to heal.”

With this in mind, Ms. Sinclair last year started the Tehani Photo Workshop — named after an 8-year-old Yemeni bride — in partnership with the Samburu Girls Foundation. The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said. Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls. “The independence that comes with a such a career, the knowledge you acquire through meeting other people, and the freedom the camera gives you to express yourself can’t be underplayed,” she said. “Instinctively, I knew that a photo workshop could nurture the girls in a unique way.”

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

Bad news, bears. Hibernation is no longer the coolest thing animals do to survive the winter.

As cold weather approaches, tiny mole-like creatures known as red-toothed shrews will shrink their own heads, reducing their skull and brain mass by as much as 20 percent, according to new research published Monday in Current Biology. When warm weather returns, they will regrow the region nearly to its original size, giving new meaning to the phrase “spring ahead.”

Though it is not yet clear why the shrews go down a few sizes for the winter, the authors of the study speculate that the reduced head and brain size helps them conserve energy when resources are scarce.

“These tiny mammals cannot migrate long distances to avoid winter, nor can they enter any kind of energy-saving state” like hibernation, said Javier Lazaro, a doctoral student at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany and an author of the study. They also have high metabolic rates and very little fat stored in their bodies. “Therefore, they starve within a few hours if they do not hunt constantly.”

The researchers say the shrinkage is a survival strategy.

“Brain tissue is energetically very expensive, so reducing overall brain size might decrease energy demands and thus food requirements,” he said.

Since the congress’s 2,300 delegates are carefully chosen for loyalty, very few oppose changes once they are proposed by the leadership.

What do these changes really mean?

A key phrase here is “new era,” one that Mr. Xi has used throughout the congress, which began last week. Mr. Xi has described Chinese history since 1949 as divided into two eras: the three decades after Mao seized power in a revolution that established a unified People’s Republic and ended nearly a century of civil war and foreign invasions, and the three decades after Deng took power in 1978 and refocused China on developing its economy.

Mr. Xi has signaled he is launching China into a new, third era. In his report to the congress, Mr. Xi suggested that if Mao made China independent, and Deng made it prosperous, he would make it strong again. Restoring China to greatness is a central message of “Xi Jinping Thought,” and a goal that has already guided Mr. Xi’s policies of building up the military, strengthening domestic controls and raising China’s profile in global affairs.

To underline that point, the congress also added a second mention of Mr. Xi’s ideas to the constitution: his call to modernize and strengthen China’s armed forces.

By enshrining Mr. Xi’s ideas as “a new component of the party’s guide for action,” the party is putting Mr. Xi on a doctrinal pedestal alongside Mao and Deng. Until Tuesday, those were the only two Chinese leaders whose names appeared in the constitution’s list of fundamental doctrines, which mentions “Mao Zedong Thought” and “Deng Xiaoping Theory.” Adding Mr. Xi by name also raises him above his two most recent predecessors, the former presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao: Their ideas are on the list of doctrines, but not their names.

In the near future, Chinese people are likely to refer to Mr. Xi’s doctrine of a reinvigorated China as simply “Xi Jinping Thought,” a flattering echo of “Mao Zedong Thought.”

Photo

Does this mean Mr. Xi is as powerful as Mao was in his day?

It’s not that simple. After he came to power in 2012, Mr. Xi surprised many people with how quickly and forcefully he asserted control. This included putting his imprint on two of China’s most powerful institutions, the party and the military, which he did using a sweeping anticorruption drive.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But the basis of his rule is different from Mao’s, and even Deng’s. Both of those leaders were founders of the People’s Republic, and hardened revolutionaries whose decades of fighting and self-sacrifice gave them a charisma and authority that Mr. Xi simply cannot replicate. For all his power, Mr. Xi does not have the almost godlike presence that Mao once had.

On the other hand, the Chinese economy, state and military are much more powerful now than they were under Mao, or even under Deng, which gives Mr. Xi far more global clout than his predecessors.

What other decisions did the party congress make?

The congress finished on Tuesday with several other major steps. Most important, the delegates voted in a new Central Committee, a council of 204 senior central and local officials who usually meet once a year to approve broad policy priorities.

There was a notable absence on that list: Wang Qishan.

Mr. Wang, 69, was the enforcer in Mr. Xi’s drive to root out corruption and strengthen discipline in the party. He has passed the usual retirement age for the committee, but party insiders had said that Mr. Xi might try to keep him in a senior position. His absence from the list means he will probably retire.

Photo

How will changing the party constitution affect how China is run?

Mr. Xi’s vision of a resurgent China will now permeate all party indoctrination in schools, the media and government agencies. With the conclusion of the congress, the party and the Chinese news media will begin a national drive to promote its decisions, and especially the elevation of Mr. Xi.

But many Chinese people will also closely watch the announcement on Wednesday of new members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the party’s top rung of power, for signs of how far Mr. Xi can get his way in promoting political allies. That will be a sign of how much power he really has behind the welter of propaganda.",China Enshrines ‘Xi Jinping Thought.’ What Does That Mean?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-constitution.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

The editors, who started brainstorming in April, eventually whittled the list down to seven “greats”: Mr. Sondheim, the singer Nicki Minaj, the designer Dries van Noten, the writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the artist Claes Oldenburg, the actress Amy Adams and the director Park Chan-wook. They paired these figures with writers and photographers who would provide a unique perspective. Lin-Manuel Miranda interviewed Stephen Sondheim; Roxane Gay wrote on Nicki Minaj; and Dave Eggers profiled Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

But perhaps most unusual for a celebrity profile, the goal was not to pry into the private lives of these individuals. “I think our writers don’t make the mistake of thinking they are getting to the heart of anything,” Ms. Yanagihara said. “It’s more about answering the question of, ‘Why is this person so moving to me?’ ”

By pairing the subjects with fellow leaders in their field, T’s editors hoped to give readers a unique perspective on how both approach their work, and on how they think about each other’s contributions. (Mr. Miranda first met Mr. Sondheim when the playwright spoke to his high school class.)

This approach offered artists and intellectuals an opportunity to engage in larger cultural conversations within the pages of the magazine. For example, the artist Carrie Mae Weems — who penned a letter to Michelle Obama for last year’s Greats issue — photographed Ms. Adichie. “Weems’s work deals with issues of gender and race, so we thought it would be interesting to see how she would envision Chimamanda,” explains Nadia Vellam, T’s photo editor. “I liked the idea of having two women from two different cultures living in America connect through shared experiences.”

The issue also offers a different view of Ms. Minaj. Patrick Demarchelier’s photographs for her cover story reveal an unadorned side of the singer, and Ms. Gay had a similar goal: to present a neglected aspect of her subject. “I was thinking about the many sides of Nicki Minaj — the rapper, the fashionista, the woman whose love life is often tabloid fodder, the businesswoman,” Ms. Gay said. “We generally only see one or two sides of her discussed, instead of the whole package.”

On Thursday in New York, a number of those involved in the issue, including Ms. Adams, Mr. Miranda and Mr. Van Noten, gathered for a celebration. Ms. Minaj addressed a beaming assemblage of students from the Stagedoor Manor performing-arts camp, who were there to perform a medley of Sondheim tunes, and brought the theme of the issue full circle.

“You are doing what you’re supposed to be doing — chasing your dreams,” she said. “Don’t let anyone tell you that you’re not amazing. You’re epic. You’re Great.”

Mumler.

Mumler, Manseau’s protagonist, is one of my favorite characters in the literature of the era. He took some of the most compelling spirit photographs of the 1860s that subjects swore contained images of their late beloved. The photos are compelling because of their weirdness; compelling because we, too, are almost seduced by the spirit images in them. We know that he was a fraud, but we don’t know what kind of fraud. Self-deceived true believer, confidence man or a blend of both? And the persistent mystery is, of course, how Mumler created these photographs. Do I believe in spirit photography? I blushingly confess I do not. I do not believe that spirits are recorded on photographic plates. But if we grant that this phenomenon does not result from some paranormal process, then how do we explain it? And how did Mumler keep his method hidden from the many witnesses and onlookers who hoped to expose him?

The trial of William Mumler, liberally excerpted in Part III of the book, is a landmark in the histories of photography and of America. It all started when the Irish immigrant and ardent Catholic Patrick V. Hickey encountered Mumler and his photographs at a meeting of the Photographic Section of the American Institute, held at New York’s Cooper Union. Suspicious of Mumler’s heretical trade, he visited him at his studio the following day. Hickey remained unconvinced about the verity of Mumler’s art, and went to the city marshal’s office to file a grievance. Marshal Joseph Tooker, Mayor A. Oakley Hall’s “confidant and crony,” took the case, visiting Mumler’s studio under the alias William Wallace and arresting Mumler after Tooker failed to recognize the apparition who appeared with him in Mumler’s photograph. A battle between science and spirituality, the case reads as a forerunner of the Scopes trial. On one hand, we could simply call it a foregone conclusion: There are no spirits, hence there are no spirit photographs. If, however, you refrain from that assumption, the debate becomes much stickier. What do you do when a desire to believe overwhelms common sense and a preponderance of evidence? Experts presented seven techniques Mumler might have used in faking his photographs, then other experts attested that they had seen Mumler using none of them.

The trial featured an array of extraordinary characters like Elbridge T. Gerry, Abraham Bogardus and Jeremiah Gurney. But in the end, it was P.T. Barnum whose testimony about “humbugs” may have saved Mumler from further incarceration and obloquy (not that he didn’t suffer his fair share of the latter anyway). Barnum’s equivocation about which came first, seeing or believing, cinched the deal for Mumler’s acquittal. Manseau takes us inside the judge’s head immediately after Barnum’s testimony. “‘However I might believe that trick and deception has been practiced by the prisoner, as I sit here in my capacity of magistrate, I am compelled to decide,’ he added with a note of resignation, ‘that the prosecution has failed to prove the case.’”

Manseau has created an exceptional story of how photography intersects with the hope that some heretofore unexplored scientific process will reveal something about the nature of man and our limitations. It is one of the persistent myths of mankind that death isn’t final — that photography, which transcends time and space, can show a way around death.

Several great moments in American history are mentioned casually, but we still feel their importance. There’s the account of then-senator Abraham Lincoln selecting Brady to be his portraitist for the 1860 election. “Lincoln did not look much like a statesman as he stood in Brady’s posing room. The photographer drew up Lincoln’s collar to shorten the appearance of his neck, and determined that he could put his artists to work taming Lincoln’s hair after the image had been developed. They also might smooth the crags in his face — whatever might be done to make him appear more presidential. As a final touch, Brady placed Lincoln’s hand on a book, as if the senator were already taking the oath of office.” Thereafter, Brady persuaded Mary Todd Lincoln to be photographed in March 1861. “Mrs. Lincoln thought she looked too stern and matronly, and that her hands were too big. As he had with her husband, Brady posed his nervous subject, finding the best possible angle with which to display her profile. He then carefully arranged her hands to seem more dainty.” The result of all these artistic adjustments was immensely pleasing to the future first lady. “Half fantasy, half reality, it was one of her favorite photographs of herself.” Perhaps most photography fits this description.

I tracked down the source of Manseau’s Kafka epigraph, that line characterizing photography as a tool of misrepresentation and tergiversation. It’s in Gustav Janouch’s “Conversations With Kafka,” and the full exchange tells a different story. “The drawing is wonderful. It is full of truth,” Kafka repeats again and again. Janouch, his interlocutor, asks: “Do you mean that it is true to life as a photograph is?” Kafka replies: “What are you thinking of? Nothing can be so deceiving as a photograph. Truth, after all, is an affair of the heart. One can get at it only through art.” Needless to say, I prefer Manseau’s abbreviated version. It more accurately expresses my own sympathies with respect to photography.",The Man Who Photographed Ghosts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/books/review/apparitionists-peter-manseau-william-mumler-biography.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The core organizers plan to reach out to a group of roughly 100 black executives, lawyers and other professionals who attended the July dinner. They have mutual friends. They meet socially in places like East Hampton, N.Y., and Kiawah Island, S.C. They attend the same charitable functions, like the annual fund-raising dinner in New York City for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

The group has been increasingly stepping into the national debate about race and inequality. Two years ago, it funded screenings so that 320,000 students across the country could see “Selma,” the movie about a crucial moment in civil rights history. After the police shootings of black people in Ferguson, Mo., and other cities, the group raised $1 million in 48 hours to fund a police reform initiative. And in August, it supported Kenneth C. Frazier, the chief executive of Merck and a member of the extended network, after President Trump criticized him.

“We have now entered more the ranks of corporate America with the financial wherewithal, with the thought leadership, to now engage around the issues,” said Ms. Smalls, who while growing up in South Carolina in the 1960s watched her parents help organize get-out-the-vote rallies and fight for equality in local schools.

The election last November, Ms. Smalls said, was an “inflection point.” The question now, she said, is “defining a narrative, politically, that matters to our community.”

The ranks of black senior executives remains small. In 2001, when Kenneth I. Chenault was named to the top job at American Express, just one other black chief executive was running a Fortune 500 company, Franklin D. Raines of Fannie Mae. On this year’s list, Mr. Chenault, who is preparing to step down after a 16-year tenure, was one of four.

While black business leaders have long used their money and influence, they have often worked individually behind the scenes. Still, many have proven adept at mobilizing money and support for causes dear to them.

Mr. Chenault is a prime example. In September, he hosted a dinner at his apartment for Cashmere Nicole, who founded an online cosmetics company, Beauty Bakerie, with her own money. Mr. Chenault, Infor’s Mr. Phillips, Lazard’s Mr. Lewis and Adebayo Ogunlesi, a private equity executive who is Goldman Sachs’s lead director, all provided seed capital for the company.

The shift from an informal network to a more organized effort was marked in 2015 by an appeal by Mr. Lewis.

Early that year, he sent an email to friends and fellow executives, asking if they’d like to pool funds to sponsor student tickets to “Selma.” After seeing the film, “I walked out of the theater with my wife and said, ‘Every New York City eighth grader should see this movie,’” Mr. Lewis recalled in an interview at the time. They raised more than $2 million and funded screenings in about 30 cities.

Early in 2017, some of the same executives funded student screenings of “Hidden Figures,” which told the story of three female black mathematicians who worked for NASA during the 1960s. They paid for 63,000 students to see the movie in 25 different places, including Britain and Nigeria.

A focus on police reforms took shape after a white police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson during the summer of 2014. That deadly encounter, and similar ones, sparked nationwide protests.

The next July, a handful of executives were at a charity dinner, and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund came up. Its president, Sherrilyn Ifill, was being inundated with requests to provide legal work and organize assistance in embattled communities. Tapping the informal network of friends and associates, the group quickly collected $1 million.

“This group provided key support that enabled us to be influential at a critical time when we saw a window was open,” Ms. Ifill said.

During that period, Mr. Phillips, Ms. Ifill and Raymond J. McGuire, the head of corporate and investment banking at Citigroup, met with officials at the New York Police Department to talk about the agency’s attempts to improve relations with the black community. In a series of meetings, they discussed neighborhood policing plans, community meetings and changes in police discipline procedures, tracking data on the department’s progress as new steps were taken. Mr. Phillips and Mr. McGuire later joined the board of trustees of the New York City Police Foundation.

Members of the group are also taking more public stands. In August, Mr. Frazier, the Merck chief executive, resigned from the president’s manufacturing council after Mr. Trump failed to directly condemn the white nationalists involved in the violent protest in Charlottesville, Va. The president then criticized Mr. Frazier, accusing him on Twitter of charging “ripoff drug prices.”

Mr. Frazier’s inbox was soon filled with supportive emails. Edith Cooper, the head of human capital management at Goldman Sachs, spoke out on LinkedIn, saying she was “outraged and frightened by what took place in Charlottesville and by President Trump’s response.”

Through a spokeswoman, both Mr. Frazier and Ms. Cooper declined to comment.

Since the July dinner at Topping Rose House in Bridgehampton, the PAC’s organizers have been trying to work out their priorities and their differences.

Some likely donors in the broader network want to see dedicated staff and a clearly defined action plan before they get involved. Others question whether a PAC that doesn’t support a particular party can make a difference.

The organizers have consulted with Mr. Kirk about the best legal structure. They met with senior black politicians and set up brainstorming sessions with think tanks in Washington.

Mr. Coles of Yumanity Therapeutics and his wife, Robyn, held an event at their Kiawah Island home, where Senator Tim Scott, a Republican, and Representative James E. Clyburn, a Democrat, mingled with some of their friends. The conversation focused partly on education and work options for the state’s younger generation.

“As African Americans have advanced in business, and assumed important positions across the board,” Mr. Coles said, “I think we are finding our way to adding to or extending what many of our forebears have done. And in a sense, it’s our turn now, to contribute to this kind of leadership.”","Black Executives Join Forces, Forming a PAC to Back Them Up",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/business/black-executives-pac.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

And sure enough, the females lay the eggs in a relatively dry spot in the rain forest, and once the embryos reach tadpole stage, the males load them on their backs and take off.

Andrius Pasukonis, a researcher associated with the University of Vienna and Harvard University, has been studying these frogs in the rain forest of French Guiana to learn how the males find the pools and what triggers this complicated act of tadpole transport. He and Kristina Beck, a graduate student at the University of Vienna, and others, determined in one project that the frogs don’t search for pools but return directly to pools they know.

He and his colleagues also found that they could trigger the complex behavior of tadpole transport simply by putting tadpoles on a frog’s back. The tadpoles could come from any frog at all. And the method worked just as well with females as males. That was a surprise, because in nature females only carry tadpoles if the male has disappeared, and then they will only carry tadpoles from the exact spot where they laid their eggs.

As a candidate, Donald Trump promised regular people, “I will be your voice,” and attacked the drug industry for “getting away with murder” in setting high prices for lifesaving medications. But as president, he has declared war on regulatory programs protecting the health, safety and economic rights of consumers. He has done so in disregard of evidence that such protections help the economy and financial well-being of the working-class voters he claims to champion.

Already his aggressive actions exceed those of the Reagan administration in returning the country to the “Let the buyer beware” days of the 1950s.

Though Mr. Trump is brazen in his opposition to consumer protections, many of his most damaging attacks are occurring in corners of the bureaucracy that receive minimal news coverage. His administration, for instance, wants to strip the elderly of their right to challenge nursing home abuses in court by allowing arbitration clauses in nursing home contracts. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has announced that it is canceling a proposed rule intended to reduce the risk of sleep apnea-related accidents among truck drivers and railway workers.

And the Environmental Protection Agency is busy weakening, repealing and under-enforcing protections, including for children, from toxic exposure. Scott Pruitt, the director, went against his agency’s scientists to jettison an imminent ban on the use of chlorpyrifos, an insecticide widely used on vegetables and fruits. Long-accumulated evidence shows that the chemical is poisoning the drinking water of farm workers and their families.

But here are some tips from design and color experts on how to use dark colors without becoming overwhelmed — or claustrophobic.

START SMALL If you’re nervous about playing with a deep, dark hue, “limit the color to the inside of cabinets, backs of bookshelves or a painted floor,” said Donald Kaufman, who owns the paint company Donald Kaufman Color with his wife, Taffy Dahl. “Dark, bold windows often bring the outside in.”

Ms. Studholme, of Farrow & Ball, suggested starting with a contained space like a powder room, the underside of a claw-foot tub or a hallway. “When you arrive, it creates a sense of drama,” she said. “You come through and go, ‘Wow.’” An added bonus, she noted: “A dark color in the hall makes the rooms off the hall feel really big and light.”

Ellen O’Neill, director of strategic design intelligence for Benjamin Moore, recommends starting with a focal point, like a fireplace mantel or the inside of shelves or drawers. “I recently photographed a home where the owner painted the inside of the drawers of an antique Chippendale chest a rich aubergine,” she said. “What a color surprise every time you open a drawer.” And as you become more confident, she said, “you can graduate to painting doors to a room or hallway, window trim or wainscoting.”

TEST IT OUT When you’re ready to tackle a whole room, “start with a color family that is already dominant in the home and select two to three shades that you feel makes a statement,” Ms. O’Neill said. “I’d get quarts of each color and paint large swatches of each, one set next to a window and one set in a corner. Observe how the room’s lighting affects the colors three times a day.”

EMBRACE THE DARKNESS “A deep, rich color goes an especially long way in a room without a lot of natural light, as dim rooms look particularly dull in lighter colors,” said Frances Merrill, the founder of Reath Design in Los Angeles, who painted her children’s room Farrow & Ball’s Pigeon gray. “It makes the small space feel finished and gives definition to the ever-rotating collection of artwork.”

In the playroom, she used Templeton Gray from Benjamin Moore. “Every surface in this room is usually covered in a layer of Legos and half-finished science experiments,” she said. “I find that the deeper colors mask the chaos.”

“Conventional wisdom states that small spaces — especially those facing north — should be lightened to increase the sense of space,” said Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute consultancy. “However, painting trim a lighter color in an area painted with darker hues can actually increase the illusion of space,” she said, because it creates a “greater impression of height or width in the space.”

Whatever your situation, “it’s best to work with what you’ve got, rather than try to fight the light,” said Ms. Studholme of Farrow & Ball, which offers a guide to how light affects color on its website.

PREPARATION IS KEY “Before painting, ensure surfaces are sound, clean, dry and free from dirt, grease and any other contamination,” said Ms. Cosby of Farrow & Ball. “Always sand down surfaces to achieve a smooth base.”

And if you change your mind later, dark colors are just as easy to paint over as light ones, assuming you prep properly. “Start by priming over the bold hue, then apply two coats of the desired color,” said Ms. O’Neill of Benjamin Moore. But “be sure to allow the primer coat to dry completely before applying the first coat of color.”

GO HALFSIES To add “sophistication and spirit” to a client’s “stark, boxy, white rental,” Alex Kalita, a founder of Common Bond Design in Manhattan, painted the bottom half of the bedroom wall in Hague Blue from Farrow & Ball. She calls it “the chair-rail effect” and notes that it serves a few purposes: “It simulates architectural variation in otherwise uniform space; it ties in the building’s teal window frames; and it leverages the cozy, rich, complex and grown-up quality of Hague Blue, while maintaining the practical qualities of white paint, like the illusion of ceiling height.”

Another tip: “If you’re tempted to go dark and bold on the walls, but you prefer a restrained aesthetic, try keeping the furniture neutral,” Ms. Kalita said. “You can even make bulkier pieces recede by camouflaging them in the wall color. We had our client’s Wonk NYC dresser color-matched to Hague Blue, so that the piece could augment the client’s storage without competing for attention with the room’s more deliberate and sculptural design elements. Dark walls do a good job of visually absorbing things.”

FINALLY, BE BRAVE “I encourage people to be brave with color and unleash their inner artist,” said Ms. Eiseman of the Pantone Color Institute. “Experiment with color, have fun with it, allow yourself to live with it for a while. It is, after all, just one or two cans of paint. And when, and if, you tire of it, move on to another color and treat yourself to another creative exercise.”",Scared of Dark Paint?

They convince themselves that ‘this text is important,’” he said. “It’s something we need to be aware of.”

There is a dearth of data directly linking distracted walking to pedestrian injuries and deaths, but it seems to be a global problem, too. Preliminary studies “give a hint to unsafe behavior,” said Dr. Etienne Krug, director of the Department for Management of Noncommunicable Diseases, Disability, Violence and Injury Prevention at the World Health Organization.

People who text and walk, for example, are nearly four times as likely to engage in at least one dangerous action, like jaywalking or not looking both ways, and take 18 percent more time to cross a street than undistracted pedestrians. Solutions, Dr. Krug said, are “hard to legislate and even harder to enforce.”

A number of other cities have come up with creative ways to help protect so-called cellphone zombies, who talk, text, listen to music, check their email and even snap selfies. Initiatives include low-tech efforts, like edgy signs in Hayward, Calif. (“Heads Up! Cross the Street. Then Update Facebook.”) and no-selfie zones in Mumbai, and specially designed traffic lights in Europe and several pieces of legislation in reaction to Honolulu’s new law.

Last month, the Board of Supervisors in San Mateo County, Calif., unanimously passed a resolution prohibiting pedestrians’ use of cellphones while crossing streets. It’s not enforceable, as state law governs such issues, but David Canepa, who introduced the measure, said it was an important springboard; the resolution is expected to go to the California Legislature for statewide consideration in January.

“There is chaos in the crosswalks,” said Mr. Canepa, who admits to a few close calls with distracted driving and walking himself. “I know it’s an issue. I’ve lived it. My cellphone is my life.”

As children, he said, we are taught to look both ways when crossing a street, but “you can’t look both ways when you’re looking down and texting.”

Critics are concerned about personal freedom and slow to adjust to new ideas, Mr. Canepa said. “But at the end of the day, people understand the value of public safety,” he added. “This legislation is practical and is common sense. It will save lives.”

At least 10 states have debated similar legislation dealing with distracted pedestrians or bicyclists; none of it has passed, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Legislation is pending in two states, the group said, and in September, New York passed a law that directs New York City to study its efforts to educate the public on the dangers of distracted walking.

Municipal laws are not tracked, but Rexburg, Idaho, may have been among the first to adopt a citywide ban, in 2011. The city recorded five pedestrian deaths in a short period in a concentrated area. It was a high toll, given the city’s size: about 35,000 residents.

“It was a shock to our system,” said Stephen Zollinger, Rexburg’s city attorney.

Distracted walking was suspected. Along with other safety measures, Rexburg barred pedestrians from using hand-held devices — except while talking — while crossing public streets, he said, and “we’ve not had a pedestrian fatality since.”

Bodegraven, a small town near Amsterdam, tried a different approach. This year, it embedded LED-illuminated strips in the crosswalk at a busy intersection — right in the line of sight of people staring at their phones. When the traffic lights turn red or green, so do the lights at ground level, alerting pedestrians when it’s safe to cross.

The pilot program aims to anticipate trends, not reverse them, said Dolf Roodenburg, the project leader and a traffic engineer in the Netherlands. If it’s successful, the town hopes to install the lights at more intersections and on bike paths, and offer them to other cities.

In Augsburg, Germany, similar lights were installed last year after a teenager using her smartphone was struck and seriously injured by a tram when she walked onto the tracks.

There are, of course, contrary points of view on the effectiveness of legislating pedestrian behavior.

Janette Sadik-Khan, a former commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation and now transportation principal at Bloomberg Associates, which advises mayors around the world, said laws against texting and walking were not the answer. They have no basis in any research, are poorly conceived and distract from the road design and driver behavior issues that are responsible for most crashes, she said.

“It’s an easy way out. Engineering is a lot more difficult, but a lot more efficient,” Ms. Sadik-Khan said. “Traffic safety is very serious business in government, based in sound analysis.”

She and others recommended focusing on proven strategies like vehicle speed reduction, which is one of the most effective ways to reduce deaths, as survival rates are higher in low-speed collisions.

Vehicle design can also help. “In some countries, cars are designed to be more forgiving to pedestrians,” said Deborah A. P. Hersman, president and chief executive of the National Safety Council. Making bumpers softer and modifying the front ends of vehicles can reduce the severity of a pedestrian impact, but only 44 countries, mostly in Europe, require manufacturers to apply these protections, according to the W.H.O. The United States is not among them.

Rochelle Sobel, founder of the Association for Safe International Road Travel, a nonprofit group, said it was important for Americans traveling abroad to learn the local road culture. In the Dominican Republic, pedestrians do not have the right of way, and in some countries, drivers routinely ignore traffic regulations.

For example, they may fail to stop at intersections or red lights, Ms. Sobel said. In many low- and middle-income countries, where about 90 percent of the world’s road-traffic deaths occur, according to the W.H.O., pedestrians often share poorly maintained roads with animals, carts, cars, buses and trucks. Those roads are already high-risk environments not designed for walking, Ms. Sobel said.

Ms. Hersman, who previously served as chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said concerns about government overreach often lessened with time. Laws requiring seatbelt use or restricting smoking initially met resistance but now are widely accepted.

“It’s important to have an open mind,” she said. “Society can move forward.”

Mr. Massey of Synaxis said it would take some convincing for people to see value in laws to combat distracted walking.

“I agree in principle — begrudgingly,” he said. “It’s a bit Big Brotherish. We don’t like that in this country.”

European efforts are more realistic, Mr. Massey added. “I think the lights are brilliant,” he said. “It reflects an understanding of human nature: People are going to do it anyway, so let’s make it safer.”","Reading This While Walking?

Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said Mr. Weinstein denied all the allegations against Mr. Lombardo.
Mr. Lombardo said he first met Mr. Weinstein and his family in St. Barts.
Several years ago, Mr. Lombardo bumped into Mr. Weinstein on the ski slopes in Gstaad, Switzerland, prompting a reconciliation.
Earlier this year, Mr. Lombardo accompanied Mr. Weinstein to a private screening in Rome of the film “Perfect Strangers,” leading the Weinstein Company to buy the rights.","“That’s absolutely not true. I completely deny it. It’s false,” Mr. Lombardo said in another interview in his lawyer’s office in Rome, a city where he said he had done great work bringing movies and a lot of money to Miramax.

He said he was “shocked” by the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, though he reserved judgment on the validity of the accusations.

“This is something that nobody knows, except the people in the place where it happened,” he said. “A man wouldn’t tell this story. So how do I know? You see what I mean? I don’t think anybody knows except the people in the room.”

At the height of Mr. Weinstein’s power, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, unease about Mr. Lombardo’s role in the company was so great that Mr. Weinstein attempted to allay concerns, according to Elizabeth Dreyer, a senior executive who was in charge of international acquisitions at the time.

But Ms. Dreyer said Mr. Weinstein’s denial to his senior international staff at a meeting she attended did not entirely dispel suspicions inside the company.

Years earlier, Ms. Dreyer had worked in Miramax’s New York office and was responsible for reserving hotel rooms for the Cannes Film Festival. She recalled requesting a room at the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc for Mr. Lombardo, and being told that he was barred because the owner said he “brings too many girls.”

“That was kind of an ‘ah-ha’ moment for me,” she said, recalling thinking, “I get what Fabrizio is about now. I get the relationship.”

Mr. Lombardo said that neither he nor Mr. Weinstein was ever barred from the hotel. (The hotel manager at the time would not comment.) Mr. Lombardo attributed the criticisms to people within the company who were “envious” of his relationship with Mr. Weinstein.

“They have to find a reason for their failure” he said, adding that it was not his fault what took place behind closed hotel room doors. “You can’t hold responsible the person who from the lobby shows the room.”

But some of the women are eager to take Mr. Weinstein, and his alleged facilitators, to task.

One of Mr. Weinstein’s accusers, Asia Argento, an Italian actress, received what she considered threatening messages on her telephone from Mr. Lombardo, whom she said she hadn’t heard from in years.

“I’m scared to death,” Ms. Argento told a reporter by phone the morning after receiving the image on Oct. 3 of an anonymous couple passed out on a bed with the words, “Have You Ever Been This Drunk.” “Why is he sending me this?” she said.

Mr. Lombardo acknowledged he had sent what he called the “funny videos,” but argued he sent them to her — on two separate days — as part of a mass forwarding by “mistake.” He expressed regret that Ms. Argento felt threatened and he conceded that “the timing was terrible.”

Ms. Argento subsequently went public in The New Yorker with her account of sexual harassment by Mr. Weinstein, and she has since named Mr. Lombardo as the person who brought her to Mr. Weinstein’s room in 1997 under the false pretense of attending a party.

Another woman, Zoë Brock, has accused Mr. Lombardo of accompanying her into Mr. Weinstein’s Cannes hotel room in 1998 under the pretense that friends would be joining them to continue a party.

Ms. Brock, a former model, said in a phone interview that Mr. Lombardo had excused himself to leave her alone with Mr. Weinstein, who, behind closed doors, stripped naked and chased her around the room.

“It was a total set up. He knew,” Ms. Brock said, referring to Mr. Lombardo.

Mr. Lombardo denied both accounts. Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said Mr. Weinstein denied all the allegations against Mr. Lombardo.

“As the executive in charge of Rome and parts of Europe, Mr. Lombardo made contributions that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues for the company,” she said.

Before Mr. Lombardo befriended actors and dated movie stars, he was the son of engineers in the northern Italian town of Novara.

He learned English in London and French in Paris, where he first put his early passion for real estate into practice and entered the orbit of Jean-Luc Brunel, a powerful modeling agent in the 1980s.

“He was one of the boys hanging around Jean-Luc,” said Renée Toft Simonsen, a top model at the time, who considered Mr. Lombardo “part of the system” of young men who hang around models and connect them with powerful people.

Mr. Brunel, who surfaced in news reports several years ago for his connection to Jeffrey Epstein, a Flordia billionaire convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, declined to comment.

Mr. Lombardo ended up as part of the moveable feast. Former models and Miramax executives recalled him as a handsome wingman of Italian soccer stars like his real-estate business partner Nicola Berti.

Mr. Lombardo said he first met Mr. Weinstein and his family in St. Barts. Ms. Hofmeister, speaking for Mr. Weinstein, said the two met during the making of the film “Pulp Fiction,” when Mr. Lombardo was dating the actress Uma Thurman.

Mr. Weinstein and his first wife dined at Mr. Lombardo’s West Village townhouse, and Mr. Lombardo said Mr. Weinstein’s office subsequently called him to help interpret during a meeting with the Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore.

But he said they mostly saw each other in Cannes and St. Barts, where, during a Weinstein family Christmas vacation, the mogul fell deathly ill with septicemia.

Mr. Lombardo arranged for a private plane to medevac Mr. Weinstein out and flew with him to New York, where Mr. Weinstein’s brother, Bob, waited with an ambulance.

“If he had waited another day in St. Barts he wouldn’t have survived,” Mr. Lombardo said.

His big break came, he said, when he brought Mr. Tornatore’s project, “Malèna,” to Mr. Weinstein who in 1999, despite the objections of some Miramax executives, asked Mr. Lombardo to lead Miramax Italy.

Ms. Dreyer, then overseeing Miramax’s Italy operations, said she received a call from her superiors urging her to use Mr. Lombardo in everything she did.

“I thought this was a way to legitimize his involvement in the company,” she said, adding that his responsibilities amounted to setting up meetings and translating.

In 2003, Mr. Weinstein served as the best man to Mr. Lombardo when he married Chiara Geronzi, the daughter of Cesare Geronzi, then chairman of the Capitalia bank.

But soon after, Miramax closed its Italian branch but the company was upset that Mr. Lombardo kept receiving payments, which he said protective Italian labor laws required.

An article in The New York Times in 2004 aired the company’s grievance, and Mr. Lombardo felt unfairly maligned and insufficiently defended by Mr. Weinstein.

“We had a little falling out,” he said.

Mr. Lombardo subsequently kept a lower profile, playing golf, raising a family and occasionally showing up for movie premieres with his wife.

Several years ago, Mr. Lombardo bumped into Mr. Weinstein on the ski slopes in Gstaad, Switzerland, prompting a reconciliation.

Earlier this year, Mr. Lombardo accompanied Mr. Weinstein to a private screening in Rome of the film “Perfect Strangers,” leading the Weinstein Company to buy the rights.

“I made it happen,” Mr. Lombardo said, adding that instead of a payment, he sought only an executive producer credit to demonstrate to his daughters that their father was once somebody in the film business.

The movie tells the tale of old friends who think they know each other, but they don’t.

“This film,” Mr. Weinstein told Variety in February, is about “what can happen when our addiction to phones and social media reveals our deepest secrets rather than letting people hide behind the public profiles they so skillfully create for themselves.”",Harvey Weinstein’s Italian Friend Is Now in the Eye of a Media Storm,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/world/europe/fabrizio-lombardo-harvey-weinstein-italy.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Ms. Soleimani and Mr.","Larger hotel chains, like Marriott or the Four Seasons Resorts, will typically refund any deposits in a disaster, but smaller businesses may not have funds to recoup. “If you book at a smaller hotel or bed-and-breakfast and they’re wiped out, whatever deposit you wired them is going to be very difficult to get back,” Ms. Gregoli said.

Insure Yourself

Weddings today can be as expensive as a car, sometimes even more, so protect your investment. Purchase wedding insurance. It isn’t very expensive, Ms. Gregoli said, but it may protect against any unexpected events. It starts at about $150 for a basic policy, but rates go up based on such things as location, the number of guests and whether the event is inside or outside in a tent. The total cost of the wedding will also affect the rate: A $10,000 even is going to carry a lower premium than one costing $150,000.

Insurance can offer peace of mind. For example, if the space you booked for your wedding is destroyed by a hurricane or fire, a good insurance policy will cover the costs of rescheduling and reimburse you for any lost deposits. (It will even cover things like losing the rings before the wedding or if a bride’s gown is lost in baggage.)

Find Out Who’s in Charge

If there is an extreme event — an act of terrorism, say, something weather-related, or a fire — don’t rely on hotel wedding planners. Often, the general manager will have clearer answers, Ms. Gregoli said.

One month after Hurricane Maria passed over Anguilla, Ms. Gregoli and one of her couples had a conference call with the general manager at a resort on the island. They needed to know specifics about the damage: Is it landscaping and trees that were hardest hit — or is there structural damage? Would the ferry dock be rebuilt in time to accept guests? Lucky for this particular bride and groom, the general manager confirmed all repairs would be finished for their June 2018 nuptials. But another one of Ms. Gregoli’s clients, whose wedding was booked in December at the Ritz Carlton in St. Thomas, in the United States Virgin Islands, wasn’t as fortuitous. That couple had to reschedule for the following year.

The Fine Print

Read contracts carefully. In an extreme event, what is the wedding site’s obligation to keep you informed?

Sonia Byck-Barwick of Paradise Ridge Vineyards, which was devastated in the early days of the wildfires in Santa Rosa, Calif., asserted that refunding any and all deposits the winery had collected for upcoming weddings was a top priority. Weddings were a major part of the boutique winery’s business; it had 24 already booked for 2018, plus 8 to 10 in the remainder of 2017 (including one on Oct. 14).

“It’s a big revenue hit, that’s undeniable,” Ms. Byck-Barwick said. “But we’ll be back up and running. I feel so much more pain for everyone who lost their homes.”

Backup Plan

Have an alternate plan. If you can’t make it to your destination is there somewhere you can marry locally?

Roya Soleimani and Andrew Charles Winner, who live in San Francisco, had planned their wedding for Oct. 15 at Chardonnay Golf Club in Napa County. They hoped to stick to their original plans until the preceding Thursday, when Mr. Winner’s brother, a firefighter in San Rafael, Calif., engaged in fighting the blaze, told them it was time to call it.

“I was researching the best respiratory masks to buy for our guests and vendors,” said Ms. Soleimani, 32, a corporate communications manager at Google.org. “We were starting to realize that the idea of celebrating in Napa, when all of this was going on, just didn’t feel right.” (The couple is quick to point out that their original venue and vendors offered full refunds, nearly across the board.)

Ms. Soleimani and Mr. Winner, 38, a consultant for First Republic Bank and an appraisals specialist, put out the call that they were searching for a new venue for their 230 guests. Soon, they were put in touch with the Julia Morgan Ballroom in San Francisco, and were gratified by the venue’s immediate willingness to help — and at a discount, no less.

“We’re making major cuts to our normal rates,” said Phil Spiegel, the executive vice president of Merchants Exchange Productions, which runs the ballroom. “This is our way of helping.” The ballroom hosted two displaced weddings last weekend and is currently taking inquiries from wine country couples for the weeks and months ahead.",5 Ways to Protect Yourself Against Unexpected Wedding Catastrophe,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/fashion/weddings/5-ways-to-protect-yourself-against-unexpected-wedding-catastrophe.html

But how effective are these measures?

To date, Facebook has offered little information to the public other than a recent email to fact checkers asserting that labeled articles receive 80 percent fewer impressions. But more data is necessary to determine the success of these efforts. Research (including my own) suggests the need to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of Facebook’s interventions.

Yale’s Gordon Pennycook and David Rand offer two principal warnings. First, the effects of exposure to false information are not easily countered by labeling, as they find in a paper they wrote with Tyrone D. Cannon. False information we have previously encountered feels more familiar, producing a feeling of fluency that causes us to rate it as more accurate than information we have not seen before. This effect persists even when Facebook-style warnings label a headline “disputed.” We should be cautious about assuming that labels tagging articles as false are enough to prevent misinformation on social media from affecting people’s beliefs.

In a second paper, Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand find that the presence of “disputed” labels causes study participants to rate unlabeled false stories as slightly more accurate — an “implied truth” effect. If Facebook is seen as taking responsibility for the accuracy of information in its news feed through labeling, readers could start assuming that unlabeled stories have survived scrutiny from fact checkers (which is rarely correct — there are far too many for humans to check everything).

Encouragingly, my students at Dartmouth College and I find that the effects of Facebook-style “disputed” banners on the perceived accuracy of false headlines are larger than those Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand observed. The proportion of respondents rating a false headline as “somewhat” or “very accurate” in our study decreased to 19 percent with the standard Facebook “disputed” banner, from 29 percent in the unlabeled condition. It goes down even further, to 16 percent, when the warning instead states that the headline is “rated false.” (We find no evidence of a large “implied truth” effect, though we lack the statistical precision necessary to detect effects of the size Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand measure.)

Other results suggest further reason for caution. Back in April, Facebook provided users with “Tips to Spot False News” in an article that was linked above users’ news feeds. We find that general warnings of this sort are also potentially counterproductive. When we showed a warning reminding users to “remain skeptical” and “think critically” to spot misleading articles, it did reduce belief in the accuracy of false news headlines somewhat — but it also somewhat reduced the perceived accuracy of news articles that were not false. Readers seemed to become more skeptical of all the headlines that they encountered. (A similar effect was not observed for the fact-check banners.)",Why the Fact-Checking at Facebook Needs to Be Checked,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/upshot/why-the-fact-checking-at-facebook-needs-to-be-checked.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

I completely deny it. It’s false,” Mr. Lombardo said in another interview in his lawyer’s office in Rome, a city where he said he had done great work bringing movies and a lot of money to Miramax.

He said he was “shocked” by the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, though he reserved judgment on the validity of the accusations.

“This is something that nobody knows, except the people in the place where it happened,” he said. “A man wouldn’t tell this story. So how do I know? You see what I mean? I don’t think anybody knows except the people in the room.”

At the height of Mr. Weinstein’s power, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, unease about Mr. Lombardo’s role in the company was so great that Mr. Weinstein attempted to allay concerns, according to Elizabeth Dreyer, a senior executive who was in charge of international acquisitions at the time.

But Ms. Dreyer said Mr. Weinstein’s denial to his senior international staff at a meeting she attended did not entirely dispel suspicions inside the company.

Years earlier, Ms. Dreyer had worked in Miramax’s New York office and was responsible for reserving hotel rooms for the Cannes Film Festival. She recalled requesting a room at the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc for Mr. Lombardo, and being told that he was barred because the owner said he “brings too many girls.”

“That was kind of an ‘ah-ha’ moment for me,” she said, recalling thinking, “I get what Fabrizio is about now. I get the relationship.”

Mr. Lombardo said that neither he nor Mr. Weinstein was ever barred from the hotel. (The hotel manager at the time would not comment.) Mr. Lombardo attributed the criticisms to people within the company who were “envious” of his relationship with Mr. Weinstein.

“They have to find a reason for their failure” he said, adding that it was not his fault what took place behind closed hotel room doors. “You can’t hold responsible the person who from the lobby shows the room.”

But some of the women are eager to take Mr. Weinstein, and his alleged facilitators, to task.

One of Mr. Weinstein’s accusers, Asia Argento, an Italian actress, received what she considered threatening messages on her telephone from Mr. Lombardo, whom she said she hadn’t heard from in years.

“I’m scared to death,” Ms. Argento told a reporter by phone the morning after receiving the image on Oct. 3 of an anonymous couple passed out on a bed with the words, “Have You Ever Been This Drunk.” “Why is he sending me this?” she said.

Mr. Lombardo acknowledged he had sent what he called the “funny videos,” but argued he sent them to her — on two separate days — as part of a mass forwarding by “mistake.” He expressed regret that Ms. Argento felt threatened and he conceded that “the timing was terrible.”

Ms. Argento subsequently went public in The New Yorker with her account of sexual harassment by Mr. Weinstein, and she has since named Mr. Lombardo as the person who brought her to Mr. Weinstein’s room in 1997 under the false pretense of attending a party.

Another woman, Zoë Brock, has accused Mr. Lombardo of accompanying her into Mr. Weinstein’s Cannes hotel room in 1998 under the pretense that friends would be joining them to continue a party.

Ms. Brock, a former model, said in a phone interview that Mr. Lombardo had excused himself to leave her alone with Mr. Weinstein, who, behind closed doors, stripped naked and chased her around the room.

“It was a total set up. He knew,” Ms. Brock said, referring to Mr. Lombardo.

Mr. Lombardo denied both accounts. Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said Mr. Weinstein denied all the allegations against Mr. Lombardo.

“As the executive in charge of Rome and parts of Europe, Mr. Lombardo made contributions that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues for the company,” she said.

Before Mr. Lombardo befriended actors and dated movie stars, he was the son of engineers in the northern Italian town of Novara.

He learned English in London and French in Paris, where he first put his early passion for real estate into practice and entered the orbit of Jean-Luc Brunel, a powerful modeling agent in the 1980s.

“He was one of the boys hanging around Jean-Luc,” said Renée Toft Simonsen, a top model at the time, who considered Mr. Lombardo “part of the system” of young men who hang around models and connect them with powerful people.

Mr. Brunel, who surfaced in news reports several years ago for his connection to Jeffrey Epstein, a Flordia billionaire convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, declined to comment.

Mr. Lombardo ended up as part of the moveable feast. Former models and Miramax executives recalled him as a handsome wingman of Italian soccer stars like his real-estate business partner Nicola Berti.

Mr. Lombardo said he first met Mr. Weinstein and his family in St. Barts. Ms. Hofmeister, speaking for Mr. Weinstein, said the two met during the making of the film “Pulp Fiction,” when Mr. Lombardo was dating the actress Uma Thurman.

Mr. Weinstein and his first wife dined at Mr. Lombardo’s West Village townhouse, and Mr. Lombardo said Mr. Weinstein’s office subsequently called him to help interpret during a meeting with the Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore.

But he said they mostly saw each other in Cannes and St. Barts, where, during a Weinstein family Christmas vacation, the mogul fell deathly ill with septicemia.

Mr. Lombardo arranged for a private plane to medevac Mr. Weinstein out and flew with him to New York, where Mr. Weinstein’s brother, Bob, waited with an ambulance.

“If he had waited another day in St. Barts he wouldn’t have survived,” Mr. Lombardo said.

His big break came, he said, when he brought Mr. Tornatore’s project, “Malèna,” to Mr. Weinstein who in 1999, despite the objections of some Miramax executives, asked Mr. Lombardo to lead Miramax Italy.

Ms. Angulo, though, had embarked on a different life. Despite the bombs, the parties continued in Shanghai, and at one of them, she met an American lieutenant, James Rockwell. They were married, and in 1940, when he was recalled to duty in the United States, she accompanied him.

Facial recognition is another troubling surveillance technology whose use is on the rise. Half of American adults are already in a law enforcement facial recognition network. Merged with police body camera technology, facial recognition could facilitate increased surveillance and the erosion of the anonymity most citizens assume when they go about their business. The New York Police Department’s body camera policy, which was adopted after consulting with the public, does not prohibit the use of facial recognition.

The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and Upturn, a technology and policy research group, last year examined the body camera policies of 51 police departments across the country, including those in Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston. Of the 51 departments, none put strict limits on the merger of facial recognition and body camera technology, and only six departments had even partial limitations in place.

Americans should be aware of the rules governing this type of surveillance in their jurisdiction. It’s one thing to be identified by the police once you’re detained; it’s another for the police to be able to identify you at a distance without having to say a word to you.

This use of facial recognition could potentially have a stifling effect on First Amendment-protected activity such as protests. Citizens may be less willing to take part if they think the police are able to catalog their participation and see where else they’ve appeared in public.

The same concern applies to drones, which, although still comparatively rare, will also be a regular part of police departments’ tool kits soon. The New York Police Department has in the past strongly resisted calls for information about its drone records.

Americans care about this. Analysis of online behavior suggests, unsurprisingly, that some changed their online search behavior after Edward Snowden’s revelations that the National Security Agency had engaged in widespread internet surveillance.

The relationship between security and liberty is often described as a balancing act. This act can’t take place if we’re not informed about the technology used to safeguard our security.

That’s why, when it comes to surveillance technology, the American people should demand to know whether the police are spying on them. At the moment, those who are suspected of being Muslim extremists are prime targets, and innocent people caught in this effort face immediate concerns. In the past, Communists, civil rights leaders, feminists, Quakers, folk singers, war protesters and others have been on the receiving end of law enforcement surveillance.

No one knows who the next target will be. What we do know is that it’s difficult to put surveillance equipment back in the box it came from.","When It Comes to Surveillance, Watch the Watchmen",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/opinion/police-surveillance.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Trish Goff, a former top model, discussing her experiences with Mr. Weinstein, told The New York Times, “The horrible thing is, as a model, it wasn’t that unusual to be in a weird situation where a photographer or someone feels they have a right to your body.”

The issue was first brought to Ms. Rozic’s attention a few months ago by Sara Ziff, a former model and the founder of the Model Alliance, a research and policy organization established in 2012. Ms. Ziff had been doing a project with the legal clinic at Fordham Law School on the working conditions of models, and, said Elizabeth B. Cooper, an associate professor there, when it came to sexual harassment, “we were all mortified by what we found, and surprised by the limited scope of the current law.”

“I’ve experienced sexual harassment in the workplace; we all know someone who has experienced sexual harassment in the workplace,” said Ms. Rozic, who, when she was elected in 2012, was the youngest woman in the state legislature.

Ms. Ziff, who began modeling when she was 14, remembered “being made to sit on the lap of my booker, who was a man; being sent to castings and told to go into a room alone with a photographer who then asked me to take off all my clothes; going to shoots and being routinely asked to go topless with no warning — all this behavior that in any other industry would be recognized as inappropriate, but in fashion is treated as no big deal.”

Karen Elson, a top model and singer who is on the advisory board of the Model Alliance, said the biggest threat for her was when she was a teenager working in cities like Milan and Paris. “I was repeatedly followed, sexually harassed and intimidated,” she said. “A model scout who worked at my old agency in Paris tried to coerce me into having sex with him and his friend at a nightclub in Paris when I was barely 16. I sensed the danger and ran out. Then, the next day, I told my agent and the scout threatened to have me kicked out of Paris.”

On one of Ms. Elson’s shoots, for a “major U.S. retailer,” she said the photographer was standing over her and “got out his penis and asked if ‘I wanted it.’” She then told her agent. “I know he complained to the client, but nothing happened,” she said. “I turned 18 and became successful and I was lucky to have great agents who were very protective of me, but that’s not always the case for a lot of models.”

Now, when she is on a job, “I insist that the set be cleared and at least one woman stays on set,” Ms. Elson said. “I can demand this because I have respect in the industry, but it should be the norm.”

Though Ms. Cooper did acknowledge that under the current law it was possible for a model to go to the police or district attorney with an abuse complaint, she said in practice that making a complaint was unlikely given the characteristics of many models, which can include their very young age, a lack of language fluency, or lack of support system.

Fashion has grappled with this issue before, most recently in 2014, when the photographer Terry Richardson was accused of sexual harassment by a number of models — though his behavior had been public knowledge since 2009. That year, a documentary directed by Ms. Ziff and Ole Schell, “Picture Me,” contained an allegation from a model named Sena Cech, who said on camera that Mr. Richardson and his assistant had asked her during a casting call to strip, “do something a little sexy,” and then touch his penis.

Though some prominent magazines such as Vogue pledged not to use him after women began to describe their experiences working with him, by 2015 he was again shooting covers, for Harper’s Bazaar and Rolling Stone.

“There has been a sense that simply speaking out is enough,” Ms. Ziff said. “It’s an important first step, but it does not solve the problem. If there aren’t basic legal protections in place, than real change does not occur.”

The bill would amend the current law to explicitly include models, explicitly forbid sexual advances and commentary or other forms of discrimination linked to their employment, and would require clients to provide models upon booking with a contact and avenue for filing any complaints. It would attempt, in effect, to create a human resources department in an industry that has had none.

“For me, personally, it would have held a lot more people accountable for their actions sooner,” said Ms. Elson.

Ms. Rozic is hopeful that a groundswell of public support will ensure that both legislature houses pass the bill by June, so it can be signed into law by the end of 2018.

“It’s impossible to imagine, given the events of the last two weeks, why anyone would oppose this,” Ms. Cooper said.

Ms. Ziff had a somewhat different take on the situation. “It is timely,” she said. “But it’s been timely for a long time.”","After Weinstein Scandal, a Plan to Protect Models",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/fashion/sexual-harassment-law-models-new-york-state-harvey-weinstein.html

“Congressional investigations unfortunately are usually overtly political investigations, where it is to one side’s advantage to drag things out,” said Mr. Gowdy, who made his name in Congress as a fearsome investigator of Democrats. He added, “The notion that one side is playing the part of defense attorney and that the other side is just these white hat defenders of the truth is laughable.”

Instead, he said, he is looking to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, to conduct an apolitical investigation.

None of the challenges have thus far stopped the committees. And given the closed-door nature of their work, prominent new avenues of inquiry could always emerge, such as Russia’s use of social media to sow chaos and discord, capable of influencing the public discourse.

But all three are up against a ticking clock, with Republicans in both chambers eager to wrap up the investigations before too long.

Particularly in the House, partisan fighting is likely to undermine whatever conclusions the committee reaches. One lawmaker said the committee would probably produce two reports. The first, written by Republicans, is expected to forcefully say there is no proof that anyone around Mr. Trump worked with Russia to tip the election. A Democratic report will probably raise unanswered questions and say that the committee was never fully committed to answering them.

The panel has been on rocky ground for months, with much of the controversy surrounding the committee’s chairman, Representative Devin Nunes of California. Mr. Nunes was forced to step aside from leading the investigation in April after it was disclosed that he had received classified information from the White House that showed that Mr. Trump and his associates were incidentally swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies.

Mr. Nunes handed control to three of the committee’s Republicans, Representatives K. Michael Conaway of Texas, Tom Rooney of Florida and Mr. Gowdy. Mr. Conaway, a well-liked accountant, helped put the investigation back on track and has maintained a productive relationship with Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the panel’s top Democrat.

But Democrats say Mr. Nunes, whose signature is required to issue subpoenas, has continued to meddle around the edges of the investigation, driving Republican inquiries into who financed a dossier of unsubstantiated information on purported links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr. Nunes, they say, is also participating in an investigation into the revealing of Trump associates caught up in American surveillance by Obama administration officials.

“Frankly, I have been doing everything I can to try to get us to do a credible investigation and to reach a common conclusion,” Mr. Schiff said. “I view these things as obstacles that are in the way to overcome, and I am doing my best to overcome them almost daily.”

A spokesman for Mr. Nunes did not reply to a request for comment.

Democrats were also incensed by Mr. Gowdy’s remarks to Mr. Kushner in July, which they said were representative of efforts by some Republicans to cut the investigation short. Shortly after the meeting, Mr. Schiff publicly accused Mr. Gowdy of playing defense attorney for the administration.

Republicans have returned the biting words, sharply criticizing Mr. Schiff, whose frequent television appearances irk them. Mr. Rooney used a vulgarity when he called Mr. Schiff’s comments about the Kushner interview nonsense. And Mr. Gowdy said on Friday that he had been compelled to weigh in by the Democrats’ repetitive and meandering questions — and that a transcript would show his own questions to have been appropriately aggressive.

The Republican said it had become clear where the committee was headed.

“Will our private conclusions be the same? Yes,” Mr. Gowdy said. “Will our public pronouncements be the same? No, of course not.”

“This is politics,” he added.

Across Capitol Hill, the tone has been different. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and its top Democrat, Mark Warner of Virginia, have worked to project a collaborative rapport that committee members insist is real.

At a rare news conference this month, the two senators said they had already expended significant resources verifying the conclusions of America’s spy agencies about Russia’s efforts to meddle in the election and were now taking steps to better understand its use of social media campaigns and to investigate the collusion question.

“At the end of the day, what we owe the American people is the truth,” Mr. Warner said in an interview on Thursday. “And if there’s something there, then they should know that. And if there’s not something there, I’ll be the first to acknowledge that.”

But other committee members have sought to contain expectations. At the news conference, Mr. Burr said investigators had “hit a wall” in their work on the dossier, which holds some of the most salacious allegations of collusion, because its author, Christopher Steele, would not meet with the committee. Mr. Burr also said he did not have a mandate to look for criminal activity.

“The special counsel is focused on criminal acts; we’re not focused on criminal acts,” he said. “If we find one, then they’re the first phone call we make.”

Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and a former chairwoman of the committee, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” this month that Mr. Mueller stood a much better chance of reaching a definitive conclusion about collusion than the committees did.

“There’s no proof yet that it’s happened, and I think that proof will likely come with Mr. Mueller’s investigation,” Ms. Feinstein said. “He’s got the ability to use a grand jury. He’s got the ability to use the power of subpoena without question. And he’s got the ability to do a criminal investigation.”

Both intelligence committees will also face questions about how much of what they find can be declassified and shared with the public. Mr. Burr said on Wednesday that his goal was to have the “meat of our business” done by late spring, in time for state governments to make changes to their voting systems before next year’s midterm elections. He said he would push to declassify the findings as much as possible.

The Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, has struggled to get a fledgling investigation off the ground. Ms. Feinstein, the committee’s top Democrat, and its chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, agreed this summer to begin investigating a cluster of topics related to the firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, including Mr. Comey’s handling of the Clinton email case and the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia.

Given its jurisdiction over the Justice Department, the panel is the best positioned on Capitol Hill to unravel the Comey saga, including possible obstruction of justice. But after a brief flurry of activity earlier this fall — including a closed-door interview with the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. — investigators reached an impasse in recent weeks, as Democrats and Republicans haggled over the next witnesses to call and documents to request.

Mr. Grassley has spent weeks negotiating with the Justice Department on the committee’s behalf to try to gain access to two key F.B.I. officials who worked closely with Mr. Comey, Carl Ghattas and James Rybicki. Hopes of interviewing Paul J. Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, collapsed over the summer after prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller warned Mr. Manafort that they planned to seek criminal charges against him.

On Wednesday, Mr. Grassley unilaterally sent a flurry of letters requesting interviews with and information from current and former Justice Department officials, as well as Mr. Kushner and others involved in a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer said to be offering incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton.

Senators said they were still hopeful that the committee would break through the logjam, but a deal had not been reached as of Friday.

But manufacturers have not gone quietly in the city. They have mounted several legal challenges, arguing that e-cigs do not qualify because technically they do not emit smoke. The most recent challenge to New York City’s ban was rejected this year in the New York State Court of Appeals, which found that the inclusion of e-cigs in the law was valid.

Jeff Seyler, the executive vice president of the American Lung Association’s Northeast region, said, “This new law not only protects public health by restricting the use of e-cigarettes and the public’s exposure to smoke-cigarette emissions,” but it also shields children, for whom the products are “just another tool reeling them into a dangerous and often lifetime of addiction to nicotine.”

But proponents of devices like e-cigs and vaporizers — larger, cellphone-size gadgets — say they are a safer alternative to cigarettes and may help with smoking cessation. Studies so far have been limited and short term, and are not conclusive on either front.

At Long Island Vape, in Huntington Station, N.Y., the owner, Aman Singh, said the rules were unnecessary — the social mores that govern cigarette smokers already are in play when it comes to vapers, he said. “Our customers they know that they can’t be walking through a store vaping, or sitting at a bar vaping,” he said. “They don’t feel like doing it anyway because its obnoxious.”

Mr. Singh acknowledged that the product he sells may be a health risk, but he says it is a lesser evil; most customers use it as way to quit traditional cigarettes, he said.

“We’re out here trying to help people,” he said, adding he worries about the impact ever-tighter strictures on e-cigarettes would have on his customers. “I think people will start smoking cigarettes again.”",New York State Bans Vaping Anywhere Cigarettes Are Prohibited,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/nyregion/new-york-bans-vaping-ecigs-bars-restaurants.html

Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said Mr. Weinstein denied all the allegations against Mr. Lombardo.
Mr. Lombardo said he first met Mr. Weinstein and his family in St. Barts.
Several years ago, Mr. Lombardo bumped into Mr. Weinstein on the ski slopes in Gstaad, Switzerland, prompting a reconciliation.
Earlier this year, Mr. Lombardo accompanied Mr. Weinstein to a private screening in Rome of the film “Perfect Strangers,” leading the Weinstein Company to buy the rights.","“That’s absolutely not true. I completely deny it. It’s false,” Mr. Lombardo said in another interview in his lawyer’s office in Rome, a city where he said he had done great work bringing movies and a lot of money to Miramax.

He said he was “shocked” by the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, though he reserved judgment on the validity of the accusations.

“This is something that nobody knows, except the people in the place where it happened,” he said. “A man wouldn’t tell this story. So how do I know? You see what I mean? I don’t think anybody knows except the people in the room.”

At the height of Mr. Weinstein’s power, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, unease about Mr. Lombardo’s role in the company was so great that Mr. Weinstein attempted to allay concerns, according to Elizabeth Dreyer, a senior executive who was in charge of international acquisitions at the time.

But Ms. Dreyer said Mr. Weinstein’s denial to his senior international staff at a meeting she attended did not entirely dispel suspicions inside the company.

Years earlier, Ms. Dreyer had worked in Miramax’s New York office and was responsible for reserving hotel rooms for the Cannes Film Festival. She recalled requesting a room at the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc for Mr. Lombardo, and being told that he was barred because the owner said he “brings too many girls.”

“That was kind of an ‘ah-ha’ moment for me,” she said, recalling thinking, “I get what Fabrizio is about now. I get the relationship.”

Mr. Lombardo said that neither he nor Mr. Weinstein was ever barred from the hotel. (The hotel manager at the time would not comment.) Mr. Lombardo attributed the criticisms to people within the company who were “envious” of his relationship with Mr. Weinstein.

“They have to find a reason for their failure” he said, adding that it was not his fault what took place behind closed hotel room doors. “You can’t hold responsible the person who from the lobby shows the room.”

But some of the women are eager to take Mr. Weinstein, and his alleged facilitators, to task.

One of Mr. Weinstein’s accusers, Asia Argento, an Italian actress, received what she considered threatening messages on her telephone from Mr. Lombardo, whom she said she hadn’t heard from in years.

“I’m scared to death,” Ms. Argento told a reporter by phone the morning after receiving the image on Oct. 3 of an anonymous couple passed out on a bed with the words, “Have You Ever Been This Drunk.” “Why is he sending me this?” she said.

Mr. Lombardo acknowledged he had sent what he called the “funny videos,” but argued he sent them to her — on two separate days — as part of a mass forwarding by “mistake.” He expressed regret that Ms. Argento felt threatened and he conceded that “the timing was terrible.”

Ms. Argento subsequently went public in The New Yorker with her account of sexual harassment by Mr. Weinstein, and she has since named Mr. Lombardo as the person who brought her to Mr. Weinstein’s room in 1997 under the false pretense of attending a party.

Another woman, Zoë Brock, has accused Mr. Lombardo of accompanying her into Mr. Weinstein’s Cannes hotel room in 1998 under the pretense that friends would be joining them to continue a party.

Ms. Brock, a former model, said in a phone interview that Mr. Lombardo had excused himself to leave her alone with Mr. Weinstein, who, behind closed doors, stripped naked and chased her around the room.

“It was a total set up. He knew,” Ms. Brock said, referring to Mr. Lombardo.

Mr. Lombardo denied both accounts. Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said Mr. Weinstein denied all the allegations against Mr. Lombardo.

“As the executive in charge of Rome and parts of Europe, Mr. Lombardo made contributions that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues for the company,” she said.

Before Mr. Lombardo befriended actors and dated movie stars, he was the son of engineers in the northern Italian town of Novara.

He learned English in London and French in Paris, where he first put his early passion for real estate into practice and entered the orbit of Jean-Luc Brunel, a powerful modeling agent in the 1980s.

“He was one of the boys hanging around Jean-Luc,” said Renée Toft Simonsen, a top model at the time, who considered Mr. Lombardo “part of the system” of young men who hang around models and connect them with powerful people.

Mr. Brunel, who surfaced in news reports several years ago for his connection to Jeffrey Epstein, a Flordia billionaire convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, declined to comment.

Mr. Lombardo ended up as part of the moveable feast. Former models and Miramax executives recalled him as a handsome wingman of Italian soccer stars like his real-estate business partner Nicola Berti.

Mr. Lombardo said he first met Mr. Weinstein and his family in St. Barts. Ms. Hofmeister, speaking for Mr. Weinstein, said the two met during the making of the film “Pulp Fiction,” when Mr. Lombardo was dating the actress Uma Thurman.

Mr. Weinstein and his first wife dined at Mr. Lombardo’s West Village townhouse, and Mr. Lombardo said Mr. Weinstein’s office subsequently called him to help interpret during a meeting with the Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore.

But he said they mostly saw each other in Cannes and St. Barts, where, during a Weinstein family Christmas vacation, the mogul fell deathly ill with septicemia.

Mr. Lombardo arranged for a private plane to medevac Mr. Weinstein out and flew with him to New York, where Mr. Weinstein’s brother, Bob, waited with an ambulance.

“If he had waited another day in St. Barts he wouldn’t have survived,” Mr. Lombardo said.

His big break came, he said, when he brought Mr. Tornatore’s project, “Malèna,” to Mr. Weinstein who in 1999, despite the objections of some Miramax executives, asked Mr. Lombardo to lead Miramax Italy.

Ms. Dreyer, then overseeing Miramax’s Italy operations, said she received a call from her superiors urging her to use Mr. Lombardo in everything she did.

“I thought this was a way to legitimize his involvement in the company,” she said, adding that his responsibilities amounted to setting up meetings and translating.

In 2003, Mr. Weinstein served as the best man to Mr. Lombardo when he married Chiara Geronzi, the daughter of Cesare Geronzi, then chairman of the Capitalia bank.

But soon after, Miramax closed its Italian branch but the company was upset that Mr. Lombardo kept receiving payments, which he said protective Italian labor laws required.

An article in The New York Times in 2004 aired the company’s grievance, and Mr. Lombardo felt unfairly maligned and insufficiently defended by Mr. Weinstein.

“We had a little falling out,” he said.

Mr. Lombardo subsequently kept a lower profile, playing golf, raising a family and occasionally showing up for movie premieres with his wife.

Several years ago, Mr. Lombardo bumped into Mr. Weinstein on the ski slopes in Gstaad, Switzerland, prompting a reconciliation.

Earlier this year, Mr. Lombardo accompanied Mr. Weinstein to a private screening in Rome of the film “Perfect Strangers,” leading the Weinstein Company to buy the rights.

“I made it happen,” Mr. Lombardo said, adding that instead of a payment, he sought only an executive producer credit to demonstrate to his daughters that their father was once somebody in the film business.

The movie tells the tale of old friends who think they know each other, but they don’t.

Numerous furniture companies that once had stand-alone stores in NoHo and SoHo have also relocated to the New York Design Center, including Aero, Desiron, Dune and Lobel Modern.
“It’s the re-emergence of a design district,” said Bruce Ehrmann, an associate broker at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, which is leading sales and marketing for the building.","This time, Mr. Adjmi said he was inspired by the pointed neo-Gothic details of neighbors such as the Kaye Building at 105 Madison Avenue and the Remsen Building at 148 Madison Avenue.

At 40 stories and about 470 feet, 30 East 31st Street, located between Madison and Park Avenues, will be the tallest building of Mr. Adjmi’s career so far, so he also looked to Manhattan’s most iconic skyscrapers.

“What can we do to create a classic New York skyscraper,” he asked himself, “something that really talks to the Chrysler Building, to the Empire State Building?”

One of the key differences between those towers and newer buildings, he noted, is that they culminate in spectacular tops where many contemporary buildings tend to end uneventfully when they reach a required height.

Mr. Adjmi’s design “starts out with vertical pilasters,” he said, but these structural members curve near the top of the building and “terminate in this weaving that speaks to that Gothic architecture you see at the ground plane, but then is also recognizable in the skyline.”

Inside, there are 13 one-bedroom apartments on floors 2 through 8, starting at 866 square feet and $1.65 million. But from the 9th floor up, there is a single 1,677-square-foot two-bedroom apartment per floor, starting at $3.5 million. At the top, there is a 3,354-square-foot three-bedroom duplex penthouse for $12 million, where windows look out in all directions through the building’s zigzagging structure.

To market the building, which is not in a very residential area, the developers have partnered with the nearby New York Design Center, which houses about a hundred furniture showrooms at 200 Lexington Avenue, between 32nd and 33rd Streets.

“There’s an important synergy between luxury real estate and design neighborhoods that nobody is capitalizing on,” said James Druckman, the president and chief executive of the New York Design Center. “We can work together to enhance what’s going on at their building and show people the value of good design.”

Plans include dinner events and panel discussions with designers for prospective buyers and brokers in the center’s showrooms, joint window displays, and an eventual designer show house at 30 East 31st Street. The design center is also hosting the development’s launch event on November 1.

These activities build on the growing number of design-focused stores within a few blocks of the development, including B&B Italia, Natuzzi, Poliform, Luxury Living, DDC, Suite NY, M2L, Duravit and Dover Street Market.

The Nuevo Amanecer Mariachi Academy is one of those places where the traditions of Mexico are passed onto new generations. Students between the ages of 6 and 20 meet in a church basement in East Elmhurst, Queens, to learn violin, trumpet or guitar, while more experienced students rehearse for gigs in local restaurants and churches.

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

“They are a generation in transition since they are the first to be born here, yet they have not lost their roots,” said Ms. Vincenti, 28. “They are American, but they consider themselves Mexican, too.”

The young people, she said, approach their studies eagerly, unlike those of us who balked at weekly piano lessons as children. Even in their spare time, they kick back and play their instruments just for the fun of it. Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

Broadly speaking, it is a protectionist policy that limits foreign competition in shipping. Without it, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has argued, thousands of American jobs would be outsourced.

What are the arguments for and against repeal?

Opponents of the Jones Act, on both sides of the aisle, argue that it serves special interests and unfairly burdens some Americans in the process.

“If the government wants to subsidize the continuation of a maritime industry, it should do it with a direct subsidy, not these indirect methods that impose large costs on the territories, particularly Puerto Rico,” said Barry P. Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the left-leaning think tank.

The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank, has said that the law amounts to little more than a “legislative gift to the shipping industry.” And, in introducing a bill last month to repeal the law, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, argued that it had outlived its purpose.

In 2013, the World Trade Organization described the Jones Act as “the most restrictive” protectionist shipping or transport law in the world, calling it an “anomaly” in the otherwise open market of the United States. Even China, which has similar restrictions in place, lacks a requirement that vessels be made locally, the organization noted.

In arguing for a longer-term waiver, Puerto Rican officials say they need all the help they can get. “It couldn’t hurt. It couldn’t hurt to have it,” Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told CBS News on Oct. 9, a day after the waiver expired.

Defenders of the Jones Act argue that the act is needed to counter protectionist policies abroad and to give the military a pool of vessels and sailors to rely on in times of need.

Without it, the nation would either have to build its own expensive fleet to carry cargo or “pay exorbitant prices” for naval vessels and rely on foreign carriers to move critical military supplies, the Lexington Institute, a Washington-area policy research group, said in a 2011 report.

“Ninety years after it became law, the Jones Act continues to be vital to national security needs,” it concluded.

What would repeal look like?

Many studies have found that repealing the Jones Act would contribute hundreds of millions of dollars annually to the American economy. It would also eliminate a policy that has been blamed for driving up gas prices, moving some Texas oil to refineries abroad, and, reportedly, a decision by at least one Hawaiian cattle rancher’s to put his cows on a plane.

But the effect of repeal may be complicated for Puerto Rico. While it may have increased costs for some goods there, it also created a “discrete” and predictable market between the mainland United States and the island, according to a 2013 report by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office.

Under the Jones Act, a handful of American shippers provide regular service to Puerto Rico, bringing perishable goods like dairy, meat and agricultural products as well as other supplies, the report found. Foreign carriers typically operate on longer, global routes, with less-reliable service.

Repealing the law would probably lead to the outsourcing of shipbuilding and associated jobs, the report said. Loosening its requirements would make it easier for foreign carriers to compete, most likely pushing down shipping costs, according to the report.

But the effect on prices would depend on other factors, including how the government regulated those new carriers and what business decisions they made in response to the new opportunity in Puerto Rico.

“So many factors influence freight rates and product prices that the independent effect and associated economic costs of the Jones Act cannot be determined,” the agency concluded, after reviewing research and interviewing shipping industry experts.

In a 2012 report on the economic challenges facing Puerto Rico, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York acknowledged the complications associated with repeal, but suggested that a temporary reprieve from the Jones Act — for, say, five years — could help clarify its effects.

“Trends in shipping costs, volumes, and business practices could be monitored,” the bank wrote. “At the end of the period, a review could assess the costs and benefits to determine if this exemption should be made permanent.”",Would Repealing the Jones Act Help Puerto Rico?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/jones-act-puerto-rico.html

They are focused on areas like access to education and employment, as well as voter participation. But they are still trying to find consensus. Many don’t want to narrowly define the mandate around race, since initiatives like improving school quality and job training are as much about geography and income level.

The 10 or so core organizers, who meet every other Sunday in Manhattan, have hired a lawyer to get the paperwork ready but haven’t started to raise money. They plan to create three structures: a “super PAC” to run political ads or host events; a federal PAC to support candidates; and a 501(c)(4) group, or social welfare nonprofit, that will do a mix of the two.

“What we’ve been doing is just writing checks for years, and we don’t know what happened” once the money was received, Mr. Phillips said. “We’ve got to learn from the Koch brothers, do what they do, have them sign pledges.”

The core organizers plan to reach out to a group of roughly 100 black executives, lawyers and other professionals who attended the July dinner. They have mutual friends. They meet socially in places like East Hampton, N.Y., and Kiawah Island, S.C. They attend the same charitable functions, like the annual fund-raising dinner in New York City for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

The group has been increasingly stepping into the national debate about race and inequality. Two years ago, it funded screenings so that 320,000 students across the country could see “Selma,” the movie about a crucial moment in civil rights history. After the police shootings of black people in Ferguson, Mo., and other cities, the group raised $1 million in 48 hours to fund a police reform initiative. And in August, it supported Kenneth C. Frazier, the chief executive of Merck and a member of the extended network, after President Trump criticized him.

“We have now entered more the ranks of corporate America with the financial wherewithal, with the thought leadership, to now engage around the issues,” said Ms. Smalls, who while growing up in South Carolina in the 1960s watched her parents help organize get-out-the-vote rallies and fight for equality in local schools.

The election last November, Ms. Smalls said, was an “inflection point.” The question now, she said, is “defining a narrative, politically, that matters to our community.”

The ranks of black senior executives remains small. In 2001, when Kenneth I. Chenault was named to the top job at American Express, just one other black chief executive was running a Fortune 500 company, Franklin D. Raines of Fannie Mae. On this year’s list, Mr. Chenault, who is preparing to step down after a 16-year tenure, was one of four.

While black business leaders have long used their money and influence, they have often worked individually behind the scenes. Still, many have proven adept at mobilizing money and support for causes dear to them.

Mr. Chenault is a prime example. In September, he hosted a dinner at his apartment for Cashmere Nicole, who founded an online cosmetics company, Beauty Bakerie, with her own money. Mr. Chenault, Infor’s Mr. Phillips, Lazard’s Mr. Lewis and Adebayo Ogunlesi, a private equity executive who is Goldman Sachs’s lead director, all provided seed capital for the company.

The shift from an informal network to a more organized effort was marked in 2015 by an appeal by Mr. Lewis.

Early that year, he sent an email to friends and fellow executives, asking if they’d like to pool funds to sponsor student tickets to “Selma.” After seeing the film, “I walked out of the theater with my wife and said, ‘Every New York City eighth grader should see this movie,’” Mr. Lewis recalled in an interview at the time. They raised more than $2 million and funded screenings in about 30 cities.

Early in 2017, some of the same executives funded student screenings of “Hidden Figures,” which told the story of three female black mathematicians who worked for NASA during the 1960s. They paid for 63,000 students to see the movie in 25 different places, including Britain and Nigeria.

A focus on police reforms took shape after a white police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson during the summer of 2014. That deadly encounter, and similar ones, sparked nationwide protests.

The next July, a handful of executives were at a charity dinner, and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund came up. Its president, Sherrilyn Ifill, was being inundated with requests to provide legal work and organize assistance in embattled communities. Tapping the informal network of friends and associates, the group quickly collected $1 million.

“This group provided key support that enabled us to be influential at a critical time when we saw a window was open,” Ms. Ifill said.

Photo

During that period, Mr. Phillips, Ms. Ifill and Raymond J. McGuire, the head of corporate and investment banking at Citigroup, met with officials at the New York Police Department to talk about the agency’s attempts to improve relations with the black community. In a series of meetings, they discussed neighborhood policing plans, community meetings and changes in police discipline procedures, tracking data on the department’s progress as new steps were taken. Mr. Phillips and Mr. McGuire later joined the board of trustees of the New York City Police Foundation.

Members of the group are also taking more public stands. In August, Mr. Frazier, the Merck chief executive, resigned from the president’s manufacturing council after Mr. Trump failed to directly condemn the white nationalists involved in the violent protest in Charlottesville, Va. The president then criticized Mr. Frazier, accusing him on Twitter of charging “ripoff drug prices.”

Mr. Frazier’s inbox was soon filled with supportive emails. Edith Cooper, the head of human capital management at Goldman Sachs, spoke out on LinkedIn, saying she was “outraged and frightened by what took place in Charlottesville and by President Trump’s response.”

Through a spokeswoman, both Mr. Frazier and Ms. Cooper declined to comment.

Since the July dinner at Topping Rose House in Bridgehampton, the PAC’s organizers have been trying to work out their priorities and their differences.

Some likely donors in the broader network want to see dedicated staff and a clearly defined action plan before they get involved. Others question whether a PAC that doesn’t support a particular party can make a difference.

The organizers have consulted with Mr. Kirk about the best legal structure. They met with senior black politicians and set up brainstorming sessions with think tanks in Washington.

Mr. Coles of Yumanity Therapeutics and his wife, Robyn, held an event at their Kiawah Island home, where Senator Tim Scott, a Republican, and Representative James E. Clyburn, a Democrat, mingled with some of their friends. The conversation focused partly on education and work options for the state’s younger generation.

“As African Americans have advanced in business, and assumed important positions across the board,” Mr. Coles said, “I think we are finding our way to adding to or extending what many of our forebears have done. And in a sense, it’s our turn now, to contribute to this kind of leadership.”","Black Executives Join Forces, Forming a PAC to Back Them Up",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/business/black-executives-pac.html

The middens around Damariscotta are the largest examples north of South Carolina, said Arthur Spiess, senior archaeologist with the Maine Historic Preservation Commission.

From about 2,200 to 800 years ago, Native Americans visited this site in late winter and spring. The inhabitants discarded the shells in heaps that grew year after year, century after century.

“They were eating oysters like crazy and catching alewives,” Dr. Spiess said, referring to a type of herring.

In later centuries, European settlers viewed the middens as a resource. One company burned the oyster shells for lime; another smashed them for chicken feed.

As the shells were unearthed, however, archaeologists found ceramics, bones and stone tools, and the remains of animals on which the tribes feasted. (Many of the artifacts went to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University.)

This and other middens have revealed much of what is known about Native Americans in Maine over the past 4,000 years. The best-studied site, Turner Farm, on North Haven Island in Penobscot Bay, has yielded artifacts more than 5,000 years old.

The inhabitants ate shellfish, of course, mostly soft-shell clams. But they also had a taste for deer, bear, moose, porpoise and seal; cod, sturgeon and swordfish; and even extinct species like sea mink and the flightless great auk.

Donald Soctomah, the historic preservation officer for the two Passamaquoddy tribes in eastern Maine, said middens tell important stories.

“To the Passamaquoddy, the shell middens are a link to the past, and give us an idea of how life was at a certain time and what people consumed,” Dr. Soctomah said in a phone interview. “To us, any information about our past is very important, because we didn’t have a written record.”

In an effort to more rapidly assess middens, Dr. Kelley has developed protocols to survey them using ground-penetrating radar. She thinks of the surveys as a sort of triage, a way of determining which sites are at greatest risk of erosion and which are best to study. With funding from Maine Sea Grant, she has surveyed six middens so far.

“If you want to know what was in the western Gulf of Maine 3,000 years ago, this is how you’re going to figure that out,” Dr. Kelley said.

To survey a site, Dr. Kelley and graduate student Jacque Miller pushed a wheeled radar unit about the size of a jogging stroller across the area, and followed a grid pattern at a walking pace. This allowed them to map a midden without excavating in just two or three days (longer for forested or brushy sites).

The radar not only shows the extent and thickness of the middens, but also reveals the detailed layering, including what may have been floors in historic settlements.

More Reporting on Archaeology

Ms. Miller said in addition to the cultural information buried in the middens, the shells are also a record of ancient climate. Researchers can analyze them to determine historic water temperatures and salinity in the Gulf of Maine.

Still, she said, the middens do not get much attention. “A lot of people just don’t know these things exist,” said Ms. Miller. “It’s just not a focus.”

During the radar surveys, Dr. Kelley’s team had some unpleasant surprises. In one case, they arranged permission to survey a southern Maine midden that had been recorded 49 years ago. When the crew arrived with their equipment, they found it had vanished into the sea.

At the conference, Tom Dawson and Joanna Hambly of the University of St. Andrews described the Shorewatch program, which enlists citizens to monitor archaeological sites in Scotland that are threatened by coastal erosion.

Florida has developed a similar network, called Heritage Monitoring Scouts. Dr. Kelley hopes to develop such a program in Maine.

Dr. Soctomah said he keeps an eye on middens in eastern Maine. “We try to do a walk-by after a bad storm, when you are going to see a site getting more damage,” he said.

“It’s bad because they are disappearing so fast, and the knowledge that is within those middens will be washed out to sea.”",Native American Secrets Lie Buried in Huge Shell Mounds,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/science/native-americans-shell-middens-maine.html

After graduation, he bagged groceries, then moved into Johannesburg and took a job delivering antique furniture. He volunteered for a government-run youth league.

The Olympic torch was lit today in Greece, beginning the countdown to the next Winter Games.

The flame will travel more than 5,000 miles east to South Korea, arriving Nov. 1 — 100 days before the 2018 Olympics begin.

Photo

Starting in the city of Incheon, the torch will cross South Korea, with stops in nine provinces and eight major cities, before arriving in Pyeongchang for the opening ceremony on Feb. 9.

The lighting of the torch goes back to the ancient games, but the Olympic flame made its first modern appearance at the 1928 Games in Amsterdam. The relay began with the 1936 Games in Berlin.

The torch itself is designed by the host country. The Times noted in 2010: “The modern Olympic Games have become as much a global contest among designers and architects as among athletes. Each Olympics is expected to produce a logo, a signature building — and a characteristic torch that symbolizes local tradition and national character.”

The torch for the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul featured a bright metal body and Korean graphic elements. The five-pronged shape of the 2018 torch represents the Korean symbol for Pyeongchang.

Mr. Zarate, an immigrant from Mexico, had accrued multiple felonies. He had been deported five times since entering the United States as a youth.

Yet less than three months before the shooting, a San Francisco jail released Mr. Zarate without alerting federal agents who wanted him for questioning.

The San Francisco sheriff, Ross Mirkarimi, cited the city’s sanctuary policies.

After Ms. Steinle’s death, that decision drew condemnation from political leaders in both parties. The sheriff was ousted in a re-election campaign.

The debate over sanctuary policies has only intensified under the Trump administration and led California lawmakers to reassert the divide between the local police and federal authorities.

Ms. Steinle’s family members have said they are not opposed to the idea of sanctuary policies, but want to close loopholes that allow people like Mr. Zarate to walk free.

Those matters won’t feature in his murder trial. On Monday, a city prosecutor argued that Mr. Zarate brought a gun to the pier that summer day intending to kill, according to news accounts from inside the courtroom.

A public defender countered that Mr. Zarate had found the weapon only moments before the killing and accidentally fired a bullet that ricocheted off the pavement before striking Ms. Steinle.

Jim Steinle, Kate Steinle’s father, was the first witness.

In emotional testimony before a packed courtroom, The Associated Press reported, he described walking with his daughter as she was shot in the back. She collapsed into his arms, he recounted, and said, “Help me, dad.” She died hours later at a hospital.

Mr. Zarate’s trial is expected to last at least four weeks.

It may be autumn, but the heat isn’t quitting.

Temperature records fell like dominoes in Southern California on Monday.

A sampling, according to National Weather Service figures:

— Ramona, San Diego County, hit 101 degrees, up from a record of 97 in 2003

— Downtown Los Angeles, 102 degrees, up from 98 in 1965

— Riverside, 102 degrees, up from 101 in 1959

— Santa Maria Airport, 102 degrees, up from 98 in 1965

Tuesday could bring a new round of records. The weather service expected the heat to dial up higher still.

With forecasts also calling for strong Santa Ana winds, fire officials said they were bracing for extreme fire danger.

At 5:08 p.m. in Dodger Stadium, when the first pitch is scheduled for Game 1 of the World Series, the temperature is expected to be about 97 degrees, which would be a record high for a Series game.

That’s bad news for the starting pitchers, Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers and Dallas Keuchel of the Astros.

Research has shown baseballs travel farther in hot weather.

When a draft-evading bone-spur bozo takes on a man of character who put his life on the line for his country and knows what the United States means to the world, the result can only be ugly. Trump will look very small. He will look smaller than his fingers, as small as his spite. No puffed-up chest, no jutting upraised chin will be able to conceal the zero at his heart.

Speaking of putting one’s life on the line, Sgt. La David T. Johnson was the soldier killed early this month in Niger, along with three other American servicemen. Trump, after consulting John F. Kelly, his chief of staff, elected to call the soldier’s widow, Myeshia Johnson, to express his condolences, a risky undertaking for a man who knows nothing of dignity. The president, predictably, blew it.

He said Sergeant Johnson knew what he signed up for. (Trump denies this, but Kelly confirmed the president used these words.)

Wilson, the congresswoman, is a family friend of the Johnsons. She listened to the call. She told reporters about the offense given to the widow. This enraged Trump, who deployed his “wacky” epithet, and upset Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general whose son was killed in Afghanistan. Kelly unwisely decided to come to the defense of his boss.

Kelly’s speech the other day was moving at the outset in its description of ritual and loss. He spoke of “the most important phone calls” for any grieving family. His gravitas was a reminder of all that has been lost in the tacky Trump White House. But then he descended into gross, unprofessional calumny.

Alluding to Wilson’s speech at the dedication in 2015 of an F.B.I. building in South Florida, named for two fallen agents, Kelly described the congresswoman as an “empty barrel” who was “making the most noise.” He falsely accused her of bragging about securing $20 million for the building and of saying she’d twisted President Barack Obama’s arm for funding.

Semper Fi. Well, Semper Fi-ish. Kelly owes Wilson an apology.

There’s a video of Wilson’s speech. She’s wearing a red hat. She’s brash. Kelly evidently found her tone inappropriate. But she did what people do at a ribbon-cutting ceremony, acknowledging lawmakers of both parties, and did not utter the words attributed to her by Kelly.

“Empty barrel” is interesting. Barrels are often locked in the dark in cellars and warehouses. They evoke guns, too. Wilson is black. The Johnsons are black. This is a president who laces contempt for African-Americans into everyday discourse. Lying about them, disparaging them, dehumanizing them, is just business as usual. Why should a four-star general bestir himself over getting his facts wrong or describing a black woman as a barrel?

Because Kelly has some notion of the American idea, knows the military depends on equal value being given to every life, and must understand that when truth dies America is lost.

The empty-barrel bone-spur bozo at the White House can’t apologize or get that. It’s beyond him.

Here’s McCain speaking this month on the America that’s bigger than Trump:

“To refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain ‘the last best hope of earth’ for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.

Some blame the industry’s demise on the government’s refusal in 2013 to come to the rescue of the country’s automakers as they were battered by a high Australian dollar, high production costs and a shrinking domestic market.

Union officials estimated about 30,000 people lost their jobs as a result of the recent closures. In the area north of Adelaide, which has at times had South Australia’s highest unemployment rate and where Holden was the largest employer, nearly 1,000 people were left looking for work as a result of the automakers decision to cease production.

Leading politicians expressed dismay at the fate of the domestic auto industry.

“Personally, I feel very sad, as we all do, for the end of an era,” Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said during a radio interview on Friday. He added that the majority of workers in Elizabeth had either found new employment, decided to go back to school or retired.

But union representatives said most of the laid-off workers will never get work in the manufacturing industry again.

The average length of service among those at the plant was about 20 years, according to the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, and the average age of those affected by the closure was about 38.

But John Camillo, the union’s secretary in South Australia, said it was the workers over 50 that were particularly struggling to find new employment.

“It’s difficult out there, especially here in Adelaide,” Mr. Camillo said.

The decision to stop making cars in Australia reflects “the perfect storm of negative influences the car industry faces,” Mr. Turnbull said. He pointed to the continued strength of the Australian dollar, high production costs, and a small domestic market that is both competitive and fragmented.

The small size of the domestic car industry made it almost impossible to compete against foreign automakers.

“It just didn’t reach the scale of operation,” said John W. Freebairn, an economics professor at the University of Melbourne. “You have to compete with the smart U.S. manufacturers, the Japanese, the South Koreans and so on who are producing several hundred thousand units a year. Our guys were nowhere near that.”

But the Sanders approach didn’t work for George McGovern in 1972 or Michael Dukakis in 1988, and I don’t believe it will work for Democrats in 2018 or 2020.

Yes, recent polls seem to indicate rising support for single payer. But when factors like whether taxes would be raised or the Affordable Care Act would be repealed are introduced, the consensus swings to opposition.

Spellbound Democrats should also consider the fate of past single payer proposals. In Sanders’s home state of Vermont, a single payer plan was abandoned after an analysis found that it would require a near doubling of the state budget (and increasing taxes similarly).

In Colorado last November, a whopping 80 percent of voters rejected a universal plan, again over taxes and costs. And for similar reasons, California recently shelved a single-payer proposal.

Amid the many complications of Medicare for All, the question of what would happen to the 157 million Americans who get their insurance from their employers and the 19 million who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage loom large.

More like the starting point of a political nightmare for Democrats. For one thing, Mr. Sanders has been unabashed in his attacks on “the establishment wing of the Democratic Party” and has intimated that primary challenges may be in the offing.

For another, when the Republicans unleash their inevitable blitzkrieg, I doubt voters will recognize the subtleties in positions like Mr. Franken’s.

Privately, many moderate Democratic senators are harshly critical of Sanders’s tactics. “It’s radioactive for me,” one Democrat facing re-election in 2018 told me.

But publicly, even Democratic senators who have declined to endorse Medicare for All have done so in measured terms to avoid antagonizing the progressives.

“The first thing has to be to protect the health care people have now and stabilize markets,” said Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.

Instead of Medicare for All, we Democrats should be focused on “Better Jobs for All” — big ideas for addressing our most pressing economic challenge. That is: the wage stagnation that has left too many Americans behind, particularly white working-class men.

That’s not an easy problem to solve, but we know the solutions revolve around people-centric initiatives like improving education, providing more training and retraining and increasing worker mobility.

To buttress those programs, it’s time to move ahead with rebuilding our infrastructure and restoring government investment spending on research and development.

In doing so, let’s not forget that only about a quarter of voters consider themselves liberals; the balance self-identify as moderates or conservatives.

Our model of democratic capitalism has stood us well for more than two centuries; now is not the time to embrace the kinds of ideas, often involving deep government economic intervention, that have often fallen short elsewhere, notably in much of Europe.

I’m interested in your complaint about how the current rules require that tax reform not add to the deficit.","Bret: Good point about Trump taking credit. But Trump takes credit for anything, and I’d hate to begrudge Americans economic growth just because it might help the president politically.

The larger point, though, is that Trumpism is fueled by a sense of economic anxiety that has exploded into fury, and there is no curing that until growth in the real economy (not just the stock market) resumes and creates a genuine sense of mobility and opportunity. If the rich benefit disproportionately it is only because they pay a disproportionate share of taxes.

Gail: The rich pay more taxes, but if they get a cut, they’re more likely to just sock it away. It’s the non-rich who go out and use the new income to buy stuff. That in turn gins up the economy.

Bret: So here is where we get to the root of our differences on taxes. When the rich “sock it away,” that only means that they are spending or investing, which is to say, putting the money into the real economy just like everyone else. They create jobs when they build a second home or become angel investors in a promising start-up or reinvest in their own businesses. Yes, it’s “trickle down” economics. No doubt most of our readers agree with me entirely!

That being said, I’m sorry that this isn’t the kind of bipartisan tax reform we had under Reagan in 1981 or 1986, when Democratic senators like Bill Bradley and congressmen like Dan Rostenkowski and Dick Gephardt were backers of the legislation.

The result is that the only reform we can get now, to avoid a presumptive Democratic filibuster, is through the parliamentary shenanigan known as budget reconciliation. And budget reconciliation requires that tax reform not add to the deficit, which leads to some pretty bad ideas, like a border tax or slashing the 401(k) deductibility limit to balance the books.

I’m interested in your complaint about how the current rules require that tax reform not add to the deficit. Do you think the deficit isn’t a problem?

Bret: I only worry about deficits in extended periods of slow growth. Nobody thinks of Carter-era stagflation as a prosperous time for the United States, but the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio was low: just under 31 percent in 1980 as opposed to around twice that in the middle of the Clinton boom. And there are times when the government has legitimate reasons to spend a lot of money and pile on debt, like winning World War II under Roosevelt or the Cold War under Reagan. We should never hold public prosperity hostage for the sake of a statistical artifact dear mostly to anally retentive deficit scolds preaching “The end is nigh!”

But I think you’ve put your finger on something essential. Bipartisanship is moribund under this president because he’s thrashed the concept and possibility of trust in politics. There was a brief ray of hope last month when he seemed ready to strike a deal on DACA, but that seems to have collapsed, too.

Speaking of trust, do you trust General Kelly?

Gail: Do you remember those days of yore when everybody presumed Trump wouldn’t blow up the planet because he had those three sensible generals hovering in the background? Generals who were undoubtedly working out a plan among themselves for how to put a lid on the president if he tried to drop a bomb on North Korea?

Seems so quaint now. As out of date as the theory that Ivanka and Jared would turn him into a social moderate so their New York friends wouldn’t give them the cold shoulder.

How about you?

Bret: Trump single-handedly destroys the theory of containment. Nothing and nobody contains him. And he tarnishes everything and everyone around him. He’s like a hyper-empowered schlemiel — I’m using the Yiddish word for the guy who proverbially spills his borscht all over you — while turning the rest of us into his schlimazels, the ones who get spilled on.

The latest political fiasco involving Trump’s condolence calls is such a case in point. This should be the one thing every president ought to be able to get right. But Trump couldn’t help but turn an accusatory political finger at Barack Obama, which was wrong on fact, wretched as principle and dumb as politics. And then Kelly, for whom I used to have nothing but admiration, soiled his own moment by defending the president and needlessly pointing an accusatory finger at Representative Frederica Wilson, which once again turned out to be wrong on fact, wretched as principle and dumb as politics.

When did people forget when to know how to leave well enough alone? Like, you know, Bill O’Reilly.

Gail: Yow, I’m not sure the concept of “let alone” is one O’Reilly ever mastered.

But about Trump — we’re seeing more and more outcry from traditional Republicans. George W. Bush made a powerful speech last week. Senator Corker from Tennessee has done everything but picket the White House. John McCain has been incredible. But none of it seems to have any impact on the base. Really coming to dread that base.

What do you think is going to happen to the party? Will it be Bannonized? Split in two?

Bret: I fear the worst. The only people who seem to be standing up to Bannon are either retiring, retired or gravely ill. But where’s Paul Ryan? What about Mitch McConnell? Watching him standing alongside Trump in that Rose Garden ceremony the other day was like watching a hostage video. “Stockholm syndrome” is something conservatives used to accuse liberals of suffering from. Ha! Today it’s the so-called establishment Republicans who have fallen in love with their mad captor.

Gail: Yeah, if he wasn’t around, they’d be forced to give up their good office space to the other side.

Bret: All parties have their extremists; every political persuasion has its fanatical tendency. Republicans have spent the past 60 or so years trying to dissociate themselves from their nativist, isolationist, ethnonationalist wing only to fall right back into it. It’s like a man falling off the wagon after decades of sobriety.

I don’t think the party of Reagan will survive Trumpism. Those of us who subscribe to some version or another of moderate conservatism are going to have to find a new political home, either alongside centrist, Clinton-style Democrats — who, I hope, will hold the Democratic reins in 2020 — or in an entirely new party, the Party of Sanity. As someone once said to somebody, 4,000 or so years ago, surely there must be 10 good people left in this wicked city.

Gail: I suspect that in a Trump-free world, the moderate Republicans and the Clinton-style Democrats would notice they still have a lot — not in common. Such as taxes. But it’s amazing how the current occupant of the White House has managed to bring us together.

Should we thank him? O.K., I guess not.

Happy United Nations Day, Bret. And next week it’s Halloween. Who are you going trick-or-treating as?

Nor would Mrs. Obama comment.

Kim Sajet, the Portrait Gallery’s director, would only divulge that Mrs. Obama and Ms. Sherald have already met about the portrait, that the paintings typically involve multiple sittings and that this year’s subjects chose the artists from about 20 portfolios submitted by the curators. The first lady has to personally approve the finished work, as does the Portrait Gallery’s advisory board.

The Smithsonian plans to pay for both works with $500,000 in private donations of which $300,000 has been raised so far. This amount covers everything including each artist’s fees, which Ms. Sajet would not specify. Ms. Sherald’s paintings typically sell for $15,000 to $25,000.

There is no prescribed format for an official portrait, Ms. Sajet said, except that it be a painting — not a work on paper — and that the artists “be respectful of both the person and the position they hold.”

Official portraits have ranged from “highly formal to much more relaxed,” Ms. Sajet added, citing as examples Ron Sherr’s 1994 portrait of George H. W. Bush standing in a suit and tie at the White House and Robert Anderson’s 2008 likeness of George W. Bush in an open-collared shirt on a couch at Camp David.

The selection of Ms. Sherald, who typically depicts African-Americans doing everyday things — two women in bathing suits, a man holding a child — has historical significance. “It’s as if she’s saying, ‘Let’s be clear: the President and I are African Americans and proudly so,” Mr. Staiti said, “and these portraits are going to have an African-American vibe — they’re going to break out of that rather staid tradition. I think it’s important and I think it’s political,” he added, referring to Mrs. Obama’s choice.

While Ms. Sherald could not discuss her interactions with Mrs. Obama, the way she generally works offers clear insights into her likely process with the former first lady. She invites her subjects to her studio here, where she photographs them in an outfit she has selected for them. Or, she said, she may go to their homes to “shop from their closets” and photograph them there.

Ms. Sherald always shoots her subjects outdoors with natural light. “I like the way it highlights the textures of the skin,” she said.

The commission represents something of a departure for Ms. Sherald; she usually chooses subjects who arrest her attention on the street, in an airport. She literally approaches strangers.

“I would wonder how she’d feel about this leading to commissions of other prominent people,” Mr. Staiti said. “She’s interested in the exact opposite; she’s interested in ordinariness.”

Ms. Sherald said how much the selection means to her, how Mrs. Obama loomed large in her life, though they had not previously met. “We’ve been on a first-name basis for eight years,” she said jokingly. “Seeing her made my world better.”

Photo

“She’s an archetype that a lot of women can relate to — no matter shape, size, race or color,” Ms. Sherald added. “We see our best selves in her.”

Ms. Sherald has yet to start the Obama portrait, though it is due to be finished by year’s end. “I’m not going home for the holidays,” she said with a laugh.

Yet sitting among her paint tubes — their colors smeared on paper plates — with three canvases-in-progress leaning against the walls, Ms. Sherald seemed remarkably calm in the face of such a daunting deadline, perhaps because she has confronted far tougher challenges.

Ms. Sherald is a survivor of congestive heart failure, diagnosed at age 30 just as she was earning her master’s degree at the Maryland Institute College of Art and was training for a triathlon. She received a transplant at 39.

She interrupted her career again, taking a four-year break to care for two ailing relatives back in her hometown Columbus, Ga. She lost her father, a dentist, to Parkinson’s in 2000; her brother to lung cancer in 2012.

But she does not think of herself as unlucky. In fact, she said she is keenly aware of those less fortunate around her — like children in her own community who are aging out of foster care. (One block from her studio, she said she “can see 10 addicts at any given time.”) Ms. Sherald, who has taught art in the Baltimore City Detention Center, hopes to give back financially as soon as she pays off her school loans and can more easily afford her extensive medication: 13 different pills a day.

“When I look at those people,” she said, “I see myself.”

Ms. Sherald isn’t very far from the days when she waited tables and worked in a studio without heat or air-conditioning.

Her parents wanted her to go to medical school, but Ms. Sherald knew that she was an artist. “I don’t feel like I chose to do it,” she said. “I don’t know what else I’m good at.”

Photo

She began with bald self-portraits — she shaved her own head for a time — and then moved into more fantastical work that explored the idea of circus, and fantasy.

Ms. Sherald’s cultural influences range from the science fiction writer Octavia Butler to the Surrealist painter Salvador Dalí and Tim Burton’s quirky movie, “Big Fish.” Names that come up in conversation include the poet David Whyte, the public radio host Krista Tippett — and Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Over the years, Ms. Sherald’s figurative painting has evolved into a stylized realism — a gray skin palette punctuated by colorful pieces of clothing on a flat plane. She makes only about 13 paintings a year. “It’s hard for me to find people to paint,” she said. “There has got to be something about them that only I can see.”

“They exist in a place of the past, the present and the future,” she added. “It’s like something I sense with my spirit more than my mind.”

Ms. Sherald only paints African-Americans. Having studied European art history, she is keenly aware of the scarcity of black faces. “There’s not enough images of us,” she said.

Last year she had her first solo show at Monique Meloche’s Chicago gallery and became the first woman to win the Portrait Gallery’s Outwin Boochever competition. Now there are waiting lists for her work.

“Everybody responds to her paintings,” Ms. Meloche said. “There is something that’s so alive in these characters; they’re very calm — but they’re still very confrontational.”","After a Late Start, an Artist’s Big Break: Michelle Obama’s Official Portrait",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/arts/design/amy-sherald-michelle-obama-official-portrait.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Facial recognition is another troubling surveillance technology whose use is on the rise. Half of American adults are already in a law enforcement facial recognition network. Merged with police body camera technology, facial recognition could facilitate increased surveillance and the erosion of the anonymity most citizens assume when they go about their business. The New York Police Department’s body camera policy, which was adopted after consulting with the public, does not prohibit the use of facial recognition.

The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and Upturn, a technology and policy research group, last year examined the body camera policies of 51 police departments across the country, including those in Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston. Of the 51 departments, none put strict limits on the merger of facial recognition and body camera technology, and only six departments had even partial limitations in place.

Americans should be aware of the rules governing this type of surveillance in their jurisdiction. It’s one thing to be identified by the police once you’re detained; it’s another for the police to be able to identify you at a distance without having to say a word to you.

This use of facial recognition could potentially have a stifling effect on First Amendment-protected activity such as protests. Citizens may be less willing to take part if they think the police are able to catalog their participation and see where else they’ve appeared in public.

The same concern applies to drones, which, although still comparatively rare, will also be a regular part of police departments’ tool kits soon. The New York Police Department has in the past strongly resisted calls for information about its drone records.

Americans care about this. Analysis of online behavior suggests, unsurprisingly, that some changed their online search behavior after Edward Snowden’s revelations that the National Security Agency had engaged in widespread internet surveillance.

The relationship between security and liberty is often described as a balancing act. This act can’t take place if we’re not informed about the technology used to safeguard our security.

That’s why, when it comes to surveillance technology, the American people should demand to know whether the police are spying on them. At the moment, those who are suspected of being Muslim extremists are prime targets, and innocent people caught in this effort face immediate concerns. In the past, Communists, civil rights leaders, feminists, Quakers, folk singers, war protesters and others have been on the receiving end of law enforcement surveillance.

No one knows who the next target will be. What we do know is that it’s difficult to put surveillance equipment back in the box it came from.","When It Comes to Surveillance, Watch the Watchmen",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/opinion/police-surveillance.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Back in April, Facebook provided users with “Tips to Spot False News” in an article that was linked above users’ news feeds.","Since the 2016 presidential campaign, Facebook has taken a number of actions to prevent the continued distribution of false news articles on its platform, most notably by labeling articles rated as false or misleading by fact checkers as “disputed.”

But how effective are these measures?

To date, Facebook has offered little information to the public other than a recent email to fact checkers asserting that labeled articles receive 80 percent fewer impressions. But more data is necessary to determine the success of these efforts. Research (including my own) suggests the need to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of Facebook’s interventions.

Yale’s Gordon Pennycook and David Rand offer two principal warnings. First, the effects of exposure to false information are not easily countered by labeling, as they find in a paper they wrote with Tyrone D. Cannon. False information we have previously encountered feels more familiar, producing a feeling of fluency that causes us to rate it as more accurate than information we have not seen before. This effect persists even when Facebook-style warnings label a headline “disputed.” We should be cautious about assuming that labels tagging articles as false are enough to prevent misinformation on social media from affecting people’s beliefs.

Photo

In a second paper, Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand find that the presence of “disputed” labels causes study participants to rate unlabeled false stories as slightly more accurate — an “implied truth” effect. If Facebook is seen as taking responsibility for the accuracy of information in its news feed through labeling, readers could start assuming that unlabeled stories have survived scrutiny from fact checkers (which is rarely correct — there are far too many for humans to check everything).

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Encouragingly, my students at Dartmouth College and I find that the effects of Facebook-style “disputed” banners on the perceived accuracy of false headlines are larger than those Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand observed. The proportion of respondents rating a false headline as “somewhat” or “very accurate” in our study decreased to 19 percent with the standard Facebook “disputed” banner, from 29 percent in the unlabeled condition. It goes down even further, to 16 percent, when the warning instead states that the headline is “rated false.” (We find no evidence of a large “implied truth” effect, though we lack the statistical precision necessary to detect effects of the size Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand measure.)

Other results suggest further reason for caution. Back in April, Facebook provided users with “Tips to Spot False News” in an article that was linked above users’ news feeds. We find that general warnings of this sort are also potentially counterproductive. When we showed a warning reminding users to “remain skeptical” and “think critically” to spot misleading articles, it did reduce belief in the accuracy of false news headlines somewhat — but it also somewhat reduced the perceived accuracy of news articles that were not false. Readers seemed to become more skeptical of all the headlines that they encountered. (A similar effect was not observed for the fact-check banners.)",Why the Fact-Checking at Facebook Needs to Be Checked,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/upshot/why-the-fact-checking-at-facebook-needs-to-be-checked.html

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect.
Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive.
“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city.","Devastated by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Photo

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

So much history. So much pain. The humble, scorned and wacky outer-borough Dodgers had played and lost two earlier World Series before finally meeting the Yankees in 1941 — a harbinger of hideous things to come.

In the fourth game that year, the Dodgers were one strike away from tying the Series except that the catcher, Mickey Owen, missed a third strike on Tommy Henrich, thrown by Hugh Casey, which just may have been a spitter: hard to hit, hard to catch.

This was my family legacy as a kid in Queens. Brooklyn was the mother ship and the Dodgers were the good guys, doing the right thing, signing black players and repeatedly reaching the World Series.

1949: I rush home from grade school just in time to hear Tommy Henrich (yes, the same guy from 1941) hit a home run off Don Newcombe in Game 1 and set a tone for a five-game loss.

(I am not the only person whose life was affected by these tragedies. Fast forward four decades to an Old-Timer’s Day in Yankee Stadium. My good friend Steve Jacobson of Newsday is typing his column in the press room and Henrich walks past him, headed toward the men’s room. “You!” Jacobson says to Henrich, who does not necessarily know him. “You ruined my childhood. I couldn’t concentrate in school. I was never the same.” Henrich regards him for a moment and says, “Tough!” — or words to that effect. “What were you going to be, a doctor?” Probably not. Henrich proceeds to the men’s room.)

1952: The intraleague terror from the Phillies in 1950 (Richie Ashburn! Dick Sisler!) and the Giants in 1951 (Bobby Thomson!) are now terrible recent history. I am coming home from junior high, waiting for a bus, watching Game 7 on a television in a store window. The Dodgers are two runs down in the seventh inning but the bases are loaded, and Jackie Robinson hits a high pop-up into the wind and sun. The Yankees cannot track the ball until Billy Martin comes running from second base to catch the ball two feet off the ground and halfway to home plate. I take the bus home, and by the time I arrive the Dodgers have lost, again.

1953: My dad has come up with a ticket for Game 5, my first World Series game. I take three subway lines to Ebbets Field, sit way up behind center field. In the third inning, Russ Meyer relieves Johnny Podres. Bases loaded. Mickey Mantle hits a ball that gets bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and lands in the stands not far from me for a grand slam. The Dodgers lose the next game and the Series.

1955: Brooklyn fans always talk about Next Year. The seventh game is taking place in Yankee Stadium and I am playing defense for the Jamaica High soccer team against Brooklyn Automotive in the Borough of Churches. Somebody in the stands has a transistor radio and I edge toward the sideline to catch the score. Our coach notices and I am subbed at halftime — benched for the rest of the season. (Truth is, I was terrible.) Sandy Amoros makes a marvelous catch in left field and, as we head for the subway, bells are ringing all over Brooklyn as the Dodgers have won the Series.

1956: I am standing in the parking lot at Hofstra College, listening to Game 5. Don Larsen has a perfect game going for the Yankees. The umpire calls a third strike on Dale Mitchell. The pitch was outside. I saw it on the radio. In the seventh game, Berra unloads on Newcombe. Next Year was fun, while it lasted.

One season later, the Dodgers move to Los Angeles in a land grab described by Ry Cooder in his marvelous album, “Chávez Ravine.” Fired up by Dick Young’s writing in The Daily News, I believe the Dodger owner Walter O’Malley is the worst person in the world. I trudge toward theoretical adulthood, feeling the world is against me.

What have I learned from all these World Series? That fringe players often decide Series games — in moments like Lavagetto’s hit and Al Gionfriddo’s catch off DiMaggio in 1947, the last major-league plays for both of them, described in a charming recent book, “Electric October: Seven World Series Games, Six Lives, Five Minutes of Fame That Lasted Forever,” by Kevin Cook.

Despite his rocky start in the city, Mr. Konate said last month that he did not regret the move.
“I remember the date because that was a big day for me,” Mr. Konate recalled.
This fall Mr. Konate started taking classes part time at Hostos Community College in the Bronx; his tuition is covered by a scholarship.
Mr. Konate has applied for a green card through the Special Immigrant Juveniles program, which helps young foreigners who were abused, abandoned or neglected.","Mr. Konate does not know if his father is still alive, but he is haunted by the stories of what happened to others who disobeyed the president. When a neighbor who was saving to build a youth shelter refused to give money to the government, his throat was slit, he said. Others were beaten to death.

The president, Amadou Toumani Touré, was ousted in a coup in 2012, but that did not improve Mr. Konate’s circumstances. He watched through a window as rebels drove down the streets of Bamako, the capital. His school there was closed for six months, as jihadists forbid classes, a restriction that continues in the central and northern regions, according to a recent Amnesty International report.

That same year, Mr. Konate’s uncle, who had supported him and his mother, died; he also left behind his wife and five children. So in 2013, when a family friend suggested that Mr. Konate stay with her in New York City to finish his senior year of high school, he accepted. But it was not the American experience he had imagined. She expected him to work, not go to school. He soon left her home, rented a room and worked odd jobs washing cars and delivering food for the next year.

Despite his rocky start in the city, Mr. Konate said last month that he did not regret the move.

“Always, always I was thinking, Maybe I want to go back to Mali,” he recalled. “But then I’d think about my life before, and I’d know that I couldn’t go back.”

At Create Young Adult Residences, a transitional housing program in Harlem for men 18 to 25, he lifted his pant leg to reveal blotchy pink skin. Pointing to a long dark line crossing his arm, he noted, “This is from a knife.” They are the scars of doing business at a market in Bamako, where he worked to support his mother in his father’s absence.

The housing center is affiliated with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Mr. Konate has been living there since May.

Before finding that stability, he would spend his spare time on a bench in Central Park, marveling at the gleaming Manhattan buildings and chatting with African pedicab drivers and other passers-by.

“I’d see these people in the park, and they were so happy,” he said. “And I’d think, I don’t even know what I’m going to eat today. And I’d ask myself, When am I going to be happy like them?”

His opportunity came one day when a stranger approached his bench. Inspired by his story, she promised to help him enroll in school.

On March 16, 2015, a Monday morning, he finally walked up the gray stone steps of Harlem Renaissance High School and pushed through the powder-blue double doors.

“I remember the date because that was a big day for me,” Mr. Konate recalled. “I was finally going back to school. I walked in that first day, and I said: ‘Thank God, I’m back in school. I’ll do my best to get my education.’”

He excelled in math. “Numbers made it easier — I didn’t need English to solve math,” said Mr. Konate, who did not learn English until he moved to New York. He added, “I like to solve my own problems.”

He worked through the summer, performed autobiographical poetry at a spoken-word event and graduated in June 2016. Now he works night shifts as a busboy at a restaurant on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, sending $250 to $400 a month to his mother and his uncle’s children in Mali.

This fall Mr. Konate started taking classes part time at Hostos Community College in the Bronx; his tuition is covered by a scholarship. In August, Catholic Charities used $360 from the Neediest Cases Fund to buy him college textbooks and a graphing calculator. He plans to study civil engineering, an interest he developed working in construction in Mali, where he enjoyed “taking an idea and making something new,” he said. He also hopes to delve into human rights issues, with a particular interest in the Young African Leaders Initiative and Unicef.

Mr. Konate has applied for a green card through the Special Immigrant Juveniles program, which helps young foreigners who were abused, abandoned or neglected. He expects an interview with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services within six months. Waiting, he follows the conflict back home closely.

Eugene Smith Memorial Fund’s 2017 grant in Humanistic Photography for his project on the European migrant and refugee crisis.

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Photo

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

“When we put out a call last summer for freeways without a future, we got almost 75 recommendations,” she said.
It skirted the city’s waterfront and was demolished instead of rebuilt after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
“We had to make the big argument, the Jane Jacobs argument, that the freeway was harmful to the whole city,” he said.","One of the groups leading the new charge is Congress for the New Urbanism. Since 2008, it has published a biennial list called “Freeways Without Futures,” which names highways whose elimination would, according to its website, “remove a blight” from their cities. The 2017 edition includes Route 710 in Pasadena, Calif., Interstate 70 in Denver, Interstate 375 in Detroit and, paved enemy No. 1, the Scajaquada Expressway.

Lynn Richards, the president and chief executive officer of C.N.U., said that removing a highway is “a somewhat radical idea.” “There’s a lot of analysis that needs to go into it about where the traffic is going to go,” she said.

But already, several cities have removed or decommissioned existing highways, including Paris; Seoul, South Korea; Boston; and Portland, Ore. Last year, Rochester buried a portion of a downtown expressway known as the Inner Loop, a stretch of sunken highway the city’s mayor likened to a “moat.” It is being replaced with a boulevard on the same grade as the rest of the streetscape.

And because of a confluence of factors, including the embrace of ride-hailing services like Uber and the rebirth of cities as places to live, work, raise families and retire to, advocates like Ms. Richards see an “incredible opportunity” to remove even more pavement. “When we put out a call last summer for freeways without a future, we got almost 75 recommendations,” she said. “This can kick-start a conversation about the best way to spend infrastructure dollars.”

Many in-city highways were built during the post-World War II boom years with easy money from the 1956 Federal-Aid Highway Act. They hail from an age when the automobile was ascendant and were built to quickly move commuters in and out of urban centers; many of these highways were used by white suburbanites and built in low-income minority neighborhoods (“white men’s roads through black men’s homes,” went a saying in Washington).

Perhaps the greatest argument that removal advocates have is that so much of this infrastructure is nearing the end of its life span. In this era of tight budgets and political gridlock, it may be cheaper for local and state governments to remove a freeway rather than repair or build a new one.

If it sounds counterintuitive, if not crazy, to tear down a highway that still carries thousands of cars and trucks each day, there are a number of case studies to point to. One of the earliest and, to advocates, most successful, was San Francisco’s double-decker Embarcadero Freeway. It skirted the city’s waterfront and was demolished instead of rebuilt after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.

“The Embarcadero came out of the waterfront, and now the waterfront real estate is seeing tremendous value,” said Peter Park, a city planner in favor of removing highways in cities where neighborhoods have been “significantly disconnected.”

Not only in San Francisco but also in every case where a highway has been removed, Mr. Park argues, “the city has improved.”

Mr. Park was the planning director for Milwaukee when the city decommissioned the Park East Freeway spur in 2002. Less than a mile long, the highway hosted traffic snarls each day, but it had its supporters, especially among suburban commuters and truck drivers, and there was concern about what would happen if it was removed.

“The basic argument for it was, people will never get to the city without it,” said John Norquist, Milwaukee’s mayor at the time, who spearheaded the removal campaign. “Well, how do they get to Paris? The arguments were left over from this glorious age of motoring after World War II.”

The bill to demolish the Park East and restore the street grid was around $30 million, significantly less than the $80 to $100 million estimated cost to rebuild the 40-year-old freeway, Mr. Norquist said. He pointed to the rising land values and the slow-but-steady development along the 26-acre corridor in the years since — and the lack of a traffic apocalypse — as signs of success.

Mr. Norquist, who went on to run Congress for the New Urbanism for a decade and is now a semiretired consultant, said removing a highway is not just about addressing local residents’ concerns. “We had to make the big argument, the Jane Jacobs argument, that the freeway was harmful to the whole city,” he said.","Once So Chic and Swooshy, Freeways Are Falling Out of Favor",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/21/style/the-end-of-freeways.html

Spit-grilled chicken (pollo a la brasa) is popular all over Latin America. But it’s the Peruvian version that’s best known here in the United States, buoyed by the many restaurants that serve the bird in all its burnished, garlic-scented, drippings-slicked glory. Usually, they serve a spicy, creamy cilantro sauce alongside that is the perfect complement — and delicious in its own right.

Peruvian chicken is worth learning to make at home because few things beat the crackling skin of a home-roasted chicken, especially when it’s been marinated in garlic, chiles and plenty of spices.

To mimic the juiciness and char of a grill, in this version the chicken is split down the middle before roasting at high heat. You can ask your butcher to do this or go at it yourself with a pair of sturdy kitchen shears; it’s not at all hard. Or substitute a cut-up bird, removing the breasts from the oven a few minutes before the legs and thighs so the white meat doesn’t dry out.

Photo

Before roasting, you’ll need to marinate the chicken.

Even in Peru, the precise ingredients of the marinade are flexible, varying from region to region, cook to cook. In the mountainous parts of the country, pollo a la brasa is often a highly spiced bird imbued with garlic, chiles, cumin, paprika and either dark beer or soy sauce (an ingredient adopted from the country’s large Asian-Peruvian population). In Lima, you might see chickens seasoned more simply, with just a sprinkling of salt, to round out the smokiness of the grill.

Peruvian-style chickens in the United States tend to follow the more assertively flavored route. In this recipe, a full six cloves of garlic ensure its pungent dominance, while chile pastes from both aji amarillo and aji panca chiles lend plenty of complex heat. If you can’t find the Peruvian chile pastes (which are available at Latin American groceries and online), don’t fret. As long as you add some kind of chile paste or sauce for heat and brightness, this dish will maintain its vibrant balance. Even sriracha or sambal will work in a pinch.

Photo

While the chicken roasts, whip up the spicy cilantro sauce to serve alongside. Like the marinade, there are dozens of versions of this creamy, rich mix. Some recipes call for peanuts to give the sauce body and heft, others rely on mayo. This one uses feta cheese for a salty bite. Then slather it liberally over the bird, because the combination of spiced, crispy chicken skin and the creamy herb sauce is magical — particularly when it’s been made by you.

Recipe: Peruvian Roasted Chicken With Spicy Cilantro Sauce

And to Drink ...

One of my favorite combinations is roast chicken and a savory northern Rhône syrah. Actually, I like peppery northern Rhône reds, with their black-olive tang, to accompany almost any sort of chicken dish, and this spicy, bright Peruvian recipe will make an excellent pairing. You could try a good St.-Joseph or a Cornas, or you could splurge on a Côte-Rôtie or Hermitage, though those wines need a good 10 years of age to shine. As alternatives, some really good syrahs are coming from cooler-climate regions of California and Washington State, and from Australia as well. Want something else? Modest pinot noirs from Oregon or California will be delicious. You could try reds from Ribeira Sacra in Spain, or Chinon and Saumur-Champigny in the Loire Valley. Beaujolais would be a natural.

Back Story

The Olympic torch was lit today in Greece, beginning the countdown to the next Winter Games.

The flame will travel more than 5,000 miles east to South Korea, arriving Nov. 1 — 100 days before the 2018 Olympics begin.

Photo

Starting in the city of Incheon, the torch will cross South Korea, with stops in nine provinces and eight major cities, before arriving in Pyeongchang for the opening ceremony on Feb. 9.

The lighting of the torch goes back to the ancient games, but the Olympic flame made its first modern appearance at the 1928 Games in Amsterdam. The relay began with the 1936 Games in Berlin.

The torch itself is designed by the host country. The Times noted in 2010: “The modern Olympic Games have become as much a global contest among designers and architects as among athletes. Each Olympics is expected to produce a logo, a signature building — and a characteristic torch that symbolizes local tradition and national character.”

The torch for the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul featured a bright metal body and Korean graphic elements. The five-pronged shape of the 2018 torch represents the Korean symbol for Pyeongchang.

How well do air purifiers work?

In Mr. Heffernan’s in-depth test and review of HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Arrestance) air purifiers for Wirecutter, he found that on the whole, they are extremely effective at reducing the particle pollution in your home. Air purifiers capture small particles in the air that are generally not visible to the naked eye by trapping them in a dense mat of fine fibers.

To put it simply, they draw in polluted air, trap the particles, then blow out clean air.

In order to be HEPA certified, air filters have to remove 99.97 percent of particles that are exactly 0.3 microns in diameter — a size that’s especially difficult to filter mechanically. The models Wirecutter has tested were able to remove virtually all particles as small as 0.01 micron, one-thirtieth the HEPA standard.

Again, while the long-term effects of short-term smoke exposure may be low, any kind of particle pollution can still affect our health, and that pollution is more concentrated indoors — meaning nearly all of us can benefit from cleaner air.

“Most of us spend a lot of time indoors,” Mr. Heffernan said. “And indoor air is more polluted than outdoor air. It kind of comes down to what we have in our homes: pets, rugs, furniture that traps dust. And many homes are not terribly well ventilated.”

Especially if you’re older or have asthma or other respiratory conditions, you may want to consider an air purifier. All of the HEPA-certified models Mr. Heffernan tested with his colleague John Holecek were effective at removing particulate pollution.

For homes in smoke-prone areas, including those near wildfire-affected areas, Heffernan suggested running the purifier on high for an hour, then turning it down to medium or low, which should keep the amount of smoke in your home to a minimum.

How to choose an air purifier

When choosing an air purifier, it’s important to ensure first that the purifier is indeed HEPA certified; it’ll usually be listed as “true HEPA.” You’ll also want a model with a tight seal around the filter. “If it’s not well sealed, air is going to flow around the edges,” Mr. Heffernan said. “If it’s letting dirty air around the edges, you’re not getting the full effect.”

Some models may list a CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) rating. This measures the volume of air that will pass through the unit, telling you how efficiently the model will work depending on the size of the room. Mr. Heffernan suggested looking for a CADR rating of at least 200, which means the unit effectively delivers the equivalent of 200 cubic feet of pure air per minute.

These models are often recommended for smaller rooms of about 300 square feet, and they will cycle the air four to five times per hour in a room that size, ensuring that pollutants are filtered quickly. This isn’t to say a model with a 200 CADR rating won’t work in a larger room, but it will work more slowly.

If you’re looking for a more cost-effective solution, you can also upgrade your existing HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system to improve air quality.

HVAC systems come with basic filters that trap larger particles, like pet hair. You can upgrade your filter to one that traps smaller particles, as noted by the filter’s MERV rating, or Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value. This metric indicates how efficiently the filter will reduce particulates that pass through it.

The higher the number, the better the rating. According to the E.P.A., “Filters with a MERV between 7 and 13 are likely to be nearly as effective as true HEPA filters at controlling most airborne indoor particles.” There are also “whole house” purifiers that provide true HEPA filtration in HVAC systems, but these are expensive and may require upgrading your home’s air handler.

As effective as HEPA-certified air purifiers are, some come with dubious additional features. Many of them claim to produce ozone to destroy pathogens, which sounds impressive, but the California Air Resources Board warns against them. Ozone, or O3, is a respiratory system irritant that can cause health problems.

A 2008 ARB report said the “introduction of any amount of ozone into indoor spaces may result in increased levels of formaldehyde, ultrafine particles, and other pollutants.” In fact, if you are indeed in California, you may not even be able to order these types of units on Amazon.

Many purifiers claim to reduce VOCs, or volatile organic compounds, using an activated charcoal filter. “Very few of them actually do,” Mr. Heffernan added. “It comes down to the mass of the activated charcoal filter.” In order to be effective, the activated charcoal filter would have to be a minimum of five pounds to have any statistically significant effect, he said. Most contain a tiny fraction of that.

How to care for your air purifier

Maintenance of your air purifier should be minimal. Most HEPA filters are designed to run continuously for a year, though many manufacturers recommend checking them every six months. If there’s a fair amount of buildup on your filter, or you just want peace of mind, simply replace it.

Beyond purifying your air, there are additional precautions to take if you live in a smoke-adjacent area or you’re concerned about pollutants.

Many of these tips are common sense: Keep your windows closed, and avoid spending too much time outdoors to keep from bringing particulates into your home.

“I would also recommend simple tasks, like washing your sheets and pillowcases. You don’t want to spend eight to 10 hours on sheets filled with smoke,” Mr. Heffernan said. And if you’re planning to vacuum, remember that vacuuming can also kick up dust and smoke that has settled, so mopping may be a better approach.

Finally, if you’re using a paper face mask instead, or want one so you can go outside in a smoke-adjacent area, keep in mind that most of them have limited utility, as the E.P.A. points out in its guide. In order to offer adequate protection from smoke particles, you would need a mask that’s rated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as N95 or P100. These ratings indicate that the mask or respirator blocks out 95 to 99.9 percent of particles 0.3 microns or larger.

“So if you’re going to be outside and you want a mask, you need one of these certified masks,” Mr. Heffernan said. “A paper one won’t do any harm, but it shouldn’t give you a false sense of security.”",What to Know Before Buying an Air Purifier to Clear Wildfire Smoke,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/smarter-living/what-to-know-before-buying-an-air-purifier.html

“There is no question that the photo has been manipulated,” said Hany Farid, an expert in photo forensics and a professor of computer science at Dartmouth College.

Mr. Farid said the method was most likely done through Photoshop, editing software that can delete objects and refill the space. But this particular alteration was easily detectable.

Security concerns for the visit of someone as high profile as Mr. Tillerson are justified because of the Taliban’s resurgence. Last month more than 50 rockets landed at and around Kabul airport during Defense Secretary James Mattis’s visit.

But many Afghans may see the altered photo of Mr. Tillerson’s visit as evidence of a government effort to twist facts to package a positive narrative, both to its international partners as well as its citizens.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — We’re doing some heavy lifting today, so make sure you do some warm-ups. John Guzzetta and Michael Hawkins are back and are asking us to help them move.

Today’s Theme

What we are moving are the Ys at the end of the first word of each of the theme entries, like the original phrase GRAVY TRAIN at 23A. The Ys (or their sound) move to the end of the second word of each theme phrase and are then pluralized to make an entirely different phrase, which is clued in a punny way. That changes the phrase to GRAVE TRAINEES, clued as “Interns at a cemetery?”

Please remember to lift with your knees and set the Ys down gently.

Similarly, the phrase JUICY PARTS (15D) is changed to JUICE PARTIES, which are “Social gatherings where fruit drinks are served?”

In December, Nikki Haley, Trump’s nominee for ambassador to the United Nations, set up a conference call with two senior State Department officials: Kristie Kenney, the State Department counselor, and Patrick Kennedy, the under secretary of state for management.
“The people the Senate would expect to confirm have all been taken off the table.”In the early days of the administration, according to State Department officials, White House officials, especially Bannon, sent over many names for State Department posts.
“They came away with the impression that we’re very ‘patriotic’ and ‘professional,’ ” a senior State Department official says.
According to one senior State Department official, Tillerson originally wanted to cut the staff by 15 percent, until he was told that to do so the State Department would have to fire people.","On the afternoon I saw Tillerson at the State Department, he’d just returned from several hours at the White House. This was hardly unusual. When he’s in Washington, he often spends part of his workday at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in formal and informal meetings with Trump. Tillerson, a former Eagle Scout who years later served as the Boy Scouts of America’s national president, always comes prepared for those encounters, keeping a 2-inch-by-8-inch notecard in the inside pocket of his suit jacket with a handwritten list of matters he wants to discuss with the president. After meeting with Trump, he’ll then add to the list the things Trump wants him to take care of.

Many political eminences, including Tillerson’s hunting buddy, the former Secretary of State James Baker, had advised Tillerson that his relationship with Trump would be the most important factor in determining his success in his new job. And this was an area in which Tillerson, in his previous job as chief executive of Exxon Mobil, had excelled. “I have over my life had to build relationships with heads of state, not just this one, but heads of states all over the world,” he reminded me. At Exxon Mobil, he did business with a rogue’s gallery of world leaders, from Vladimir Putin (who in 2013 awarded Tillerson Russia’s Order of Friendship) to Hugo Chavez (who in 2007 seized Exxon Mobil’s assets, prompting the oil giant to leave Venezuela). I asked Tillerson if Trump had any similarities to the heads of state he dealt with as an oil executive. “Yeah, there are other leaders that share the qualities that he has,” Tillerson replied, before adding, “and I’m not gonna name names, because then you’ll go — everybody will go dissect that.”

But building a good rapport with the head of state of his own country has, so far, proved to be beyond Tillerson’s formidable abilities. According to some people who are close to Trump, his disappointment with Tillerson is as much personal as it is professional. “Trump originally thought he could have a relationship with Tillerson that’s almost social,” says one Trump adviser, “the way his relationships are with Wilbur Ross and Steve Mnuchin.” But unlike Trump’s commerce and Treasury secretaries — plutocrats who, like Trump, are on their third, younger wives — Tillerson, who is 65 and has been married to the same woman for 31 years, has shown little interest in being the president’s running buddy; instead of Saturday-night dinners with Trump at his Washington hotel, Tillerson favors trips home to Texas to see his grandchildren or to Colorado to visit his nonagenarian parents.

(The White House, provided a detailed list of questions relating to Tillerson and his relationship with Trump as described in this article, responded with the following official statement: “The president has assembled the most talented cabinet in history and everyone continues to be dedicated towards advancing the president’s America First agenda. Anything to the contrary is simply false and comes from unnamed sources who are either out of the loop or unwilling to turn the country around.”)

In his office, Tillerson contemplated what has turned out to be his most difficult diplomatic mission. “I’ve had to build a relationship with President Trump because he didn’t know me — I mean he certainly knew of me, just as I knew of him — but to understand how my thought processes work, for me to understand how his work, for me to understand how he makes decisions, because he makes decisions in a very different way than I do,” Tillerson said, spinning his fingers around his head to indicate cognition. “I’m an engineer by training. I’m a very systems, process, methodical decision maker. He’s an entrepreneur. Different mind-set. He makes decisions differently. Doesn’t mean one is better than the other, but I’ve had to learn how he processes information and how I can help him process the information and how I can give him good advice that makes sense to him. So for both of us there’s a communication to be worked out.”

Although the State Department is no longer quite the ivied redoubt it was a half-century ago, when men like George Kennan and Paul Nitze roamed the halls of Foggy Bottom and its global outposts, its employees still tend to be a bit tweedier than your ordinary government bureaucrat. This is especially true of the nearly 14,000 members of the Foreign Service, with their rigorous entrance exam and a strict up-or-out promotions system, not to mention their cosmopolitan ethos and fluency in multiple languages. They consider themselves elite.

This elite might have been more simpatico with President Barack Obama, given his appreciation of diplomacy and soft power, than with Trump, but neither of Obama’s secretaries of state was particularly beloved by the department’s rank and file. There were complaints that Hillary Clinton subordinated the department’s needs to those of her political ambitions, creating a new and unwieldy cadre of special envoys and ambassadors at large that seemed designed to appeal to Democratic constituencies. Clinton’s successor, John Kerry, was viewed by some as an imperious boss who treated the department as a kind of playground, bringing his yellow Labrador retriever to work and letting the dog roam the building’s seventh-floor suite of executive offices known as Mahogany Row.

But after Trump’s election, many State Department officials braced for much worse. Some of the initially rumored potential secretaries — John Bolton, Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani — often seemed more inclined to blow up Foggy Bottom than to run it. When Trump picked Tillerson, the news was greeted not only with relief but even with optimism.

It was true that Tillerson was never going to be a conventional secretary of state, especially not working for Trump. “His idea for the job when he took it was that he and Trump can be negotiators, the best negotiators, for America,” says a Trump adviser. “His idea of foreign policy isn’t one that would make sense to people who read Foreign Policy.” But his combed-back silver hair and Texas-inflected baritone — in which a Foggy Bottom commonplace like “partner” becomes a mellifluous “pardner” — radiated the kind of authority admired by Trump, who asked Tillerson to be his secretary of state during their first meeting at Trump Tower in December. “He’s much more than a business executive,” Trump told Fox News shortly before announcing Tillerson’s nomination. “He’s a world-class player.” Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House adviser who attended that first Trump-Tillerson meeting, says: “The president puts a ton of weight on first impressions. As soon as Rex walked in the room, I knew the job was his.”

To external appearances, the work Tillerson did at Exxon Mobil seemed to reflect the zero-sum negotiator’s view of foreign policy that Trump has espoused ever since “The Art of the Deal.” “He’s led this charmed life,” Trump said of Tillerson at a black-tie dinner in January. “He goes into a country, takes the oil, goes into another country.” Tillerson’s future employees took a different comfort in Tillerson’s résumé. As chief executive of Exxon Mobil, where he worked for 41 years, Tillerson led a nearly 75,000-person corporate behemoth with a global footprint that rivaled that of the United States itself, requiring it to have, in effect, its own foreign policy. In fact, Exxon Mobil operated its own sort of mini-State Department, a division called the International Government Relations Group, staffed with foreign-policy experts, including a number who previously served in high-ranking positions in Foggy Bottom. As Tillerson traveled the world cutting deals for Exxon Mobil in Russia and Africa and the Middle East, he relied on the I.G.R.G. for expertise and advice much the same way secretaries of state typically rely on the Foreign Service.

Tillerson was originally recommended to the Trump team by the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, both mandarins of the Republican foreign-policy establishment who had consulted for Exxon Mobil, on the grounds that his vast knowledge of foreign governments and their leaders made him a perfect fit for the job. “The expectation was that Tillerson would be a grown-up and provide ballast,” says a 30-year veteran of the Foreign Service, “that he was someone who believed in America being the glue that created global stability and would be interested in upholding the world order as we have it.”

Before their Senate confirmations, secretary-of-state nominees are customarily provided a suite of offices on the first floor of the State Department’s eight-story, limestone-and-steel headquarters. There, just off the international-flag-draped lobby on C Street, they prepare for their new job, receiving briefings from and meeting with some of the people they will soon be leading.

Trump transition officials had sent a small beachhead team, led by Charles Glazer, a former Wall Street executive and Republican donor who served as President George W. Bush’s ambassador to El Salvador, to use the office. Few saw Tillerson set foot in it. A space that could accommodate 50 people wound up being filled by not even a dozen. What’s more, some State Department officials were told by the Trump transition team that they were not to contact Tillerson at all. “The attitude was that anyone who worked with Obama must be suspect,” one Trump transition official says.

In December, Nikki Haley, Trump’s nominee for ambassador to the United Nations, set up a conference call with two senior State Department officials: Kristie Kenney, the State Department counselor, and Patrick Kennedy, the under secretary of state for management. Haley wanted to ask them questions about the logistics of her new job: basic matters like what her salary and benefits would be and where her family would live in New York City. Kenney and Kennedy told her about the federal employee health insurance plan and offered to send her floor plans of the U.N. ambassador’s apartment. When word of the call got back to Trump’s transition team, the two department officials were reprimanded by Glazer and told never to speak with Haley again.

Kenney and Kennedy were among the small cohort of foreign-policy professionals who held the Foreign Service’s equivalent of a three- or four-star general rank in the military. These senior diplomats were responsible for handling America’s most vexing global challenges, everything from Russia’s annexation of Crimea to North Korea’s pursuit of weapons of mass destruction to the Iran nuclear deal. Members of this elite group, who served under Democratic and Republican presidents alike, had submitted their pro forma letters of resignation upon the end of the Obama administration, as was the custom during presidential transitions. The letters typically occasion a conversation with the incoming secretary and his or her team about whether these diplomats should remain in their current jobs or, if not, what other senior positions inside the department they might be moved to. In a worst-case situation, they would usually be rotated into a sleepy ambassadorship.

But this time around, every letter was greeted with silence. Not only did the officials not know how Tillerson intended to use them; they didn’t know if, come the Monday after Trump’s Friday inauguration, they would even have jobs. As one of them later recalled, “Every conversation would end with, ‘Have you heard anything from Tillerson?’ ”

Finally, with only a few days until the inauguration and still no word from Tillerson, one of the senior officials, Victoria Nuland — who once was Hillary Clinton’s State Department spokeswoman but had also been a foreign-policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney and was at the time the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs — opted to retire. The others chose to make a go of it. On the Monday after the inauguration, they showed up for work, as usual, at Foggy Bottom.

Two days later, Kennedy was told to retire and given three days to clean out his office. Kennedy had spent 44 years in the Foreign Service and was not particularly political, focusing instead on management and operations; he’d been appointed to his under-secretary position by President George W. Bush. But he had become a central figure in conservative conspiracy theories about Benghazi and Clinton’s private email server. Tillerson aides later joked that Kennedy’s defenestration was like something out of the Soviet Union, dragging a political foe out into the street and shooting him in the head so as to send a message to others.

A few weeks later, Kenney, who as counselor was the State Department’s No. 5 policy official, was told that her services were no longer needed, and she retired. And in the weeks after that, half a dozen other top diplomats were shown the door — fired, forced into retirement or warehoused at a university fellowship. “If you took the entire three-star and four-star corps of the military and said, ‘Leave!’ Congress would go crazy,” one of the recently departed said.

In a few short months, Tillerson had rid the State Department of much of its last several decades of diplomatic experience, though it was not really clear to what end. The new secretary of state, it soon became evident, had an easier time firing people than hiring them — a consequence of the election that delivered him to Foggy Bottom.

During the campaign, the “Never Trump” movement gathered many of its most devoted adherents from Republican foreign-policy circles, with scores of G.O.P. national-security professionals signing open letters declaring their opposition to the eventual Republican nominee. Although internecine foreign-policy squabbles were hardly unusual, they typically ended when the primaries did, with the losers rallying around the victor. But in 2016, representatives of all the various factions of the Republican foreign-policy world — realists and neoconservatives, hawks and isolationists — were united in their opposition to Trump, not only on ideological grounds but because they viewed him as personally unfit for office. And, given the personal nature of the criticism, Trump and those around him didn’t forgive it.

Tillerson’s early choice for deputy secretary of state was Elliott Abrams, a longtime Republican foreign-policy hand who served as George W. Bush’s deputy national-security adviser. At Tillerson’s instigation, Trump met with Abrams in early February and came away favorably disposed to his nomination, according to White House officials. But after the meeting, Trump apparently saw Rand Paul on Fox News disparage Abrams as a Never Trumper. (During the campaign Abrams wrote an article for The Weekly Standard titled “When You Can’t Stand Your Candidate.”) Trump told Tillerson that Abrams could not work for him after all.

According to a senior administration official, other potential hires were knocked out of consideration for sins as minor as retweeting some of Marco Rubio’s “little hands” jokes about Trump. “The hiring pool is very different from your normal hiring pool,” the official says. “The people the Senate would expect to confirm have all been taken off the table.”

In the early days of the administration, according to State Department officials, White House officials, especially Bannon, sent over many names for State Department posts. But Tillerson, after looking at their résumés and in some cases conducting interviews, felt he had no choice but to reject them. “They didn’t meet the qualifications for the actual jobs,” another senior administration official says.

Amid this impasse, power in the State Department has accrued to the relative handful of figures who have actually been hired, like Tillerson’s chief of staff, Margaret Peterlin. Peterlin served in the early 2000s as a national-security aide to Dennis Hastert, who was then speaker of the House, but she had been out of international-affairs work for more than a decade, first as a Commerce Department official, then as an executive for the Mars candy company before she left to raise her children. Peterlin was tapped by a Trump transition official, a fellow former Hastert staff member, to shepherd the secretary-of-state nominee through his confirmation process. Tillerson subsequently asked her to become his chief of staff.

By the spring, however, Peterlin had become a particular source of irritation to White House officials, some of whom told me they believed that she was dragging her feet on nominations in order to preserve her newfound power. In April, according to multiple sources, Reince Priebus, who was then chief of staff at the White House, went so far as to set up a weekly meeting among himself, Peterlin and the White House personnel director, Johnny DeStefano, to review applicants in the hope of moving things along.

In the past few months, the pace of nominations for the State Department has picked up. But even so, few of the nominees have qualifications that match those of their predecessors. For instance, Tillerson’s nominee for under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs — a post that was held by the former White House senior adviser Karen Hughes during George W. Bush’s administration and the former Time editor Richard Stengel during Obama’s — is a New York City marketing executive named Irwin Steven Goldstein who once worked at the same company as Peterlin’s husband.

The person on whose shoulders the fallout from the staffing shortage rests most heavily is Brian Hook, the head of the department’s office of policy planning. A former adviser to Mitt Romney, Hook was a founder of the John Hay Initiative, a hawkish foreign-policy think tank whose other two founders, Eliot A. Cohen and Eric Edelman, were (and still are) among Trump’s most vociferous critics. Cohen and Edelman put their names on anti-Trump letters during the 2016 election; Hook didn’t.

With so many crucial assistant-secretary positions — including some responsible for Asia, the Middle East, and South America — still either vacant or filled with acting officials, Hook has had to pick up the slack. “He’s trying to do the job of 30 people,” a 25-year veteran Foreign Service officer says. “He’s just knee-walking.” Worse, the office of policy planning, which has traditionally functioned as the secretary of state’s in-house think tank, is now tasked with handling day-to-day operations at the expense of formulating long-term strategy. “The problem is there’s no conceptual motor at all,” says Cohen, a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies who served as counselor of the department under Rice. “It’s the random thoughts of Donald J. Trump and a very weak State Department and a secretary of state who hasn’t thought deeply about these things.”

When I recently met with Hook in his seventh-floor office at the State Department, he seemed wary of any implication that, in light of his establishment pedigree and association with Cohen and Edelman, he wasn’t sufficiently pro-Trump. I noted that on his conference table he had a book by Daniel W. Drezner, an international-politics professor at Tufts University who writes regularly for The Washington Post website and is a frequent critic of Trump and of Tillerson. In fact, just that morning, Drezner had published a column calling on Tillerson to resign. I jokingly told Hook that he might want to hide the book. Instead, R.C. Hammond, Tillerson’s communications director, who was sitting in on the interview, immediately seized it.

“This is the guy who has the thing at The Post?” Hammond asked Hook. “Where’s your trash can?” He made as if he was going to throw the book across Hook’s office. Hook raised his hand to block Hammond.

“No!” Hook said. “It’s a book on policy planning! This was written before Rex Tillerson was even considered.”

“Trash can,” Hammond reiterated. Hook kept his hand up. The fifth of Bombay gin and the liter bottle of tonic water on his desk suddenly made more sense.

On June 5, Tillerson was in Sydney, Australia, with the defense secretary, James Mattis, when he learned that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt were all severing relations with the tiny Persian Gulf nation Qatar and imposing an air, sea and land blockade. The countries took these actions, they contended, because of Qatar’s support for Islamist groups, like the Muslim Brotherhood, and its warm relations with Iran, with which it shares the world’s largest gas field. But it was most likely not a coincidence that the move came on the heels of Trump’s goofy and garish visit to Saudi Arabia, during which he was photographed laying hands on what appeared to be a mysterious glowing orb, announced a $110 billion arms deal and called for a Sunni alliance to combat terrorism and Iran.

Tillerson had participated in the festivities, joining Trump and their Saudi hosts in a ceremonial sword dance — “not my first sword dance,” he later told reporters. But Qatar is also a country Tillerson knows well. At Exxon Mobil, he worked closely with its emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, who was then Qatar’s interior minister, to help develop the world largest liquefied-natural-gas complex in Ras Laffan Industrial City. He happened to be in Doha, on Exxon Mobil business, the night Trump was elected. According to Hammond, when Tillerson returned to the country for the first time as secretary of state, in July, he tapped Hammond on the shoulder as his airplane was making its approach and pointed down to Ras Laffan. “Do you want to see what $250 billion looks like?” Tillerson asked.

Tillerson feared the crisis could destabilize the region. Mattis, meanwhile, was concerned about the United States air base in Qatar that hosts the largest concentration of American military members in the Middle East. Together, the two cabinet secretaries began working to get Trump to try to broker a resolution.

But other members of the Trump administration argued against such a move, especially Jared Kushner. Ever since Trump’s election, Kushner had been the focus of an intense courtship by Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, and Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi; and the two men quickly formed a close friendship with the president’s son-in-law. So close, in fact, that the crown princes convinced Kushner not just of Qatar’s perfidy but of the opportunity the blockade provided to further tilt American foreign policy toward the Saudis and away from Iran, according to the Trump adviser. “Rex saw it as a crisis to solve,” the adviser says. “Jared saw it as an opportunity to seize.”

Back in Washington, Tillerson suggested summoning the parties to Camp David. When that idea gained no traction, Tillerson proposed an American-sponsored meeting in Kuwait, to no avail. While Tillerson publicly called on the Saudis to end their blockade, Trump pronounced the action against Qatar “hard but necessary.” The “special relationship of prince to prince,” as the senior administration official describes the Kushner-Mohammed bin Salman alliance, seemed to be carrying the day.

Finally, in mid-July, Trump acquiesced to Tillerson’s request to be allowed to go to the region himself to conduct a round of shuttle diplomacy. In Doha, over a dinner of goat and baby camel, Tillerson negotiated with Qatar’s emir. In Jidda, he cajoled the Saudis and their allies to end their blockade. Nothing seemed to work, especially because each side was receiving the opposite message from other officials in Washington. On his flight back to the United States, Tillerson vented some of his frustrations. “It is a lot different than being C.E.O. of Exxon because I was the ultimate decision maker,” he told two reporters on board. The federal government, by contrast, is “not a highly disciplined organization, decision making is fragmented and sometimes people don’t want to take decisions.”

But Tillerson continued to quietly work the issue, concentrating as much on the head of state at home as on the heads of state in the gulf. When the quartet excluded Qatar from a military exercise in which it had traditionally taken part, he made a note of it on his list of things to talk to Trump about and brought it up to him at the White House. When Mohammed bin Salman welcomed a rogue member of Qatar’s Al-Thani royal family to Mina, lending credence to Tillerson’s suspicion that the Saudis hoped to use the crisis to engineer a regime change in Doha, Tillerson alerted Trump.

After several months, Tillerson finally won Trump over to his view. In early September, Trump told the Saudis and the Qataris that it was time to end the dispute. After Trump brokered a call between the emir of Qatar and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, the two sides immediately began fighting again, and the crisis remains unresolved, but at least it was a start.

When I spoke to Tillerson about what caused the initial split in the administration on Qatar, he said that it boiled down to experience. “I think I started from a different place perhaps because I’ve known all the leaders involved for a long time, and I’ve seen these kinds of issues emerge in the region over the 20-plus years I’ve been dealing with the region,” he said. “So this was not new for me, and so I guess my reaction to it was perhaps immediately measured because I’ve seen it before. To those who have not seen it before” — and here Tillerson didn’t bother to name names, but it seemed he was talking about Kushner — “there are a lot of concerns expressed about Qatar that are legitimate concerns. The U.S. government has had some of these concerns, and we’re addressing them now through the engagement with Qatar and the memorandum of understanding we put in place when I was over there, and it’s going very well. We have issues with the other countries as well, and so I think the way we reacted was just based upon, in my case, that past experience versus those who perhaps had not seen this before.”

It was amid the Qatar episode that, in July, Tillerson and Mattis convened a special meeting with Trump to give the president a tutorial on, as The Associated Press later described it, “American Power 101.” Sitting in a windowless meeting room at the Pentagon known as the Tank, Tillerson and Mattis reportedly used charts and maps to explain to Trump why the United States needed to have so many diplomatic, military and intelligence assets deployed around the world. In at least one respect, their message had its intended effect: A month later, Trump would reverse his promise to withdraw from Afghanistan and announce that he was sending more troops there.

But when the meeting broke up, that development was hardly assured; and it was after spending 90 minutes tutoring Trump — including, according to NBC, about why the tenfold increase in nuclear weapons Trump desired would be a bad idea — that Tillerson reportedly called the president a “moron.” It may well be the harshest criticism Tillerson has directed at his boss, but it’s far from the only one. According to a former administration official, in private conversations with aides and friends, Tillerson refers to Trump, in his Texas deadpan, as the dealmaker in chief. And in meetings with Trump, according to people who have attended them, he increasingly rolls his eyes at the president’s remarks. If Trump disagrees with Tillerson, the official said, his secretary of state will say, “It’s your deal.”

The friction hasn’t been confined to foreign policy. In July, Tillerson was reportedly outraged by Trump’s politically charged speech at the Boy Scout Jamboree in West Virginia, where, a few days earlier, Tillerson himself was honored for his service to the organization. In August, after Trump’s response to a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville — in which he said there were “very fine people” on “both sides” of the violent clashes there — Tillerson was asked on Fox News about whether the “president’s values” reflected America’s values. “The president speaks for himself,” Tillerson replied.

The souring of Tillerson’s relationship with Trump has left him not just without the support of the most crucial ally, his boss, but also without the support of any real allies at all. “The conundrum for Rex,” says a Trump-administration official sympathetic to Tillerson’s plight, “is that he’s on this island.”

During his first eight months in Washington, Tillerson spent so much time focusing his energies on Trump that he neglected other crucial constituencies. Bob Corker, the Republican senator from Tennessee who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has praised Tillerson — along with Mattis and the White House Chief of Staff John Kelly — for helping to “separate our country from chaos”; but Tillerson has few other allies on Capitol Hill, and now that Corker’s own relationship with Trump is on the rocks, it’s unclear how much his support of Tillerson will mean. Nor has Tillerson developed any new, close ties with foreign leaders, and many of the ones he had from his days at Exxon are now complicated by the realities of his current job.

His interactions with the press, meanwhile, have been grudging at best. Previous secretaries of state traveled the globe on a Boeing 757 that could accommodate as many as a dozen members of the State Department press corps; Tillerson has usually opted to fly on a smaller 737, with very limited room for reporters, and has studiously avoided the media in Washington. He has been sparing with his major policy speeches. “I speak when I have something I think’s important to say,” Tillerson told me. “I don’t need a lot of time talking to. ...” He nodded curtly in my direction.

And then, of course, there’s Tillerson’s relationship — or lack thereof — with the State Department itself. For a secretary of state, speaking to the public, either in speeches or through regular interactions with the press, is a vital way of speaking to the department’s employees, especially when the secretary is planning to upend their lives, as Tillerson currently is. Not long after he was sworn in last February, Tillerson announced that he would be undertaking a grand “redesign” of the department. He hired a small consulting firm, Insigniam, that did work for him at Exxon Mobil to conduct a “listening tour” of State Department rank and file through an online questionnaire and about 300 personal interviews.

Many State Department employees found that Insigniam’s questions, both online and in person, betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of what they did. “They came away with the impression that we’re very ‘patriotic’ and ‘professional,’ ” a senior State Department official says. “You don’t need a [expletive] survey to know that. It’s completely demeaning.”

At the same time Tillerson was getting ready to carry out his redesign, he was also trying to accommodate the Trump administration’s demand to drastically slash the State Department’s budget, ultimately acquiescing to a 30 percent cut. Tillerson insists that one has nothing to do with the other. “The budget and what we’re doing organizationally have no relationship whatsoever,” he told me. But others inside and outside the State Department see them as inextricably linked. “It’d be like Exxon Mobil starting with a budget number and then deciding if it was going to produce oil or gas,” a former senior State Department official says.

Although Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have already declared Trump’s State Department cuts a nonstarter — and, in September, passed an appropriations bill that funded the department for the next three months at about last year’s level — Tillerson still intends to slash the department’s staff by 8 percent, or roughly 2,000 people. According to one senior State Department official, Tillerson originally wanted to cut the staff by 15 percent, until he was told that to do so the State Department would have to fire people. (The 8 percent reduction will be accomplished through attrition and some buyouts.)

“I have just the utmost respect for the Foreign Service officer corps here, and they’re vital,” Tillerson told me. “They’re vital and critical to the country’s ability to carry out its foreign policies.” As for the perception by many inside and outside Foggy Bottom that he wants to gut the Foreign Service, he said he doesn’t quite know how to respond. “I’m mystified by it,” he said. “I’m perplexed by it.”

But even the cuts he has planned, some State Department veterans fear, will cripple the department for years to come, especially as the lower and midlevel ranks of the department are reduced. “You can’t have captains if you don’t have lieutenants,” a senior State Department official says. “You can’t have majors if you don’t have captains.”

In nearly 300 embassies, missions and consulates around the world where State Department officials work to promote and defend America’s interests, diplomats complain about not just a dearth of resources but also a lack of guidance. “I’d request instructions on action items, saying I need a decision, and I’d hear absolutely nothing,” a recently returned ambassador said. Meanwhile, foreign leaders are increasingly emboldened in their attempts to drive a wedge between America’s diplomatic corps and the president. Earlier this year, according to Foreign Policy, Trump pushed out the United States ambassador to Jordan at the request of the country’s king. And this month, Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has cultivated a close relationship with Trump, declared the American ambassador to his country persona non grata after a visa dispute. “We do not see him as the representative of the United States in Turkey,” Erdogan said.

A result, according to the nearly two dozen current and former State Department officials with whom I spoke, is that the department’s morale has never been lower. For that, almost all of them blame Tillerson. “When we’re put up for confirmation and swearing in, we thank the president and the secretary of state for having confidence in us, but I’m not sure I can honestly say that anymore,” the 25-year veteran of the Foreign Service confessed. “It’s not even about the president for me. It’s that I am deeply, deeply anguished about the secretary of state, and I have never felt like that.”

After Tillerson’s punishing turn in the media glare in recent weeks, the assumption among many that I spoke to in Foggy Bottom (outside Tillerson’s closest advisers) was that his departure was now a question of when, not if. Some believed that the only holdup was that Trump had not yet decided on Tillerson’s replacement, with Haley and the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, being the most frequently mentioned candidates. Others speculated that Tillerson had asked to delay his exit until he’d been in his position for a year, in order to avoid a huge capital-gains tax hit on the stocks he had to divest from in order to take the job.

The “moron” remark had actually elevated Tillerson in the estimation of some in Foggy Bottom — “I feel like it’s curiously redemptive,” the 25-year veteran Foreign Service officer told me — but even these people conceded that they believed he could no longer do his job effectively. “This just isn’t sustainable,” a senior State Department official said. “You can’t have a secretary of state going around the world who’s not seen as representing the president’s foreign policy.”

But even if Tillerson leaves, the fear among many in the State Department is that the hangover from his tenure will be long-lasting. The Foreign Service officer recalls a recent meeting of acting assistant secretaries, where the most pressing matters discussed were the backlog of Freedom of Information Act requests and the number of typographical errors in memos to the secretary’s office. “The world is going to hell in a handbasket,” the Foreign Service officer fumed, “and the greatest minds in our diplomatic service are talking about FOIA requests and [expletive] typos.”

All of which can lead to some dark thoughts. More than one State Department official told me that they believed all of this wasn’t a case of simple mismanagement but of something more sinister. “I’ve lived in a lot of countries where conspiracy theories abound because people feel like they lack self-determination,” Nancy McEldowney, a 30-year career Foreign Service officer who retired in June, says. “And a great many people inside State are now hypothesizing about what the goal of all this is. Why are they firing people and shrinking the department down? It can’t simply be a budget-cutting exercise. If it were purely for reform, they would have done it differently.”

Whatever his intentions, Tillerson’s true legacy may well be to have transformed a venerable American institution into the caricature of its most fevered, irrational critics. In Foggy Bottom, anguish is increasingly giving way to bitterness. “I’ve jokingly said to friends that I’m going to be executive director of the Deep State,” the Foreign Service veteran of 25 years, who is currently in the process of “separating” from the organization, told me. “There was never a Deep State before, but these idiots have managed to create one.”",Rex Tillerson and the Unraveling of the State Department,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/magazine/rex-tillerson-and-the-unraveling-of-the-state-department.html

I taught my first class at Columbia University’s M.F.A. program this month, and even though I’ve been teaching college writing since 1993, I initially felt a little intimidated by the school’s regal campus. That, and regretful.

I enjoyed going to college at the University of Michigan, an hour from home, but my secret humiliation is: I was the type of mediocre student I now disdain. As a freshman, I cared about my friends, my boyfriend and my poetry. Or, I cared about what my boyfriend thought of my friends, what my friends thought of him, and what they thought of my poetry about him. Here’s what I wish I’d known and done differently:

A’S ARE COOL AND COME WITH PERKS As a student, I saw myself as anti-establishment, and I hated tests; I barely maintained a B average. I thought only nerds spent weekends in the library studying. Recently I learned that my niece Dara, a sophomore at New York University with a 3.7 G.P.A. (and a boyfriend), was offered a week of travel in Buenos Aires as part of her honors seminar. I was retroactively envious to learn that a 3.5 G.P.A. or higher at many schools qualifies you for free trips, scholarships, grants, awards, private parties and top internships. At 20, I was too busy freaking out when said boyfriend disappeared (after sleeping with one of said friends). Students certainly don’t need to strive obsessively for perfection, but I should have prioritized grades, not guys.

SHOW UP AND SPEAK UP If a class was boring or it snowed, I’d skip. My rationale was that nobody in the 300-person lecture hall would notice and I could get notes later. Attendance barely counted. When I went, I’d sit quietly in back. Yet as a teacher, I see that the students who come weekly, sit in front, and ask and answer questions get higher grades and frankly, preferential treatment. After 15 weeks, I barely know the absentees or anyone Snapchatting the term away on their iPhones. It’s not just that these students flush $300 down the toilet every time they miss my class; participating can actually lead to payoffs. I reward those who try harder with recommendations, references, professional contacts and encouragement.

CLASS CONNECTIONS CAN LAUNCH YOUR CAREER As an undergrad, I rarely visited my professors during office hours. I didn’t want to annoy teachers with what I considered triviality. Besides, I thought I knew everything already. In graduate school, on the other hand, I went to the readings of a professor I admired. Eventually, I’d go to his office just to vent. Once, after I complained about a dead-end job, he recommended me for a position at The New Yorker, jump-starting my career.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city.","Devastated by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

In his township school, 10 children shared a single textbook. For high school, he talked his way into a technical school reserved for Indians. After graduation, he bagged groceries, then moved into Johannesburg and took a job delivering antique furniture. He volunteered for a government-run youth league. That eventually turned into a staff position for President Zuma, overseeing youth affairs.

Between June and August this year, it was exceptionally hot and dry across southern Europe. In Spain, temperatures soared above 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) in July. In Italy, rainfall was 30 percent below normal levels — and in parts of the country, much lower still.

Scientists with the World Weather Attribution program, a group dedicated to the study of extreme weather, concluded last month that the “the chances of seeing a summer as hot as 2017” had increased tenfold since the early 1900s, and the chances of a heat wave like the one that hit the region for three days in August, nicknamed Lucifer, had risen by four times.

“We found a very clear global warming fossil fuel fingerprint,” said Heidi Cullen, a climatologist who heads the program.

Here and there, tiny, dried-up olives lay on the ground. A few trees were bare. But many were drooping with fruit: fat, purple-green olives, the sight of which made Filippo exceedingly happy.

“He is very excited,” Ms. Contini Bonacossi said of her brother. She was less so. Capezzana would produce 20 percent less oil this year; as Capezzana’s sales chief, she would have to ration it out to her loyal customers.

Ms. Guidobaldi, for her part, was taking no chances. She started harvesting in late September, the earliest ever on the estate. It was still scorching hot. What if a freakish storm came and knocked the olives down?

“Bellissimo,” she said, caressing the olives she had saved. “I don’t have children. These are my children. You can’t just ignore them one year and then come back the next year and everything is O.K.”

More than two years after the New York City police officer Brian Moore was fatally shot while on patrol in Queens, his fellow officers relived that night, as testimony began on Monday in the trial of the man prosecutors say killed him with two bullets to the head from a silver revolver.

With the slain officer’s mother and father listening, officers who were on the scene testified in State Supreme Court in Queens, recounting the events of May 2, 2015, of watching as the young officer was shot and trying to save him.

Daniel Day-Lewis has always been unpredictable, and he may have delivered his biggest surprise yet when he announced in June that he would retire from acting after reteaming with his “There Will Be Blood” director, Paul Thomas Anderson, on one final film, “Phantom Thread.” The trailer for the movie has just been released, and it looks to be a portrait of an artist as intense and focused as the man who plays him.

Mr. Day-Lewis stars as Reynolds Woodcock, a 1950s London couturier who has always been married to his work. Into his life comes Alma (Vicky Krieps), a young woman who becomes his muse and, seemingly, his obsession. Lesley Manville, known for her roles in Mike Leigh films like “Mr. Turner” and “Topsy-Turvy,” plays Woodcock’s sister.

“Whatever you do, do it carefully,” Alma advises Woodcock in the teaser’s final line. That sentiment certainly applies to Mr. Day-Lewis, who has thoughtfully chosen parts like the painter with cerebral palsy in “My Left Foot” and the legendary president in “Lincoln.” Both those roles won Oscars for the actor, and so did his turn as an avaricious oilman in “There Will Be Blood.”

If Mr. Day-Lewis wins again for “Phantom Thread,” he will tie Katharine Hepburn as the actor with the most Oscars. The film will be released in theaters on Christmas Day.",New Trailer: Paul Thomas Anderson’s ‘Phantom Thread’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/movies/paul-thomas-anderson-daniel-day-lewis-phantom-thread-trailer.html

When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.
He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly.
He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.
“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

Photo

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

Mr. Nunes handed control to three of the committee’s Republicans, Representatives K. Michael Conaway of Texas, Tom Rooney of Florida and Mr. Gowdy.
Shortly after the meeting, Mr. Schiff publicly accused Mr. Gowdy of playing defense attorney for the administration.
Yes,” Mr. Gowdy said.
“The American people deserve a public investigation,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, noting that the Judiciary Committee could work more publicly than the intelligence panels.","Nine months into the Trump administration, any notion that Capitol Hill would provide a comprehensive, authoritative and bipartisan accounting of the extraordinary efforts of a hostile power to disrupt American democracy appears to be dwindling.

“Congressional investigations unfortunately are usually overtly political investigations, where it is to one side’s advantage to drag things out,” said Mr. Gowdy, who made his name in Congress as a fearsome investigator of Democrats. He added, “The notion that one side is playing the part of defense attorney and that the other side is just these white hat defenders of the truth is laughable.”

Instead, he said, he is looking to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, to conduct an apolitical investigation.

None of the challenges have thus far stopped the committees. And given the closed-door nature of their work, prominent new avenues of inquiry could always emerge, such as Russia’s use of social media to sow chaos and discord, capable of influencing the public discourse.

But all three are up against a ticking clock, with Republicans in both chambers eager to wrap up the investigations before too long.

Particularly in the House, partisan fighting is likely to undermine whatever conclusions the committee reaches. One lawmaker said the committee would probably produce two reports. The first, written by Republicans, is expected to forcefully say there is no proof that anyone around Mr. Trump worked with Russia to tip the election. A Democratic report will probably raise unanswered questions and say that the committee was never fully committed to answering them.

The panel has been on rocky ground for months, with much of the controversy surrounding the committee’s chairman, Representative Devin Nunes of California. Mr. Nunes was forced to step aside from leading the investigation in April after it was disclosed that he had received classified information from the White House that showed that Mr. Trump and his associates were incidentally swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies.

Mr. Nunes handed control to three of the committee’s Republicans, Representatives K. Michael Conaway of Texas, Tom Rooney of Florida and Mr. Gowdy. Mr. Conaway, a well-liked accountant, helped put the investigation back on track and has maintained a productive relationship with Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the panel’s top Democrat.

But Democrats say Mr. Nunes, whose signature is required to issue subpoenas, has continued to meddle around the edges of the investigation, driving Republican inquiries into who financed a dossier of unsubstantiated information on purported links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr. Nunes, they say, is also participating in an investigation into the revealing of Trump associates caught up in American surveillance by Obama administration officials.

“Frankly, I have been doing everything I can to try to get us to do a credible investigation and to reach a common conclusion,” Mr. Schiff said. “I view these things as obstacles that are in the way to overcome, and I am doing my best to overcome them almost daily.”

A spokesman for Mr. Nunes did not reply to a request for comment.

Democrats were also incensed by Mr. Gowdy’s remarks to Mr. Kushner in July, which they said were representative of efforts by some Republicans to cut the investigation short. Shortly after the meeting, Mr. Schiff publicly accused Mr. Gowdy of playing defense attorney for the administration.

Republicans have returned the biting words, sharply criticizing Mr. Schiff, whose frequent television appearances irk them. Mr. Rooney used a vulgarity when he called Mr. Schiff’s comments about the Kushner interview nonsense. And Mr. Gowdy said on Friday that he had been compelled to weigh in by the Democrats’ repetitive and meandering questions — and that a transcript would show his own questions to have been appropriately aggressive.

The Republican said it had become clear where the committee was headed.

“Will our private conclusions be the same? Yes,” Mr. Gowdy said. “Will our public pronouncements be the same? No, of course not.”

“This is politics,” he added.

Across Capitol Hill, the tone has been different. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and its top Democrat, Mark Warner of Virginia, have worked to project a collaborative rapport that committee members insist is real.

At a rare news conference this month, the two senators said they had already expended significant resources verifying the conclusions of America’s spy agencies about Russia’s efforts to meddle in the election and were now taking steps to better understand its use of social media campaigns and to investigate the collusion question.

“At the end of the day, what we owe the American people is the truth,” Mr. Warner said in an interview on Thursday. “And if there’s something there, then they should know that. And if there’s not something there, I’ll be the first to acknowledge that.”

But other committee members have sought to contain expectations. At the news conference, Mr. Burr said investigators had “hit a wall” in their work on the dossier, which holds some of the most salacious allegations of collusion, because its author, Christopher Steele, would not meet with the committee. Mr. Burr also said he did not have a mandate to look for criminal activity.

“The special counsel is focused on criminal acts; we’re not focused on criminal acts,” he said. “If we find one, then they’re the first phone call we make.”

Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and a former chairwoman of the committee, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” this month that Mr. Mueller stood a much better chance of reaching a definitive conclusion about collusion than the committees did.

“There’s no proof yet that it’s happened, and I think that proof will likely come with Mr. Mueller’s investigation,” Ms. Feinstein said. “He’s got the ability to use a grand jury. He’s got the ability to use the power of subpoena without question. And he’s got the ability to do a criminal investigation.”

Both intelligence committees will also face questions about how much of what they find can be declassified and shared with the public. Mr. Burr said on Wednesday that his goal was to have the “meat of our business” done by late spring, in time for state governments to make changes to their voting systems before next year’s midterm elections. He said he would push to declassify the findings as much as possible.

The Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, has struggled to get a fledgling investigation off the ground. Ms. Feinstein, the committee’s top Democrat, and its chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, agreed this summer to begin investigating a cluster of topics related to the firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, including Mr. Comey’s handling of the Clinton email case and the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia.

Given its jurisdiction over the Justice Department, the panel is the best positioned on Capitol Hill to unravel the Comey saga, including possible obstruction of justice. But after a brief flurry of activity earlier this fall — including a closed-door interview with the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. — investigators reached an impasse in recent weeks, as Democrats and Republicans haggled over the next witnesses to call and documents to request.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Grassley has spent weeks negotiating with the Justice Department on the committee’s behalf to try to gain access to two key F.B.I. officials who worked closely with Mr. Comey, Carl Ghattas and James Rybicki. Hopes of interviewing Paul J. Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, collapsed over the summer after prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller warned Mr. Manafort that they planned to seek criminal charges against him.

On Wednesday, Mr. Grassley unilaterally sent a flurry of letters requesting interviews with and information from current and former Justice Department officials, as well as Mr. Kushner and others involved in a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer said to be offering incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton.

Senators said they were still hopeful that the committee would break through the logjam, but a deal had not been reached as of Friday.

In 2015, she started a podcast, “Anna Faris Is Unqualified,” a show that has been described as a mash-up between Marc Maron and Dear Abby.
In the last chapter of “Unqualified,” Ms. Faris noted that she started seeing a therapist while writing the book, and that she has grown skeptical of the idea of “closure” following a breakup.","“At first, I was really nervous about the idea of the book coming out and coinciding with these major life changes we were having, but Chris is amazing,” Ms. Faris said in an interview, noting that she made minor revisions but decided not to drastically alter or postpone the publication.

For Ms. Faris, the breakup creates an added wrinkle for an already anxiety-inducing moment in her career, as she prepares to promote the book in television appearances and bookstore events where, inevitably, the subject of her marriage and separation will come up.

“The book release would have been terrifying regardless,” she said, adding that it was even more so “with the new complications in my life.”

“I’ve never done anything like this,” she added. “I get to hide behind characters.”

She’s resigned herself to fielding questions about the split, and says that if she had published the memoir a year from now, she would have had time to reflect on and address their separation in the book. “The story is kind of dull,” she said. “It’s a little bit like, two incredibly busy people that care a lot for each other got really busy.”

Ms. Faris’s editor at Dutton, Jill Schwartzman, said she was confident that the memoir wouldn’t be overshadowed by Ms. Faris’s separation because it’s ultimately a funny and revealing look at Ms. Faris, through the lens of her relationships.

“Unqualified,” which grew out of Ms. Faris’s popular podcast, is goofily self-deprecating, casually profane and occasionally raw, earnest and blunt, like Ms. Faris herself. She seems determined to catalog her own flaws and foibles — an offensive tactic, she admits, against critics who would gladly pile on. She concedes that she can be heedless and impulsive in love.

But coming on the heels of her separation from Mr. Pratt, the book often reads like a love letter — or now, a heartfelt epitaph — to a marriage.

Ms. Faris chronicles the highs and lows, but mostly the highs, of their courtship and marriage. In a chapter titled, “Take Me Home Tonight. Literally,” Ms. Faris recalls developing a crush on Mr. Pratt while working on the comedy “Take Me Home Tonight,” when she was still married to the actor Ben Indra. (After realizing she was attracted to Mr. Pratt, Ms. Faris told Mr. Indra over the phone that she wanted a divorce, then announced to everyone on set that she had left her husband.)

Later on, she describes how, on one of her first dates with Mr. Pratt, she ate a fly to impress him. She also reveals trying moments, like the wrenching weeks after their son Jack was born prematurely and had to spend about a month in the neonatal intensive care unit. In what would have been a stressful time for any parents, Ms. Faris and Mr. Pratt had the additional burden of facing paparazzi who stalked them at the hospital entrance.

With characteristic self-effacement, Ms. Faris also addresses the downsides of being a famous Hollywood couple, including her feelings of insecurity when Mr. Pratt starred with Jennifer Lawrence in the sci-fi epic “Passengers” and the tabloids speculated that they were a couple: “Of course it’s hurtful and also embarrassing when people are saying your husband is cheating on you — even if it’s patently untrue,” Ms. Faris writes.

Mr. Pratt — who went from playing a lovable, dimwitted side character on the NBC sitcom “Parks and Recreation” to full-blown movie stardom, with leading roles in blockbusters like “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “Jurassic World” — is a looming presence in “Unqualified,” from the first page to the acknowledgments. Ms. Faris dedicated the book to him, and thanks him for “being just about the best person I know.”

In his foreword to the book, Mr. Pratt obliquely references the separation, and intentionally butchers the spelling of “foreword,” as part of a running joke that he doesn’t know what the word means. “When I was asked to write the forward for ‘Unqualified,’ Anna’s memoir, I immediately said yes without even thinking about it,” he writes. “And boy did a lot happen between then and now. So much. Like … soooo much.” Mr. Pratt also makes an extended guest appearance later in the book, in a chapter titled, “She Said, He Said: What It’s Like to Be a Couple in Hollywood,” which consists entirely of dialogue between them. (A publicist for Mr. Pratt said he was unable to comment for this article because “his schedule is completely over committed at this point.”)

Ms. Faris, 40, grew up in Edmonds, Wash., and has been acting since she was 9. She got a degree in English literature from the University of Washington, then moved to Los Angeles. Her first role in a major film was playing Cindy Campbell in “Scary Movie,” a campy horror parody. In the ensuing years, she was often cast as the drunk girl, the ditsy sidekick or the adorable goofball. Eventually, she started producing and landing leading roles in comedies like “The House Bunny” and “What’s Your Number?” Next year, she stars in a remake of the 1987 romantic comedy “Overboard,” which originally featured Goldie Hawn as a self-involved heiress.

In 2015, she started a podcast, “Anna Faris Is Unqualified,” a show that has been described as a mash-up between Marc Maron and Dear Abby. On the show, Ms. Faris and her co-host, Sim Sarna, take calls from listeners and dole out relationship advice, often with celebrity guests weighing in (T.J. Miller, Lisa Kudrow, Aubrey Plaza and Chelsea Handler have all made appearances). The podcast gave her the idea for the book.

In the last chapter of “Unqualified,” Ms. Faris noted that she started seeing a therapist while writing the book, and that she has grown skeptical of the idea of “closure” following a breakup.

“I just wanted to make sure that anyone who was actually willing to read the book felt like I wasn’t glorifying my life at all. I am clearly a flawed person,” she said in the interview. “This is terrifying,” she added — that word again — “that I’m writing about stuff that makes me feel incredibly vulnerable.”",Is Anna Faris Unqualified?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/books/anna-faris-book-chris-pratt.html

Nor would Mrs. Obama comment.

Kim Sajet, the Portrait Gallery’s director, would only divulge that Mrs. Obama and Ms. Sherald have already met about the portrait, that the paintings typically involve multiple sittings and that this year’s subjects chose the artists from about 20 portfolios submitted by the curators. The first lady has to personally approve the finished work, as does the Portrait Gallery’s advisory board.

The Smithsonian plans to pay for both works with $500,000 in private donations of which $300,000 has been raised so far. This amount covers everything including each artist’s fees, which Ms. Sajet would not specify. Ms. Sherald’s paintings typically sell for $15,000 to $25,000.

There is no prescribed format for an official portrait, Ms. Sajet said, except that it be a painting — not a work on paper — and that the artists “be respectful of both the person and the position they hold.”

Official portraits have ranged from “highly formal to much more relaxed,” Ms. Sajet added, citing as examples Ron Sherr’s 1994 portrait of George H. W. Bush standing in a suit and tie at the White House and Robert Anderson’s 2008 likeness of George W. Bush in an open-collared shirt on a couch at Camp David.

The selection of Ms. Sherald, who typically depicts African-Americans doing everyday things — two women in bathing suits, a man holding a child — has historical significance. “It’s as if she’s saying, ‘Let’s be clear: the President and I are African Americans and proudly so,” Mr. Staiti said, “and these portraits are going to have an African-American vibe — they’re going to break out of that rather staid tradition. I think it’s important and I think it’s political,” he added, referring to Mrs. Obama’s choice.

While Ms. Sherald could not discuss her interactions with Mrs. Obama, the way she generally works offers clear insights into her likely process with the former first lady. She invites her subjects to her studio here, where she photographs them in an outfit she has selected for them. Or, she said, she may go to their homes to “shop from their closets” and photograph them there.

Photo

Ms. Sherald always shoots her subjects outdoors with natural light. “I like the way it highlights the textures of the skin,” she said.

The commission represents something of a departure for Ms. Sherald; she usually chooses subjects who arrest her attention on the street, in an airport. She literally approaches strangers.

“I would wonder how she’d feel about this leading to commissions of other prominent people,” Mr. Staiti said. “She’s interested in the exact opposite; she’s interested in ordinariness.”

Ms. Sherald said how much the selection means to her, how Mrs. Obama loomed large in her life, though they had not previously met. “We’ve been on a first-name basis for eight years,” she said jokingly. “Seeing her made my world better.”

Photo

“She’s an archetype that a lot of women can relate to — no matter shape, size, race or color,” Ms. Sherald added. “We see our best selves in her.”

Ms. Sherald has yet to start the Obama portrait, though it is due to be finished by year’s end. “I’m not going home for the holidays,” she said with a laugh.

Yet sitting among her paint tubes — their colors smeared on paper plates — with three canvases-in-progress leaning against the walls, Ms. Sherald seemed remarkably calm in the face of such a daunting deadline, perhaps because she has confronted far tougher challenges.

Ms. Sherald is a survivor of congestive heart failure, diagnosed at age 30 just as she was earning her master’s degree at the Maryland Institute College of Art and was training for a triathlon. She received a transplant at 39.

She interrupted her career again, taking a four-year break to care for two ailing relatives back in her hometown Columbus, Ga. She lost her father, a dentist, to Parkinson’s in 2000; her brother to lung cancer in 2012.

But she does not think of herself as unlucky. In fact, she said she is keenly aware of those less fortunate around her — like children in her own community who are aging out of foster care. (One block from her studio, she said she “can see 10 addicts at any given time.”) Ms. Sherald, who has taught art in the Baltimore City Detention Center, hopes to give back financially as soon as she pays off her school loans and can more easily afford her extensive medication: 13 different pills a day.

“When I look at those people,” she said, “I see myself.”

Ms. Sherald isn’t very far from the days when she waited tables and worked in a studio without heat or air-conditioning.

Her parents wanted her to go to medical school, but Ms. Sherald knew that she was an artist. “I don’t feel like I chose to do it,” she said. “I don’t know what else I’m good at.”

She began with bald self-portraits — she shaved her own head for a time — and then moved into more fantastical work that explored the idea of circus, and fantasy.

Ms. Sherald’s cultural influences range from the science fiction writer Octavia Butler to the Surrealist painter Salvador Dalí and Tim Burton’s quirky movie, “Big Fish.” Names that come up in conversation include the poet David Whyte, the public radio host Krista Tippett — and Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Over the years, Ms. Sherald’s figurative painting has evolved into a stylized realism — a gray skin palette punctuated by colorful pieces of clothing on a flat plane. She makes only about 13 paintings a year. “It’s hard for me to find people to paint,” she said. “There has got to be something about them that only I can see.”

“They exist in a place of the past, the present and the future,” she added. “It’s like something I sense with my spirit more than my mind.”

Ms. Sherald only paints African-Americans. Having studied European art history, she is keenly aware of the scarcity of black faces. “There’s not enough images of us,” she said.

Last year she had her first solo show at Monique Meloche’s Chicago gallery and became the first woman to win the Portrait Gallery’s Outwin Boochever competition. Now there are waiting lists for her work.

“Everybody responds to her paintings,” Ms. Meloche said. “There is something that’s so alive in these characters; they’re very calm — but they’re still very confrontational.”","After a Late Start, an Artist’s Big Break: Michelle Obama’s Official Portrait",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/arts/design/amy-sherald-michelle-obama-official-portrait.html

LOS ANGELES — A sassy church lady, a group of elite firefighters, an alcoholic detective, some do-gooder Texans and a renegade scientific genius walked into multiplexes on Friday.

Only one grabbed the attention of ticket buyers.

“Tyler Perry’s Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,” with Mr. Perry reprising his gun-toting, moralizing granny, took in about $21.7 million at North American theaters over the weekend. That total gave Mr. Perry his sixth No. 1 opening, bolstering his status as one of the most reliable crowd pullers in moviedom. Even so, initial ticket sales for “Boo 2” (Lionsgate) fell 24 percent behind those for “Boo! A Madea Halloween” last year. “Boo 2” cost roughly $24 million to make.

Ticket sales were terrible for the other newcomers — “Geostorm,” “Only the Brave,” “The Snowman” and “Same Kind of Different as Me” — adding to worries that moviegoing is falling out of fashion, as Americans curl up at home with their Netflix accounts. On the other hand, all of those films but one, “Only the Brave,” a dramatization of a wildfire that killed 19 responders, received abysmal reviews.

“Geostorm” (Warner Bros.) was second for the weekend, taking in an estimated $13.3 million, a failing total for a film that cost roughly $130 million to make, not including tens of millions of dollars in marketing costs, and was released in 3,246 theaters. “Geostorm,” starring Gerard Butler as a scientist racing to save the planet from environmental destruction, likely suffered from a sense of been-there, done-that, coming across as another “The Day After Tomorrow.”

“Geostorm” was cofinanced by Skydance Media, a company founded by the Oracle heir David Ellison.

Next among the newcomers was “Only the Brave,” which collected about $6 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Black Label Media, a company co-founded by the FedEx heiress Molly Smith, spent about $38 million to make this firefighter drama, which was distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment. (It has been a bad month for the FedEx family at the movies: Alcon, backed by Ms. Smith’s father, Fred Smith, had a major box office misfire with “Blade Runner 2049.”)

Sony noted that “Only the Brave” received an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls. “We expect great word of mouth among our core audience,” the studio said in a statement on Sunday.

We ate our last meal there before heading out of the city toward the vast tea estates and spice gardens that lace the Cardamom Hills of Kerala.

To get there, we spent nearly five hours in a van grinding our way up the steep hills of the Western Ghats, stopping only for plates of vegetable curry and glasses of fresh pineapple juice. The road narrowed as we worked our way past wildlife sanctuaries and forests of sandalwood. The oppressive mugginess of the city had lifted, giving way to weather cool enough that I considered digging out the one light sweater I brought. Tea estates cascaded down the steep valleys, their tight, trimmed shrubs looking as manicured as a formal English garden.

Manoj Vasudevan, a photographer who teaches tourism in Kerala and who has been exploring the mountains here for decades, was our guide. That included explaining the finer points of mountain driving in India, which required faith, acceptance and a good horn.

The strips of pavement hugging the mountainside were often only wide enough to hold one vehicle, but sometimes three would try to navigate a stretch at once. Horns were essential to blast our gentle warnings on blind curves. Inevitable traffic knots that brought traffic to a stop were solved when a driver or a passenger would hop out and calmly direct cars and buses to back up or edge around each other. Everyone would then head on without a harsh word or even a friendly wave.

“We practice a kind of practical politeness,” he explained.

Many of the sprawling tea estates we passed are owned by Tata Global Beverages, which maintains 51 estates in India and Sri Lanka. We stopped for lunch at the Briar Tea Bungalow, a rambling, low-slung Colonial-style building northwest of Munnar that the British built on a mountain top surrounded by 2,500 acres of tea plants.

We waded out into hip-high tea bushes and hiked to where women armed with small hedge clippers spend the day trimming the very tips from the tea bushes. A day’s work brings in a little over $6, more if they can beat their daily quotas.

Soon, we were back on the road headed for the heart of spice country. Small spice gardens started to pop up the way “u-pick” apple orchards do in upstate New York. Some offer tours for a couple of hundred rupees, about $3. Others declare themselves to be organic, and have small shops where packets of vibrant ground turmeric, nutmeg and green cardamom pods can be had for prices that would make a cook used to prices at an American grocery store fall to her knees.

Touring spice gardens is a fairly new pursuit here, driven by an increasing appreciation of agriculture and cooking among tourists.

“Twenty years ago when I traveled this way there was not even a single place,” Mr. Vasudevan said. “Ten years ago there were maybe a few places. Now, they’re all over. Somebody started it then everyone started copying it because they saw that people were becoming curious to see how spices grow.”

Photo

And then there’s black pepper. From the time of the Roman Empire, people have been coming to Kerala for black pepper. Wars have been fought over it. The plants that produce the fruit are everywhere. Their thin green vines wrap around jackfruit, mango and coconut trees that grow with such abandon they don’t seem to need a bit of human effort to thrive.

Cardomom is a big money maker here, but black pepper remains the coin of the realm. Even though Indian pepper growers are fighting off cheaper production in countries like Vietnam, there are still plenty of wealthy owners who oversee vast plots of pepper plants. But in every village and small town, you can find someone who grows a little pepper and sells a few kilos when a bill comes due or there’s a wedding to fund. About 30 percent of the people who live here are involved in the spice trade, Mr. Vasudevan estimated.

Ms. Gomez and I found our way to a small, organic spice garden in Thekkady where Thomas Puttampurakkal, a retired Kerala police officer in his 80s, tends to pepper vines that twist around jackfruit and nutmeg trees growing in what seems to be an agricultural system with no real pattern or structure.

He uses only elephant dung for fertilizer. Pepper, he explained, is all about terroir. The best grows naturally here in the high elevations, the green berries protected by the shade until they ripen.

The green pepper berries become black pepper after they spend four or five days in the sun. Those same green berries can also produce white pepper, whose pungency is softened by a long soak in water before they are dried and their husks removed.

Photo

Ms. Gomez and I wandered through Mr. Puttampurakkal’s spice garden like kids in a toy store. We rubbed curry leaves between our fingers and dug up turmeric roots. We searched around the bottom of willowy cardamom stalks 12 feet tall, looking for green buds. We sucked the custardy pulp off the seeds inside cacao pods, smelled clove buds and peeled a bit of bark from a cinnamon tree.

We found a nutmeg tree and pulled down a round piece of fruit the size of my palm. Someone had a knife, so we sliced it open to reveal a glossy dark gem covered in a lacy red coat. The seed is nutmeg, the red covering mace.

In the little shop Mr. Puttampurakkal runs, I bought bags of the small, local black Malabar peppercorns locals call tribal pepper and another of the fat, fragrant peppercorns called Tellicherry, named after the famed growing region in Northern Kerala.

I bit into one. It tasted like citrus and flowers. In a split-second, heat overtook the flavor, like hot perfume in my mouth.

Ms. Gomez wandered in, her hands filled with nutmeg. “You have no idea how excited I am,” she said.

Photo

Mr. Puttampurakkal was laughing, probably at us. It was hard to tell. It didn’t matter.

I had made it to the Cardamom hills. Ms. Gomez was right. It was God’s own country. Or, at least, a cook’s.

If You Go

Kerala is always warm, but can get downright hot and muggy from March to May. December through February is reliably dry and cooler, and also more crowded. The monsoon season comes in May and can last until November. The mountains with their spice gardens and teas estates are always cooler than the coast. It’s relatively easy to rent a car or van with a driver, or take a small tour bus to the spice and tea regions. Car rentals are available, too.

Tea fans can visit the Briar Tea Bungalows (V-363, Kannan Devan Hills Village, Talliar post, Idukki; teabungalows.com/talayar-valley-bungalow-munnar/) in the Talayar Valley in Munnar, where you can pick your own tea onthe 2,500-acre estate.

Mayor Edward I. Koch compared the attack to a lynching.

After one participant testified for the prosecution, Mr. Lester, who had pleaded not guilty, was convicted of second-degree manslaughter and first-degree assault. He was sentenced in 1988 to the maximum prison term, 10 to 30 years. Two others were convicted of manslaughter as well.

In state prison, Mr. Lester earned a general equivalency diploma and an associate college degree in business administration. He learned to play the guitar and composed an ode to Mr. Griffith’s mother.

In 2001, grown by then to 5 feet 10 inches tall and 170 pounds, Mr. Lester was paroled and deported back to Britain, where he had lived until he was 14 before immigrating to the United States with his siblings, mother and stepfather.

In England he moved in briefly with his father, who had remained there after the others left for New York. He got a menial factory job, earned a degree in engineering and started his own electrical services company. He went on to live with a woman in Ashton-Under-Lyne, a town on the River Tame in Greater Manchester, and had three children with her.

Mr. Lester died on Aug. 14. Though the Coroners Service for the Manchester South District said on Monday that the cause was still under investigation, the family said it was suicide. Mr. Lester was 48.

“He suffered from depression due to the fact that he was wrongly convicted,” his sister Jayne Lester said in a telephone interview from Florida, where she lives. “He was just tormented. He was never the same person.”

Her brother was haunted by “guilt dreams,” she said, but was not a coldblooded killer.

“He really wasn’t a bad person the way they made him out to be,” she said. “He wouldn’t tell on anybody, and they had to blame someone.”

Jonathan Louis Lester was born on July 6, 1969, in Wales to John Lester and the former Jean Pollard.

The Life Events listing on his Facebook page consists of only two dates: 1984, when he started John Adams High School in Queens, and 1987, when he said he left school.

He is survived by his parents; two sisters, Julia and Jayne; a stepbrother, Peter; and his three young children. His mother, who also lives in Florida, remarried and is now known as Jean Holmes.

“What happened in Howard Beach — and make no mistake about it, no ifs, ands or buts about it — it was a racial incident that triggered off this violence,” Justice Thomas A. Demakos said in sentencing Mr. Lester in New York State Supreme Court in Queens.

Declaring that Mr. Lester showed “no remorse, no sense of guilt, no shame, no fear,” the judge asked, “What kind of individual do I have before me, who, after witnessing a young black man get crushed by a car, continues his reckless conduct by savagely beating another black male with a bat?”

Jason Ladone and Scott Kern were also convicted of manslaughter in the attack. Mr. Ladone was released in 2000, Mr. Kern in 2002.

Mr. Sandiford, who, like Mr. Griffith, was from Brooklyn, survived the beating. He married Mr. Griffith’s mother, Jean, and died of AIDS in 1991.

“In my heart I’m sorry to hear of his death,” Mr. Griffith’s mother, now Jean Griffith Sandiford, said of Mr. Lester in a telephone interview on Monday. “Regardless of what happened, I always forgave them.”

Photo

Mr. Lester later admitted to beating Mr. Sandiford with the bat. But he did not chase Mr. Griffith onto the highway, he told The Daily News in 1996, and was unaware while pursuing Mr. Sandiford that Mr. Griffith had been struck by a car.

He added, however: “I accept responsibility for Michael Griffith’s death. If we hadn’t chased him, he wouldn’t have died.”

Charles J. Hynes, the special prosecutor in the case, rejected Mr. Lester’s version of events and expressed dismay at his release from prison after he had been rejected four times for parole.

“Jon Lester can try and rewrite history all he wants,” Mr. Hynes wrote in an email on Monday. “Some would say 15 years’ imprisonment is significant punishment, but after 15 years he was alive, and Michael Griffith is dead.”

During those 15 years, mostly at Wende Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison near Buffalo, and the Sullivan Correctional Facility in Fallsburg, N.Y., in Sullivan County, Mr. Lester studied and counseled other prisoners on anger management.

In jailhouse interviews and shortly after his release, he insisted that he had never been a racist and expressed regret for the attack, something the sentencing judge said he had failed to do after his conviction.

“I was just a typical cocky teenager who got involved in a situation which I couldn’t control,” he told the British newspaper The Sunday Mirror in 2001.

Photo

“I’m not that baby-faced thug anymore,” he told The Daily News.

“I’m responsible for someone being dead,” he said in an interview with The Times Herald-Record of Middletown, N.Y. “I can never undo that, and I will live with it every day forever.”

Mr. Lester remembered reading that Mr. Griffith had two sisters.

“I have two sisters,” he told The News. “It was Christmas week. I thought I had ruined Christmas. I had probably ruined Christmas forever. I had probably ruined Christmas for the Griffith family forever, too.”

He emerged from prison scarred from fights with fellow inmates, who he said had attacked him, and armed with a business degree, which he had earned from Sullivan County Community College with a straight-A average. He had also recovered from Crohn’s disease, a bowel disorder that required several operations.

After returning to England, he attended Stockport College in Manchester before starting his electrical services business.

“In his last days he was a successful and caring businessman with a high degree of integrity who tried to live his life and give back to society,” his sister Jayne Lester said. “He always regarded the Howard Beach case as a huge tragedy to everyone involved.”

She added, “The fact that he couldn’t come back to America is basically what killed him, because he couldn’t be with his family.”

Mr. Lester’s family did not publish an obituary; his sister announced the death on Facebook. Among those who expressed condolences online was Victoria Gotti, a former neighbor and the daughter of the deceased Mafia boss John Gotti.

Ms. Lester said she had returned from England a few weeks ago with her brother’s ashes.

At the risk of belaboring an unfortunate episode that could have been averted with a bit of White House common sense, we need to examine one aspect of John Kelly’s equivalent of the St. Crispin’s Day speech from “Henry V.” This was when Mr. Kelly, the retired four-star general who is President Trump’s chief of staff, essentially said that those who haven’t served in the military — meaning nearly all Americans — cannot really understand those who have. He may as well have recited “we few, we happy few, we band of brothers” while he was at it.

“We don’t look down upon those of you that haven’t served,” Mr. Kelly said. But then he did exactly that. “In fact, in a way we’re a little bit sorry because you’ll never have experienced the wonderful joy you get in your heart when you do the kinds of things our servicemen and women do.”

Implicit in his remarks was this: If you cannot grasp instinctively what the military goes through, you may well have forfeited the right to criticize it. That point was made explicit by Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, when she called it “highly inappropriate” to “get into a debate with a four-star Marine general.”

Mr. Kelly’s statements struck some as offensively patronizing. But they can only bolster the conviction of those among us who believe that reinstating military conscription, or requiring some form of alternative national service, deserves serious consideration — and that the country would be the better for it.

Facial recognition is another troubling surveillance technology whose use is on the rise. Half of American adults are already in a law enforcement facial recognition network. Merged with police body camera technology, facial recognition could facilitate increased surveillance and the erosion of the anonymity most citizens assume when they go about their business. The New York Police Department’s body camera policy, which was adopted after consulting with the public, does not prohibit the use of facial recognition.

The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and Upturn, a technology and policy research group, last year examined the body camera policies of 51 police departments across the country, including those in Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston. Of the 51 departments, none put strict limits on the merger of facial recognition and body camera technology, and only six departments had even partial limitations in place.

Americans should be aware of the rules governing this type of surveillance in their jurisdiction. It’s one thing to be identified by the police once you’re detained; it’s another for the police to be able to identify you at a distance without having to say a word to you.

This use of facial recognition could potentially have a stifling effect on First Amendment-protected activity such as protests. Citizens may be less willing to take part if they think the police are able to catalog their participation and see where else they’ve appeared in public.

The same concern applies to drones, which, although still comparatively rare, will also be a regular part of police departments’ tool kits soon. The New York Police Department has in the past strongly resisted calls for information about its drone records.

Americans care about this. Analysis of online behavior suggests, unsurprisingly, that some changed their online search behavior after Edward Snowden’s revelations that the National Security Agency had engaged in widespread internet surveillance.

The relationship between security and liberty is often described as a balancing act. This act can’t take place if we’re not informed about the technology used to safeguard our security.

That’s why, when it comes to surveillance technology, the American people should demand to know whether the police are spying on them. At the moment, those who are suspected of being Muslim extremists are prime targets, and innocent people caught in this effort face immediate concerns. In the past, Communists, civil rights leaders, feminists, Quakers, folk singers, war protesters and others have been on the receiving end of law enforcement surveillance.

No one knows who the next target will be. What we do know is that it’s difficult to put surveillance equipment back in the box it came from.","When It Comes to Surveillance, Watch the Watchmen",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/opinion/police-surveillance.html

The unusual heat in Los Angeles also comes amid a period of extreme weather events around the country, such as the devastating hurricanes that have hit Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida; temperatures of over 100 degrees in Portland in August and San Francisco last month; and the wildfires that have raged through parts of California.

“For Angelinos, October is Santa Ana season,” said William Patzert, a climatologist with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is about 10 miles northeast of Dodger Stadium.

Santa Ana winds blow toward the Pacific Ocean when a high-pressure system builds over the Great Basin desert in Nevada. That pushes winds through the high desert and three mountain passes — Cajon, Banning and Santa Clarita River — at speeds ranging from 30 to 50 miles per hour.

“As they drop down into the basin where Dodger Stadium is, they tend to heat up and dry out,” Patzert said. “What we’re expecting in the next couple days is record-breaking heat.”

This could be not-so-welcome news for the starting pitchers in Game 1, Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers and Dallas Keuchel of the Astros.

Dodger Stadium, which sits in Chavez Ravine in the hills just above downtown Los Angeles, is one of baseball’s more pitcher-friendly ballparks — especially at night. This is due to not only the stadium’s dimensions, with its ample 385-foot power alleys, but also Los Angeles’s weather patterns. Normally, mornings bring an offshore flow, as warm air is carried out toward the ocean.

In the afternoon, the winds often shift, bringing in a moist, heavier marine layer that benefits pitchers, weighing down long drives that might normally leave the ballpark. If that marine air is absent, replaced by warm, dry and thin air from the Santa Ana winds, it could be a boon for lineups with plenty of pop. The Astros were second in the American League with 238 home runs, while the Dodgers were fourth in the National League with 221.

Keuchel, though, did not seem to mind.

“This weather is always beautiful,” he said Monday. “It’s that dry heat.”

Asked if it was hot enough to make him consider shaving his bushy, chest-length beard, Keuchel laughed.

“Well, if it’s hot enough for four wins, I’ll shave it for sure,” he said.

For a long time, weather was less of an issue in the World Series. Until the postseason was expanded in 1969, the World Series wrapped up much earlier in October. And until 1971, when Commissioner Bowie Kuhn persuaded NBC to begin broadcasting some World Series games at night, postseason games were played exclusively during the day.

Kuhn, sensitive to criticism over the move away from traditional day baseball, sat in the stands without an overcoat during Game 2 of the 1976 World Series, even though others around him shivered as they watched the Yankees play the Reds in Cincinnati. In 1979, Kuhn prohibited the Baltimore Orioles and Pittsburgh Pirates from wearing ski caps during warm-ups or in the dugout, even though it was 41 degrees at the start of Game 1.

After Kuhn was long gone, the postseason calendar kept expanding. Division series were added in 1995 to supplement the league championship series that had begun 26 years before. And then a wild-card game was added for each league in 2012.

The extended postseason action has created the opportunity for more bone-chilling nights when the Series takes place in cities like Boston, New York, Denver, Detroit, Chicago or Philadelphia.

After a frigid 2006 World Series, when the St. Louis Cardinals and the Detroit Tigers improvised to keep warm when the temperature dipped below 40 degrees, the New Era apparel company persuaded Major League Baseball to allow it to develop three types of cold-weather accouterments: knit ski caps, balaclavas and fleece-lined baseball caps with ear flaps, which drew comparison to cartoon character Elmer Fudd’s hunting cap.

The gear came in handy in 2008, when the Phillies and Tampa Bay Rays had to play in wet, windy and cold conditions in Philadelphia.

Dodgers outfielder Curtis Granderson pondered the weather’s effects on the postseason in 2006, when he played for the Tigers. “Since spring training, outside of maybe the first few weeks in April, it’s been nice weather all season,” he recalled thinking that year. “Now we’re trying to determine the best teams in baseball and it’s anywhere from 20 to 50 degrees colder than you’ve been playing all season long? Has anyone thought about this?”

Such considerations will not be necessary on Tuesday. Neither will the balaclavas, scarves and wool coats. The fans who fill Dodger Stadium are far more likely to be wearing tank tops and flip flops while they watch the Astros and Dodgers trying to beat each other — and the heat.","For Game 1 of the World Series, Mother Nature Will Bring the Heat",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/sports/baseball/dodgers-astros-heat-los-angeles.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Undoubtedly, the term “fascism” has an effective anti-authoritarian ring to it, so perhaps that is why it is thrown around so much these days. But from what I can tell, much of what students are protesting, both at the University of Oregon and elsewhere, is the expression of viewpoints or ideologies that offend them and make them feel marginalized. They are fed up with what they see as a blanket protection of free speech that, at its extreme, permits the expression of views by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. I am opposed to all these groups stand for, but offensive speech can never be the sole criterion for shutting down a speaker.

The students’ own tactics reveal just how malleable the concept of offensiveness can be. For example, the word “fascism” has deep emotional connotations for me. It’s the reason for great suffering in my family. Two generations ago, members of my extended family were thrown into concentration camps and murdered in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust.

So, when students accuse me of leading an institution that harbors and promotes fascism, it offends me. But does that justify my censoring their speech? Clearly the answer is no.

Without the freedom to express ideas, even those that offend, we cannot challenge the status quo nor move society forward. But student protesters can still change and reform institutions. In 2015, I had been president of the University of Oregon for all of three months when protests erupted around the country over the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. A group called the Black Student Task Force organized a protest right outside my office. I invited the students in for a discussion, and although the matters we discussed, about systemic racism and educational opportunity, were emotionally charged, we established a respectful dialogue. More important, the discussion led to change.

The University of Oregon engaged in a searching and difficult historical examination of racism at the school. We doubled the number of black faculty members, created new programs to enroll more black students, started an African-American lecture series, and raised $1.6 million to build a new black student cultural center. We also invested in symbolic change by removing the name of a former Ku Klux Klan leader from one of our residence halls and replacing it with the name of an illustrious black alumnus.

Educators and students must learn from each other, and nothing is more important to this exchange than free speech. Our future as a university, and more broadly, our future as a nation, depends upon our willingness to hear voices different from our own and engage in meaningful discussion.

We in academia have a lot of big issues to tackle. One such topic — what to do about speech that offends vulnerable populations and how to protect speech and safety at the same time — presents a difficult challenge, but that makes the issue that much more important.

A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Photo

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

Mrs. Royer acknowledged there was no guarantee that her son would be free of a shunt. But she said she and her husband had “happiness and peace” after deciding to go for the surgery.

On Sept. 26, the day before the operation, Mr. and Mrs. Royer and her parents met with the medical team at Texas Children’s.

With more than a dozen doctors and nurses in the conference room, it was standing room only. All would be involved in the operation.

Dr. Belfort reviewed the test results, telling the group that the fetus had a “significant lesion” involving much of his lower back. But he added, “He’s able to do the gas pedal. That’s a great thing. There’s a lot of function to save.”

Addressing Mrs. Royer, he said: “This is experimental surgery, with no guarantee. You are the person who will take the risk for another person. There is no mandate for you to do this. Nobody will think less of you if change your mind, and you can change your mind until the last minute, until you go to sleep.”

Early the next morning, with Mrs. Royer under general anesthesia, the surgery began in an overheated operating room ideal for the fetus but sweltering for doctors and nurses in caps, gloves and surgical gowns.

During the standard prenatal surgery for spina bifida, surgeons cut open the woman’s abdomen and uterus to reach the fetus. But the newer, experimental approach is different.

Dr. Belfort opened Mrs. Royer’s lower abdomen, but not her uterus. Instead, he eased the uterus out of her body and inserted the fetoscope, and then, through another slit, surgical tools. The doctors drained out the amniotic fluid and pumped in carbon dioxide to keep the uterus expanded, giving them room to work and allowing them to see better and cauterize when needed.

They gave the fetus an anesthetic injection and then, guided by images on the video screens, began to operate on him, tugging skin and membranes over the naked spinal cord and sewing them tightly shut with five stitches to seal out amniotic fluid.

Because the defect was so large, they made “relaxing incisions” along his sides, to loosen the skin so they could pull it across his back. The cuts would heal, though they would leave scars.

Every few minutes, a pediatric cardiologist called out the fetal heart rate, which held steady at a normal rate of about 150 beats a minute. When the surgery was finished, the doctors replaced the amniotic fluid with saline.

The surgery took three hours. The standard, open operation is faster and easier, but Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead think their method will prove safer for both the mother and the fetus.

With the open procedure, the cut into the uterus increases the risk of early labor and premature birth, which puts the fetus at risk for a host of complications.

The incision also raises the risk of uterine rupture during labor, and requires that the mother give birth by cesarean section, which is generally riskier for women than a vaginal birth.

The scarring on the uterus from the two operations makes it likely that she will need cesareans for future births, and also increases the risk of placental problems that can be life-threatening. The small slits for the fetoscopes are thought to reduce these risks.

To develop their fetoscopic procedure, Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead operated on sheep and spent several hundred hours over the course of two years practicing on a simulator that they had created. It consisted of a rubber kickball, about the size of a basketball — like a uterus at 24 weeks of pregnancy — with a doll inside, wrapped in chicken skin that they cut to mimic the defect in spina bifida.

They would insert fetoscopes into the ball and, eyes on the monitor, work together to sew up the chicken skin. They completed more than 30 simulated operations, including two sessions in an operating room, with a full surgical team assembled. They still use the simulator at least twice a month to keep up their skills, Dr. Belfort said.

They operated on their first patient in July 2014. In August, in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, they reported on their first 28 cases. So far, the results have been good, though the numbers are small.

No fetuses have died, few have needed shunts, and some of the mothers have been able to have vaginal deliveries. Their pregnancies appear to last longer, coming closer to full-term than with the open procedure. More research is needed, but other medical centers have begun adopting the technique. Surgeons at Johns Hopkins have used it to treat five patients, and Dr. Belfort is helping to train colleagues at Stanford.

Doctors who practice the open procedure are critical, and warn that the carbon dioxide pumped into the uterus may harm the fetus and cause neurological problems. Dr. Belfort said there has been no evidence of harm. But time will tell.

Mrs. Royer, who will stay in an apartment in Houston for the rest of her pregnancy, had a painful recovery from the surgery. But she has no regrets.

“It’s not done by any means, but I definitely feel it’s the right thing for us,” she said. “Seeing the ultrasound and how good he’s doing, moving his ankles and feet, it’s such a happy moment.

“I can’t imagine going on further in the pregnancy not knowing every day what damage is being done and if he’s getting worse. It’s such a relief to move forward.”

After several minutes, the agents arrest Mr. Bolanos, removing a paintbrush from one hand and a cellphone from the other and then placing his hands behind his back and handcuffing him. He is walked to a car outside.

An ICE public affairs officer, Yasmeen Pitts O’Keefe, said later that Mr. Bolanos was released from custody pending further investigation. She said in a statement that the matter had been referred to the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility and the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General.

“The agency is reviewing this incident,” Ms. Pitts O’Keefe said. She did not reply to a request for further comment on Monday.

In their letter to Elizabeth Godfrey, a deputy field office director for ICE, Mr. Wyden and Mr. Merkley wrote that people “do not lose their constitutional protection from warrantless search and seizure simply because ICE believes they may be immigrants.”

The senators asked Ms. Godfrey for an explanation of the policies that led to Mr. Bolanos’s arrest and questioned whether the behavior of the agents conformed to guidelines. Mr. Cardenas said on Monday that Mr. Bolanos planned to speak with a lawyer before talking publicly about the episode.

It was the latest encounter to bring ICE under criticism for its agents’ practices during arrests in Oregon and across the country. The letter from the senators said that the encounter with Mr. Bolanos came about two weeks after ICE responded to their questions about the targeting of an American citizen in Hillsboro, Ore.

In that episode last month, according to an account by the American Civil Liberties Union, a man, Isidro Andrade-Tafolla, and his wife were stopped by ICE agents as the couple left the Washington County Courthouse.

Mr. Andrade-Tafolla was asked to show his identification by agents who did not identify themselves, but who showed him a photograph. Mr. Andrade-Tafolla said that it was not him in the photograph, and that the only resemblance was skin color.

“That confusion about who is who with unidentified ICE agents could literally become deadly,” Sheriff Pat Garrett of Washington County said at a news conference last month after Mr. Andrade-Tafolla was stopped. He said sheriffs in Oregon had expressed concern to ICE about other circumstances in which agents did not identify themselves or drove in unmarked cars.

“We have heard story after story,” Representative Suzanne Bonamici said at the news conference in September.

On Friday, after Mr. Bolanos was arrested, she wrote in a joint letter with Representative Earl Blumenauer, a fellow Democrat, that the agents’ behavior was inappropriate.

“Without a response, we will assume that an investigation into the Washington County incident is not underway,” the lawmakers said. “Now after this most recent incident, it is even more disturbing to witness ICE agents act inappropriately again, only a month later.”

Mat Dos Santos, the legal director for the A.C.L.U. of Oregon, said in an interview over the weekend that the arrest of Mr. Bolanos, as seen in the video, was “flagrantly unconstitutional.”

“I hope that they review this incident and realize just how bad it is and how plainly illegal this arrest was and reprimand and retrain officers on how to conduct an arrest legally,” he added.

The middens around Damariscotta are the largest examples north of South Carolina, said Arthur Spiess, senior archaeologist with the Maine Historic Preservation Commission.

From about 2,200 to 800 years ago, Native Americans visited this site in late winter and spring. The inhabitants discarded the shells in heaps that grew year after year, century after century.

“They were eating oysters like crazy and catching alewives,” Dr. Spiess said, referring to a type of herring.

In later centuries, European settlers viewed the middens as a resource. One company burned the oyster shells for lime; another smashed them for chicken feed.

As the shells were unearthed, however, archaeologists found ceramics, bones and stone tools, and the remains of animals on which the tribes feasted. (Many of the artifacts went to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University.)

This and other middens have revealed much of what is known about Native Americans in Maine over the past 4,000 years. The best-studied site, Turner Farm, on North Haven Island in Penobscot Bay, has yielded artifacts more than 5,000 years old.

The inhabitants ate shellfish, of course, mostly soft-shell clams. But they also had a taste for deer, bear, moose, porpoise and seal; cod, sturgeon and swordfish; and even extinct species like sea mink and the flightless great auk.

Donald Soctomah, the historic preservation officer for the two Passamaquoddy tribes in eastern Maine, said middens tell important stories.

“To the Passamaquoddy, the shell middens are a link to the past, and give us an idea of how life was at a certain time and what people consumed,” Dr. Soctomah said in a phone interview. “To us, any information about our past is very important, because we didn’t have a written record.”

In an effort to more rapidly assess middens, Dr. Kelley has developed protocols to survey them using ground-penetrating radar. She thinks of the surveys as a sort of triage, a way of determining which sites are at greatest risk of erosion and which are best to study. With funding from Maine Sea Grant, she has surveyed six middens so far.

“If you want to know what was in the western Gulf of Maine 3,000 years ago, this is how you’re going to figure that out,” Dr. Kelley said.

To survey a site, Dr. Kelley and graduate student Jacque Miller pushed a wheeled radar unit about the size of a jogging stroller across the area, and followed a grid pattern at a walking pace. This allowed them to map a midden without excavating in just two or three days (longer for forested or brushy sites).

The radar not only shows the extent and thickness of the middens, but also reveals the detailed layering, including what may have been floors in historic settlements.

More Reporting on Archaeology

Ms. Miller said in addition to the cultural information buried in the middens, the shells are also a record of ancient climate. Researchers can analyze them to determine historic water temperatures and salinity in the Gulf of Maine.

Still, she said, the middens do not get much attention. “A lot of people just don’t know these things exist,” said Ms. Miller. “It’s just not a focus.”

During the radar surveys, Dr. Kelley’s team had some unpleasant surprises. In one case, they arranged permission to survey a southern Maine midden that had been recorded 49 years ago. When the crew arrived with their equipment, they found it had vanished into the sea.

At the conference, Tom Dawson and Joanna Hambly of the University of St. Andrews described the Shorewatch program, which enlists citizens to monitor archaeological sites in Scotland that are threatened by coastal erosion.

Florida has developed a similar network, called Heritage Monitoring Scouts. Dr. Kelley hopes to develop such a program in Maine.

Dr. Soctomah said he keeps an eye on middens in eastern Maine. “We try to do a walk-by after a bad storm, when you are going to see a site getting more damage,” he said.

“It’s bad because they are disappearing so fast, and the knowledge that is within those middens will be washed out to sea.”",Native American Secrets Lie Buried in Huge Shell Mounds,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/science/native-americans-shell-middens-maine.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

As the sun set in the shantytown of La Perla in Old San Juan, Ramón Marrero, 79, slumped onto the unwashed cot inside his brother’s tool shed, where he had lived since Maria claimed his home.

A single light bulb illuminated the other contents of the bare, musty room: two plastic chairs piled with clothes, canned fruit and vegetables, and a single gas burner.

Mr. Marrero, a community elder known to his neighbors as Don Ramón, draped a towel over his bare back to fend off the mosquitoes. Earlier, he had walked to the post office to charge his cellphone and mobile battery pack.

The only electricity he had seen since the storm came from an extension cord connected to a shared generator donated by Luis Fonsi, the Puerto Rican pop singer who filmed the video for the hit song “Despacito” in La Perla.

Mr. Marrero was hesitant to plug in the light bulb or his electric fan — only one could be used at a time — because he was afraid to overheat the machine or take energy from his neighbors.

Residents of the barrio say they were left to clear garbage and other debris on their own after the storm because municipal workers had failed to show up. Like Mr. Marrero, they were using fallen branches to fuel bonfires for cooking.

Lorel Cubano, the director of a local nonprofit, said most of the aid the neighborhood had received was from private citizens and celebrities like Mr. Fonsi. “The government hasn’t arrived here,” she said.

Fear in the Darkness

Georgia Lopez Ortiz, 92, is one of many elderly residents of the Luis Lloréns Torres housing project who have been too scared to walk outside since Maria wiped out the streetlights. The notoriously crime-ridden development is the largest in the Caribbean, and is dominated by rival gangs. Residents say it has become even more dangerous in the dark.

Ms. Ortiz’s washing machine does not work, so she has been hand-washing clothes in a bucket. She cannot cook, so her daughters bring her food every few days.

When aid groups visit, she throws a rope through the security bars that enclose her patio, and uses it to pull up packages of water and dried goods.

Raquel Mercado, 69, lives in a cramped one-room apartment with her 37-year-old son. Her car has not worked since it was flooded during the storm, so she has not been able to get to a bank to withdraw cash or to a pharmacy to refill her prescriptions.

She is selling snacks out of her apartment to bring in some money.

“What else is there to do?” Ms. Mercado said. “We’re stuck here.”

Baseball, Wine and Long-term Guests

A baseball game blared from speakers connected to a projector screen in Maricarmen del Llano’s living room. The adults drank red wine as they cleaned up from a dinner of fried chicken and mashed potatoes.

Even in the well-off parts of the island, though, life is not quite normal.

For the last month, seven extended family members, including a newborn, have been living with Ms. del Llano, a school psychologist; her husband, a veterinarian; and their two children, ages 7 and 9.

The whole house is running off a powerful generator. Overnight, they use the machine to run air-conditioning in each bedroom.

Tangie Sobrino, Ms. del Llano’s cousin and the newborn’s mother, is getting ready to move back home with her husband, a lawyer, and their two other young children. They were preparing to purchase a $5,200 generator.

“Our reality is not the norm,” Ms. Sobrino said, referring to the many Puerto Ricans for whom recovery was much further off.

From Good Life to Discomfort

The storm also revealed what had been carefully hidden cracks in the upper echelons of Puerto Rican society, which has been imploding during a decade-long recession.

Inside her two-story home with multiple balconies and a pool, Maria Julia Martinez’s stainless-steel refrigerator, espresso machine and toaster oven have been gathering dust. The family’s flooring business had tanked in recent years, and they could not use the appliances because they did not have $2,000 to fix their broken generator in the backyard.

They have a much smaller generator that could support a couple of small appliances at a time, but to save gas money and prevent it from breaking down, the family runs the machine only at night. They use a propane camping stove and a barbecue to prepare food.

When Ms. Martinez’s husband cranked on the small generator one night last week, she ran off to do a couple of laundry loads on the efficiency cycle. Afterward, the entire family, including their pets, went to sleep on mattresses set up on the floor of their upstairs master bedroom. A small air-conditioning unit in the room provided a respite from the rest of their home, which felt like a dark and steamy cave all day and night.

“This is living in hell,” Ms. Martinez said. She acknowledged that despite their discomfort, her family was still much better off than most people on the island. “I feel bad for feeling bad.”

A New Level of Poverty

Inside the elementary school classroom that has become their temporary home, Iris Perez and her two adult daughters sat in plastic chairs, slapping mosquitoes on their exposed arms and legs and staring blankly, as if it was too hot to speak.

Like nearly half of Puerto Ricans, they had been living in poverty before the storm. But Maria swept away their ocean-side home, and banished them to a new level of destitution.

This emergency shelter was better than the last; here there were showers and the family had the classroom to itself. Before, the women — along with Ms. Perez’s brother, son-in-law, and two young granddaughters — had slept next to other families and bathed with cups of water, filled up in the bathroom sinks.

Hand-washed clothing hung from fluorescent lights on the ceiling. A bookshelf had become a medicine cabinet, with deodorant and baby shampoo stacked in front of school books. Filing cabinets were diaper changing stations.

Nashali Reyes, Ms. Perez’s oldest daughter, was seven months pregnant, and worried about contracting the Zika virus. Her 2-year-old daughter Charyliz bobbed around the classroom with a blanket and bottle in her hands, seemingly unbothered by the bug bites on her face, which had become swollen and infected because she was allergic.

“It doesn’t matter what we do,” Ms. Reyes said, gesturing to a bottle of repellent. They had to keep the windows and doors open, they said, to maintain a livable, if extremely uncomfortable, temperature.

A message written on a whiteboard reminded them to keep their temporary home clean. “Welcome,” it said in Spanish, “God has blessed you.”

Communal Living

Felix Cruz was holding court for his neighbors at a dining table in his garage. His home had been transformed into a motel and soup kitchen of sorts, because of his two extra bedrooms and large furniture, including a couple of sofa beds where people were crashing.

Most of the neighborhood’s residents are retired and living on fixed incomes. They cook and eat communally using a 40-year-old gas stove that has been dragged out of storage and scraped clean of cockroach eggs and mold.

They have been cramming their food into a small freezer in Mr. Cruz’s backyard, opening it as little as possible to preserve the cold air.

The neighbors pooled money to pay for gas to power a small generator that could support a couple of fans, and are eating two meals a day, usually rice and whatever meat is on sale.

They eat on fine china, even though doing dishes in the dark is a pain, to try to distract themselves from their discomfort.

“It was difficult before because food was expensive, electricity was expensive, and now it’s even worse,” Mr. Cruz said. He pointed to Alma Gonzalez, 67, one of the neighbors he said had become like family. “When she has money, she pays. When I have money, I pay.

John Kelly, President Trump’s chief of staff, is grimly suited to addressing the family of a fallen service member. Mr. Kelly, a retired four-star general, is the highest-ranking officer to lose a child in Iraq or Afghanistan. His son Second Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in Afghanistan in 2010.

After more than 40 years with the Marines, Mr. Kelly possesses the gravitas and credibility on matters of military and public service that his boss does not. Which is perhaps why Mr. Trump consulted him for advice on how best to console Myeshia Johnson after her husband, Sgt. La David Johnson, was killed under still-unexplained circumstances in Niger.

Representative Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat and family friend, said Mr. Trump had upset Ms. Johnson by seeming to forget her husband’s name and by saying, in effect, that Sergeant Johnson knew what he was signing up for. Mr. Trump responded by attacking the congresswoman and insulting the family, insisting he’d said the right thing.

Mr. Kelly then weighed in at a media briefing on Thursday. One might have expected him to bring some dignity to this agonizing and confounding episode, putting things right with remarks chosen with the care for which he is known among his fellow service members. But after a passionate and moving recounting of Gold Star families’ trauma, he instead waded waist-deep into the morass Mr. Trump had created, insulting Ms. Wilson by accusing her of taking credit in 2015 for securing funding for a federal building in Miami named for two slain F.B.I. agents. He said she “stood up there and all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call he gave the money — the $20 million — to build the building.”

Did Mr. Kelly quickly acknowledge his errors? No. Instead, in the days since, he and the White House have added to his mistakes by refusing to correct them.

But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

“He’s spiked a small fever,” the unit nurse said.","M. was on this list of supplicants. His own heart, meanwhile, was failing so precipitously that he needed constant medical monitoring. Weird, deadly electrical rhythms arose out of his dying cardiac muscles, like ripples on a stagnating pond, necessitating defibrillating shocks to reset his rhythm. Fluid pooled in his feet, and the skin on his calves came off in strips.

There was a second reason to monitor M.’s status. Hearts are so rare that patients have to be under constant surveillance to ensure that they continue to “qualify” for the transplant. Transplantation is a touch-and-go procedure; a patient on the wait-list must be in the best possible condition before receiving the donor organ. An innocuous-seeming infection, or kidney failure, can spiral out of control after the transplant. “If it’s bad now, it’ll only be worse later,” the transplant nurse told me, grimly. She was efficient-looking, dressed in a white nursing smock. She noted M.’s vital signs and then disappeared down the corridor with her book.

And so we watched him. Every vital sign — temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate — was dutifully recorded in the log books and on the resident’s notes. I was on call every third night. I would stop by to say hello to M. and wait for the transplant nurse to come around. He would be puzzling over 40-across on the Sunday crossword. She would check his numbers. “Maybe there will be one tonight,” she would say, before signing off for the day.

It must have been on the third or fourth week of M.’s hospitalization, sometime late in the evening, that the transplant unit called up to the I.C.U. A kid had dead-ended his motorcycle on a concrete barrier on the expressway. He was declared brain-dead shortly after the accident, but his heart was intact. M. was on the top of the transplant list. I half-ran, half-walked to his room to bring him the news. He had been dozing through most of the day and night — a sign, perhaps, that he was having trouble pumping blood to his brain. He woke up, smiled wearily and then drifted off to sleep again.

Around midnight, I was paged to the unit. “He’s spiked a small fever,” the unit nurse said. She tried to look at me blandly. “It’s nothing,” she wanted me to say. “It’s not real. Nothing to see here, folks. Get back to work.”

“How small?”

“101.”

“Well, let’s retake the temperature.”

She measured it again. 101.

His systolic blood pressure had also dropped ever so slightly — a few, barely discernible notches. But his pressures had always been low.

I paused for a moment, weighing my choices. “Try another thermometer. And check the pressure again. Actually, let’s wait and try in 10 minutes.”

She brought another instrument out from the nurse’s station. M. began to sense the slowly building hubbub in the unit. He sat up woozily.

“Do you feel anything wrong? A chill?”

“Nope,” he said. “Nothing.”

I examined him, pore by pore, looking for a potential source.

The nurse entered the room and made a tiny motion to see her outside. I met her by the nurse’s station. “Should we record the temperature?” she asked, whispering, as if the intercom might be eavesdropping.

The stakes could not have been clearer to both of us. If we put the number in the chart, M. would temporarily fall off the list for the next morning. The transplant surgeons at this hospital, I knew, would never risk taking a febrile, potentially septic, patient to the operating room.

I felt paralyzed. Medicine depends on looking at data objectively, dispassionately; a decade of training had taught me that. But it also depends on understanding that tests can mislead us, that data can deceive: What patient ever fits squarely into an assigned box? My fingers hovered above the computer, where I was meant to write my note and record the fateful temperature spike, but I found that I couldn’t type a word.

At 1 a.m., I called the attending physician. I felt foolish: I imagined her scuffling around her nightstand for her spectacles, anticipating a question about an acute cardiac crisis. Instead, there was a mumbling, hesitant resident trying to decide whether to write a note. But she understood immediately. She walked through the details of the case. Had I really evaluated the infection? Yes, yes, I reassured her — or rather, tried to reassure myself.

“It’s really your decision, Sid,” she said. “But you’ve got to consider that in some other hospital, there’s some other young guy — a doctor, with a Ph.D. — waiting for that same heart. If your patient goes to the O.R. infected, he’s not going to make it, and the new heart is going to die with him.”

I put the phone down and turned to the nurse. The fever had come down to 100 degrees. What if we hadn’t measured it in the first place? What if we’d forgotten to take the vitals on one shift? How about all the things we don’t measure? Muscle tone? Wakefulness? If a temperature spikes in a forest. ...

I returned to the computer, tried to type my note, hesitated and stopped again.

I wrote my final note at 2 in the morning. Temperature: 101 degrees, currently 100. No obvious source of infection. A chest X-ray showed no signs of a pneumonia. A complete history and physical exam was unrevealing. Awaiting blood-culture data.

At rounds the next morning, I felt as if I had let the team down. I presented the case quietly, feeling the eyes of my co-residents burning holes into my skull. No one had any questions.

There were just a few more days left in the rotation, and I went to say goodbye to M. His fever had subsided on its own after that overnight spike. “I’m sorry,” I said, and he nodded.

M. died of a fatal arrhythmia a few weeks later. No other heart became available. The fever never returned.",The Rules of the Doctor’s Heart,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/magazine/the-rules-of-the-doctors-heart.html

But none of RT’s social media activities or its presence in cable and satellite TV lineups has delivered the impact of its YouTube channel.
RT launched its YouTube page in March 2007, roughly four months after Google paid $1.65 billion for the fledgling video site.
His personal YouTube channel has earned more than 60 million views.
Today, RT ranks among the top news channels on YouTube for views, subscribers and “engagement” such as comments or likes.","As the presidential election heated up in the spring of 2016, RT consistently featured negative stories about Mrs. Clinton, according to United States intelligence officials. That included claims of corruption at her family foundation and ties to Islamic extremism, frequent coverage of emails stolen by Russian operatives from Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, and accusations that she was in poor physical and mental health.

“More than half of American adults say they watch YouTube, and younger viewers are moving to YouTube at staggering numbers,” said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russia’s exploitation of social media platforms based in the United States. “YouTube is a target-rich environment for any disinformation campaign — Russian or otherwise — that represents a long-term, next-generation challenge.”

Much like the Russian-controlled pages on Facebook, RT’s YouTube videos comply with YouTube’s community guidelines, which cover things like nudity, copyright violations and promoting violence against a group based on race or religion. But not propaganda.

YouTube carries “a wide variety of news channels” that represent “an array of viewpoints across the political spectrum,” said a spokesman for the company, Chris Dale.

RT’s reach on YouTube — 2.2 million subscribers, just slightly behind CNN — stemmed from a long and mutually beneficial relationship between the news channel and the video site, according to current and former RT employees and technology industry analysts.

YouTube had the vast audience and global reach that RT needed as it set out to become a worldwide alternative news source with influence and viewers beyond Russia’s own borders. RT has YouTube channels in a number of foreign languages including Arabic, Spanish, German, French and Chinese.

“RT management did view YouTube as hugely important to spreading content,” said Liz Wahl, a former correspondent in the United States for RT who quit on the air in 2014 over concerns that the network was whitewashing the Russian annexation of Crimea. “Traditional television ratings weren’t important because the aim was to get the messaging out through various digital and social platforms.”

The Russian channel was among the first news organizations to recognize YouTube’s power and developed content intended to perform well on the platform. RT uploads videos frequently, sprinkling in buzzy viral videos of disasters — plane crashes, tsunamis, a meteor strike — to earn likes and longer watch times, which YouTube’s algorithm rewards with better placement among search results and recommendations.

The viral videos, which were often borrowed from other sources, help to build up RT’s subscribers, and they became part of the Kremlin’s audience for more political content.

“People come for the click-bait material,” said Bret Schafer, an official at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, the Washington-based public policy research group. “And they eventually land on videos that the Kremlin wants them to see.”

While much of RT’s traffic stems from nonpolitical videos, the channel’s political and foreign affairs content ranks highly in many YouTube searches. Searches on topics on which the Kremlin is typically eager to promote its point of view — American intervention in Syria, the Ukrainian civil war or the rise of Germany’s far-right AfD party — will often turn up an RT video as one of the top results.

YouTube also provided RT with the kind of perks it reserved for big publishers, including custom backgrounds for its channel in the early days and a “check mark” that designated RT as a verified news source. Until recently, RT was also among a select group of news organizations included in Google’s “preferred” news lineup, granting them access to guaranteed revenue from premium advertisers. Those advertisers, in effect, subsidized Russia’s international propaganda arm.

Google dropped RT from the preferred lineup last month. Andrea Faville, a Google spokeswoman, said the decision was unrelated to the congressional inquiry, and that RT had been dropped as part of a “standard algorithmic update.” But Google also noted that it was not placing any other limits on RT: The channel could still sell regular ads on its videos and the status downgrade only applied in the United States. Google later clarified that RT was downgraded in other markets, but it would not say which ones.

Kirill Karnovich-Valua, RT’s deputy editor in chief, said the organization had not been informed of Google’s decision and it was puzzled about why it was dropped despite being “one of the most watched YouTube channels in the world.”

“This speaks to the unprecedented political pressure increasingly applied to all RT partners and relationships in a concerted effort to push our channel out of the U.S. market entirely, and by any means possible,” Mr. Karnovich-Valua wrote in an email.

Last month, RT said the Justice Department had demanded that a private company affiliated with RT America register as a “foreign agent” — a term that dates back to a law originally enacted in 1938 to deter Nazi propaganda. On Thursday, after the deadline set by American officials had passed, an RT spokeswoman said that the news organization was “doing everything possible for RT to avoid having to register.” Registration could impose voluminous disclosure requirements on RT, a particular burden for a media organization producing frequent content.

Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, responded in more forceful terms: Should the United States impose restrictions on Russian media, Mr. Putin said last week, Russian would act “symmetrically and quite swiftly.”

RT’s use of other technology platforms is also under investigation. Last month, officials at Twitter told a Senate Intelligence Committee that three RT accounts targeting an American audience — with a combined following of roughly six million users — had spent $274,100 to promote tweets in 2016.

But none of RT’s social media activities or its presence in cable and satellite TV lineups has delivered the impact of its YouTube channel. RT launched its YouTube page in March 2007, roughly four months after Google paid $1.65 billion for the fledgling video site. At the time, YouTube was better known for pirated content and videos of cute animals than news programming, but RT caught on quickly.

The Russian channel recruited talent from within the burgeoning world of YouTube-born media stars, people who had already shown a knack for creating viral or popular video content.

One RT contributor, the British blogger Graham Phillips, built a large following on YouTube with videos from Ukraine’s civil war, many of them critical of Ukraine’s central government. RT often featured Mr. Phillips and at one point employed him as a part-time freelancer before he was arrested and deported by Ukrainian authorities. His personal YouTube channel has earned more than 60 million views.

Another RT contributor, Lori Harfenist, began her career on public-access television in New York City, and eventually moved her self-produced show, “The Resident,” to YouTube. Ms. Harfenist was one of the platform’s first revenue-sharing partners, according to a biography on Ms. Harfenist’s personal website.

Ms. Harfenist was eventually recruited by RT, which began featuring her on segments with titles like “America is a Hypocrite.” During the presidential campaign, RT’s Twitter account promoted a video from her that claimed the existence of an anti-Semitic conspiracy involving Hillary Clinton, Google and the Illuminati. (She later claimed the segment was meant as satire.) Ms. Harfenist did not respond to emails and Facebook messages seeking comment.

Today, RT ranks among the top news channels on YouTube for views, subscribers and “engagement” such as comments or likes. The most-watched clips on RT are not political or anti-establishment videos, they are snackable content. A clip of a homeless man with a gifted voice for radio is the most popular video on RT, viewed 40 million times since it was uploaded six years ago.

Mr. Karnovich-Valua said RT’s primary aim is to provide an alternative point of view on current events so its audience can get a full picture of world events. “Where relevant, RT does present a Russian perspective on current events, but we don’t promote the Russian point of view, we explain it alongside with presenting others,” he said.

Some lawmakers, including Mr. Warner, have called for tighter regulation and disclosure requirements for political advertising on social media platforms. Yet RT’s embrace of YouTube shows how difficult it could be to limit foreign influence.

You might buy a copy of Rolling Stone simply to ogle a superstar or to find out if Jerry Garcia was still dating Mountain Girl. But as the magazine began to filter out across America, it let a lot of lonely people discover that there were other people like them and other ways to live.

Over the ensuing decades, Hagan writes, Wenner assembled “an entire American cosmology of superstars and superstar journalists, stories, and myths, all fired in the kiln of his appetites and ambition. Millions had dreamed on his pages. Bruce Springsteen said Rolling Stone changed his life. Patti Smith found liberation in Rolling Stone.”

“Sticky Fingers” is about promises and promises betrayed, and about how Wenner’s life — his increasing obsession with fame and a plutocratic lifestyle — reflected both.

The visions the rock culture had once delivered “had morphed into the Me Decade,” Hagan writes, “and the Me Decade had turned into Me Decades, and finally the falcon could no longer hear the falconer, not even in the pages of Rolling Stone.”

Wenner and our current president are the same age, and Hagan draws a straight line between them. “The solar eclipse of Donald Trump signaled the complete triumph of celebrity culture over every aspect of American life,” Hagan writes, and Wenner helped lead us to the state we are in.

Come for the essayist in Hagan, stay for the eye-popping details and artful gossip. Wenner has complained about how much of that gossip is focused on his changeful sexual appetites. Wenner has slept for much of his life with men and women and thus, to paraphrase Woody Allen on the upside of bisexuality, has rarely lacked a date for Saturday night.

Hagan could easily have named-dropped his way through this book, yet he doesn’t drop names so much as pick them up and coolly appraise them in a line or two. Here’s Joni Mitchell, “plucking a dulcimer and ululating.” Or the record executive Ahmet Ertegun, “with the half-lidded ease of a beat poet.” Or Thompson, who “mumble-grumbled like a character actor from a Bogart movie.” Or Keith Richards, “looking as if his face were roasted for a Thanksgiving dinner.”

Richards has become the Gore Vidal of rock, the elder statesman always armed with an acid quote. He says about Wenner and Mick Jagger (this book floats the possibility that the two slept together): “They’re both very guarded creatures. You wonder if there’s anything worth guarding.”

Wenner founded Rolling Stone with money borrowed from the family of his soon-to-be wife, Jane Schindelheim, after dropping out of Berkeley. A famous early cover featured a naked John Lennon and Yoko Ono. “Print a famous foreskin,” Wenner wrote in the next issue, “and the world will beat a path to your door.”

The staffers at Rolling Stone tended to sleep together, and often enough with Wenner, according to Hagan’s account. Wenner developed an outsize cocaine habit; writers and staffers were sometimes paid bonuses with the drug. When the staff stayed en masse in a hotel, the management couldn’t figure out, the next day, why all the mirrors were off the wall and on their backs.

As rock music faded in importance, Rolling Stone got a lift from Wolfe and Thompson and became, in many ways, the beating heart of New Journalism. Annie Leibovitz made the magazine’s images as vital as its writing.

After Wenner himself, Leibovitz is the most fully realized character in this biography. She comes across as an endearing wild child, sleeping with some of her subjects, abandoning rental cars in haste at airports and becoming, Hagan writes, a “full-blown drug addict whose body was, more than once, unceremoniously dumped in front of a hospital by her dealer.”

In the decades that followed the ’70s, Rolling Stone made money but largely ceased to matter. Hagan charts the way that Wenner, in some of his employees’ estimation, sold out to record companies, and the way he allowed his favorite artists to control what was written about them.

Wenner had a heart attack and broke a hip in June. He has put his controlling share of Rolling Stone up for sale. The magazine itself had grown perilously thin, even before it was rocked by a discredited story about a rape at a University of Virginia fraternity.

Wenner comes off in “Sticky Fingers” as a narcissist, a bully, a seducer and a betrayer, and a troubled soul. Feuds with countless people — Lennon, Paul Simon, Greil Marcus, the promoter Bill Graham — are recounted. He also led a big life that was packed with incident and frequently even joy. “The alchemy of his appetites,” Hagan writes, is what made him a great editor in chief.

This book lays those appetites bare. In scorning Hagan’s work, Wenner’s editorial antennae have failed him. He had the nerve to select a writer and not a hagiographer, and the decision, at the end of his long career, looks good on him.

Halloween in New York is terrifying. Haunted houses pop up throughout the five boroughs, subway cars swell with all kinds of characters and, scariest of all, interminable lines for parties snake around city blocks.

But the week leading up to Halloween in New York? Adorable. This year, the Tompkins Square Halloween Dog Parade drew 500 canines and an estimated 25,000 humans to the East Village. Here are some of the good boys and girls who braved the unseasonably warm fall day in full costume.

Steyer, a hedge fund manager-turned-environmentalist who spent more than $91 million on behalf of Democrats in 2016, finds this reticence baffling. “What is the calculus to being silent on the most important issue of the day, where it’s absolutely critical to the American people, and it will go on the historical record of what you did or didn’t do?” he asked me. “I don’t understand.”

I’ve spoken to Democrats who fear making impeachment too partisan, holding out hope that if Trump’s behavior becomes egregious enough Republicans might join the effort to hold him accountable. Others, Sherman told me, say, “We don’t want to distract from health care, and from our economic plan.” And, of course, some on the left believe that a functioning Mike Pence administration would be worse than the dysfunctional Trump regime.

There are strategic merits to all these arguments. But they leave many Americans terrified by Trump’s erratic behavior and incompetence feeling marooned, confused as to why their leaders aren’t treating this presidency like the civic emergency that it is. At some point, we need politicians to address the crisis in front of us. “We have a democracy to protect and a republic to save, and that’s what this is all about,” Green told me.

Obviously, no matter how grave the threat, a Republican-controlled Congress has little incentive to act. But even if Democrats retake the House in 2018, Sherman told me, impeachment “would still require a change in public opinion.”

This is why Steyer’s campaign is potentially useful, even if at first glance it seems quixotic. Sure, it’s hard to imagine anyone who doesn’t already despise the president being convinced by the earnest plea of a filthy-rich California climate activist. But Steyer is aiming at movement-building; he wants to reach people who desperately want Trump gone but don’t know what to do about it. “We’re asking electeds to stand up for the right thing, but we’re going to American citizens to ask them to demand it,” he said.

Some commentators fear “normalizing” impeachment as a tool of routine political warfare. But Bill Clinton’s impeachment already normalized its use against Democrats on the flimsiest of pretexts. Had Hillary Clinton been elected, the campaign to remove her would probably be in full swing by now. Democrats may wish to return to a less destructive brand of politics, but that’s not an option while Trump sits in the White House.

While he does, we’re all better off if he thinks impeachment is a possibility. “I’m hoping that if Trump is aware that he could be removed, that that awareness constrains him to the extent he can be constrained,” Sherman said. And the best way to show Trump that people are serious about impeaching him is to put the message on television.",Democrats Should Embrace Impeachment,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/opinion/trump-impeachment-tom-steyer.html

Researchers have even found occurrences among sign language users. (Those, they call tip-of-the-finger states.)

We’re more likely to draw blanks on words we use less frequently — like abacus or palindrome — but there are also categories of words that lead to tip-of-the-tongue states more often.

Proper names are one of those categories. There’s no definitive theory, but one reason might be that proper names are arbitrary links to the people they represent, so people with the same name don’t possess the same semantic information the way that common nouns do, Abrams said.

To do that, they must contain the revenue losses from reducing tax rates, both over the next decade and in the years to follow.

The party’s most difficult fights will be over how to do that — by some combination of eliminating popular tax breaks and employing accounting maneuvers, such as setting some tax cuts to expire, in order to reduce revenue losses.

Mr. Corker stands as a possible impediment to that plan. A longstanding opponent of rising federal deficits, the senator has said he will not vote for any tax bill that would increase the federal debt by a dollar. But on Thursday, the House is expected to give final approval to a budget blueprint that would protect a 10-year, $1.5 trillion tax measure from a Democratic filibuster.

A Treasury Department report released on Friday showed that the budget deficit for fiscal 2017 grew by $80 billion, to $666 billion, as federal spending eclipsed revenues and economic growth remained tepid. At the same time, Congress is contemplating what the president has promised would be the largest tax cut in history.

The protracted Tuesday-morning brawl quickly spread from taxes and debt to foreign policy and the president’s fitness for office.

Mr. Corker said Mr. Trump was “absolutely not” a role model for the children in America.

“I don’t know why he lowers himself to such a low, low standard and is debasing our country,” Mr. Corker said in a CNN interview, suggesting that he will soon convene hearings to examine the ways Mr. Trump “purposely has been breaking down relationships around the world.”

“It’s unfortunate that our nation finds itself in this place,” he added.

Mr. Trump then attacked Mr. Corker’s tenure at the helm of the Foreign Relations Committee.

Mr. Corker, who supported Mr. Trump in the 2016 presidential election, told CNN on Tuesday that he would not do that again.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Corker have been locked in a public feud for weeks. Mr. Corker has said that Mr. Trump runs his White House like a reality TV show, and Mr. Trump has responded by mocking Mr. Corker’s height, calling him “Liddle’ Bob.”

Mr. Trump has made declarations about the tax plan while the legislation is still being drafted. On Monday, Mr. Trump said the plan would not include any changes to how much Americans can save in tax-deferred retirement plans like 401(k) accounts.

“Hopefully the White House will step aside and let that occur in a normal process,” Mr. Corker said on NBC’s “Today.”

Any tax plan would need all the Republican support Mr. Trump can get in the Senate, and his fight with Mr. Corker puts that support in jeopardy.

“I think it’s fine for him to come over,” Mr. Corker said of the president’s visit to Capitol Hill. “I do look at these things as more of a photo op. They’re not really about substance, but more power to him.”

The Republicans have promised the most sweeping revision of the tax code in decades, a challenging task that has already met Democratic opposition. Some supporters of the tax overhaul are concerned Mr. Trump’s streaming comments on the plan could hurt chances of getting it approved.","Trump and Corker Escalate Battle Over Taxes, in Personal Terms",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/trump-corker-feud-dog-catcher.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

The most recent idea to get caught in the game of legislative whack-a-mole was a proposal to dramatically lower the cap on the amount that workers can set aside in their 401(k) retirement accounts. Currently workers under 50 can set aside up to $18,000 a year without having to pay taxes up front on that money. House Republicans were discussing lowering that to $2,400.

This creates both practical and political problems. Lowering the cap on 401(k) contributions would save only a sliver of the $1.5 trillion in lost revenue from the tax cuts that Republicans are pushing. What is more, such plans are widely used by middle-class taxpayers that Republicans say they are trying to help. The idea died a quick death on Monday when President Trump said he would not let it happen.

Raising income taxes on the rich

The tax framework released by the “Big Six” Republican tax working group last month — the six lead negotiators from the House, Senate and Trump administration — called for three tax brackets with a top rate of 35 percent, down from 39.6 percent today. The plan kept open the option of creating an additional tax bracket for top earners to ensure the tax code remained progressive. No guidance was given on what that tax rate would be or what income level it would apply to.

Lawmakers, now facing criticism that their plan is a giveaway to the rich, are considering adding that additional bracket, potentially keeping it at the current 39.6 percent rate or slightly lowering or raising it.

While Mr. Trump says that many of his wealthy friends have encouraged him to raise their taxes to help the middle class, doing so would be a break with Republican orthodoxy. Republican leaders in Congress have been hesitant to raise tax rates on anyone because the party’s brand is largely built around the idea that the economy does best when people have more money to spend.

Cutting corporate taxes — gradually

A big reduction in the corporate tax rate is the centerpiece of a plan that Republicans argue will trigger robust economic growth, create incentives for businesses to stay in the United States and prompt businesses to pay more to their workers. But cutting the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, while getting rid of the corporate alternative minimum tax, would cost nearly $2 trillion over 10 years. So Republicans have been talking about the possibility of a temporary tax cut or getting to the lower rate gradually, over a period of years.

Temporary or gradual tax cuts would be less costly, but they could also pack less punch for accelerating economic growth. Companies say that they are less likely to make long-term investment plans if they think their tax rates will eventually start climbing again. A phased-in tax cut would likely encourage businesses to time their investments accordingly, meaning that growth would remain sluggish in the near-term. Since Republicans are counting on rapid economic growth to pay for their tax cuts, anything that inhibits this could be counterproductive.

Grappling with a global minimum tax

Multinational corporations have been salivating at the prospect of a switch from a “worldwide” tax system to a territorial system, where profits earned abroad are not taxed by the United States. Such a switch, they contend, would make American companies more competitive with their counterparts around the world and spur hiring at home.

The fear — and the coming fight — is over a proposed “global minimum tax” that would be paired with the new system. In theory, this would protect the tax base from being eroded by companies having even more incentive to do business overseas. However, firms fear that such a tax would continue to make them less competitive than their global counterparts and mean that the tax system is not truly territorial.

Curbing the deductibility of corporate interest

For months, House Republicans pitched a plan to eliminate the deductibility of corporate interest in exchange for allowing companies to immediately write-off equipment expenses. The latest plan would allow companies to immediately expense their equipment purchases for five years and only partially deduct interest they pay on loans.

However, compromises come with their own sets of problems. Making expensing temporary could lead to an investment hangover after five years. Firms that rely heavily on debt are bracing for a big fight if the curbs on deductibility prove overly onerous. Ultimately they may get their way, as Mr. Trump’s industry – real estate – prizes the deduction.",Tax Cuts Are Coming.

The Nuevo Amanecer Mariachi Academy is one of those places where the traditions of Mexico are passed onto new generations.

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

“They are a generation in transition since they are the first to be born here, yet they have not lost their roots,” said Ms. Vincenti, 28. “They are American, but they consider themselves Mexican, too.”

The young people, she said, approach their studies eagerly, unlike those of us who balked at weekly piano lessons as children. Even in their spare time, they kick back and play their instruments just for the fun of it. Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

You were the guest chef for the first state dinner of former President Barack Obama. How did it feel to take on such a huge task?

Besides opening Red Rooster, it’s probably the biggest honor that I’ve had as a chef. The idea of being an immigrant in this country and cooking at the White House was amazing. Up until that point, most state dinners featured French food, but I thought we should have food connected to the guest of honor [then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India].

The policy also provides guidelines for cleaning exam rooms in between patients, disinfecting equipment (including wiping stethoscopes with alcohol), cleaning up after any spills involving body fluids, and general housekeeping. (Certain infections require more than just cleaning, of course; if a child has measles or chickenpox, we have to track down everyone who was exposed and offer specific protections to those who aren’t fully immunized, and measles is so infectious that cleaning the room isn’t enough — we actually have to leave it empty for a while to get rid of the risk.)

Parents might want to ask about infection control when they are choosing a pediatrician, Dr. Jackson said. Look to see that surfaces and toys look easy to clean, that tissues and a place to dispose of tissues are provided, that hand sanitizer is easily accessible.

You might also want to ask how the practice handles children who are not adequately immunized, and whether they are kept out of the waiting room when they’re sick.

Ask, “How do you triage? What does your waiting room look like? Are your health care workers immunized against influenza? Do you have a policy for infection control?” she said.

No matter where we start, we always come back to good hand-washing or the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer. “Hand hygiene at all levels” is critical, said Dr. Mobeen H. Rathore, the lead author on the policy statement, who is a professor of pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Jacksonville, and the chief of pediatric infectious disease at Wolfson Children’s Hospital. Parents should be vigilant, he said, “teaching their children hand hygiene, practicing their own hand hygiene, insisting health care providers practice hand hygiene — it’s O.K. to ask.”

And then there is what we now refer to as “cough etiquette,” that is, covering a cough, coughing into your elbow rather than your hand, and, yes, again, practicing hand hygiene after wiping your nose or dealing with a cough.

But while infection control in the waiting room and the exam room are important, the best ways to protect your child actually go back well before that trip to the doctor. First and foremost, make sure your child is fully immunized, including getting the annual influenza vaccine as soon as it’s available. Yes, I know, that means going to the doctor’s office, but it’s still the most crucial thing you can do, and if you get the flu shot early in the season, your child will have had time to generate a full immune response before there’s a lot of flu going around.

And if the bad thing happens, in spite of everyone’s best efforts, and there’s that dreaded waiting room exposure for a very contagious disease like measles or chickenpox, you at least want to be one of the people who was there with a fully immunized child. “There’s nothing better than giving your child vaccines to prevent infections,” Dr. Rathore said.

More immediately, for any given visit to the doctor, good infection control precautions start before you actually come in, and they involve both the parent and the pediatric office staff. The people you talk to on the phone should have the training they need to ask you if there are concerning symptoms — a funny rash, a fever, a bad cough — which suggest that your child should not spend any time in the waiting room.

If you have a sick child, make sure to explain the symptoms when you make the appointment, and tell the staff if there are additional details that might raise the odds that it’s something contagious (recent return from exotic travel, exposure to someone with a known infection, child not properly immunized). Maybe they can put you into an exam room right away or have you come at the very beginning or the very end of the day.

“We had a case very recently, a parent who called us, said the child may have chickenpox,” Dr. Rathore said. “We asked them not to bring the child in to the clinic. We looked at the child outside.”

If you have a child who is particularly vulnerable to infections, you might ask whether there is a way to minimize time in the waiting room, especially during the winter months. Some practices try to batch the well child checkups, or the newborn and young-infant checkups, for example, so that there are certain hours or days when the waiting room and exam rooms are dedicated to infants, too young to be fully immunized (we don’t start giving flu shots till 6 months, and babies born premature are especially vulnerable to respiratory infections).
