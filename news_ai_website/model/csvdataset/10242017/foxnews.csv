I wish I could invite you into our home and discuss it over one of my daughter’s amazing homemade lemon tarts.","Loving big is a way of life around our house. Everyone is welcome. Just last week, we had students from Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Japan, Liberia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, and Mali around our table. We’ve made our goal to fill our home as often as possible with people who are different from us—to learn, to laugh, and to grow—but you might not get that impression if you Google our business or check out my personal Facebook profile.

That’s because 10 months ago, my husband and I filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota law that would require our small business to celebrate same-sex marriages if we enter into the marriage industry at all.

As Christians, we’d love to use our talents as filmmakers to celebrate the goodness of marriage as taught in the Bible though our work, but the state has made it clear that if we don’t promote all messages about marriage, we’ll face enormous fines, and even up to 90 days in jail, simply for living according to our convictions.

Since then, we’ve received a staggering amount of messages wishing death, disease, and poverty on us, our family, and even some of our closest associates all because we challenged the idea that the government shouldn’t have the power to silence or threaten anyone for not promoting all messages.

So when a federal judge ruled in our case, and equated our request to protect our conscience to posting a “White Applicants Only” sign in our window, we were both hurt and deeply offended. Like most people in the expressive professions, we work with all people; we just can’t promote all messages.

A person’s protected status is irrelevant to these types of message-based decisions. For example, an atheist print-shop owner is no more guilty of religious discrimination for declining to design a T-shirt for a Christian that proclaims “God exists” than we are guilty of sexual orientation discrimination for declining to create films promoting messages about marriage with which we disagree.

Not just our business practices, but our whole lives, run counter to the “whites only” analogy. Two of our sons are adopted from Ethiopia. Our youngest child is half Cameroonian and half Native American. And having eight children means we can’t afford to travel the world, so we bring the world to us. We do this precisely because we believe beauty exists in the diversity of God’s creation.

In fact, several years ago we intentionally began to stay home on holidays so that we could celebrate with people who would otherwise have no place to go. This has included spending Christmas with an alcoholic Vietnam veteran, a bisexual international student, and yes, even Trump supporters, among many, many others. We love all people. We work with all people. We simply don’t promote all messages.

But the irony of it all is that every single person operates this way. Nobody wants to be forced to promote messages—via custom artistic expression in our case—or have to repress their own speech just because their opinion is unpopular in the eyes of the government.

If the First Amendment only protects speech that is popular in its cultural day, then it really doesn’t protect any speech.

This is why we’re appealing the court’s ruling. This case is about preserving the freedom of all people to live according to their sincerely held beliefs—a principle we all should be able to support.

We are all on a journey with our convictions. I wish I could invite you into our home and discuss it over one of my daughter’s amazing homemade lemon tarts. But until that can happen, no matter where you are on that path or what you believe about marriage, we should all be able to agree that living peacefully according to our deepest convictions without the fear of government punishment is best for everyone.",Christian videographer: Let's live together in peace instead of silencing those with whom we disagree,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/20/christian-videographer-lets-live-together-in-peace-instead-silencing-those-with-whom-disagree.html

Brandon Bloom, 8, of South Setauket, on Long Island, became an NHL athlete for a day, Newsday reported.

The boy was diagnosed with Stage 4 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma last year. He has been undergoing chemotherapy and will be done with his treatment in August 2018.

The special day was set up by the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society’s Random Acts of Light Campaign. The campaign’s mission is to “bring light to the darkness of cancer and create awareness for the critical need to find new treatments and cures for blood cancer patients,” according to its website.

Bloom called the day at the Northwell Health Ice Center in East Meadow “a dream come true” and revealed he was scared at first but “had a lot of fun.”

Bloom was given ice skates and a custom-made jersey with his name stitched on the back, ABC 7 reported.

The boy was able to perform drills on the ice and shoot a hockey puck with the team’s players. Bloom also scored a goal, which prompted the Islanders to celebrate around their new teammate. One of the players, Casey Cizikas, wrapped up the puck Bloom shot with tape and wrote on it “1st NHL goal” before giving it to the boy.

Senior senators are demanding a rethink of U.S. policy toward Myanmar in response to what they call a systematic military campaign to force Rohingya Muslims out of the country.

Ben Cardin, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, characterized the crackdown as ""genocide"" and said the U.S. should seek accountability for the perpetrators.

He said half of the Rohingya population in Myanmar had left the country and villages were burned systematically.

Cardin told a hearing Tuesday the U.S. needs to re-evaluate whether it should have normal relations with Myanmar.

Bob Corker, the Republican committee chair, questioned whether the Obama administration had rolled back sanctions too quickly in response to its shift toward democracy.

U.S. officials are preparing a recommendation for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to declare that ""ethnic cleansing"" is occurring against Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims.

That assessment would raise pressure on the Trump administration and American lawmakers to consider new sanctions on a country that had been lauded for its democratic transition.

Officials familiar with the process say Tillerson could receive the recommendation as early as this week. He will then decide on whether to adopt the advice of his agency's policy experts and lawyers.

The officials weren't authorized to speak publicly on the internal process and requested anonymity.

The uranium agreement was reached while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, and some investors in the Russian-backed company, Uranium One, had relationships with former President Bill Clinton and donated to the Clinton Foundation.

“I’ve spoken with the confidential informant that helped the FBI uncover this bribery scheme,” DeSantis, R-Fla., a member of the oversight committee, told “America’s News Headquarters.” “Clearly, it’s in the public’s interest that this individual be able to tell his story to Congress.”

When asked by Fox News if a criminal investigation would be coming, DeSantis responded: “It could be criminal.” He cited statutes of limitations that may limit prosecutions of any crimes that may arise from the 2010 deal.

The Senate Judiciary Committee last week said it started an investigation into the matter, including whether federal agencies knew the FBI was looking into possible corruption before the deal was approved.

In addition, Iowa GOP Sen. Charles Grassley, the committee chairman, has requested the Justice Department lift a non-disclosure agreement that a former FBI confidential informant said prevents him from speaking to Congress about the handling of a criminal probe linked to the deal.

Grassley said the Justice Department had threatened to prosecute the informant if he disclosed details of his involvement in the investigation.

DeSantis said Sunday the informant to whom he spoke signed his original non-disclosure deal with Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder and was “threatened with reprisal” by the Justice Department under Attorney General Loretta Lynch when he tried to “come forward” in 2016.

DeSantis also said he has spoken with the informant’s attorney, but it’s unclear whether the informant is the same one to whom Grassley has referred.

The House Oversight Committee doesn’t appear to have announced officially that it has opened a probe or more formal investigation. Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., could not be reached Sunday for comment.

“I have spoken with Chairman Gowdy. He believes that this is an important issue and he has indicated to me that he is supportive of what we are doing. So, I think you are going to see action,” DeSantis added.

President Trump said last week that media outlets have failed to cover the purchase of American uranium mines by the Russian-backed company adequately, as most recently reported by The Hill.

The Senate committee launched its probe after the series of Hill stories, which showed the FBI had evidence that Russian nuclear officials were involved in fraudulent dealings in 2009 before the uranium deal was approved.

During his 2016 campaign, Trump frequently cited the deal for the uranium, which is used in nuclear reactors, and has returned to the issue at rallies during his presidency.

Clinton's State Department was one of nine U.S. government agencies that had to approve the deal. But Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and former State department officials have said she was not involved in the approval process by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.

Republicans have also pointed to some of the investors in the deal and their ties to the former president. Canadian financier Frank Giustra, a top Clinton Foundation donor, sold his company, UrAsia Energy, to Uranium One, which was chaired by Ian Telfer, also a Clinton Foundation donor.

Giustra has said he sold his stake in the deal in 2007, while Clinton and Barack Obama were vying for the Democratic presidential nomination.

And PolitiFact found that most of the donations from individuals related to Uranium One and UrAsia Energy were made before and during Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign — before she became secretary of state.

The musician announced Tuesday he will not be running for the U.S. Senate in Michigan. The rocker, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, told Howard Stern he has decided to stay out of politics.

In a statement released on his website in July, the rocker announced a new initiative to create a “non-profit organization for the promotion of voter registration,” while he continues to explore the idea of challenging incumbent Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich, in 2018.

The 46-year-old has also faced several controversies, most recently when he was announced as the opening act for a new sports arena in mostly black Detroit.

The performances injected the musician into the national debate over race and culture because of his embrace of the Confederate flag, an expletive-laced criticism of NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and unabashed support for President Donald Trump.

The narrow blue cobblestone streets of Old San Juan are deserted. Cigar shops are boarded up. Boutiques in bright colonial buildings are closed.

""It's like a ghost town,"" said Mike Maione, a 57-year-old tourist from Flanders, New Jersey, who was staying in the heart of the colonial city with his wife at a small hotel powered by a generator. ""We've been here a number of times before, and the place is usually just crawling with tourists, but there's nobody here.""

Tourism, a rare thriving sector on the island in a deep economic slump, is practically nonexistent a month after Hurricane Maria swept though. And part of the recovery from the storm depends on how fast visitors reappear.

About a third of the hotels in Puerto Rico remain shuttered. Restaurants and shops are still without power. Beaches are closed for swimming because of possible water contamination.

The high season begins in December, and tourism officials are hoping to lure some visitors, but that depends on when power is fully restored and how quickly hotels and attractions can repair the catastrophic damage.

""We want Puerto Rico to be more like New Orleans post-Katrina and Detroit post-financial crisis,"" said Jose Izquierdo, the executive director of Puerto Rico's government Tourism Company. Though, he hopes, on a faster timeline.

The U.S. territory usually sees more than 5 million visitors a year, and they spend close to $4 billion, creating jobs for more than 80,000 people. While that's a small portion of the overall economy, about 8 percent, money generated by visitors has been growing at the same time other sectors have shrunk during a 10-year recession.

Maria roared across the island on Sept. 20 as a Category 4 storm, killing at least 49 people and knocking out electricity to the whole island. More than a month later, only 30 percent of customers have power, though Gov. Ricardo Rossello has pledged to get that to 95 percent by Dec. 31. Roughly 70 percent of the communication network has been restored, and 70 percent of the water service is back.

The main airport recently resumed full operations. Cruise ships are beginning to sail again. The Bacardi rum distillery will reopen Nov. 1. Nearly all the island's casinos are open. Old San Juan's colonial-era buildings mostly survived intact.

""We don't want to give up entirely on the high season,"" said Izquierdo, who hopes business will be bolstered by Puerto Ricans coming home for the holidays, emergency federal officials working on the recovery and others coming with a sense of purpose to help rebuild. ""And then post high-season, we continue to revamp the product,"" he said.

But for Patti Weiss, 54, of Gilbertsville Pennsylvania, the uncertainty was too much. She and her husband planned their Royal Caribbean cruise a year ago and regularly embark from Puerto Rico, staying through Christmas, but are leaving from Florida instead.

""I just didn't feel it was the right time to go, it was too iffy. I was still seeing pictures and the hotels lost the generators and I just couldn't do it,"" she said. ""We were really disappointed, but I still have my house and drinking water so this is nothing compared to what they're going through down there.""

Scores of restaurants are open, but operating under truncated hours with limited menus and many without power. Some are offering discounted meals to locals who can't cook. Chef Ariel Rodriguez, owner of Ariel, a fine dining spot open for almost 30 years where a two-course meal is $54, said it's been nearly impossible to get ingredients. He was offering a meal of beef stew and rice for $5. For smaller eateries like gastropub Gallo Negro, it's hard to pay the cost of diesel for generators, said Chef Maria Grubb. Her 52-seat restaurant hasn't been open for weeks.

""It's quite crushing,"" she said. ""Rent is still due. Insurance is still due, distributors need to be paid. We have a staff of 14 people without any means of making money. That's the toughest part of all this.""

The financial impact of Maria on the industry won't be clear until after the season ends, but the visible impact of the storm is more obvious. Some of the island's best-known attractions were battered, like El Yunque, a biologically diverse tropical rain forest of 45 square miles (11,700 hectares). Aerial footage shows massive defoliation, plus landslides and downed trees. One of the island's most famous resort hotels, El Conquistador in Fajardo, will be closed until the end of the year for repairs.

The expansive grounds of the Castillo San Felipe del Morro are open around the breathtaking 250-year-old Spanish fort that winds through the cliffs overlooking San Juan Bay, but the fort itself is still shut. Beaches that were slammed by lashing rain and winds may also be contaminated after sewers overflowed; environmental officials say no one should go in yet.

Even if people do come, finding a hotel will be tricky. There are roughly 100 hotels open, mostly powered by generators, but nearly all are occupied with recovery workers and it's not clear how long they're staying, though tourism officials say they expect more rooms available starting Dec. 20. Of the premier resorts, the Caribe Hilton isn't accepting reservations until New Year's. The Ritz Carlton in San Juan won't open for guests until at least April.

In the meanwhile, hospitality officials are encouraging do-gooders come to help rebuild. Local Guest, a website promoting sustainable tourism is offering trips starting Dec. 1 for people to come stay with families in hard-hit areas to help them rebuild, said creator Carmen Portela.

""After the hurricane I have to be honest, hearts were destroyed,"" she said, and she tried to figure out how to help on a larger scale. ""If we don't help rebuild our country then there's nothing, there's nothing.""

For now, businesses that count on tourism are staying afloat through emergency workers streaming onto the island.

""We're depending on them right now,"" said Carmelo Perez, manager of Gul Plaza Souvenir Store. The darkened shop sells t-shirts, shot glasses and other trinkets. Business is terribly slow, and they're praying people start coming back.

Some are. Stephan Renard, his wife Nikola Sheienssen and their son were visiting Old San Juan from Kiel, Germany, and planned to spend a day before heading off on a cruise. They had some trouble finding a hotel and were surprised by the empty streets and closed stores. But they never considered canceling.

Maulsby and online commenters contend that a song about workers happily picking cotton is a racist reference to black slaves toiling in the fields of the South.

Springfield Schools Superintendent Matt Geha said the song came from a book of American folk music, adding that he hadn't received any calls on Friday, but was aware of the complaints circulating on social media.

“I know that timing can sound bad, but it's a historical component for what the choir department had to use for their curriculum,” Geha said.

The short song includes the lyrics: “Cotton needs pickin' so bad, we're going'na pick all over this field.”

Maulsby told The Blade the performance came “a little bit too close” to when a racial slur was “being used directly across the street in the parking lot.”

The “one-off” car was travelling on Saturday in a convoy in west Sussex with other super sports cars. The Zonda, which can reach 218 mph, had its front chassis ripped off, The Evening Standard reported. The driver was not hurt.

Authorities are asking the public to offer any information it may have on the circumstances surrounding the accident.

Jalopnik reported that one auto YouTuber said the crash occurred on the A27 motorway while the car was headed to the Goodwood Circuit.

As with most Zondas, this one is a one-off custom that features a huge rear wing and a roof-mounted air intake to feed its 760 hp V12.

The car was alone when emergency responders arrived to find it up against the guardrail facing the wrong way on the wet highway in the town of Tangmere.

Police have not revealed who was behind the wheel at the time of the crash, but it is believed to be owned by Peter Saywell, managing director of aircraft parts manufacturer Saywell International, which was sponsoring a charity track event at Goodwood on the same day.

A hacker group known as the Dark Overlord is reportedly responsible for the breach at London Bridge Plastic Surgery (LBPS) that could potentially expose sensitive information of numerous celebrities and private citizens.

The group, which first came about in 2016, previously used hacked information to blackmail people or organizations, including schools, medical centers and even a production firm working with Netflix, the Daily Beast reported.

The hackers claim the latest cyber attack of LBPS was successful, with one Dark Overlord representative telling the Beast that they “have TBs [terabytes] of this s---. Databases, names, everything,” and claimed “There are some royal families in here.”

The Dark Overlord claims that it acquired many graphic and close-up pictures of the clinic’s patients – some showing surgery on male and female genitalia and other photos featuring patients post-operation. Some pictures reportedly also have faces.

In what appears to be among the biggest security breaches in recent memory, the hackers also threatened to distribute the graphic pictures of the patients of the clinic.

“We're going to pitch it all up for everyone to nab,” the group told the Beast. “The entire patient list with corresponding photos. The world has never seen a medical dump of a plastic surgeon to such degree.”

LBPS confirmed the breach, saying “we believe that our security was breached and that data has been stolen” but remain unsure “what data has been compromised,” according to a statement sent to the outlet.

“We are horrified that they have now targeted our patients,” the statement added. ""Security and patient confidentiality has always been of the utmost importance to us.

“The president said he wants to make America great again. F--k that s--t, we gon’ make America Crip again,” Snoop Dogg raps. ""As I look around I see so many millionaires with skin like mine, don't pretend that I'm with that bulls--t your president been tweeting.""

The Bowling Green Daily News reports that Chevrolet will stop building the 2018 model on January 22 after a total of just four months of production.

Chevrolet won't say why.

The Bowling Green factory where the Corvette has been manufactured since 1981 has been shut down the past few months for the installation of a new paint shop and other upgrades, so the model year was already truncated.

Chevy is still scheduled to build around 9,700 of the coupes and convertibles by January, according to the newspaper, so 2018 cars won’t exactly be rare, but they may end up being among the last of their kind.

Although the folks at Chevy haven’t admitted it, they are hard at work on a next-generation sports car that’s believed to be a mid-engine successor to the Corvette.

Prototypes of the vehicle have been spotted on the road, and it is expected to officially debut at the Detroit Auto Show in January.

The question is, what will be coming out of the factory when the plant starts building 2019 model year cars on January 29?

Chevy won’t comment, but along with the mid-engine coupes, a high performance version of the current Corvette has also been spotted being tested, so the front-engine version should live on for at least part of the year.

It’s still possible that the mid-engine car isn’t a Corvette replacement at all, but a more exotic model that will be sold alongside the traditional Corvette.

The teenager, who loved nothing more than writing and performing her own songs, believed that a radio tour would allow her to follow in the footsteps of her heroes like Patsy Cline, Linda Ronstadt, Martina McBride and all of the other female artists who came before her.

But Armiger told Fox News she would soon learn that the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry came with a hefty price.

Years before pop superstar Taylor Swift was groped by a radio DJ from Denver, Colo., Armiger says she was fending off a different handsy DJ while she was underage.

""I was at a radio station in Texas and was taking a promo photo with one of the on-air DJs after doing my performances and he grabbed my butt during the photo,"" Armiger told us. ""And at the same time he was whispering in my ear, 'When are you going to be legal?'""

Armiger told us she ""was shocked"" and ""terrified"" but had no one to lean on for support.

""I brought up my fears and I was told that's how it was and if I wanted to be in music, I'd have to get over it,"" she said.

Armiger decided to keep her mouth shut after that, but things came to a head in June 2016 when the singer was sued by her record label, Cold River, and filed a counterclaim alleging the label told her to ""sex it up"" in order to become successful.

According to the lawsuit, Armiger said she was asked to ""purchase 'hot, game-changing' clothes,"" ""hug, kiss and flirt"" with radio programmers. Armiger said she was told she needed to make the programmers ""wish you would take them home with you.""

Cold River Record head Pete O'Heeron told Fox News at the time the suit was ""baseless"" and ""an attempt to try and smear good people.""

Armiger said she can't comment on her battle with Cold River after a settlement was made, but said she now wants to share her stories of sexual harassment after hearing the bombshell sexual abuse allegations against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that have rocked Hollywood.

""There's something really horrible going on behind the scenes,"" she told us, saying the country music community has its fair share of Weinstein-like behavior.

The now-26-year-old detailed several other stories of sexual harassment that she's encountered. Armiger recalled taking a radio programmer and his team to lunch when the program director asked everyone to share their ""top five list of women they would want to sleep with.""

After sharing his first choice, Armiger said a radio programmer turned to her, ""looking me in the eyes, he said, 'But you would absolutely be my No. 2.'""

Armiger said he then turned to her guitar player and said, ""Surely you've been f--king her. Where is she on your list?""

The guitar player suggested the group change the subject to something more appropriate, but Armiger said she still ""got flack"" for the exchange.

""The programmer called and said if I ever brought that guitar player back again he'd never play my music again,"" she recalled.

The singer said she was similarly rebuked after a radio DJ was interviewing her about her album ""Confessions of a Nice Girl"" at the 2010 ACM Awards.

""As we were doing the interview, he is trying to feel me up under the table -- this is on air -- trying to ask me whether or not my album title was true because surely I couldn't be a nice girl. I had to be a naughty girl,"" Armiger said.

When the DJ later asked her what her least favorite interview question was, Armiger was ""pissed"" and curtly said, ""The worst question is that you're asking me if I'm a nice girl or a naughty girl because what kind of person asks that?""

She said ""that didn't go over well"" and she learned ""not to talk back"" after that.

When Armiger filed her lawsuit against Cold River, she said many people in the country music world would not work with her anymore.

""When my story first became public and in the aftermath when I was finally to start looking for other opportunities in the industry, we went to [publishing houses] but we would be met with, 'We're not going to sign you, but we're really a big fan and we just want to know your story and how are you?'""

She continued, ""That was the consensus; that was everywhere I went. I would talk to booking agents and they were scared to work with me because they either thought somehow the tour would be canceled or I was a liability to work with.""

Armiger said she does not want to name her harassers out of fear of retribution, but she hopes coming forward with her story of harassment in the country music world will make a difference because ""it has to change.""

""I don't think it will change until people start speaking out, and for the most part they're too scared,"" she told us. ""Look at my story -- they'll see that I spoke out and spoke my truth and thought for the most part people would believe my story.

Well, besides being reasonable activities for a night out in Atlantic City, officials who help prepare specific sports for Olympic recognition apparently think they could soon take their place alongside running, gymnastics and ski jumping in the world’s most prestigious athletic competition.

Seriously.

The Switzerland-based Global Association of International Sports Federations earlier this month granted observer status to the International Federation of (Match) Poker, the International Pole Sports Federation and International Table Soccer Federation along with the organizing bodies for four other nontraditional sports — the first step toward joining the Olympic program.

“We warmly welcome our first Observers,” Patrick Baumann, the president of GAISF, said in a statement. “This is an exciting time for them and for us and we will do everything within our remit to help them realize their full potential as International Federations within the global sport’s family and, one day, maybe become part of the Olympic program.”

Baumann added: “The new sports debuting at Tokyo 2020 and at the Buenos Aires Youth Olympics are evidence that the pathway is there.”

Joining the program in Tokyo in two years will be softball, karate, surfing, skateboarding, sport climbing and baseball — the games’ second shot at Olympic status. These sports were chosen, especially skateboarding and sport climbing, in part to reflect the changing interest in younger athletes and the worldwide popularity of these sports.

""Through these additional events, the Tokyo 2020 Games aims to inspire new generations and become a turning point and a model for future Olympic Games,” Yoshiro Mori, the president of the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, said in a statement.

But pole dancing, foosball, aka “table soccer,” and poker?

These barroom pursuits, along with dodgeball, foot golf, kettlebell lifting and the previously mentioned sports, now all have the same status as sports like baseball and surfing once had.

Under the GAISF, observer status allows new sport to grow its base while being guided by the federation toward the requirements of membership, such as receiving the required recognitions by National Olympic Committees, increasing their membership and becoming compliant with the regulations of the World Anti-Doping Agency.

And for aspiring poker Olympians, don’t worry, cigarettes and watered-down cocktails are so far not on the list of banned “performance-enhancing drugs.”

So now that they’ve taken the first steps toward Olympic gold, when – or, more importantly, will – these sports make their debuts in the Olympics?

Before anything else happens, the sport needs to be practiced by men in 75 countries on four continents and by women in 40 countries on three continents be considered for the Olympics.

So the men’s division of pole dancing – surely equality demands that there be a men’s division – may run into some issues there.

Besides these stipulations, poker may face the same challenge imposed on chess by the International Olympic Committee with its ban on purely “mind sports.”

And even if dodgeball, foot golf, kettleball lifting, table soccer and arm wrestling can pass these tests, the IOC has worked in recent years to manage the scope of the games by only permitting new sports to join when others are discontinued. Meaning that these athletes might have to wait for sports like curling and table tennis to go the way of tug-of-war and water skiing.","Olympics may soon feature pole dancing, foosball and poker",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/18/olympics-may-soon-feature-pole-dancing-foosball-and-poker.html

""To put it mildly, this is a huge, huge problem,"" he reportedly said in a Sunday speech at a police conference in Philadelphia. ""It impacts investigations across the board.""

That includes suspected crimes dealing with narcotics, counterterrorism, and child exploitation. Over an 11-month period, the FBI found itself failing to extract data from over half of the mobile devices it obtained, Wray added.

In March, Wray's predecessor, James Comey, said the FBI had failed to unlock about 1,200 devices from a three-month period, despite possessing ""classified techniques.""

With encryption becoming so prevalent—iOS and Android are now encrypted by default—the FBI has been urging the tech industry to find a solution. That's sparked debate over whether products should include a government-mandated ""backdoor"" federal agents can use when investigating a crime.

Critics in Silicon Valley say this is a bad idea. They argue any backdoor will weaken a device's security, putting consumers at risk of other hacks.

But that hasn't stopped the FBI from pressing the matter. Last year, the agency demanded Apple help unlock an iPhone 5c that was used by one of the attackers in the San Bernardino shooting. The FBI later withdrew the request, after it employed a mysterious third party to unlock the phone for a large sum of money. Nevertheless, the agency is still looking for a better solution to the encryption debate.

On Sunday, Wray suggested he wants to try and appease both sides. ""I get it, there's a balance that needs to be struck between encryption and the importance of giving us the tools we need to keep the public safe,"" he reportedly said.

""The one constant was always, 'I want to see my girls grow up, and I want to walk them down the aisle,'"" said Cheryl Shelton.

With seven daughters, the family realized it was unlikely the U.S. Army veteran would be able to accomplish that, so they came up with a plan to make his dream a reality.

With last minute help from hospice; David's Bridal; Taylor Elchert Photography in Tiffin, Ohio; a local hair studio, and others, the plan came together in just days.

""We had this idea we put together in three days. We got all the wedding gowns for the girls and hospice helped us out a great deal with some of the planning,"" said Cheryl.

""What girl doesn't want to get in a wedding dress and her hair and makeup done? So I was all in but more so for the reasoning behind it,"" said Candice Talbot.

The plan was kept a secret from Willie who was asked only to give away Emily Flinn, the only one of his daughters who was already married, so she could renew her vows.

""We got maried at a courthouse so there wasn't the formality to it where he could actually give me away,"" said Flinn.

""He had no clue that this was going on and everybody got dressed, so I said, 'she is going to have all the girls be the bridesmaids and everything for her;' little did he know that they were all going to be brides,"" said Cheryl.

""Actually, it was my sister, Candice, that texted me and said, 'hey, you need to pick out a wedding dress and give me your measurements because we are going to pick one out for you; you are going to walk down the aisle on Saturday,"" said Jennifer Talbot.

Three days later, with Willie in his dress uniform in a backyard ceremony, each of his daughters came out of the house, one at a time, all in wedding gowns.

""He looked a little confused , and then it was just great to see everybody,"" said Flinn.

""This was very touching for him and it was a dream that we could fulfill to the best or the closest we could possibly do,"" said Cheryl.

In a father-daughter ceremony performed by Millersburg Christian Church Pastor Wes McElravy, the girls got to see the gleam in their father's eye they would expect to see at their actual wedding.

And Willie was helped out of his wheelchair to stand with his daughters and experience his greatest wish.

""I always assumed that my dad would be there to walk me down the aisle and when the possibility was there that he wasn't going to be able to -- this was everything,"" said Lindsey Shelton.

Less than two weeks after the ceremony, on Monday, October 16, Willie Shelton passed away.

The girls will each now also have something of their own to keep for their actual weddings.

All seven will have a locket in which they will have a photo of their father with them in a wedding dress, and the words, ""a father's love never ends,"" engraved on the back.

""Even though part of the dream was fulfilled last week, when they get married, the rest of it will be because he will still be with them,"" said Cheryl.

Through their loss, the family says it is only fitting that they honor the life and the memory of Willie.

""He was the happiest person, the most giving person, and this was our chance to give him something,"" said Jennifer.​

i.e., sexual harassment.","While trying not to indulge in schadenfreude over those hypocritical Hollywood elites who’ve claimed to stand for “women’s rights,” only to be accused of sexually harassing them, I noticed “#MeToo” trending on Twitter. At #MeToo, women who have been sexually harassed are invited to post their experiences and many have done so, including four female U.S. senators.

I asked my adult daughter and oldest granddaughter if they had ever encountered sexual harassment. My daughter said at a previous job her boss “invited” her to sit on his lap. She refused and no longer works there.

Even more shocking was the response I received from my granddaughter, who is a nurse at a hospital in San Antonio, Texas. I reprint her account (with her permission) because it contains a lesson, not only for men, but for the male-dominated culture.

I will not use her last name to protect her from more bad experiences. Crystal writes:

“It’s a tough subject to speak on. Personally, I have been sexually harassed many times in my workplace and generally speaking. All the jobs I have ever had, there has been sexual harassment. I am a nurse and have had doctors make inappropriate comments. I’ve felt very uncomfortable and have tried to ignore or ‘laugh off’ the remarks for fear of retaliation. These are doctors I have needed orders from for my patients. The last thing I need is for them to be mad at me. So, when I see the ones who have made inappropriate remarks, I smile and say hello. I’m sure if I ever went to report (them) it would somehow be turned on me like I did something wrong. So I just ‘laugh it off’ and move on, because, just like Harvey (Weinstein), doctors are the ones bringing in the big bucks and are granted immunity for certain things ... i.e., sexual harassment.

“As a mother … I think it’s important to teach our children to stick up for themselves always, and it’s never OK for someone to harass them in any way. It’s equally important for boys and girls to learn this. It’s important to teach right and wrong and promote what is right ALWAYS.”

“Generally speaking when instances occur outside of work I have stood up for myself, and am then treated as if I am wrong for doing so.”

Commenting on pictures of Hollywood actresses hugging Weinstein, Crystal continues: “I understand why these women are all smiles with this man. He is powerful in their community. He has power over their career. And I’m sure he is the reason they are famous. Like me, and so many others, these women were afraid to speak up and to stand up to this man fearing their livelihood would be negatively affected.

“Females deal with this BS constantly ... it’s never comfortable, especially when you have to continue seeing or working with the person/people. It’s always an awkward situation to be in, especially when the person has a higher position of power.

“As a mother … I think it’s important to teach our children to stick up for themselves always, and it’s never OK for someone to harass them in any way. It’s equally important for boys and girls to learn this. It’s important to teach right and wrong and promote what is right ALWAYS.”

Powerful stuff, but in an age when the lines between right and wrong, good and bad are blurred, if not eliminated, and with culture and opinion polls defining moral standards which are constantly in flux, sexual harassment is only one of many consequences when “societal norms” are obliterated.

Perhaps the best way to address this is to put more women in charge — the right kind of women, like Crystal.","Cal Thomas: #MeToo: My daughter and granddaughter, too",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/24/cal-thomas-metoo-my-daughter-and-granddaughter-too.html

Did the snake in the photo somehow manage to wrest itself from the frog's maw and wriggle its way to freedom?","As a hapless snake vanished down the throat of a frog, the last thing it saw was likely a camera's flash, as a photographer captured the image of its head peeping from the amphibian's gullet.

The striking photo was snapped at a moment when the frog was gaping its mouth wide. And unexpectedly peering up from the frog's throat was another head, belonging to a small snake, its jaws also stretching in what was perhaps its last gasp.

Reddit user EstusFiend shared the photo on Oct. 16, titling it ""One Last Scream Into the Abysssss."" A Google Plus user had posted the photo in November 2016 and claimed ownership, but as the photo appeared unattributed on the internet prior to that claim, it is uncertain who the photographer is, Science Alert reported. [Beastly Feasts: Amazing Photos of Animals and Their Prey]

The poignancy of the doomed snake's final moments were underscored by science writer Jason Bittle, who shared the Reddit post on Twitter accompanied by all-too-relevant lyrics written by the Seattle grunge band Pearl Jam, in their popular 1991 song ""Alive.""

♫ Oh, I... I... I'm still aliveeeeeeeeeeeeee ♫ https://t.co/bTp451UEOE pic.twitter.com/5i1W81z00p — Jason Bittel (@bittelmethis) October 17, 2017

The swallowed snake likely didn't stay alive for long — though a frog's prey is usually gulped down alive and kicking, once the frog's mouth snaps shut, the end comes quickly, Jonathan Kolby, director of the Honduras Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Center, told Live Science in an email. Even if the prey doesn't go down easily, the frog is usually none the worse for wear, he said.

""It's easy to imagine that swallowing a vigorously struggling animal would hurt the frog,"" Kolby explained. ""But after being swallowed, most prey items likely suffocate and die within a minute or two while being squeezed and held in place by muscles in the frog's digestive tract.""

And it's not at all uncommon for a snake to be on a frog's menu, Kolby added.

""Tree frogs often consume a wide variety of prey, including snakes and even rodents, all according to how large a frogs' mouth is,"" he said.

The frog was identified as an Australian green tree frog (Litoria caerulea) in a tweet posted on Oct. 16 by Jodi Rowley, a curator of Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Biology with the Australian Museum and the University of New South Wales. In another tweet, Rowley suggested that the frog's esophagus appeared smaller than might be expected for an animal with such a wide gape, but it was probably somewhat constricted because the snake was still in the process of being swallowed.

The snake appears to be a baby brownsnake, according to Paul Oliver, a postdoctoral researcher at the Australian National University. That makes this interaction somewhat unusual, as many snakes are diurnal — active during the day — and frogs are nocturnal, Oliver explained.

""It seems unlikely to have occurred naturally (but then give things enough time in nature — all sorts of unlikely things do happen),"" Oliver told Live Science in an email.

One possibility? ""Human agency may have played role in the snake meeting the frog, but subsequently the frog's instincts to eat anything small took over,"" said Oliver, who studies the systematics and evolution of frogs and lizards.

In fact, tree frogs are referred to by some as ""labradors of the frog world"" for their indiscriminate eating habits, as they are known for trying to eat ""just about anything they can fit into their mouths,"" Kathleen Doody, a researcher with the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Queensland in Australia, told Live Science in an email.

Regardless, from the frog's perspective, having your meal trying to writhe its way back up your throat is probably not a pleasant experience. But there are even more extreme examples of a meal turning disastrous for frogs, Kolby told Live Science.

Epomis beetle larvae, which look like tempting grubs to a hungry frog, are actually deadly carnivores that prey on their would-be predators, Kolby said. The larvae lure the frogs closer by waving their antenna, then strike with their powerful mandibles, latching onto the frog and consuming it alive, he said.

Did the snake in the photo somehow manage to wrest itself from the frog's maw and wriggle its way to freedom? We may never know how this particular incident ended. But for one moment in a life and death struggle frozen by a photographer's lens, the prey came out ahead.

NEOM: City of the Future

The future city, named “NEOM”, stems from Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 plan, a strategy created to reduce the country’s dependence on oil.

NEOM, which will be located on the coast of the Red Sea, will span more than 10,000 square miles (26,500 square kilometers), extending across the borders of Egypt and Jordanian, making it the “first special economic zone to span three countries,” according to Saudi Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman.

The city will focus on nine sectors, “some conventional, some new” to capture a “good share in the future of the world” he said during a panel discussion in Riyadh hosted by FOX Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo.

$500 Billion to Build

NEOM will backed by more than $500 billion from the kingdom, its Public Investment Fund, local and international investors including Blackstone (BX). CEO Stephen Schwartzman, speaking at a conference in Riyadh on Tuesday, discussed the many opportunities that come with building a city from scratch.

Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest exporter of black gold, is determined to raise the amount of non-oil government revenue through “added investments, the development of unexploited assets” and implementing structural reforms, all part of the Vision 2030 plan.

While in Moscow, the former president sought to meet with Russian nuclear officials.
At the same time, Russian nuclear officials were giving $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.
The Obama administration, including Hillary Clinton and then-Attorney General Eric Holder, let it happen.","When it comes to Russia, it is clear that Democrats and their allies in the mainstream media have been flat out lying to the American people about what is really happening.

It was always just a matter of time before their manufactured hysteria and conspiracy theories blew up in their faces and boomeranged back on the Democrats and the media. Well, it is happening now.

None other than NBC News signaled the sea change with a bombshell report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is now investigating Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta. If that name sounds familiar, it is because he happens to be the brother of Hillary Clinton's former campaign chairman, John Podesta.

Mueller's investigation reportedly began by looking into the finances of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, but now is probing whether Podesta’s firm violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act while working with a Moscow-linked organization. Under that law, lobbyists in the United States who worked for foreign entities must register with the Department of Justice and disclose what they are doing.

But wait, there’s more. The Hill’s John Solomon is out with another explosive report about the FBI having evidence that the Kremlin launched a campaign to try to gain access to Hillary Clinton, her top aides and her husband, Bill Clinton, in 2009. According to The Hill, one attempt included a female Russian who used a false identity to secure a job with a key Democratic donor in the hopes that she would be able to collect intelligence on Hillary Clinton and the State Department. She was deported when her spy ring was busted in 2010.

Think about this: At the exact same time Vladimir Putin and Russia were trying to infiltrate her inner circle, Hillary Clinton was using a private server that had top-secret special access programs, classified national security information on it.

Clinton knew what was happening because her office commented on the Russia spy ring bust back in 2010. Yet, she recklessly continued to use the personal server, putting national security at risk.

Last week, Solomon and Circa News’ Sara Carter both reported that Bill Clinton, while his wife was secretary of state, tried to get permission to meet with Russian nuclear officials while the Uranium One deal was being approved by the Obama administration and his own wife. That deal gave control of 20 percent of America’s Uranium supply to Russia.

Back in 2009, the FBI was doing its job. Investigators discovered evidence, including documents and emails and financial records. They had witness accounts that the Russian nuclear officials working on behalf of Vladimir Putin and Russia and Moscow were engaging in bribery.

Just before the deal that put our own nuclear materials in the hands of a hostile nation known to be trying to bribe our government, Bill Clinton got $500,000 for a speech in Moscow. That was twice his normal speaking fee, and the check was cut from a bank that had an interest in the Uranium One deal. While in Moscow, the former president sought to meet with Russian nuclear officials. He had to ask his own wife's State Department for permission, but wound up meeting directly with Vladimir Putin and corrupt banking officials instead.

At the same time, Russian nuclear officials were giving $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. Were they simply feeling philanthropic?

Putin wanted a piece of our Uranium supply, our government knew he was illegally efforting to get it, a former president met with him and pocketed a suspicious speaking fee and, what did our government do? The Obama administration, including Hillary Clinton and then-Attorney General Eric Holder, let it happen. In 2010, the Uranium One deal was approved.

If this is all new to you, maybe it is because a patriotic informant, who first told the FBI about Russia’s bribery scheme, was mysteriously muzzled by the Obama Department of Justice. But now, President Trump is in charge, and the truth will come out, right?

Well, the federal prosecutor who helped lead that FBI investigation, and who surely knows everything about the Uranium One scandal, is Rod Rosenstein. He’s the very man who appointed Mueller to probe Trump-Russia collusion. And Mueller himself was FBI director during this entire scandal. We are supposed to trust Mueller to investigate Russian interference fairly, objectively and honestly even though he kept the Russian bribery plot quiet so the Hillary Clinton could get richer and keep her presidential aspirations intact.

If the Department of Justice won’t do its job and expose the Russia scandal, Congress will. Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., says the House Oversight Committee is now investigating this Uranium One deal. And he recently revealed some stunning information about the FBI informant.

“I've been able to speak with the confidential informant that helped the FBI uncover this bribery scheme,” he said. “I've spoken with his attorney. And this informant wants to tell his story, but he's currently under a nondisclosure agreement that was signed with the Eric Holder Justice Department. He came forward in 2016, was threatened with reprisal from the Loretta Lynch Justice Department.”

The Democrats and their handmaidens in the media should have been more careful about what they wished for. The Russia collusion story is finally coming out.

Kyle Anger, 17, Alexander Miller, 15, Mark Sekelsky, 16, Mikadyn Payne, 16, and Trevor Gray, 15, were arrested and charged with second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit second-degree murder. The teens were charged as adults in Genesee County, FOX2 Detroit reported.

The teens are accused of standing at an Interstate 75 overpass in Vienna Township, about 80 miles north of Detroit, on Oct. 18 and throwing rocks at passing cars. Anger allegedly dropped a six-pound rock from the overpass that smashed through a truck’s windshield and killed 32-year-old Kenneth White, who was driving home from work.

The rock hit White’s face and ricocheted onto his chest, causing fractures to his skull and face. The driver’s cause of death was ruled as blunt force trauma to his head and chest.

Several drivers also reported having large rocks and concrete chunks hit their vehicles, but they were not injured, prosecutors said. The Genesee County Sheriff’s Office said 20 rocks were found, including one that weighed 20 pounds, according to FOX2.

Police also said last week the teens appeared to be playing a prank.

The teenage boys are expected to be arraigned on Tuesday and face life in prison if convicted.

Wesley Mathews, 37, was arrested and charged with injury to a child, one day after a search team discovered a body believe to be Sherin Mathews, police said. Officials are still waiting for positive identification of the body.

Wesley Mathews voluntarily went to police on Monday and offered a new account of what happened the night of Oct. 7, according to an arrest warrant affidavit obtained by the Dallas News. Mathews reportedly told police he and the girl were in the house’s garage when she refused to drink her milk. She allegedly wouldn’t listen, so he “physically assisted” her until she began drinking the liquid. Sherin began choking, coughing and breathing slowly at some point, according to the affidavit.

Mathews reportedly told police he couldn’t feel a pulse on his daughter and believed she died. He then said he removed the toddler’s body from the house, the Dallas News reported. Cadaver dogs led officials to the body not far from the Mathews’ home about 11 a.m. Sunday.

The father initially told police he ordered her to stand next to a tree behind the fence of their Dallas suburb home about 3 a.m. because she refused to drink her milk. He said she was nowhere to be seen after he went to check up on her 15 minutes later. He was initially arrested and charged with child endangerment, but was released on bond and ordered to wear an ankle monitor.

SHERIN MATHEWS ABANDONED IN INDIA BEFORE ALLEY ABANDONMENT THAT MAY HAVE LED TO DEATH

Sherin's adopted mother, Sini Mathews, was reportedly sleeping at the time. Her attorney told the Dallas News she was “distraught” about the incident and was cooperating with police.

Wesley Mathews is being held on $1 million bail and faces up to 99 years in prison if convicted. The FBI also seized 47 items, including “hair-like” fibers, a Costco receipt and a washer and dryer from the home.

The couple’s other daughter, a 4-year-old, was placed in protective custody after Mathews went missing. A court hearing on Monday ruled the girl will remain in foster care at least until a Nov. 13 hearing, or when a judge determines a change in custody.

The couple reportedly adopted Sherin from an orphanage in India about two years ago. Sherin was placed in the orphanage when she was 1 after she was abandoned by her biological family, Times of India reported. Sherin had a developmental disability and didn’t have the language skills of a typical 3-year-old child.

Life is starting to return to normal in parts of California wine country, where fires destroyed lives, homes and businesses. Pam Starr, co-owner of Crocker and and Starr in St. Helena, Napa County was evacuated from her home by the fires, and she didn't know whether her business was ruined.

""Both Napa and Sonoma were filled with smoke. We didn't know what was going on,"" Starr said.

But then the skies cleared, her business was intact, and they were able to get back to work ""we had a little fruit left, we picked what was left on the Crocker estate in St. Helena.""

Starr says there are many wineries, like hers, that survived. She was touched to see first responders from as far away as Canada, and Australia, coming to California wine country to save lives and preserve homes and businesses.

Now, survivors are helping their neighbors, and wineries that are still in operation are picking up employees from the businesses that were destroyed by the fires. Starr says now that things are returning to normal, ""Napa Valley is ready for visitors, we're getting into business again.""

“Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.”You think?","Editor's note: This originally appeared in The Hill.

“If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.”

For years, Republicans used that exaggerated pledge to thrash the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and President Obama for not keeping his promise. Politifact labeled it as “lie of the year” in 2013.

Politifact will have a lot of lies to choose from this year, given the hurricane of falsehoods and broken promises on health care made by President Trump.

Who can forget Trump’s oft-repeated promise that “We will repeal and replace ObamaCare, and we will do it very, very quickly?”

ObamaCare has not been repealed. It has not been replaced. Apparently in Trump-speak, “very, very quickly” means sometime during his tenure in office — or more likely, never.

Trump says he wants to “let ObamaCare implode.” This is far worse than a mountain of lies. This is subversion of an American law by the president.

After all, Republicans had seven years to come up with a plan that they promised would provide insurance to more people, more cheaply and with better protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

Here is another broken Trump promise: “We’re going to have insurance for everybody. We’re going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better.”

Well, we are still waiting.

The Republican House can say they passed a plan, but it was inferior to ObamaCare. It left more Americans uninsured — 20 million more, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) — and pressed lower quality care on those who kept coverage.

But lacking a plan of his own, Trump initially endorsed the House plan and held a Rose Garden press conference to celebrate it as “incredibly well-crafted.”

Within a few weeks, the president admitted the bill was “mean” to people in need of health care.

Now Trump continues to attack ObamaCare — with no realistic plan to replace it.

Steve Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist, told the conservative Values Voter Summit recently that the president is taking action to “blow up those exchanges.”

Trump says he wants to “let ObamaCare implode.”

This is far worse than a mountain of lies. This is subversion of an American law by the president.

Gallup reported Friday that 3.5 million fewer people reported having health insurance through the first nine months of this year as Trump’s threats and GOP congressional inaction provoked widespread uncertainty.

In Pennsylvania, insurance premiums on track for a 7.6 percent hike next year will instead be going up 30 percent thanks to Trump destabilizing the marketplace by ending subsidies to cover insurance for the poor.

The CBO estimates the cost of ending the subsidies will add $6 billion to the deficit in 2018 alone.

The administration attack on health care also includes cutting the ObamaCare enrollment period in half and cutting the advertising budget by 90 percent. And they are cutting money for the Navigator system to help people enroll.

This means fewer healthy people will sign up to balance out enrollment by people with medical needs — a dynamic that will further destabilize the system.

To the extent that the ACA currently has problems, it is the direct result of sabotage by Republican politicians.

Never forget that it was Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio who authored a measure to drain money from “risk corridors” created to protect insurance companies.

The original sin was when GOP governors and state legislatures refused to expand Medicaid, blocking 4 million poor Americans from benefitting from the ACA.

“I would ask what’s conservative about unaffordable premiums,” asked Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. “What’s conservative about creating chaos so millions can’t buy health insurance?”

And the American people want ObamaCare in its current form to work.

A poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation taken earlier this month found that a whopping 71 percent of Americans said the Trump administration should “do what they can to make the current health care law work.”

The same KFF poll found that 51 percent of Americans still have a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and 40 percent have an unfavorable view.

Why is Trump defying the overwhelming majority of Americans who want the law to succeed?

Last week, Alexander, the chairman of the Senate Health Committee, and the ranking member, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., unveiled a bipartisan compromise bill to shore up a key ObamaCare subsidy to benefit low-income Americans for two years.

The bill came in reaction to President Trump’s threats to end these cost sharing reductions (CSRs).

Trump falsely claimed that these were “bailouts” to insurance companies, when they are help for poor people.

“The fact of the matter is the president is trying to sabotage the American health care system, trying to put a gun to the head of our constituents by taking away their health care or raising their costs in order to force us to repeal a bill the American public doesn’t want us to repeal,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Fox News Sunday recently.

The real problem here is that while Trump is playing politics he is treating people in need of health care as collateral damage, a cruel afterthought.

There is one true statement from Trump on ObamaCare that will stand the test of time.

“Now, I have to tell you, it’s an unbelievably complex subject,” he said in February. “Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.”

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

The new findings suggest that, compared with the Altai Neanderthal, the Vindija Neanderthal was more closely related to the Neanderthals who interbred with the ancestors of modern humans living outside Africa.
This closer relation allowed the scientists to identify an additional 10 to 20 percent more Neanderthal DNA in modern humans.

And some modern humans are carrying around more Neanderthal DNA than scientists had thought: The study found that the genomes of modern human populations that originated outside Africa hold between 1.8 and 2.6 percent Neanderthal DNA. That's much higher than previous estimates of 1.5 to 2.1 percent.

Neanderthals were the closest extinct relatives of modern humans. Research over the past decade has revealed that Neanderthals interbred with the ancestors of modern humans who migrated out of Africa, contributing variants of genes that play a wide variety of roles in modern human biology, such as in depression, heart attacks, nicotine addiction and obesity.

By extracting DNA from Neanderthal fossils, researchers sequenced the genomes of five Neanderthals. However, until now, just one of these yielded high-quality data — that of a woman found in Denisova Cave, in the Altai Mountains in Siberia. The fossil of the woman, who lived about 122,000 years ago, is known as the Altai Neanderthal. [Denisovan Gallery: Tracing the Genetics of Human Ancestors]

Now, scientists have fully sequenced the genome of another female Neanderthal — this one from Vindija Cave, in Croatia — who lived about 52,000 years ago. Prior work suggested that Neanderthals lived in Vindija Cave until relatively late in their history. Scientists estimate that Neanderthals in Europe went extinct around 40,000 years ago.

Neanderthal genes

In the new study, the researchers analyzed billions of DNA segments from a bone fragment discovered in 1980. It was challenging to find a bone from Vindija Cave that carried enough Neanderthal DNA to yield high-quality data and that had relatively little contamination from modern-human and other DNA, said lead study author Kay Prüfer, a paleogeneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.

""Advances in laboratory methods helped us to overcome some of these challenges, in combination with cheaper sequencing technology,"" Prüfer told Live Science.

The new findings suggest that, compared with the Altai Neanderthal, the Vindija Neanderthal was more closely related to the Neanderthals who interbred with the ancestors of modern humans living outside Africa. This closer relation allowed the scientists to identify an additional 10 to 20 percent more Neanderthal DNA in modern humans. [In Photos: Neanderthal Burials Uncovered]

The newly identified Neanderthal gene variants found in modern humans play roles in blood levels of vitamin D and ""bad"" LDL cholesterol , as well as in eating disorders, body fat levels, rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia and responses to antipsychotic drugs, the study found.

""Variants from Neanderthals are not necessarily bad for your health,"" Prüfer said. ""We find one variant that is associated with LDL cholesterol, and the variant we got from Neanderthals is associated with lower LDL cholesterol.""

Their findings also suggested that modern-human DNA entered the Neanderthal gene pool. The scientists estimated that modern human gene flow into Neanderthal populations occurred between 130,000 and 145,000 years ago, before the Altai and Vindija Neanderthals diverged.

Neanderthal inbreeding

In addition, by comparing the genomes of the Vindija Neanderthal and the Altai Neanderthal, the researchers found that the two were surprisingly similar.

""The two Neanderthals were separated by thousands of kilometers and probably lived tens of thousands of years separated in time as well,"" Prüfer said. ""That is why it is so surprising to find them to be so similar.""

A small overall Neanderthal population size is the best explanation for this similarity, Prüfer said. The fewer Neanderthals there were, the more likely it was that they had ancestors in common, he explained.

Previous research suggested that the Altai Neanderthal's parents were half-siblings, prompting scientists to wonder if Neanderthals often interbred with family members. The new Vindija genome does not have similar incestuous patterns — a finding that suggests the extreme inbreeding seen with the Altai Neanderthal may not have been common among Neanderthals.

Still, Prüfer noted that the two sets of chromosomes that the Vindija Neanderthal inherited from both of her parents carried only about 1.6 differences per 10,000 base pairs of DNA. (The double strands of DNA that make up each chromosome are made of sets of molecules known as base pairs.)

""For comparison, modern humans in Africa have around 10 differences in 10,000 [base pairs], and Europeans and Asians around seven differences in 10,000 — much more than we see in Neanderthals,"" Prüfer said. ""This shows again that Neanderthals lived in small populations.""

In the future, the researchers hope to obtain even more high-quality Neanderthal genomes. ""More Neanderthal genomes will help us to better understand how they were related in space and time, but also to narrow down which Neanderthals contributed to disease,"" Prüfer said.

The scientists detailed their findings online Oct. 5 in the journal Science.

The group comprises of more than a dozen restaurants and reportedly employs over 1,200 people.","Celebrity chef John Besh has stepped down from his restaurant group amid allegations of sexual harassment, the New Orleans Advocate reports.

Shannon White, an executive within the Besh Restaurant Group (BRG), has confirmed that the 49-year-old New Orleans restaurateur “has decided to step down from all aspects of operations and to provide his full focus on his family,” and that the BRG will increase its “efforts in sexual-harassment training.”

The claims against Besh and his restaurant staff were first published over the weekend by The Times-Picayune of New Orleans, which reported that 25 former and current employees within the BRG had come forward with accusations against the James Beard-recognized chef and several of the male supervisors within his company.

'TOP CHEF' JUDGE TOM COLICCHIO CHANGES RESTAURANT NAME OVER CONCERNS OF RACIAL INSENSITIVITY

In one complaint submitted to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, former social-media manager Lindsay Reynolds ""vulgar and offensive comments, aggressive un-welcomed touching and sexual advances were condoned and sometimes even encouraged by managers and supervisors.""

Another unidentified woman claimed that Besh, who has been married for 26 years, had ""insisted [she] drink heavily” on a work trip, and later visited her hotel room, where he ""immediately started to kiss and fondle"" her while she ""was barely conscious, and easily overwhelmed.” The complained added that Besh ultimately “engaged in oral sex and fell asleep"" beside her, the Times-Picayune reported.

Besh’s restaurant partner, Octavio Mantilla, was accused of inappropriate touching by Madie Robison, who worked as a graphic designer with BRG. Robison says she also felt pressured to attend pool parties at a supervisor’s house, where Mantilla introducing her to a bunch of men as “our design goddess.” Mantilla however, told the Times-Picayune he does not remember saying or doing these things.

Reynolds added that both Mantilla and Besh had “hit on basically every woman in the office who was young and pretty,” and likened the environment of the BRG offices to that of AMC’s “Mad Men.”

Complicating matters was the lack of a human resources department within the BRG making it more difficult for the women file complaints against supervisors or co-workers. Besh and Mantilla did eventually hire a human resources manager as of Oct. 11, the Times-Picayune reports.

On Oct. 21, the Times-Picayune also obtained a statement from Besh in which he apologized for the lack of “clear mechanism” for employees to voice concerns, but wrote that a “complaint procedure” had indeed been in place, though it was admittedly insufficient.

While he did not specifically address any of the allegations against himself or his staff, he did admit to being in a consensual relationship outside of his marriage about two years ago, and apologized to “anyone past and present who has worked with me who found my behavior as unacceptable as I do.”

""I alone am entirely responsible for my moral failings. This is not the way the head of a company like ours should have acted, let alone a husband and father,” said Besh, who also served with the United States Marine Corps. for six years. “But it should not taint our incredible team of more than 1,000 employees, nor undermine our unyielding commitment to treating everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of gender, race, age and sexual preference.""

In response to the accusations against the BRG, celebrity chefs Anthony Bourdain and Jose Andres have taken to Twitter to respond, with Bourdain citing it as the “beginning of the end of institutionalized Meathead Culture in the restaurant business,” and Andres adding that “respect, dignity, humanity is non negotiable.

The Hubble Space Telescope recently captured a speckled and sparkling image of the Cocoon Galaxy, also known as NGC 4490. Over millions of years, it morphed from an elegant spiral shape, like that of the Milky Way Galaxy, which contains Earth's solar system, into an elongated system of scattered star births and deaths.

While gravity is a weak force for small objects, it creates a powerful attraction between massive structures like galaxies. In NGC 4490's case, the smaller galaxy NGC 4485 was drawn in by gravity, moving and colliding through its larger neighbor and altering the properties of them both, according to Hubble's image caption. The impact from the smaller galaxy stretched out the bigger galaxy, which only has a few remaining signs of its former spiral shape, like the curved arm that connects it with the smaller NGC 4485. [What Makes Starburst Galaxies Spawn at a Frenzied Pace? (Video)]

Both galaxies are collectively known as system Arp 269, located in the constellation Canes Venatici, or the Hunting Dogs.

According to the caption, the bright-pink colors throughout the Hubble image are active regions where stars are forming. The galactic impact dislodged gas and dust, which are reassembling as the two galaxies are about 24,000 light years apart from each other. The collision produced ripples packed with dense areas, which are prime for star creation. Clouds of ionized hydrogen are so dense, they radiate a pink glow as they're lit by the more fully formed young stars nearby.

NGC 4490 is called a starburst galaxy because it is brimming with stellar birth. However, it is also full of supernovas, the dramatic explosions caused by the death of stars. Several supernovas have been spotted within the Cocoon galaxy in the last few decades, in 1982 and 2008, officials wrote in the caption.

In billions of years, it's likely NGC 4490 and NGC 4485 will tug one another with their gravitational forces and collide once again.

""And I can say that I've seen some of the worst bleeding disorders, and I've never seen them sweat blood.""","Italian doctors were left bewildered when a woman was admitted to the hospital for “sweating blood” from her face and hands, a new case published in a medical journal on Monday revealed.

The woman, 21, would spontaneously bleed with no visible lesions on her skin, according to the case report published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. The woman has been suffering from the mysterious disorder for three years and would start bleeding spontaneously in her sleep or while she was physically active.

It’s unclear what triggered the bleeding, but the bleeding intensified when she was under stress. The episodes would last between one to five minutes.

The women told doctors she suffered major depression and panic disorder because of the condition and became “socially isolated.” She has no history of psychosis, the report said.

The doctors floated different theories on what caused the condition, including factitious disorder, when someone would deceive others by appearing sick. However, she continued to spontaneously bleed after she was prescribed paroxetine and clonazepam for her depression and anxiety order.

They ultimately concluded she had hematohidrosis, an uncommon disease that would cause “spontaneous discharge of ‘blood sweat’ through intact skin.” Blood can also come out of areas that don’t have sweat glands.

It’s still unclear what causes the “blood sweat.” Dr. Michelle Sholzberg, co-director of the Hemophilia Comprehensive Care program at St. Michael's Hospital, told CBC News the case is the “most unusual.”

""I can say with clarity that I've never seen a case like this — ever,"" Sholzberg told CBC News. ""And I can say that I've seen some of the worst bleeding disorders, and I've never seen them sweat blood.""

Per the CBC, a 21-year-old Italian woman got to a hospital ASAP, and now doctors are puzzling over her ""most unusual"" case of bleeding from her face and palms, a condition she'd apparently suffered from for three years.

While the case study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal doesn't reveal much detail about the woman herself, it notes she was diagnosed with hematohidrosis, a rare condition in which blood is excreted or sweated out through pores or unbroken skin (ie, it's not coming out through a cut or other injury).

The patient tends to break out in the bloody sweating when she's either asleep or doing something physical, and the condition seems to get worse when she's stressed.

An episode can last up to five minutes. Per CTV News, doctors say the woman's condition is embarrassing enough to her that she became ""socially isolated"" and showed depression and panic disorder symptoms.

Although it's still not known what spurs such bleeding, different theories have emerged, including blood coagulation disorders or an overactive nervous system that reacts when a patient is under stress.

A Toronto hematologist thinks this particular patient has ""a very bizarre anatomical defect on a microscopic level"" that's causing her bleeding, perhaps in her sweat ducts.

A medical historian tells the CBC she was at first wary anyone could actually sweat blood, but after research reaching back to Aristotle's time (and her find of nearly 20 cases since 2000), she now believes the condition exists.

The patient has since been administered a heart and blood pressure med that has cut down—though not eliminated—her bleeding. (Here's what life is like when you're allergic to your own sweat.)

But some retailers are using the viral campaign to sell products, and not everyone agrees with this decision.

One product in particular has sparked a wave of backlash, with many accusing the designer of profiting off others’ pain. Jewelry company Adornia announced its latest product, a lariat necklace spelling out “Me Too,” which retails for $44.

Initially, the brand promised to donate 10 percent of all proceeds to the Rape Abuse Incest National Network. However, it later amended that amount to 100 percent, though it’s unclear whether this was spurred on by harsh criticism of the product or was simply a typo.

Allure reports that Adornia’s PR company followed up their initial email, correcting the error. “Apologies for the typo — 100% of the proceeds from this necklace is being donated to RAINN. Designer Moran Amir was inspired by her own experience as a survivor of adolescent sexual abuse to help women speak out loud.” However, according to Refinery29, Adornia designer Moran Amir made the change in an effort to assuage people’s criticism of her motives. “To eschew any controversy that I was profiting off of other people's pain, I raised the donation to RAINN to 100%,” she said.

But despite the altruistic element, reactions to the necklace were fierce, with people on Twitter calling the product “opportunistic” and “gross.”

“Today in the complete and utter reprehensible cooptation of feminist causes, a brand is selling a ""ME TOO"" necklace,” one Twitter user wrote.

“It seems really opportunistic and tone-deaf to be commodifying an organic movement for awareness of sexual assault with #MeToo jewelry,” another user wrote. ""I really like the idea of wearing our beliefs on our sleeve proverbial or not.""

FITNESS COMPANY SLAMMED FOR 'INAPPROPRIATE' POSTER BLASTS CRITICS AS 'WHINY FEMINAZIS'

Others argue that there’s nothing wrong with the necklace, and is simply a symbol of female empowerment.

“I think it's cool. Feminists have always used fashion to get the message across, from Suffragette sashes to throwing away bras. Dope,” another user tweeted.

In spite of the harsh feedback to the product, Amir is standing by the necklace, and the company has responded to critics multiple times on Twitter.

“We mean no offense so decided to increase the donation to 100% for this necklace in order to state our mission more clearly,” Adornia wrote.

“I appreciate your feedback. Our intention was to unite women through this expression, not profit off their pain,” the company wrote.

Amir explained to Refinery29 why she created the necklace in the first place, noting how shocked she was by the controversy.

""He doesn't have a clue as the entire World WAS laughing and taking advantage of us. People like liddle' Bob Corker have set the U.S. way back. Now we move forward!""

Tuesday's war of words began when Corker, R-Tenn., the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, blasted Trump on morning shows on ABC and NBC.

“Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal & couldn’t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts,” Trump tweeted following those interviews. “Corker dropped out of the race in Tennessee when I refused to endorse him, and now is only negative on anything Trump. Look at his record!”

Corker fired back minutes later.

""Same untruths from an utterly untruthful president. #AlertTheDaycareStaff,"" Corker tweeted.

The dispute raised tensions just hours before the president was set to visit Capitol Hill for a working lunch with GOP senators. With tax reform on the agenda, Trump fired another warning shot later Tuesday morning:

""Isn't it sad that lightweight Senator Bob Corker, who couldn't get re-elected in the Great State of Tennessee, will now fight Tax Cuts plus!""

Corker later told Fox News that Trump's ""political model ... is to divide."" Asked if he thinks Trump is ""debasing"" the nation,"" Corker said, ""I don't think there's any question that's the case.""

The tweets and comments extend a weeks-long feud between Trump and Corker.

Corker, who announced last month that he would not seek re-election in 2018, earlier suggested that the White House had become an ""adult day care center.""

“I don’t make comments I haven’t thought about,” Corker said on ABC’s “Good Morning America” Tuesday, referring back to that tweet.

TRUMP TURNS ON GOP SEN. CORKER OVER 'COMPETENCE' COMMENT

Corker also told “Good Morning America” Tuesday that he is not satisfied with Trump’s presidency or his treatment of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

“When you look at the fact that we’ve got this issue in North Korea and the president continues to kneecap his diplomatic representative, the secretary of state, and really move him away from successful diplomatic negotiations with China, which is key to this, you’re taking us on a path to combat,” Corker said on “Good Morning America,” adding that he would like Trump to “leave it to the professionals for a while.”

Corker added: “The president undermines our secretary of state [and] raises tensions in the area by virtue of the tweets that he sends out.”

On tax reform, Corker also said that much of the discussion should be left to the committees.

And, despite being one of Trump's early supporters, Corker told CNN he would not support Trump for re-election: “Let’s just say, I would not do that again.”

Actress Valerie Bertinelli, who America watched grow up on the hit show One Day at a Time, is now a fixture in the food world. The Golden Globe award-winning actress with her own Food Network show, sits down with Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo to talk about recipes from her new book Valerie's Home Cooking.

Take a LISTEN:

Back when we had a house in Park City, Utah, we frequented an Italian restaurant so often they put a sign above our regular table that said, ""Wolfie's Booth."" The reason we were at the restaurant so often? Their bacon-wrapped jalapeño shrimp. (Hold on a moment while I savor the memory of them. Seriously, my mouth is watering.) Sadly, the restaurant closed before I was able to get their recipe, so I developed this particular one on my own and have tinkered with it over the years to the point where I look for excuses to make it. A party, Sunday night football, a birthday, Tuesday night . . . I'm in, and so is my entire family, along with a few of my neighbors. The sauce is sweet with a hint of Cherry Coke, and once it connects with the jalapeño, it sits on the tongue with an exciting contrast of hot and sweet and savory. It goes well with a cold cocktail or even a light beer. These will disappear quickly.

Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Shrimp with Cherry Cola BBQ Sauce

Serves 16 Hands-on 35 minutes Total 45 minutes

CHERRY COLA BBQ SAUCE

1½ tablespoons bacon drippings

1/2 large red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)

2 garlic cloves, chopped

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon garlic powder

¼ teaspoon dry mustard

2 cups cherry cola soft drink

½ cup red wine vinegar

1 cup ketchup

SHRIMP

16 extra-large shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed (about 12 ounces)

1 jalapeño chile, stem removed, seeded, and cut lengthwise into 16 thin strips

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon black pepper

8 bacon slices, halved crosswise

Make the BBQ Sauce: Heat the bacon drippings in a small saucepan over medium-high. Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic, and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Stir in the salt, garlic powder, and dry mustard, and cook, stirring often, until the spices are toasted and fragrant and the onions are a deep maroon color, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cherry cola and vinegar, and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Stir in the ketchup. Bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until reduced to about 2 cups and the mixture coats the back of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Shrimp: Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium. Cut a long 1/4-inch-deep slit in the inner curve of each shrimp; insert 1 jalapeño strip. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Wrap each shrimp tightly with 1 bacon piece. Set on a plate, seam sides down.

Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp, seam sides down, in the hot skillet, and cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon is crisp and the shrimp are just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Serve the shrimp with the BBQ sauce.

Make Ahead: The BBQ sauce will hold up to 2 weeks in the fridge. If you're prepping for a party, the shrimp can be wrapped ahead of time and cooked later.

Trick Technique: If you're someone who loves their bacon in the morning, start saving the drippings in a jar for uses like this one!

Hamburger Helpa

Don't laugh. This dish might give you more insight into my culinary history than almost anything else. It's a throwback to my childhood and it speaks directly to my more-than-occasional desire for quickness and efficiency, in that I love a good casserole or one-skillet dish. No fuss, no muss, easy cleanup, and get-right-to-it dinner. I made this for Wolfie and his friends when they came home after soccer or Little League practice. I can still picture everyone at the kitchen table, doing homework, while I simmered the beef in the mélange of spices and added macaroni, cheese, and breadcrumbs, and then announced to a sea of smiling faces, ""Dinner's ready."" Years later, I whipped out this dish when Tom's kids entered the picture and everyone came home from college during breaks. We all know the store-bought mix; this homemade version is even better than the classic, I promise.

Serves 4 Hands-on 10 minutes Total 35 minutes

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 pound ground 90% lean beef

¼ teaspoon black pepper

1 teaspoon kosher salt

8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni

2 cups whole milk

1¼ cups warm water

1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

1/4 teaspoon paprika

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

11/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

½ cup chopped American cheese

2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives

1/4 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)

1 scallion, green part sliced

Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add the beef, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring to crumble, until browned, about 5 minutes. Preheat the broiler with the oven rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat. Reduce the stovetop heat to medium, and stir in the macaroni. Add the milk, warm water, mustard, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. 3. Bring to a low simmer; cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the macaroni is tender, about 12 minutes. Add the cheeses, and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheeses melt. Stir in the chives. Sprinkle the panko over the macaroni mixture. Broil until the panko is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with the scallion, and serve immediately.

Variation: Add some slices of jalapeño for extra kick.

In this episode, Carly and Clayton talk about breaking into music at an early age. We learn how they battled through personal doubts and overcame ego and other obstacles in an unforgiving business.

Great stories in this episode include an underage Carly trying out for Dollywood, an exuberant Clayton opening up for Kenny Chesney and a broken-down van that made it to the venue on time with the help of five random cousins in rural West Virginia. As Clayton puts it, ""when you're out on the road, everything is not as glamorous as it seems.""

Both artists sing some of their best, with Carly telling the story behind her big hit ""Every Little Thing"" before sharing a beautiful rendition of the soulful ballad.

By The New York Post Editorial Board

Lefty cheers for Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in US politics may soon fade now that he’s reportedly looking into a top Democratic lobbyist.

NBC reports that Tony Podesta (the brother of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta) and his firm are the subjects of a criminal investigation by the special prosecutor.

And this comes amid new reports that the FBI gathered evidence for two years as Russian agents — including a major sleeper cell — worked to gain access to then-Secretary of State Clinton, husband Bill and members of their inner circle.

All of which underscores that, yes, Russia has long been trying to worm its way into US politics. But that effort went far, far beyond any schemes to help elect Donald Trump president.

On Saturday night, Muniz wrote on Twitter, ""I lost my wallet today.
Muniz told Fox News about his wallet after a surprisingly mistake-ridden performance, ""I don't know where it is.
When asked why his dance missed, Muniz told Fox News, ""I'm not sure 'cause I've never messed up on [in rehearsal] the parts that we messed up on but I messed up on so much [tonight].
I don't know,"" he said.","Former ""Malcolm in the Middle"" star Frankie Muniz has been a ""Dancing with the Stars"" favorite all season, and fans rallied to his side after he revealed his long-term memory loss, as Fox News previously reported.



But the actor had big problems this week as he lost his wallet — then his dance moves.



On Saturday night, Muniz wrote on Twitter, ""I lost my wallet today. Replacing the contents makes me want to cry.""



Did the incident affect Muniz's dancing with partner Witney Carson on Monday night?



Muniz told Fox News about his wallet after a surprisingly mistake-ridden performance, ""I don't know where it is. I have no clue where it could possibly be. I went to a store and the next minute, it was gone.""



The star said his driver's license and other items are gone, including his girlfriend Paige Price's driver's license.



On Monday, Muniz and Carson performed a jazz-themed routine for ""movie night"" that paid tribute to the animation genre -- but judges griped at his bobbles, including a knee turn that went bad.



When asked why his dance missed, Muniz told Fox News, ""I'm not sure 'cause I've never messed up on [in rehearsal] the parts that we messed up on but I messed up on so much [tonight]. I hit a few of [the moves] but I did not do good.



""I’m disappointed. I know I can do it better. That was bad.""



Muniz, who received a score of 31 out of 40 for the dance, candidly told reporters about the judges, ""I think they should have been harsher, to be honest. In my head, it was train wreck city.""



The former child star said it wasn't for lack of trying: ""We definitely rehearse a lot longer than anyone else does, I think, but that's because I want to. I want to keep going. I want to keep working on it. I feel like I let [Witney] down.""



Muniz's enthusiasm for the ""DWTS"" experience has delighted viewers, and he said backstage, ""I already dread when we're done, the fact that I don't get to wake up and go to rehearsal. I actually really enjoy it. There hasn't been one time where I'm like, 'Oh, I wish I wasn't doing this.' I think we've had 58 days in a row of rehearsal. I'm scared for when I don't get to do that anymore.



""I'm still so nervous before we go out. I think I was a little better today but it was my worst performance. So maybe I need the nerves to perform. I don't know,"" he said.



""Frankie's really hard on himself,"" Carson commented. ""I think people still enjoyed it.""



The 31-year-old actor has earlier confided on camera that he’s suffered nine concussions and several ""mini-strokes"" and the effects have been so bad that he can't even remember being on his hit sitcom, ""Malcolm in the Middle.""","Frankie Muniz loses his wallet, then his moves on 'DWTS': 'I messed up'",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/24/frankie-muniz-loses-his-wallet-then-his-moves-on-dwts-messed-up.html

The teenager, who loved nothing more than writing and performing her own songs, believed that a radio tour would allow her to follow in the footsteps of her heroes like Patsy Cline, Linda Ronstadt, Martina McBride and all of the other female artists who came before her.

But Armiger told Fox News she would soon learn that the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry came with a hefty price.

Years before pop superstar Taylor Swift was groped by a radio DJ from Denver, Colo., Armiger says she was fending off a different handsy DJ while she was underage.

""I was at a radio station in Texas and was taking a promo photo with one of the on-air DJs after doing my performances and he grabbed my butt during the photo,"" Armiger told us. ""And at the same time he was whispering in my ear, 'When are you going to be legal?'""

Armiger told us she ""was shocked"" and ""terrified"" but had no one to lean on for support.

""I brought up my fears and I was told that's how it was and if I wanted to be in music, I'd have to get over it,"" she said.

Armiger decided to keep her mouth shut after that, but things came to a head in June 2016 when the singer was sued by her record label, Cold River, and filed a counterclaim alleging the label told her to ""sex it up"" in order to become successful.

According to the lawsuit, Armiger said she was asked to ""purchase 'hot, game-changing' clothes,"" ""hug, kiss and flirt"" with radio programmers. Armiger said she was told she needed to make the programmers ""wish you would take them home with you.""

Cold River Record head Pete O'Heeron told Fox News at the time the suit was ""baseless"" and ""an attempt to try and smear good people.""

Armiger said she can't comment on her battle with Cold River after a settlement was made, but said she now wants to share her stories of sexual harassment after hearing the bombshell sexual abuse allegations against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that have rocked Hollywood.

""There's something really horrible going on behind the scenes,"" she told us, saying the country music community has its fair share of Weinstein-like behavior.

The now-26-year-old detailed several other stories of sexual harassment that she's encountered. Armiger recalled taking a radio programmer and his team to lunch when the program director asked everyone to share their ""top five list of women they would want to sleep with.""

After sharing his first choice, Armiger said a radio programmer turned to her, ""looking me in the eyes, he said, 'But you would absolutely be my No. 2.'""

Armiger said he then turned to her guitar player and said, ""Surely you've been f--king her. Where is she on your list?""

The guitar player suggested the group change the subject to something more appropriate, but Armiger said she still ""got flack"" for the exchange.

""The programmer called and said if I ever brought that guitar player back again he'd never play my music again,"" she recalled.

The singer said she was similarly rebuked after a radio DJ was interviewing her about her album ""Confessions of a Nice Girl"" at the 2010 ACM Awards.

""As we were doing the interview, he is trying to feel me up under the table -- this is on air -- trying to ask me whether or not my album title was true because surely I couldn't be a nice girl. I had to be a naughty girl,"" Armiger said.

When the DJ later asked her what her least favorite interview question was, Armiger was ""pissed"" and curtly said, ""The worst question is that you're asking me if I'm a nice girl or a naughty girl because what kind of person asks that?""

She said ""that didn't go over well"" and she learned ""not to talk back"" after that.

When Armiger filed her lawsuit against Cold River, she said many people in the country music world would not work with her anymore.

""When my story first became public and in the aftermath when I was finally to start looking for other opportunities in the industry, we went to [publishing houses] but we would be met with, 'We're not going to sign you, but we're really a big fan and we just want to know your story and how are you?'""

She continued, ""That was the consensus; that was everywhere I went. I would talk to booking agents and they were scared to work with me because they either thought somehow the tour would be canceled or I was a liability to work with.""

Armiger said she does not want to name her harassers out of fear of retribution, but she hopes coming forward with her story of harassment in the country music world will make a difference because ""it has to change.""

""I don't think it will change until people start speaking out, and for the most part they're too scared,"" she told us. ""Look at my story -- they'll see that I spoke out and spoke my truth and thought for the most part people would believe my story. I didn't ever think that it would be met with doubt or disdain.""",Katie Armiger says she was blacklisted from country music after sexual harassment allegations,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/katie-armiger-says-was-blacklisted-from-country-music-after-sexual-harassment-allegations.html

The three men in the photo are Dwayne Harrison, Danny Thyng, and James Scruggs, according to Cossar.

Harrison, who is on the far right in the photo, told Fox News that standing for the anthem was the “right thing to do.”

“It is a respect thing for myself -- we did not do this to prove a point,” Harrison said, adding that he wasn’t aware that a picture was taken.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote. Change the bag often.",8 overlooked germy places in your kitchen to clean now,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/8-overlooked-germy-places-in-your-kitchen-to-clean-now.html

At the same time, Russian nuclear officials were giving $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.
The Obama administration, including Hillary Clinton and then-Attorney General Eric Holder, let it happen.","When it comes to Russia, it is clear that Democrats and their allies in the mainstream media have been flat out lying to the American people about what is really happening.

It was always just a matter of time before their manufactured hysteria and conspiracy theories blew up in their faces and boomeranged back on the Democrats and the media. Well, it is happening now.

None other than NBC News signaled the sea change with a bombshell report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is now investigating Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta. If that name sounds familiar, it is because he happens to be the brother of Hillary Clinton's former campaign chairman, John Podesta.

Mueller's investigation reportedly began by looking into the finances of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, but now is probing whether Podesta’s firm violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act while working with a Moscow-linked organization. Under that law, lobbyists in the United States who worked for foreign entities must register with the Department of Justice and disclose what they are doing.

But wait, there’s more. The Hill’s John Solomon is out with another explosive report about the FBI having evidence that the Kremlin launched a campaign to try to gain access to Hillary Clinton, her top aides and her husband, Bill Clinton, in 2009. According to The Hill, one attempt included a female Russian who used a false identity to secure a job with a key Democratic donor in the hopes that she would be able to collect intelligence on Hillary Clinton and the State Department. She was deported when her spy ring was busted in 2010.

Think about this: At the exact same time Vladimir Putin and Russia were trying to infiltrate her inner circle, Hillary Clinton was using a private server that had top-secret special access programs, classified national security information on it.

Clinton knew what was happening because her office commented on the Russia spy ring bust back in 2010. Yet, she recklessly continued to use the personal server, putting national security at risk.

Last week, Solomon and Circa News’ Sara Carter both reported that Bill Clinton, while his wife was secretary of state, tried to get permission to meet with Russian nuclear officials while the Uranium One deal was being approved by the Obama administration and his own wife. That deal gave control of 20 percent of America’s Uranium supply to Russia.

Back in 2009, the FBI was doing its job. Investigators discovered evidence, including documents and emails and financial records. They had witness accounts that the Russian nuclear officials working on behalf of Vladimir Putin and Russia and Moscow were engaging in bribery.

Just before the deal that put our own nuclear materials in the hands of a hostile nation known to be trying to bribe our government, Bill Clinton got $500,000 for a speech in Moscow. That was twice his normal speaking fee, and the check was cut from a bank that had an interest in the Uranium One deal. While in Moscow, the former president sought to meet with Russian nuclear officials. He had to ask his own wife's State Department for permission, but wound up meeting directly with Vladimir Putin and corrupt banking officials instead.

At the same time, Russian nuclear officials were giving $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. Were they simply feeling philanthropic?

Putin wanted a piece of our Uranium supply, our government knew he was illegally efforting to get it, a former president met with him and pocketed a suspicious speaking fee and, what did our government do? The Obama administration, including Hillary Clinton and then-Attorney General Eric Holder, let it happen. In 2010, the Uranium One deal was approved.

If this is all new to you, maybe it is because a patriotic informant, who first told the FBI about Russia’s bribery scheme, was mysteriously muzzled by the Obama Department of Justice. But now, President Trump is in charge, and the truth will come out, right?

Well, the federal prosecutor who helped lead that FBI investigation, and who surely knows everything about the Uranium One scandal, is Rod Rosenstein. He’s the very man who appointed Mueller to probe Trump-Russia collusion. And Mueller himself was FBI director during this entire scandal. We are supposed to trust Mueller to investigate Russian interference fairly, objectively and honestly even though he kept the Russian bribery plot quiet so the Hillary Clinton could get richer and keep her presidential aspirations intact.

If the Department of Justice won’t do its job and expose the Russia scandal, Congress will. Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., says the House Oversight Committee is now investigating this Uranium One deal. And he recently revealed some stunning information about the FBI informant.

“I've been able to speak with the confidential informant that helped the FBI uncover this bribery scheme,” he said. “I've spoken with his attorney. And this informant wants to tell his story, but he's currently under a nondisclosure agreement that was signed with the Eric Holder Justice Department. He came forward in 2016, was threatened with reprisal from the Loretta Lynch Justice Department.”

The Democrats and their handmaidens in the media should have been more careful about what they wished for. The Russia collusion story is finally coming out.

The admission is in; the sentence awaits us. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl admitted deserting his Afghan post and endangering fellow troops. By all accounts this is the most serious betrayal of presidential authority in my life time.

In 2014 President Obama attempted to cover Bergdahl with the achievement of a war hero, even inviting his Idaho based parents to the Rose Garden to celebrate news of his release. President Obama pointed out at the time that five Taliban leaders were freed from Guantanamo so that Bergdahl could be released from captivity. To gild the lily, National Security Adviser, Susan Rice, said Bergdahl served “the United States with honor and distinction.”

Yet everyone in the White House and the Pentagon knew this was a lie with monumental implications. In fact, Army officials refused to list Bergdahl as a POW.

But I didn’t think I was anything extraordinary to him… About a week later I got a call saying [I] got this movie with Clint Eastwood.
“Knots Landing” is still recognized as the second longest-running drama in TV history.
And that’s good or it would’ve killed ya if you worked every day.”And the relationships Mills developed with her “Knots Landing” family endured.","Donna Mills, who once lured audiences across the country as scheming vixen Abby Cunningham on “Knots Landing,” is returning to her comedic roots.

The 76-year-old television star is starring in the upcoming film “Best Mom” as Nana, a determined parent who seems to fail every time there is an opportunity to talk with her daughter. Some fans may see the movie as a far cry from the “Dallas” spinoff, which aired from 1979 until 1993, but Mills insisted the role was the right fit.

“I started out doing comedy,” Mills told Fox News. “The first thing I did here in Los Angeles when I first came was a show called ‘The Good Life’ with Larry Hagman. It was a half-hour comedy. It was great. I loved Larry and we had a great time together.

""The show only ran one season, mainly because it was opposite of ‘All in the Family.’ That was getting all the ratings. But then I was offered every comedy series that came along, and I didn’t want to get known as a comedy actress. So I turned everything down and waited for some drama. And I think people forget that I do comedy.”

However, just before Mills embarked on comedy, the aspiring actress starred in a 1971 thriller titled “Play Misty for Me,” which featured a first-time director, actor Clint Eastwood. Burt Reynolds, who previously worked with Mills in the 1970 series “Dan August,” was so impressed by the guest star that he recommended her to Eastwood, who instantly hired Mills for his directorial debut.

“I got along great with Burt,” recalled Mills. “We had a really good time. But I didn’t think I was anything extraordinary to him… About a week later I got a call saying [I] got this movie with Clint Eastwood.

""[But] apparently, Burt and Clint ran into each other at a bar one night. Clint told him, ‘I can’t find a girl I really like for this movie that I’m going to direct.’ And Burt was like, ‘I just worked with this girl… Maybe you would like her… Clint hired me from that. I never met him, I never read for him, audition — nothing… I’m always grateful for Burt.”

Mills revealed Eastwood easily impressed her with his determination to show off his directorial skills, despite already being celebrated as a Hollywood icon.

“He never directed before, so one would have thought he wouldn’t [know] what he was doing,” explained Mills. “But no, he knew exactly what he wanted… He was amazing. Absolutely amazing… He finished the movie under budget and under time… Over-budget is what you generally hear in Hollywood… I think he’s a born director, I really do. I think it was bubbling in him all the time when he was doing all the Westerns. He was just taking it all in and learning. Once he started to direct, he just took off.”

By the time “Knots Landing” came along, Mills was viewed by as “Miss Goody Two Shoes” and was eager to shed her innocent image. Even though Mills was friends with one of the show’s producers, she wanted to audition for the role of Abby and prove she was capable of playing a bad girl. The move worked, but the character would quickly impact her life when cameras stopped rolling.

“It was funny, I didn’t realize it at first,” said Mills. “When I played Abby, whenever I would meet people, a lot of the times they were kind of standoffish to me. I thought, ‘What did I do?’ I’m friendly, I’m usually pretty nice. I [didn’t] know why they were standoffish to me. So cold. And I learned — they thought I was like Abby. They thought I was Abby. So they were worried I was going to somehow do something bad to them. Steal their husbands, I don’t know. And so, I really had to fight hard to overcome that in real life.”

Still, Mills earned lasting success from the popular series. “Knots Landing” is still recognized as the second longest-running drama in TV history. She credited the show’s 14-hour work days for giving the cast flexibility to share their finest performances for viewers.

“A normal day was 14 hours, sometimes it would be 16 and on a Friday it would be 18,” said Mills. “[Quality] was the most important thing to everybody. And that had to be done right… That all takes time. The lighting, rehearsal, everything. And we never rushed it.

""We always took as much time as we needed to make it as good as we possibly could… We were happy to do it, but it was tough. It was grueling. It was exhausting… But it was a large cast, so not everyone worked every day. And that’s good or it would’ve killed ya if you worked every day.”

And the relationships Mills developed with her “Knots Landing” family endured. She still stays in touch with the cast and is even considering a secret project with two former cast mates. As for a possible “Knots Landing” reboot, Mills isn’t sure if it will ever happen, but she would happily take on Abby again if asked.

“Absolutely,” she said. “That was a once in a lifetime character… I would absolutely do it in a heartbeat. If it were up to me, I would say yes [to a reboot]. I think it would be fascinating to see where those characters are today and what they’ve experienced over the years. I think it would be fun to find out.”

But Mills isn’t sitting back and waiting. She has not slowed down since the show’s finale and is eager to do comedy again with ""Best Mom.""

“I’ve always had a lot of energy and discipline, having been a dancer,” said Mills. “But while I was raising my daughter, I didn’t work a lot mainly because I would have had to go out of town… I wasn’t going to leave her at any given amount of time to be somewhere. But once she went off to college, a bunch of stuff just fell on my lap… And I’m at a point right now where I love working. I really do. I have fallen in love with it again.”","'Knots Landing' star Donna Mills talks new comedy role, impressing Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/24/knots-landing-star-donna-mills-talks-new-comedy-role-impressing-burt-reynolds-and-clint-eastwood.html

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts.
And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts.
Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts?
Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts.","Sitting at my usual corner table in the back of Buzzy’s 8-Ball Tavern and Pool Room, It occurred to me on Thursday night that there are any number of serious issues and current crisis that we could talk about for this week’s dispatch from the front lines.

But setting all those issues aside, let me tell you something that may have escaped your attention while you’ve been busy digging a backyard bomb shelter or getting up to speed on which starlets haven’t been groped by Weinstein. Apparently, and I did not see this coming, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) leadership has decided to open the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts to, wait for it… girls.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts. Boys whittled wood into sharp, pointy things and set fire to stuff, while girls generated an incredible amount of revenue selling delicious cookies. I’m particularly fond of Samoas.

My oldest boy Scooter is in the Cub Scouts, and I can vouch for the fact that he and his Den cohorts love to whittle. They can take a 400 pound oak log and turn it into a sharp, pointy twig in less time than it takes to whistle the theme to ""The Andy Griffith Show."" To be honest, they’re a pack of smelly, loud boys with a remarkable ability to recite the entire Scout oath while actually burping. I can see why girls would be clamoring to join.

In reality, most are not. And the Girl Scouts of America, which after taking into account global cookie sales, I believe is the country’s 7th largest corporation, have criticized what they see as a blatant effort to increase membership dues by the BSA. Membership numbers are down in general for youth groups across America so this may be less about gender and more about dough. Which reminds me, I also like the Thin Mints.

Back in August of this year, the president of the Girl Scouts sent a letter to the BSA president stating “…I formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 per cent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts… and not consider expanding to recruit girls.” That, my friends, is how you win a merit badge for subtle insult.

At this point, It would be fairly easy to morph this into a high brow column about gender fluidity and the need to be considerate over what pronouns someone uses when referring to their particular identification. Or perhaps turn to the subject of gender equality and how girls and boys are really no different and so no association or organization should exclude one or the other.

But I’m a guy, raising a houseful of little guys, and so my thinking isn’t particularly complicated. I’m guessing the BSA’s decision is partly driven by a need for additional revenue, as suggested by the Girl Scouts leadership, and likely in part out of concern that they might be sued by some overly sensitive soul who wants to prove a point that most folks really don’t care about.

I admit to being a bit old fashioned. Believing that there’s a place for a Boy Scouts organization and a Girl Scouts organization that focus on their respective genders doesn’t make me a misogynist or a sexist or anything else ending in “ist” or even an “ism.” I happen to believe that there’s value and benefit in girls having their own space and boys having their own space on occasion…as long as they offer equal space and opportunity.

I know that Scooter and his pals at their current stage of life would prefer to keep the “no girls allowed” sign on their clubhouse door. And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts. Give them a couple years and they’ll see things differently…they may even realize girls don’t find it attractive when you make farting noises. Although to be fair, I didn’t have that epiphany until my mid 20s.

Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts? I would have done that research but it seems like a lot of work and I’ve been busy whittling.

Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts. For their part, the BSA leadership claims the change was designed to provide more options for parents. According to BSA’s Chief Scout Executive, “We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.”

So there you have it. Sally can now be a Cub Scout. And soon, Sally can join the Boy Scouts and eventually earn the coveted Eagle Scout award. I haven’t raised this development with Scooter yet. He may or may not care, it’s hard to tell what a 10-year-old boy’s response will be.

By Anna Eliopoulos

A New York family discouraged, after getting a letter from their insurer, that their nine-month-old's cancer treatment is denied.

Connor Richardson is the newborn of a retired NYPD officer, Wayne. He tells Fox News Radio, that up until two months ago, he was a smiling normal baby.

But then he was rushed to a Long Island hospital after exhibiting symptoms that Richardson says weren't normal for his son... and that's when they found out about the cancer

""He was in the operating room. They had to relieve the fluid,"" Richardson says."" The tumor in his brain was preventing the fluid from circulating to his spine.""

A cat scan and MRI confirmed that an aggressive and rare form of cancer was affecting Connor.

""They made an attempt to remove the tumor the first time and they got approximately 85% of it, bleeding started by the pituitary gland, and they had to wait approximately a week to go back in, and the doctor believes he got it all.""

However, doctors at Saint Jude's Childrens Hospital in Memphis, who had accepted him for chemo, said that they noticed that the cancerous cells had come back.

Connor continues to remain in their care, and to receive treatment.

Richardson says though that on October 11, he didn't expect to get a letter from his insurance provider that coverage for his son's treatment was denied.

""They're not covering because one of the chemo treatments is clinical,"" he says.

The experimental trial that their son was undergoing, with a mix of medications was considered by the letter ""investigational"" with no evidence of being effective.

""It's like a form letter, and the bold faced part is the part they fill on their own, and it wasn't medically necessary.""

Saint Jude's provides free care to patients. So while no one is really footing the bill for treatment, Richardson says it's the principal that bothers him.

""I believe Saint Jude's should get paid for this. It's going to come out to millions of dollars I'm sure.""

And Richardson adds that money is crucial to finding out how to treat and prevent cancer and other life-threatening diseases in children.

""It's taking literally millions of dollars away from their research development.""

Richardson says he plans on contesting the denial.

""You have insurance but you don't really. It's really for disasters and this is a disaster and they're not willing to cover it.""

According to Richardson, Connor is responding well to treatment.",Insurer Allegedly Sends Coverage Denial Letter to 9-month-old with Brain Cancer,https://radio.foxnews.com/2017/10/20/insurer-allegedly-sends-coverage-denial-letter-to-9-month-old-with-brain-cancer/

Shortly after Inauguration Day, Eli’sha Davies, 9, learned that the president was taking a big salary cut in his new job. So he decided to send him $3 to help him pay his bills, WGRZ reported.

The story gained attention after Trump wrote him back this week, reportedly sending a letter, a picture, and the $3, urging Davies to put it towards bettering his community.

But Davies’ mother told reporters that the money was actually meant to go towards a new mandolin the boy had been saving for, WGRZ reported. But he was having trouble because he kept finding people he thought needed the money more than he did, like the president.

The Young Musicians Education Foundation Inc. is a local charity that helps kids get access to instruments who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford them, WGRZ reported.

When John Wildeman, the president of the Foundation, heard about Davies' story, he decided that he wanted to help out, so he gifted him the mandolin he wanted.

""$3 is a lot of money to a little kid, most kids,"" Wildeman said. ""For him to sacrifice that and send that money to someone who he thought really needed it, that meant an awful lot to me.""

""I'm like a kid at Christmas when I know we're giving a child an instrument like this,"" Wildeman said. ""It's just a thrill for me to be able to do it.""

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.
Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it.
Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do.
But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","I sat on a parenting panel last month with a well-known and widely respected counselor by the name of Sissy Goff, M.Ed, LPC-MHSP. She is the Director of Child & Adolescent Counseling at Daystar in Nashville and when asked about the biggest issue facing kids today, she confirmed what you’ve probably read about recently on your news feed or even your Facebook feed – the increasing anxiety epidemic in our country.

But it’s not just an epidemic among our kids. It’s an epidemic among us -- their parents.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults.

In a recent article entitled “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety” we glean significant insight into the anxiety epidemic:

I’ll just share just two key points from the article:

* Privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic.

* For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop.’ Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.

If you’re reading this article as a mom, I imagine it breaks your heart like it breaks mine (as the mother of four boys who range in age from toddler to teenager) to learn that the pressure our kids are under “is relentless and getting worse.” Of course, I think we already assumed this to be true. But knowing it to be true leaves us responsible to do something to fight against it.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

See, we parents aren’t the only ones linking accomplishment to acceptance and success to significance. Our kids are attempting to answer the question, “Is who I am enough?” by how well they perform on the field, how much they excel in school, and how many likes they get on their Instagram feed.

They are attempting to answer that question, “Is who I am enough?” by proving they can do enough and be enough. Whatever “enough” is. Because you and I both know enough is never enough when the goal is perpetual perfection.

The primary message our kids receive is that they’d better be the best at everything, and this leaves them afraid to reveal their inadequacies and insecurities—and hiding behind the best version of themselves.

In turn, parents of anxious teens feel helpless and hopeless, questioning all of the steps we are -- or aren’t -- taking. Our confidence as moms crumbles as we try to help our kids navigate the battles they have to fight and the mountains they have to climb.

We are constantly second guessing ourselves: “Have I done too much? Have I not done enough? Am I helping or am I hurting my child?”

Our anxiety escalates and overflows into our parenting and onto our kids, who then take our anxiety on top of their own.

I won’t pretend to even begin to be able to solve this for us here. I don’t have all the answers. Not even a little bit. But I do have this one nugget – which is the primary message woven into my new book, ""Mom Set Free,"" and I believe it to be true with everything in me.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.

It starts with us. It doesn’t end with us. But we are part of the solution.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

Of course, some kids are just more prone to perfection seeking than others. Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it. But often, we parents play a role in the pressure -- and therefore, anxiety -- our kids feel, so we have to be willing to take an honest look at how we pile our own pressure onto our kids.

And ultimately, it is our responsibility to help our kids push back the pressure they face with the truth of God’s Word. I am not at all suggesting that therapy and medication aren’t part of the solution. They often times are. But please let us not forget the alive and powerful Word of God that has the absolute power to show us where our significance comes from and ultimately set us free from proving our worth and our value in our performance.

Kids who constantly feel like they just don't measure up and who feel they have “everything” to prove need to be told – over and over again - they actually have “nothing” to prove. Because this pressure to prove our value and worth has left parents and children alike longing for what all our hearts most crave:

• to be known—truly and deeply known

• to be accepted—for who they are, not who they wish they were to be loved—with no strings attached

This isn’t sentimental fluff. This is solid truth from which freedom springs. There is absolutely no denying the inherent and deepest longing every human soul holds.

If we want to raise kids who find freedom from the pressure to get it ALL right in order to be accepted and welcomed, then we are going to need to walk in that freedom first. Or at least be willing to discover how to walk in that freedom alongside our kids.

We need to know that failing doesn’t make us failures and succeeding doesn’t make us significant. At least not in the eyes of our Creator -- the only One whose opinion of us really matters in the end.

In God’s eyes we are of great worth, not because of anything we have or haven’t done, but because of what has been done for us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The cross has the final word on our value. Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do. But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","America's teen anxiety epidemic is heartbreaking.

There's word from Fort Bragg that Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl's sentencing hearing will be continued on Wednesday and could go longer. At issue are comments made by President Trump just this month that the defense now says could influence the military judge's decision on sentencing.

Bergdahl's attorney wants the court to reconsider the defense's motion to dismiss the case.

The HGTV personality worked with his twin Drew Scott on the book, which hit shelves Sept. 5, but for Jonathan some of the revelations in the tell-all took on a more personal tone.

Jonathan Scott, who has been tight-lipped about his romantic past, opened up about his divorce from an airline-crew scheduler named Kelsey. The two wed in 2007, and though they had been together for more than six years when they got married, the pair called it quits two years later.

“I think when you are young and you don’t really know what you want in life, you can commit to something and think at the time it is right,” he told Fox News.

He said his failed union gave him a new outlook.

“It really gives you perspective,” he said of marriage. “Anyone who has been through failed relationships — even people in successful relationships — understand that you gain perspective about what is important to you.”

Though Scott, 39, has not spoken much about his divorce, he felt it was an important piece of the brothers’ memoir.

“I never talked about my divorce before and anyone who has been through divorce before knows how painful that is,” he revealed. “When I commit to something I commit 100 percent and knowing I failed and we just weren't meant to be together was difficult.”

He wanted to share his tough experience with fans.

“We said if we were going to do a memoir we were only going to do it if it was authentic and it was honest and we did not cut anything out, and we committed to that,” he told us. “The book shows the highs and the lows.”

Because of YOU, #ItTakesTwoBook is on The @NYTimes' Monthly Business Best Sellers List! Thank you so much. A post shared by Jonathan Scott (@mrsilverscott) on Oct 7, 2017 at 8:59am PDT

And Scott isn't dwelling on his divorce. He gushed to us about girlfriend Jacinta Kuznetsov.

“Jacinta and I are madly in love with each other. We are perfect for each other and stand each other’s strengths and weaknesses. I’ve always said I don't regret anything as long as I have learned from it. I think the past relationships I’ve had were very important learning scenarios in my life.”

He said even though he’s been through a divorce, he’s still a strong believer in marriage.

“There is no situation in the world where I would shun marriage just because I had one that didn't work,” he said. “You can have two good people who are just not good for each other and I’ve never been the type of person to wallow in misery.”

Aside from his relationship and recently released book, Scott has been busy working on the new HGTV spinoff “Property Brothers At Home: Drew’s Honeymoon House.” The show, which premieres Nov. 22, chronicles the brothers’ journey to transform a home for Drew and fiancée Linda Phan.

“It’s absolutely phenomenal; this is hands down one of my favorite designs of all time,” he said. “It makes a difference too when it’s for your brother and future sister-in-law; it’s their very first home together. It means a lot and that’s why I wanted to make sure we get it right.”

The move is the latest episode in a long-running battle between airlines and travel sites over how consumers search for and purchase flights. The airlines want customers to use their sites, which saves them money on commissions and could boost their ability to sell extras such as preferred seating. The travel sites accuse the airlines of trying to choke off competition for ticket sales.

George Hobica, founder of the airfarewatchdog.com travel site, said JetBlue could be warning bigger online travel agencies to lower the fees they charge and to show more products that the airline offers such as ancillary services and insurance.

For its match Sunday, hard core “ultra” Lazio fans littered the Stadio Olimpico with superimposed images of Frank – the young diarist who died during the Holocaust – wearing a jersey of city rival Roma. It was a new low for the club’s fans.

The northern curva (end) of the stadium where Lazio's ""ultra"" fans usually sit was closed on Sunday for the match with Cagliari, due to racist chants spewed during a match against Sassuolo earlier this month.

As a result, Lazio decided to open the southern end and let the ultras in where Roma's hard-core fans sit for their home matches in the stadium both sides share.

Stadium cleaners found the anti-Semitic stickers on Monday, sparking immediate backlash.

""There are no justifications. These incidents must be met with disapproval, without any ifs, ands or buts,"" Sports Minister Luca Lotti said. ""I'm sure that the responsible authorities will shed light on what happened and that those responsible will quickly be identified and punished.""

The Anne Frank Center denounced Lazio's fans, calling their actions ""abhorrent.""

""This is abhorrent. This is offensive. This is antisemitism. Hate has no place in our world,"" the center wrote on Twitter.

Ex-Italian Premier Matteo Renzi called the actions from some Lazio fans “a shameful gesture” to the memory of Frank.

“Obviously we’re talking about a small minority but not shedding light on this news would be a mistake,” he said. “Because when things like this happen it’s important that children known and learn how to deal with a complete lack of dignity.”

Antonio Tajani, the head of the European Parliament, denounced those responsible during a session in Brussels on Tuesday, saying that anti-Semitism has no place.

""Using the image of Anne Frank as an insult against others is a very grave matter,"" Tajani said.

In response, the Italian soccer federation condemned the acts by Lazio fans Tuesday and announced that a passage from Frank’s famous diary – which gave a first-hand account of her family going into hiding during World War II – will be read before matches this week.

The diary passage reads: ""I see the world being slowly transformed into a wilderness, I hear the approaching thunder that, one day, will destroy us too, I feel the suffering of millions. And yet, when I look up at the sky, I somehow feel that everything will change for the better, that this cruelty too shall end, that peace and tranquility will return once more.""

The FIGC also said a minute of silence will be observed before Serie A, B and C matches this week, plus amateur and youth games over the weekend.

In a visit to Rome’s main synagogue on Tuesday, Lazio president Claudio Lotito sought to disassociate the club from its hard-core fans. He said the club would intensify its efforts to combat racism and anti-Semitism and organize an annual trip to the Auschwitz concentration camp with some 200 young Lazio fans to “educate them not to forget.”

Lazio's ultra group, the ""Irriducibili"" (diehards), expressed surprise at the widespread outrage.

""There are other cases that we feel should lead the newscasts and fill newspaper pages,"" the group said in a statement on Facebook.

The club’s ultra fans have a long history of racism and anti-Semitism. Nearly 20 years ago, a Lazio banner in the intra-city derby aimed at Roma supporters read: “Auschwitz Is Your Homeland; The Ovens Are Your Homes.”

And that's exactly what they did at Friday night's homecoming game -- bringing the audience to tears.

At the conclusion of the song, the game announcer told the crowd they were living in the “best country on the face of this Earth.”

“At Burroughs football game – we are standing,” he declared. “We are standing for the national anthem.”

Parent Tina Haugen filmed the incredible moment.

Wesley Mathews, 37, was arrested and charged with injury to a child, one day after a search team discovered a body believe to be Sherin Mathews, police said. Officials are still waiting for positive identification of the body.

Wesley Mathews voluntarily went to police on Monday and offered a new account of what happened the night of Oct. 7, according to an arrest warrant affidavit obtained by the Dallas News. Mathews reportedly told police he and the girl were in the house’s garage when she refused to drink her milk. She allegedly wouldn’t listen, so he “physically assisted” her until she began drinking the liquid. Sherin began choking, coughing and breathing slowly at some point, according to the affidavit.

Mathews reportedly told police he couldn’t feel a pulse on his daughter and believed she died. He then said he removed the toddler’s body from the house, the Dallas News reported. Cadaver dogs led officials to the body not far from the Mathews’ home about 11 a.m. Sunday.

The father initially told police he ordered her to stand next to a tree behind the fence of their Dallas suburb home about 3 a.m. because she refused to drink her milk. He said she was nowhere to be seen after he went to check up on her 15 minutes later. He was initially arrested and charged with child endangerment, but was released on bond and ordered to wear an ankle monitor.

SHERIN MATHEWS ABANDONED IN INDIA BEFORE ALLEY ABANDONMENT THAT MAY HAVE LED TO DEATH

Sherin's adopted mother, Sini Mathews, was reportedly sleeping at the time. Her attorney told the Dallas News she was “distraught” about the incident and was cooperating with police.

Wesley Mathews is being held on $1 million bail and faces up to 99 years in prison if convicted. The FBI also seized 47 items, including “hair-like” fibers, a Costco receipt and a washer and dryer from the home.

The couple’s other daughter, a 4-year-old, was placed in protective custody after Mathews went missing. A court hearing on Monday ruled the girl will remain in foster care at least until a Nov. 13 hearing, or when a judge determines a change in custody.

The couple reportedly adopted Sherin from an orphanage in India about two years ago. Sherin was placed in the orphanage when she was 1 after she was abandoned by her biological family, Times of India reported. Sherin had a developmental disability and didn’t have the language skills of a typical 3-year-old child.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, we were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse. To love each other well is to love our children well.",What happened when my daughter saw me kiss my wife,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/what-happened-when-my-daughter-saw-me-kiss-my-wife.html

By Peter Berkowitz, The Wall Street Journal



News broke last week about possible Russian wrongdoing in the U.S., and it didn’t involve the Trump campaign. The Hill reported that in 2009 the FBI “gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States.”

The FBI kept that information from Congress and the public, the Hill reported, even as Hillary Clinton’s State Department in 2010 approved a deal that transferred control of more than 20% of America’s uranium supply to a Russian company. The Hill also reported the FBI had documents showing that during this period Russia engineered the transmission of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation.

The FBI director at the time: Robert Mueller, now special counsel in charge of investigating “Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election and related matters.” The revelations can only heighten anxieties about Mr. Mueller, the FBI and the rule of law.

The special counsel’s open-ended mandate covers not only “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump” but also “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.”

Because Mr. Mueller has interpreted his mandate expansively, his effort may become the most politically disruptive federal investigation of our young century—more than the FBI’s investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s private email server and mishandling of classified information, more than Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald’s investigation into the 2003 disclosure of CIA employee Valerie Plame’s identity.

A close inspection by The New York Times found significant discrepancies in the photographs that may be explained by an effort to use image-manipulation software to doctor at least one of the images.

Both the photograph released by the U.S. and the one provided by Afghanistan depict Tillerson and Ghani seated at the front of a windowless room, flanked by their delegations.

However, the image released by Afghanistan does not include either the military-style digital clock or the large fire alarm that appear directly above Tillerson and Ghani in the photograph produced by the U.S. government, The Times reported. And in the Afghan photograph, the room is much more brightly lit.

According to an image expert cited by the Times, there is “no question” the Afghan photo was altered. The giveaway, the expert told The Times, is that whoever apparently doctored the Afghan image did not entirely remove the power cord that led to the clock and fire alarm in the U.S. photograph.

The question remains: Why would Afghanistan’s government manipulate a routine photograph of a visiting dignitary?

After Tillerson’s meeting with Ghani on Monday, the American Embassy and Ghani’s office released a statement claiming that the two men had met in Kabul. But the Times noted that the meeting actually occurred at Bagram, the U.S. military base more than thirty miles from Afghanistan’s capital.

Removing the military-style clock and large fire alarm might have been an attempt by Afghanistan’s government to conceal the meeting’s location. By claiming that Tillerson and Ghani were in Kabul and not a fortified military base, the Afghan government can project strength and advance a positive narrative about the country's security.

Neither Ghani nor Tillerson’s office has provided an explanation for the discrepancy in the images, or why the American Embassy signed off on the statement claiming the meeting was in Kabul.",Mysterious discrepancies spotted In Tillerson photographs with Afghanistan president,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/23/mysterious-discrepancies-spotted-in-tillerson-photographs-with-afghanistan-president.html

AC/DC acknowledged Young’s passing on their Twitter account, saying, “Without his help and guidance there would not have been an AC/DC.”

No location or cause of death were reported.

Young was born Nov. 6, 1946, in Glasgow, Scotland. After emigrating with his family to Sydney in 1963, Young made a splash as guitarist and principal songwriter for the Easybeats, a wildly popular Beatles-styled unit. They enjoyed several top-10 singles in their home country, including “She’s So Fine,” “Wedding Ring” and “Sorry.” They burst into international prominence with the smash “Friday On My Mind,” co-written with bandmate Harry Vanda, which reached No. 16 in the U.S. in early 1967.

Further stateside success eluded the band, which split in 1969. However, Young’s Easybeats material went on to be championed internationally by such acts as Australia’s Divinyls and INXS, David Bowie (who included “Friday On My Mind” on his 1973 covers album “Pin Ups”) and such punk-era American acts as the Plimsouls and the Three O’Clock.

During the early ‘70s, Vanda and Young became Australia’s most prominent producing duo, helming the first five studio albums by AC/DC, which featured Young’s siblings, lead guitarist Angus and rhythm guitarist Malcolm, behind lead vocalist Bon Scott. They produced the band’s 1975 debut set “High Voltage” and its four successors, which featured such early staples of the band’s repertoire as “Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap,” “Whole Lotta Rosie” and “Let There Be Rock.” They also worked with contemporaneous Aussie hard rock acts like Rose Tattoo and the Angels.

In 1976, Young and Vanda returned to performing with the pseudonymous studio project Flash and the Pan. The overtly quirky duo reached the U.S. top 100 with their debut single “Hey, St. Peter,” while Grace Jones covered the pair’s “Walking in the Rain.”

Young retired from the music business in the late ‘90s, but returned to the studio in 2000 to produce AC/DC’s album “Stiff Upper Lip,” which reached No. 3 in Australia and No. 7 in the U.S.

The show's format pivoted to focus on victims of the shooting, as well as those recovering from hurricanes and wildfires, with a night of somber tributes, inspirational anthems and voices lifted in harmony.

Aldean, who was on stage at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when the shooting occurred Oct. 1, stood side-by-side with the night's other award winners, including Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, Chris Stapleton and Keith Urban, to dedicate the night to music fans. The honorees did not accept awards or give speeches as usual, but some chose to perform or other musicians performed in their honor.

""We've been tested beyond our worst nightmare these past few months,"" Aldean said during the live broadcast from Nashville, Tennessee. ""Heartbroken doesn't even begin to describe how some of us feel. But we have proven time and again in this country that we have the power to overcome anything that threatens our way of life, or our freedom.

Andra Day kicked off the awards show with her anthem ""Rise Up,"" in a beautiful harmony duet by Little Big Town. Then Lee Ann Womack, Danielle Bradbury and rapper Common joined them for a performance of ""Stand Up For Something.""

""On this night when we usually celebrate a year of music, we also want to celebrate a year of incredible human spirit, the spirit we see in our fans every night,"" Stapleton said.

""So in some small way we want to thank you for your resolve and perhaps lift your spirits for just a moment,"" Urban said.

The names of the 58 victims from Las Vegas were listed during an in memoriam segment, along with the names of Petty, Gregg Allman, Glen Campbell, Don Williams and Troy Gentry.

The women accused of carrying out a daring February assassination on Kim Jong Un’s half-brother in a Malaysian airport returned to the scene of the crime Tuesday, retracing the steps that led them to allegedly smear the banned VX nerve agent onto Kim Jong Nam’s face, killing him.

Siti Aisyah, 25, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, donned bullet-proof vests and handcuffs as they walked and then wheeled through Kuala Lumpar airport with more than 200 police officers, dozens of journalists and an entourage of court officials surrounding them. The Indonesian and Malaysian women are accused of killing Kim on Feb. 13, though they have insisted they were duped by North Korean agents and believed they were playing a prank for a reality television show. They have pleaded not guilty to the charges.

WHO KILLED KIM JONG UN'S HALF BROTHER? HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW

Police clad in black uniforms, many carrying rifles and wearing masks, formed a security ring around the group while they toured the bustling airport for more than three hours. The women were placed in wheelchairs after they complained of exhaustion. Aisyah’s lawyer, Gooi Soon Seng, told reporters the chaotic visit to the airport helped verify the location and surroundings of the murder scene, Reuters reported.

“The CCTV footages were taken from various cameras and various places, so from there we couldn’t get a complete picture on how [the incident] took place,” Gooi said at a news conference.

Prosecutor Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin told The Associated Press before the tour began he believed the visit would “strengthen the prosecution’s case.”

""I believe the visit to the crime scene will help strengthen the prosecution's case because it will allow the judge to follow the women's trail and understand why they took that path,"" he said.

The group visited the terminal’s restaurant where Aisyah was seen on surveillance video in February meeting with an unidentified man, and the restroom where the women flocked to after spreading the deadly chemical on Kim’s face. At one point, the women appeared emotional and one broke down in tears.

The airport visit comes on the third week of Aisyah and Huong’s trial, who both face the death penalty if convicted of the crime. Huong was wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with “LOL” when she lunged at Kim at the airport. Traces of the poison were discovered on the women’s clothes and Huong’s fingernails.

But prosecutors believe the women didn’t act alone. Four other North Korean men are suspected of recruiting and supplying Aisyah and Huong for the brazen assassination, but they have since vanished.

The involvement of the missing North Korean agents have fueled South Korea’s spy agency’s claim that the attack was part of a careful plot set up by the North Korean despot to kill a brother he reportedly never met. Kim Jong Nam was not known to be actively seeking influence over his younger brother but had spoken out publicly against his family's dynastic rule. Since he was also the eldest son of the late leader Kim Jong Il, he could have been seen as a potential rival to Kim Jong Un.

KIM JONG UN KILLED UNCLE, HALF-BROTHER OVER 'CHINA COUP PLOT,' REPORT SAYS

A report by Japanese magazine Nikkei Asian Review in August also claimed Kim Jong Un “flew into a rage” when he discovered his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, was planning a coup with Chinese officials to overthrow him. The half-brother would then step in to lead the Hermit Kingdom in his place. Jang was assassinated in 2013 and branded “worse than a dog” and “despicable human scum.”

Kim Jong Un still has other siblings — two sisters and a brother — who are still alive, according to the BBC. Little is known about the siblings. He recently promoted his sister, Kim Yo Jong, to become an alternate member of the politiburo, a top decision-making body. Kim Jong Chul is reportedly an Eric Clapton megafan.

The Land Rover Defender is also British, is also rugged, and is also quite adept at wading through water. Now these two icons have come together.

Barbour sells a line of Land Rover Defender-inspired clothing, and to help promote it in the United States the company has turned to East Coast Defender to build a Barbour-inspired Defender. East Coast Defender, based in Orlando, Florida, is a company that specializes in turning stock Defenders into bespoke, sometimes wild creations.

The latest creation is dubbed Project Barbour.

The special Defender features the stock 3.5-liter Rover V-8, which has been rebuilt to ensure smooth operation and is paired to a 5-speed manual transmission. The interior is where you’ll find most of the custom treatments. For example, the designers have added saddle brown leather accented by Barbour's famous Tartan pattern. There’s also a Momo steering wheel, a Kenwood audio system, and numerous “Barbour” labels. Barbour’s logo also features on the rear canopy which in this case is a soft-top from Rovers North.

Monday, Maryland become the 23rd state to adopt anti-boycott rules. It is urgent for Congress to pass the bipartisan Israel Anti-Boycott Act, a vital tool to prevent anti-Jewish discrimination and to protect American businesses from blackmail.

On Oct. 16 the CEO of Israel’s telecom giant Bezeq, Stella Handler, posted a two-page letter that her company had received from the office of U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, a Jordanian prince. The letter, dated Sept. 22, lists Bezeq’s operations that allegedly are ensnared by a resolution of the U.N. Human Rights Council.

The Human Rights Council is the U.N.’s top human rights body. The menacing letter neglects to mention the human rights credentials of the 35 Council members that passed the resolution back in 2016 – states like Algeria, Bolivia, Burundi, China, Cuba, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

More specifically, the Council resolution calls for the production of a “database” of businesses that “directly or indirectly” are connected to Israeli settlements. In effect, the “database” is a blacklist. High Commissioner Zeid has said he intends to release the database/blacklist by the end of this year.

The letter Zeid sent to Bezeq is not unique. According to leaks to various news agencies, Zeid has sent similar letters to 150 companies around the world. Thirty of such companies are said to be American.

Recipients reportedly include Coca-Cola, Caterpillar, Priceline.com, TripAdvisor, and Airbnb, as well as Israeli businesses such as pharmaceutical leader Teva, the country’s two largest banks (Hapoalim and Leumi), the bus company Egged, the national water company Mekorot, and other major Israeli businesses in addition to Bezeq.

At its core, BDS is a response to the failure of Arab combatants to defeat Israel on the battlefield. Destroying Israel through economic isolation is perceived by Israel’s enemies as Plan B.

Zeid’s letter dictates that the company has 60 days to send “information or comments…confirming, clarifying or contesting” the U.N.’s account of the company’s business dealings in any area that the U.N. has decided is Arab territory. The information received, continues the U.N. letter, will “enable adequate consideration of whether there are reasonable grounds for inclusion of Bezeq in the database, as per the Council resolution.”

In plain English, companies face public censure – driven by the U.N.’s vast global network – unless they comply with the demands of Zeid and the Human Rights Council.

Bezeq’s CEO vowed her company would not be intimidated, and declared that Bezeq would “protect the rights of all our customers without discrimination” regardless of their religion, race, gender or where they lived.

How right she was.

The fact is that U.N. Human Rights Council resolutions have the legal status of toilet paper.

But that isn’t stopping the high commissioner from huffing, puffing and bluffing. And alarmingly, until now, nearly all the recipients of these letters appear to have been playing by the blackmailer’s rules. The “don’t you dare go to the police” routine has thrown a cone of silence around the whole affair.

Shareholders, employees, and communities that depend on the well-being of the blackmailed companies – along with the elected representatives responsible for serving these constituents – have been kept in the dark.

Bezeq has brought the U.N. moves out of the shadows. This is the most egregious boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) campaign directed against Israel ever launched by the United Nations. It is not the first, but it is the most audacious.

At its core, BDS is a response to the failure of Arab combatants to defeat Israel on the battlefield. Destroying Israel through economic isolation is perceived by Israel’s enemies as Plan B.

The two goals of the U.N. blacklist are first, devastating Israel’s economy, and second, circumventing a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For according to existing legal agreements, ownership of disputed territories is to be determined through negotiations between the parties – not by U.N. bullies.

Asked about the blacklist on Aug. 22, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert, told reporters: “We have made clear our opposition regarding the creation of a database of businesses…and we have not participated and will not participate in its creation or contribute to its content.”

The response is disingenuous. Last December the Obama administration agreed in the General Assembly to the overall U.N. regular budget, knowing full well that the budget included funding for the blacklist. Hence, American taxpayers are currently paying 22 percent of all the costs of creating the blacklist. That sounds like a “contribution” to those of us who don’t speak diplo-babble.

Which brings us to the bottom line.

U.N. High Commissioner Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein is the last person on Earth who should be telling American companies how to run their businesses.

And on the off-chance that U.N. letterhead makes American CEOs nervous, they need to be reminded that they owe their allegiance to American law and public policy.

It is past midnight for Congress and President Trump to step up and answer this U.N. assault on American businesses and our ally Israel.

Three simple, morally unambiguous steps will do it:

- The expeditious adoption of the Israel Anti-Boycott Act.

- The immediate resignation of the United States from the specious Human Rights Council

- The refusal to send Prince Zeid another penny.","Protect American business from blackmail – Congress, pass the Israel Anti-Boycott Act",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/24/protect-american-business-from-blackmail-congress-pass-israel-anti-boycott-act.html

Pots and pans sure look gleaming and gorgeous coming out of the box, but after years of spaghetti dinners, roast chickens and holiday feasts, a well-used cookware arsenal is bound to show its age. Make your sauté pans, stockpots and skillets worthy of the hanging pot rack once again with a little elbow grease and a couple of easy-to-find, mild cleaning products (including ketchup, of all things) — and learn how keep the glow once you've got it back.

Below you'll find daily care and stain removal tips for cookware made of stainless steel, copper, enameled cast iron and more.

Good practices for all cookware. No matter the type of cookware, it is best to wash it as soon as possible after cooking (cleaning as you go is ideal), and use the least abrasive cleaning method you can. Washing by hand is always preferable, even for pots and pans that claim to be dishwasher safe. Washing by hand will prevent the scratches and discoloration that can happen in a dishwasher over time.

The tips and techniques that follow are good general guidelines, but you may also want to check the manufacturer's suggestions. If your cookware is under warranty, using the wrong cleaning product can void your agreement, so it pays to do your homework.

Stainless Steel

Everyday care: Ideally, wash your stainless steel pots and pans by hand soon after use, using regular dish soap. That said, stainless steel pans are one of the few types that can handle a trip through the dishwasher — so if you are in a rush, don't worry about tossing it in with the dishes. Regular cleaning in the dishwasher may create spots or a cloudy surface.

Stain removal: To brighten up cloudy or spotty stainless steel, rub the surface with a rag dampened with white vinegar. To treat stains on the bottom of the pan caused by high heat, sprinkle a gentle scouring powder (like Barkeeper's Friend) on a wet sponge or rag to create a paste, and rub it onto the stained area. Rinse with water.

Copper

Everyday care: Wash copper pots and pans by hand, using warm, soapy water.

Stain removal: Bring that lustrous finish back to discolored copper by covering your pan with ketchup (yes, ketchup) or lemon. Let the ketchup sit on your pan for at least 10 minutes, then rub the discoloration away with a rag or sponge. Rinse clean with warm water.

Enameled Cast Iron

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool before washing it — a sudden temperature change may crack the enamel. Soak the pan in warm water first, then use a soft sponge and a mild dishwashing detergent to clean it. Do not use abrasive scrubbing pads, as they can damage the enamel finish.

Stain removal: Treat discoloration on the outside of the pan using a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. For tough stains on the inside surface, fill the pan with white vinegar and water and bring to a boil on the stovetop. Turn off the heat and let the pan soak with the vinegar solution, then wash as usual.

Hard Anodized Aluminum

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool completely before washing it, and never place a hot pan in cold water, which can cause warping. Wash by hand, using a mild dishwashing detergent and warm water — putting your hard anodized pans in the dishwasher may void your warranty.

Stain removal: For stains on the outside only, use a paste of baking soda or a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. Rinse with warm water.

Nonstick

Everyday care: Use low to medium heat only — higher temperatures can permanently damage nonstick pans. Wash promptly with a soft sponge and warm, soapy water. If scratches or flakes begin to appear on the nonstick surface of your pan, recycle or toss it immediately. Otherwise those flakes will end up in your food ... not something you want to happen!

Stain removal: On the outside only, try using a paste of Barkeeper's Friend or a similar scouring powder.

Cast Iron

Initial seasoning: When you buy a new cast iron pan, wash it by hand in warm, soapy water. Dry the pan with a towel, then put it in a 300-degree oven for about five minutes to dry it completely — even a bit of remaining moisture can cause rust to form on cast iron pans. Next, using a paper towel, rub about a tablespoon of olive or vegetable oil over the surface of the pan, inside and out. Wipe away excess oil — you are aiming for a thin coat. Put the pan in a 300-degree oven for an hour, let it cool, then rub it all over with a clean rag.

Everyday care: Never use soap on your cast iron pan. Promptly after each use, wipe out the pan using a paper towel and a bit of oil. If food is stuck on, run the pan under hot water and scrub the food off with a soft brush or plastic scouring pad — remember, no soap! Soap will remove the seasoning, which is what creates that wonderful nonstick surface.

Stain removal and long-term care: For really tough, stuck-on food, boil water in your pan on the stovetop for a few minutes, then clean it as usual. Reseasoning occasionally will help maintain the finish.

Clay Pot

Everyday care: Most clay pots must be soaked in water for 15 to 30 minutes before each use. Always place your clay pot in a cold oven so the pot can come up to temperature gradually. Do not use your clay pot on the stovetop or under a broiler, and never put a hot pot on a cold surface — any sudden temperature changes can break it.

Clean it promptly, using a paste of baking soda; rinse with warm water. Soap is not recommended for unglazed clay pots, though you may be able to use a mild soap on clay pots that have been glazed; check with the manufacturer.

Stain removal: Try leaving a paste of baking soda on the discolored area for at least 10 minutes, then wipe away and rinse with water. Do not use abrasive sponges or harsh cleaning products on a clay pot.",Essential cleaning tips for the 7 most popular cookware materials,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/essential-cleaning-tips-for-7-most-popular-cookware-materials.html

October is an exciting month for the family. Even if you or your kids aren’t into the haunted part of Halloween, you can still embrace the festivities of fall, warmth and togetherness. Encourage your kids to exercise their imagination and creativity with these Halloween-themed crafts that everyone can participate in.

1. Family Portrait Pumpkins

Skip the mess of carving pumpkins this year by investing in some good old fashioned chalk. Simply paint a circle on each pumpkin with chalkboard paint. You’ll probably have to apply at least three coats of paint. Then, draw a self-portrait using a piece of chalk. Voila!

2. Colorful Garland

Before kids jump in the pile of leaves this weekend, encourage them to collect a few especially vibrant ones. Press the leaves in a book for a couple of hours while the kids continue to play outside. Once they’ve been flattened, show your children how to clip the leaves to a string with miniature clothespins and find spots to hang them throughout the house together.

3. Harvest Vignettes

Look to nature’s bounty for easy decor ideas. Arrange apples, pears, pumpkins, squash and gourds in baskets throughout your kitchen and dining areas. Having easy access to fruits will also promote healthy eating for your family this season.

4. Candy Laboratory

First, gather vases, jars and dishes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Then fill each container with colorful treats, like candy corn, marshmallows and of course candy eyeballs. Challenge your family members to come up with a creative new name for each candy. Crows bones, zombie zingers and pumpkin teeth are excellent examples. Arrange the jars neatly on a tray or turn a bar cart into a wonderful candy buffet.

5. Candy Corn Checkerboards

A checkerboard made from a placemat can be quickly rolled up and easily tucked away. Cut a 1½-inch square from cardstock paper to make a stencil. Start at one edge of the square and paint every other square. Precise placement and straight lines aren’t necessary in this project, which makes it great for kids. Small imperfections can even give the game a rustic or quirky look. You can use candy corn or small plastic spiders as game pieces.

6. Gothic Deskscape

Fall break is the perfect time to take a break from work and transform your home office into a spooky showcase. Open a dictionary and lay a magnifying glass on the definition of “Halloween”. Stack a pile of literature to display your favorite fall titles, like The Tell-Tale Heart or Harry Potter. Swap out a desk lamp’s lightbulb for one with an orange glow or purple hue, and don’t forget an inkwell and quill pen!

7. Mantel Accessories

Fireplace mantels are the go-to spot for any holiday decor. Find wooden display letters at your local craft store to spell out “boo” or another ghastly term above the hearth. Place a mini pumpkin or two and add some candles. A stack of books and a vase of bare branches are also great ideas.

8. Stylish Spider Webs

Tulle is great for wrapping accessories, draping over doorways and even dressing up the bushes. Don’t overlook the nooks and crannies though. This fabric is even more effective in small corners of a room since that’s where spiders hang out most anyway. You might even have to dust off a few real webs before making your own.

9. Window Decals

Shadows and silhouettes can be extra spooky this time of year. Use your interior lighting and the long dark nights to your advantage by decorating windows with DIY decals. Sketch large outlines of your favorite Halloween characters on fade-resistant paper. Then cut out your witches, skeletons, bats, cats or ghosts and tape them to the inside of your home’s windows.

10. Dip-Dyed Baskets

Prepare for trick-or-treaters this year by sprucing up a traditional candy basket. Fill a plastic container (larger than your basket) with semigloss paint. Place the basket in the paint and push down until all sides are covered to your desired height. Let the basket sit overnight on an elevated rack you don’t mind getting dirty, like an old cookie sheet. Reuse this basket all year long as stylish storage!",10 DIY Halloween decorations for all ages,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/10-diy-halloween-decorations-for-all-ages.html

Americans need to understand the association between excess body weight and cancer risk.
We continue to collect and analyze data to better understand these latest trends in cancer, obesity, and risk factors.","Cancer used to be one of the scariest words a patient could hear from a doctor. Then decades of better prevention, detection and treatment helped drive cancer death rates down. It’s often been redefined as a chronic disease that can be managed or even avoided altogether. The strides we’ve made against cancer are a profound victory for America’s health, but the country’s growing overweight and obesity problem threatens to drive us back to the days when cancer was a word you had to whisper.

New research in CDC’s latest Vital Signs report reveals that nearly all cancers associated with overweight and obesity are on the rise. Only the colorectal cancer rate – down 23 percent since 2005 – is going in the right direction, thanks to effective screening and awareness efforts. But alarmingly, rates for the 12 other cancers associated with overweight and obesity have actually risen seven percent in the last decade. That is a disappointing turn, especially when compared to cancers not associated with excess body weight, which dropped 13 percent during the same period.

We must act now before we risk losing the important gains we’ve made against cancer over the last three decades. I know it won’t be easy. One of the things I worry about is knowing that two out of three adults weigh more than recommended in this country, yet fewer than half of Americans know being obese increases their risk of cancer. I believe this is one of the reasons more than half a million people are diagnosed with cancers related to excess weight each year, as CDC’s new Vital Signs reports.

There are few health preventions that offer better value than avoiding weight gain. We already know obesity is behind many of the things that commonly kill us and our loved ones, such as heart disease and stroke. Now we know the association between obesity and cancer is even greater.

There are few health preventions that offer better value than avoiding weight gain.

Excess weight changes the body, increasing certain hormones and levels of inflammation that can lead to cancer. This is why we must do more to raise awareness about the association of obesity to cancer – especially among children and at-risk populations. Anyone who has ever tried to lose weight knows obesity is much easier to prevent than reverse, so it is critical that we help children adopt healthy habits before they ever become overweight.

The new research also reveals disparities in those who suffer most from cancers associated with overweight and obesity. Among women, these cancers account for 55 percent of all cancer diagnoses, compared to only 24 percent among men. In addition, these cancers varied by race. Blacks had the highest rate (186.5 per 100,000), followed by whites (170.9 per 100,000), American Indian/Alaska Natives (162.5 per 100,000), Hispanics (150.6 per 100,000), and Asian/Pacific Islanders (128.4 per 100,000). And, two out of every three people diagnosed with these types of cancers are aged 50-74 years.

The good news is that we can do a lot to turn these alarming trends around. But it will take public health, health care providers, schools, communities, workplaces, and families all working together. Americans need to understand the association between excess body weight and cancer risk. We need to encourage people to make the right choices, including eating right, being physically active, and getting cancer screenings as recommended. And, of course, people need to avoid using tobacco to prevent both cancer and other serious health conditions.

At the federal level, we are funding community programs that promote healthy eating and physical activity. We continue to collect and analyze data to better understand these latest trends in cancer, obesity, and risk factors. And we’re developing and promoting dietary and physical activity guidelines to help Americans make informed health choices.

As a doctor, and a former state health commissioner, I’ve seen how often obesity becomes the gateway to serious health problems in people. We must not let it be the gateway to cancer making a comeback in America.",CDC: America's obesity epidemic is helping cancer make a comeback,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/24/cdc-americas-obesity-epidemic-is-helping-cancer-make-comeback.html

The admission is in; the sentence awaits us. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl admitted deserting his Afghan post and endangering fellow troops. By all accounts this is the most serious betrayal of presidential authority in my life time.

In 2014 President Obama attempted to cover Bergdahl with the achievement of a war hero, even inviting his Idaho based parents to the Rose Garden to celebrate news of his release. President Obama pointed out at the time that five Taliban leaders were freed from Guantanamo so that Bergdahl could be released from captivity. To gild the lily, National Security Adviser, Susan Rice, said Bergdahl served “the United States with honor and distinction.”

Yet everyone in the White House and the Pentagon knew this was a lie with monumental implications. In fact, Army officials refused to list Bergdahl as a POW.

Zelda Perkins was one of at least eight alleged victims to reach settlements and sign NDAs with Weinstein related to years of sexual harassment and abuse .

Perkins came forward Monday, telling the Financial Times that Weinstein’s sexual misconduct began the very first day she ended up alone with him while working out of Miramax’s London office.

“He went out of the room and came back in his underwear,” she recalled. “He asked me if I would give him a massage. Then he asked if he could massage me.”

She and a colleague split a roughly $330,000 settlement in October 1998 and signed agreements barring them from going public with their allegations.

“I want to publicly break my non-disclosure agreement,” said Perkins, who now works for the Robert Fox theater production company. “Unless somebody does this there won’t be a debate about how egregious these agreements are and the amount of duress that victims are put under.”

Perkins’ NDA included a donation to a woman’s charity and her demands that Weinstein undergo therapy “for as long as his therapist deems necessary.” Miramax said it would comply with that clause for three years.

The company also promised that it would appoint three “complaint handlers” to investigate any subsequent sexual harassment complaints.

If a complaint was filed against Weinstein within two years of Perkins’ contract and it resulted in either a settlement of either roughly $46,000 or six months’ salary, Miramax would report it to Disney, its then-owner, or fire Weinstein.

It’s unclear whether Miramax fully abided by the terms of Perkins’ NDA.

Perkins was subjected to years of sexual harassment by her boss.

Weinstein, she said, would often walk around the room naked and asked her to be in the room while he bathed.

“This was his behavior on every occasion I was alone with him,” Perkins said. “I often had to wake him up in the hotel in the mornings and he would try to pull me into bed.”

Perkins said her breaking point came after her colleague came forward “white as a sheet and shaking” with similar allegations while the crew was in Venice for a film festival from in September 1998.

“She told me something terrible had happened. She was in shock and crying and finding it very hard to talk. I was furious, deeply upset and very shocked. I said: ‘We need to go to the police’ but she was too distressed. Neither of us knew what to do in a foreign environment.”

Perkins said negotiating her NDA was “incredibly distressing” and that she was told it ultimately came down to his word against hers.

“I was very upset because the whole point was that we had to stop him by exposing his behavior,” she said. “I was warned that he and his lawyers would try to destroy my credibility if I went to court. They told me he would try to destroy me and my family.”

Perkins said part of the reason why she publicly came forward now — despite potential legal ramifications — is because NDAs should be “regulated in a fair way.”

“I want to call into question the legitimacy of agreements where the inequality of power is so stark and relies on money rather than morality,” she explained. “I want other women who have been sidelined and who aren’t being allowed to own their own history or their trauma to be able to discuss what they have suffered. I want them to see that the sky won’t fall in.”

She added, “My entire world fell in because I thought the law was there to protect those who abided by it. I discovered that it had nothing to do with right and wrong and everything to do with money and power.”

Physicist Stephen Hawking's doctoral thesis is finally available for anyone to see.

FOX's Krystin Goodwin has details:

Professor Stephen Hawking's 1966 thesis on 'Properties of Expanding Universes' went up on the University of Cambridge's website early Monday.

Physics fans were so excited, tens of thousands rushed to download it, causing the site to crash. Hawking's doctoral thesis was already the most requested item in the university's library. Previously folks had to pay about $86 to scan a copy.

The 75-year-old professor said he hoped folks would not be ""disappointed."" And said he hoped making it available to all would ""inspire people around the world to look up at the stars and not down at their feet; to wonder about our place in the universe and to try and make sense of the cosmos.""

""And I can say that I've seen some of the worst bleeding disorders, and I've never seen them sweat blood.""","Italian doctors were left bewildered when a woman was admitted to the hospital for “sweating blood” from her face and hands, a new case published in a medical journal on Monday revealed.

The woman, 21, would spontaneously bleed with no visible lesions on her skin, according to the case report published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. The woman has been suffering from the mysterious disorder for three years and would start bleeding spontaneously in her sleep or while she was physically active.

It’s unclear what triggered the bleeding, but the bleeding intensified when she was under stress. The episodes would last between one to five minutes.

The women told doctors she suffered major depression and panic disorder because of the condition and became “socially isolated.” She has no history of psychosis, the report said.

The doctors floated different theories on what caused the condition, including factitious disorder, when someone would deceive others by appearing sick. However, she continued to spontaneously bleed after she was prescribed paroxetine and clonazepam for her depression and anxiety order.

They ultimately concluded she had hematohidrosis, an uncommon disease that would cause “spontaneous discharge of ‘blood sweat’ through intact skin.” Blood can also come out of areas that don’t have sweat glands.

It’s still unclear what causes the “blood sweat.” Dr. Michelle Sholzberg, co-director of the Hemophilia Comprehensive Care program at St. Michael's Hospital, told CBC News the case is the “most unusual.”

""I can say with clarity that I've never seen a case like this — ever,"" Sholzberg told CBC News. ""And I can say that I've seen some of the worst bleeding disorders, and I've never seen them sweat blood.""

We’ve got good news for you — scientists are working on an injection that blocks your hunger for junk food.

And in doing so it can help you slim down by stopping you from eating as much.

The injection has also been shown to reduce the risk of obesity-related diseases like diabetes in fat monkeys — more good news!

A protein, called GDF15, has been found to naturally regulate body weight in humans and animals.

When it’s injected into mice it made them eat less and lose weight, reports New Scientist.

Several teams have tried to use it as an obesity treatment before but were unsuccessful as the protein broke down too quickly in the body for it to have any effect.

But now a team from pharmaceutical company Amgen has found a way to make it last longer in the body.

They used an antibody and added it to the protein, which made it take longer to break down.

When it was used on obese monkeys it made them eat 40 percent less.

And when given weekly injections they lost an incredible 10 percent of their body fat over a six week period.

They were also more tolerate of glucose, or sugar, which meant their risk of developing type 2 diabetes was reduced.

There are currently five obesity medications that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

These have been found to help patients lose an average of seven to 12 percent of their body weight over the course of a year.

But none have been as successful as the new drug looks like it could be.

Study author Murielle Véniant said the GDF15 hybrid injection did not appear to cause any adverse side effects in monkeys.

Clinical trials will be needed to see how the drug works on people before it is available.

Other studies have found that when injecting the protein into mice it binds to neurons in the stomach and intestines and sends signals to the part of the brain responsible for appetite.

That same part of the brain is responsible for your cravings.

The protein caused mice to keep food in their stomachs for twice as long, making them feel fuller for longer.

First came reports that the FBI knew about a Russian bribery plot tied to nuclear energy interests in the U.S. well before the Obama administration OK’d a mining company sale to a Russian firm, giving it partial control over American uranium reserves.

Then came a report that Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation is looking at the dealings of Tony Podesta, a powerful Democratic lobbyist and the brother of former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.

Meanwhile, Fusion GPS, the firm behind the controversial anti-Trump dossier, has gone to court to block Congress from getting its bank records after its representatives pleaded the Fifth in a Capitol Hill appearance last week.

Hillary Clinton on Monday brushed off the revival of the uranium deal controversy as “baloney” meant to distract from GOP controversies.

But Republicans beg to differ.

“Now it’s the Democrats who have some explaining to do,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement overnight. “I hope they will cooperate with the investigation, be forthcoming with the American people and I expect the media to cover these new developments with the same breathless intensity that they have given to this investigation since day one.”

NBC News first reported early Monday that Tony Podesta and The Podesta Group are now subjects in the special counsel’s Russia investigation, following inquiries regarding former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s finances.

REPORT: MUELLER PROBE EXPANDS TO TONY PODESTA'S DEALINGS

According to Monday’s NBC News report, Mueller’s team started looking into a Manafort-involved PR campaign for a pro-Ukraine nonprofit reportedly backed by a pro-Russia party; the Podesta Group reportedly was one of many firms that worked on the campaign. According to the report, Mueller’s investigators have since launched a criminal inquiry into whether the company violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which requires people in the U.S. who lobby on behalf of foreign entities to register as foreign agents and disclose their work.

Podesta's firm eventually filed a registration for the work, after the media reported on the business and Congress started asking questions. But in a statement on Monday, a spokesperson for The Podesta Group claimed the company was in compliance -- citing a series of filings dating back years -- and is “fully” cooperating with the special counsel’s office.

“The Podesta Group fully disclosed its representation of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine (ECFMU), and complied with FARA by filing under the lobbying disclosure act over five years ago and within weeks of starting our work,” the spokesperson said. “Any insinuation to the contrary is false. The Podesta Group has fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s office and taken every possible step to provide documentation that confirms compliance with the law.”

Meanwhile, new details have emerged since last week on the 2010 approval of the sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company. The U.S. was involved because the sale gave the Russians control of part of the uranium supply in the U.S.

The Hill reported, however, that the FBI had evidence as early as 2009 that Russian operatives used bribes, kickbacks and other dirty tactics to expand Moscow’s atomic energy footprint in the U.S., related to a subsidiary of the same Russia firm.

Several Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill are now asking questions about how the deal was approved the next year by an inter-agency committee. Among them, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. – who has raised concerns about the Uranium One transaction since 2010 – wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Oct. 19 that he’s “extremely disheartened and disturbed” by reports indicating the government approved the deal despite the DOJ having “evidence of corruption by Russian nuclear energy officials in the United States.”

He asked for “all documents” disclosed by the department to the committee – of which the DOJ was a member – concerning the investigation prior to the approval.

The Hill has since reported that as Hillary Clinton began her role as secretary of state, a Russian spy posing as an accountant became close to a Democratic donor in hopes of gathering intelligence on Clinton’s State Department. (The spy was later arrested.) Lawmakers have also revived questions that first surfaced in 2015 about payments to both Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation from “interested parties.”

Addressing the matter Monday on C-SPAN, Clinton said “it’s the same baloney they’ve been peddling for years, and there’s been no credible evidence by anyone. In fact, it’s been debunked repeatedly and will continue to be debunked.”

The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee said these issues are just part of the “distraction and diversion” from the investigation into Russian meddling and possible coordination with Trump associates in last year’s election.

“The closer the investigation about real Russian ties between Trump associates and real Russians … the more they want to just throw mud on the wall,” Clinton said.

But White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday that the only “collusion” is on the other side.

“If you want to see collusion with anyone and the Russians, look no further than the Democrats. Look no further than Tony Podesta and the Clinton crew,” she said.

On another front, Fusion GPS has gone to court in an attempt to block a House committee subpoena for the company’s banking records.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., had issued a subpoena on Oct. 4 for those TD Bank records. But, according to documents reviewed by Fox News, Fusion is seeking a ""temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction"" to block the release of those records.

Fusion's filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia claimed that complying with the subpoena would ""deny Plaintiff and its clients their rights to free speech and expressive association as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution.""

House Republican lawyers countered Monday in their own court filing that the company is a for-profit business and not an “association” engaged in protected activity under the First Amendment. “Plaintiff’s argument is too clever by half, and an insult to the efforts of true advocacy organizations,” they said.

Fusion has refused to tell congressional committees who paid for the dossier or reveal its sources.

Lighter glass is used for the windows and some of the extras in the cabin, including the door handles, are removed. The resulting weight is 3,142 pounds.

Inside, you’ll find sport seats with “911” embroidered in the headrests. The interior trim on the dashboard and doors is in black, as are the new door opener loops (replacing the regular door handles), and for the steering wheel the designers have used Porsche’s Sport GT unit which integrates the driving modes selector. Buyers can also choose to fit bucket seats, which like the rear-wheel steering are being made available for the first time on a Carrera variant. Note, with this option Porsche also removes the rear seats.

The engine is the latest Carrera’s 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged flat-6. Peak output is 370 horsepower and 339 pound-feet of torque, the latter of which is available in a broad range between 1,750 and 5,000 rpm. A manual with short throw shifter is standard but buyers have the option of a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission.

With the manual, you’re looking at 0-60 mph acceleration in 4.3 seconds. The DCT drops this to 4.0 seconds. The top speed is 182 mph with the manual and 180 mph with the DCT.

Some online skeptics blasted the country singer's Monday night performance as a ""Dancing with the Stars"" guest judge.

Twain has bravely discussed her career and life- threatening battle with Lyme disease.

Twain joined ""DWTS"" regular judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Len Goodman and Bruno Tonioli on the panel to critique the movie-themed night -- but she had some fans confused.

Some suggested she looked unrecognizable, while others weren't happy with her comments and several people charged she was awkward in her use of the score paddles.

Twitter user Kara Meade wrote, ""Not only does #ShaniaTwain not look like Shania Twain, shes equally confused with the #DWTS25 paddle. Hope her votes don't count.""

A user named Erika asked about Twain, ""Who is this imposter?""

Another viewer chimed in, ""Who is this person? It’s clearly NOT #ShaniaTwain. Do we need to send out a search party?""

Another user called the appearance strange.

After ""Property Brothers"" star Drew Scott performed a Paso Doble with his partner Emma Slater on ""DWTS,"" Twain seemed to stammer. She paused during some of her critiques during the live show, including that of former ""Malcolm in the Middle"" star Frankie Muniz and his dance partner Witney Carson.

Fans also accused Twain of lip-synching on ""DWTS"" in a performance of her new single, ""Soldier,"" from the new movie ""Thank You for Your Service,"" about returning veterans.

""I don’t think I’ve ever seen anybody lip sync so bad,"" ScArY Cassie shuddered on Twitter.

Twain has said in the past she wondered if she would ever sing again after contracting Lyme disease.

""It can kill you. And if it doesn't kill you, it can give you a seriously degenerated quality of life for the rest of your life,"" she said.

The country singer had to undergo extensive vocal re-training to get her singing voice back and said she sounded like a ""dying cow"" before experiencing improvement.

Twain persevered and has a new album out; she has said, ""I feel triumphant….it's like a small miracle really for me personally.""

Buddy Rich was a relentless perfectionist whose life revolved around making great music and entertaining audiences everywhere. Arguably the greatest drummer that ever lived, this self-taught genius never practiced but instead, played with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey and Artie Shaw, always making these giants better.

We already know obesity is behind many of the things that commonly kill us and our loved ones, such as heart disease and stroke.
But it will take public health, health care providers, schools, communities, workplaces, and families all working together.
Americans need to understand the association between excess body weight and cancer risk.
We continue to collect and analyze data to better understand these latest trends in cancer, obesity, and risk factors.","Cancer used to be one of the scariest words a patient could hear from a doctor. Then decades of better prevention, detection and treatment helped drive cancer death rates down. It’s often been redefined as a chronic disease that can be managed or even avoided altogether. The strides we’ve made against cancer are a profound victory for America’s health, but the country’s growing overweight and obesity problem threatens to drive us back to the days when cancer was a word you had to whisper.

New research in CDC’s latest Vital Signs report reveals that nearly all cancers associated with overweight and obesity are on the rise. Only the colorectal cancer rate – down 23 percent since 2005 – is going in the right direction, thanks to effective screening and awareness efforts. But alarmingly, rates for the 12 other cancers associated with overweight and obesity have actually risen seven percent in the last decade. That is a disappointing turn, especially when compared to cancers not associated with excess body weight, which dropped 13 percent during the same period.

We must act now before we risk losing the important gains we’ve made against cancer over the last three decades. I know it won’t be easy. One of the things I worry about is knowing that two out of three adults weigh more than recommended in this country, yet fewer than half of Americans know being obese increases their risk of cancer. I believe this is one of the reasons more than half a million people are diagnosed with cancers related to excess weight each year, as CDC’s new Vital Signs reports.

There are few health preventions that offer better value than avoiding weight gain. We already know obesity is behind many of the things that commonly kill us and our loved ones, such as heart disease and stroke. Now we know the association between obesity and cancer is even greater.

There are few health preventions that offer better value than avoiding weight gain.

Excess weight changes the body, increasing certain hormones and levels of inflammation that can lead to cancer. This is why we must do more to raise awareness about the association of obesity to cancer – especially among children and at-risk populations. Anyone who has ever tried to lose weight knows obesity is much easier to prevent than reverse, so it is critical that we help children adopt healthy habits before they ever become overweight.

The new research also reveals disparities in those who suffer most from cancers associated with overweight and obesity. Among women, these cancers account for 55 percent of all cancer diagnoses, compared to only 24 percent among men. In addition, these cancers varied by race. Blacks had the highest rate (186.5 per 100,000), followed by whites (170.9 per 100,000), American Indian/Alaska Natives (162.5 per 100,000), Hispanics (150.6 per 100,000), and Asian/Pacific Islanders (128.4 per 100,000). And, two out of every three people diagnosed with these types of cancers are aged 50-74 years.

The good news is that we can do a lot to turn these alarming trends around. But it will take public health, health care providers, schools, communities, workplaces, and families all working together. Americans need to understand the association between excess body weight and cancer risk. We need to encourage people to make the right choices, including eating right, being physically active, and getting cancer screenings as recommended. And, of course, people need to avoid using tobacco to prevent both cancer and other serious health conditions.

At the federal level, we are funding community programs that promote healthy eating and physical activity. We continue to collect and analyze data to better understand these latest trends in cancer, obesity, and risk factors. And we’re developing and promoting dietary and physical activity guidelines to help Americans make informed health choices.

As a doctor, and a former state health commissioner, I’ve seen how often obesity becomes the gateway to serious health problems in people. We must not let it be the gateway to cancer making a comeback in America.",CDC: America's obesity epidemic is helping cancer make a comeback,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/24/cdc-americas-obesity-epidemic-is-helping-cancer-make-comeback.html

The hagfish is more than 300 million years old and it lives out of sight in the deepest depths of the ocean. Without a jaw, this spineless ancient creature scavenges the ocean floor for food.

It feasts on dying animals from the inside out and although it is snakelike, hagfish do not have scales. To defend itself, the hagfish unleashes slime (similar to slime featured in ""Ghostbusters"") - and it is this slime that has military scientists excited.

WILL COMBAT VEHICLES USE URINE FOR FUEL?

Spider silk has long been pursued as an option to building ultralight weight and ultra-strong body armor. Hagfish slime threads are almost as strong and light as spider silk, but could prove far easier to harvest in the necessary large volumes to be practical.

Made of mucus and threadlike fibers, the clear slime’s fibers are ultra-strong and flexible.

Will synthetic slime become the basis of new body armor for the military? Bottled into a spray to protect Navy divers? Scientists are unlocking these and more potential from this unique fish.

Hagfish slime and its unique capabilities are being studied and pioneered by scientists like the Navy team at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division in Florida.

PODCAST: HOW TO SPOT DANGER ZONES IN YOUR DAILY LIFE WITH THIS ELITE MARINE CORPS RAIDER AND STAR OF DISCOVERY’S TRAILBLAZERS TV SHOW

Slime defense

Hagfish defend themselves by oozing slime on their threats, some of which risk slime suffocation.

When combined with seawater, the slime rapidly expands and creates huge volumes. One mere foot-long hagfish can possess hundreds of miles of slime thread inside and can expand 10,000 times in volume in milliseconds.

Even a shark attempting to eat a hagfish will find it hard to succeed and will battle a face and gills full of slime – risking slime suffocation.

To clean off their slime, hagfish tie themselves in knots.

How could it be used for body armor?

The slime is simple, but incredibly strong with very interesting properties with great defense potential.

When the wet fibers are stretched and dried out, the fibers become a sort of soft thread that could be woven to create a range of apparel materials.

Scientists believe that this hagfish slime, and its ultra-strong stretchy thread, could be the key to next-level bullet-proof vests.

Just how strong is hagfish slime? Hagfish may not be pretty, but they’ve got staying power and this is in large part down to its ability to defend itself and survive. The hagfish have been around for centuries during extinction after extinction - even outlasting the dinosaurs.

In fact, dinosaurs became extinct 60 million years ago, but hagfish date back 330 million years.

WILL A SINGLE BOMB STOP NORTH KOREA?

How will they farm slime?

Any team working to crack slime applications will need to figure out how to reproduce the slime and at high volumes.

Natural hagfish reproduction still remains a mystery. Hagfish breeding in captivity has not yielded success, therefore hagfish farms are an unlikely solution. Artificial reproduction in a lab is more probable.

Spider silk has been similarly pursued for its strength and posed similar practical problems in terms of replicating at a mass level. Hagfish slime proteins are smaller and so could prove easier to replicate.

Remarkably, the Navy team has already replicated the material and can now focus on applying the synthetic slime to provide military advantages.

Potential applications

Replicated slime could replace petroleum based-products like Kevlar. Similar to spider silk, there is potential it could eventually provide enhanced strength at a lighter weight than current bulletproof armor.

Beyond bulletproof vests, there are other interesting military applications.

For example, special operations could find creative tactical uses for a material that can instantly change, massively expand and ensnare or “clog.”

Different delivery systems are being explored. Just as the slime protects the fish, the synthetic slime could potentially be developed into a spray to protect divers against sharks.

An artificial slime also means that it can be tinkered with and modified. Scientists are working on enhancing the synthetic slime’s stickiness- its ability to attach to various surfaces. Enhancing the slime’s stability in different environments is another potential objective that would expand its potential utility for the military.

Another application could be applying the slime as a ship coating to prevent barnacles and algae from attaching.

On the homeland, there’s lots of other potential such as using the slime to protect firefighters.

What’s next?

Eventually, some products derived from the hagfish slime could work their way into uses outside of the military.

Dunford acknowledged that nearly three weeks after the attack, many questions remain.
Independent of the events surrounding the attack, Johnson's death and his family's ordeal have triggered a major political row.","The U.S. special forces unit ambushed by Islamic militants in Niger didn't call for help until an hour into their first contact with the enemy, the top U.S. general says, conceding many questions linger about the assault that killed four American troops and triggered a political brawl.

Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters the American people and the fallen soldiers' families deserve answers about the deadly ambush in the West African nation. But Dunford said Monday that he still lacks many details about how the attack unfolded.

At a Pentagon news conference, Dunford asked for patience as the military continues to investigate the incident.

Dunford's description of the assault, however, underscored how long the mid-morning attack dragged on, and that it was many hours before the wounded and killed were evacuated. He said that ""within minutes"" after the unit called for assistance, a U.S. drone was moved into position overhead, providing surveillance and full-motion video. He declined to say if it was armed, but said it did not fire.

Another hour went by before French fighter jets arrived, but the wounded weren't taken out until later in the afternoon when French helicopters arrived along with additional Niger troops. The bodies of three Green Berets who were killed were evacuated that evening, he said.

""I make no judgment as to how long it took them to ask for support,"" Dunford said. ""I don't know that they thought they needed support prior to that time. I don't know how this attack unfolded. I don't know what their initial assessment was of what they were confronted with.""

A battle-hardened commander, Dunford recalled situations when, ""you're confronted with enemy contact, your initial assessment is you can deal with that contact with the resources that you have.""

He added that under the military's rules, U.S. forces only accompany Niger troops on missions in that area when ""the chances of enemy contact are unlikely."" But he also agreed that it is an inherently dangerous area, and U.S. forces are there as part of a training and advising mission to help local Niger forces learn to deal with the various al-Qaida and IS-linked groups operating in the region.

Dunford acknowledged that nearly three weeks after the attack, many questions remain. They include whether the U.S. had adequate intelligence, equipment and training, whether there was an accurate assessment of the threat in that area, and how the U.S. troops became separated in the fight. Another question is why it took so long to recover the body of a fourth American serviceman, Sgt. La David Johnson, who was missing for two days before his body was found by Niger troops and turned over to the U.S.

Dunford said the 12-member Army special forces unit had accompanied 30 Nigerien forces on a reconnaissance mission to an area near the village of Tongo Tongo, about 85 kilometers north of the capital on Oct. 3. They ended up spending the night there, and when they were returning to their base the next morning, they encountered about 50 enemy fighters traveling by vehicle, carrying small arms and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.

Dunford said the White House was notified by the operations center when it became clear that at least three U.S. forces had been killed, and more direct notifications were made when officials realized that Johnson was missing. When he received the call about Johnson, Dunford said he made a ""20-second"" call to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and got immediate approval to bring the ""full weight of the U.S. government to bear"" in order to locate the missing soldier.

Independent of the events surrounding the attack, Johnson's death and his family's ordeal have triggered a major political row. After Johnson's body was returned to the U.S., President Donald Trump said at one point that he had done more than any of his predecessors to honor the dead and console their families.

Members of Congress are also demanding answers. Last week, Sen. John McCain, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, even threatened a subpoena to accelerate the flow of information from the administration. Asked about the congressional complaints, Dunford said that if lawmakers believe they aren't getting enough information, ""then I need to double my efforts to provide them with information.""

He said the military will try to wrap up its investigation into the incident as quickly as possible. The FBI is also investigating, but that probe likely focuses on counterterrorism and any information or intelligence related to threats to the U.S.

Dunford defended the broader American mission in Niger, saying U.S. forces have been in the country intermittently for more than two decades. Currently, some 800 U.S. service members are supporting a French-led mission to defeat the Islamic State, al-Qaida and Boko Haram in West Africa.

""We are back to conducting operations as normal,"" he said.

The tractor-trailer’s overturn wasn’t the first on the Washington highway this week.

A semi-truck on Monday also rolled over at the Blewett Pass, leaving 56,000 pounds of Red Delicious apples strewn across the immediate area, KOMO News reported.

A new Washington state distracted driving law — mainly focused on handheld electronics — that was implemented by Gov. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., in July was meant to crack down on sidetracked drivers.

But sniping between Trump and top GOP senators could turn the Capitol Hill luncheon into a food fight.

Trump, still trying for a major legislative win after Republicans failed this summer to pass legislation to dismantle ObamaCare, has called on the Republican-led Congress to pass tax reform by Thanksgiving.

The Senate passed a related budget plan last week -- but specifics on the tax legislation are still being worked out, including over tax rates and provisions for popular benefits like pretax 401(k) contributions.

But any hopes of total unity after the Senate repeatedly failed on ObamaCare faced another setback Tuesday morning when Tennessee GOP Sen. Bob Corker reignited his simmering feud with Trump.

“I would just like him to leave it to the professionals for a while and see if we can do something that’s constructive,” Corker said on ABC’s “Good Morning America” about overhauling the federal tax code for the first time in roughly three decades.

Trump responded with a series of vitriolic tweets including: “Isn’t it sad that lightweight Senator Bob Corker, who couldn’t get re-elected in the Great State of Tennessee, will now fight Tax Cuts plus!”

The president appeared last week to settle his differences with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., emerging from a White House meeting to say his relationship with the Senate Republican leader is “better than ever.”

However, Arizona Sen. John McCain and other GOP senators still appear at odds with Trump, who essentially needs consensus from the 52-member Senate Republican conference to get a simple 51-vote majority to pass tax reform and most other legislative proposals.

The Senate narrowly passed its blueprint plan last week, 51-49. And McCain cast the deciding no vote in August that nixed the chamber’s ObamaCare repeal-and-replace bill.

McCain on Sunday took a swipe at Trump when he said on C-SPAN that the U.S. military has “drafted the lowest income level of America and the highest income level found a doctor that would say they had a bone spur.""

Trump had five draft deferments, including one granted after he submitted a physician's letter stating he suffered from such spurs in his feet.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Tuesday he expects his chamber to have its final tax bill ready by the Thanksgiving holiday but that the Senate is going to be “a little slower,” which would mean the final package would likely be ready by year’s end.

“At the end of the day … Bob’s going to vote for tax reform because he knows it’s in the best interest of Americans. So put this Twitter dispute aside,” Ryan also said about the Corker-Trump feud.

Among the issues still being debated in the effort to overhaul the tax code is the future of employee retirement plans known as the 401(k)s.

Congress is looking for ways to raise revenue as part of an overhaul plan. And one of the methods reportedly under consideration is to curtail how much pretax money workers can contribute to their 401(k) and similar accounts. Such a move would strike at a way that tens of millions of Americans use to save for retirement.

The suggestion has already run into some resistance, even if it isn't an official policy proposal.

Trump said Monday in a tweet: ""There will be NO change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!""

Another key issue is the new corporate tax rate, which is now at 35 percent and that the administration would like to have at 20 percent.

In addition, congressional Republicans are debating whether the new tax code will have a fourth tax bracket, for the country’s highest wage-earners.

A pair of twins who were formerly connected at the head are sitting up on their own and continuing to hit crucial developmental milestones after undergoing separation surgery in June. Abby and Erin Delaney, of Mooresville, North Carolina, have spent all 15 months of their lives at Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania, Fox 29 reported.

Erin was recently discharged, but Abby remains in recovery.

“Nearly five months after separation, we are happy to announce that both Erin and Abby Delaney are doing well as they continue to recover from this very complex surgery,” Gregory Heuer, the girls’ neurosurgeon who co-led the 30-member surgical team, said.

WOMAN'S 'MISSING' IUD TURNS UP IN HER BLADDER

Heather and Riley Delaney were told that their daughters were craniopagus conjoined twins during a prenatal ultrasound. It’s considered the least common type of conjoined twins, and only accounts for about 2 percent of cases, Fox 29 reported. They were born 10 weeks early via C-section in July 2016, and weighed 2 lbs., 1 ounce each.

“Although this has been a long journey, with many ups and downs, Riley and I are thrilled to see how well the girls are doing today,” Heather said, according to Fox 29. “We are so grateful for the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia team, and for the support and encouragement that our families, our friends and the community have given us during this long journey.”

While the hospital has performed 24 separation surgeries, the girls were considered the earliest separation of craniopagus conjoined twins ever recorded, Dr. Jesse Taylor, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon said.

“We know that children heal better and faster the younger they are, therefore our goal for Erin and Abby was separation as soon as possible with minimum number of surgeries,” Taylor said, according to Fox 29.

The twins will require additional surgeries in the future to address missing bone areas at the tops of their heads and to minimize scarring, but for now, they are working on crawling and practicing rolling over.

“The girls are inspiring,” Heather said. “As their parents, it is very neat for Riley and me to have a front row seat to this and watch them overcome these incredible obstacles. We cannot wait to see what their future holds.”",Formerly conjoined twins thriving after separation surgery,https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/10/23/formerly-conjoined-twins-thriving-after-separation-surgery.html

Monday, Maryland become the 23rd state to adopt anti-boycott rules. It is urgent for Congress to pass the bipartisan Israel Anti-Boycott Act, a vital tool to prevent anti-Jewish discrimination and to protect American businesses from blackmail.

On Oct. 16 the CEO of Israel’s telecom giant Bezeq, Stella Handler, posted a two-page letter that her company had received from the office of U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, a Jordanian prince. The letter, dated Sept. 22, lists Bezeq’s operations that allegedly are ensnared by a resolution of the U.N. Human Rights Council.

The Human Rights Council is the U.N.’s top human rights body. The menacing letter neglects to mention the human rights credentials of the 35 Council members that passed the resolution back in 2016 – states like Algeria, Bolivia, Burundi, China, Cuba, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

More specifically, the Council resolution calls for the production of a “database” of businesses that “directly or indirectly” are connected to Israeli settlements. In effect, the “database” is a blacklist. High Commissioner Zeid has said he intends to release the database/blacklist by the end of this year.

The letter Zeid sent to Bezeq is not unique. According to leaks to various news agencies, Zeid has sent similar letters to 150 companies around the world. Thirty of such companies are said to be American.

Recipients reportedly include Coca-Cola, Caterpillar, Priceline.com, TripAdvisor, and Airbnb, as well as Israeli businesses such as pharmaceutical leader Teva, the country’s two largest banks (Hapoalim and Leumi), the bus company Egged, the national water company Mekorot, and other major Israeli businesses in addition to Bezeq.

At its core, BDS is a response to the failure of Arab combatants to defeat Israel on the battlefield. Destroying Israel through economic isolation is perceived by Israel’s enemies as Plan B.

Zeid’s letter dictates that the company has 60 days to send “information or comments…confirming, clarifying or contesting” the U.N.’s account of the company’s business dealings in any area that the U.N. has decided is Arab territory. The information received, continues the U.N. letter, will “enable adequate consideration of whether there are reasonable grounds for inclusion of Bezeq in the database, as per the Council resolution.”

In plain English, companies face public censure – driven by the U.N.’s vast global network – unless they comply with the demands of Zeid and the Human Rights Council.

Bezeq’s CEO vowed her company would not be intimidated, and declared that Bezeq would “protect the rights of all our customers without discrimination” regardless of their religion, race, gender or where they lived.

How right she was.

The fact is that U.N. Human Rights Council resolutions have the legal status of toilet paper.

But that isn’t stopping the high commissioner from huffing, puffing and bluffing. And alarmingly, until now, nearly all the recipients of these letters appear to have been playing by the blackmailer’s rules. The “don’t you dare go to the police” routine has thrown a cone of silence around the whole affair.

Shareholders, employees, and communities that depend on the well-being of the blackmailed companies – along with the elected representatives responsible for serving these constituents – have been kept in the dark.

Bezeq has brought the U.N. moves out of the shadows. This is the most egregious boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) campaign directed against Israel ever launched by the United Nations. It is not the first, but it is the most audacious.

At its core, BDS is a response to the failure of Arab combatants to defeat Israel on the battlefield. Destroying Israel through economic isolation is perceived by Israel’s enemies as Plan B.

The two goals of the U.N. blacklist are first, devastating Israel’s economy, and second, circumventing a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For according to existing legal agreements, ownership of disputed territories is to be determined through negotiations between the parties – not by U.N. bullies.

Asked about the blacklist on Aug. 22, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert, told reporters: “We have made clear our opposition regarding the creation of a database of businesses…and we have not participated and will not participate in its creation or contribute to its content.”

The response is disingenuous. Last December the Obama administration agreed in the General Assembly to the overall U.N. regular budget, knowing full well that the budget included funding for the blacklist. Hence, American taxpayers are currently paying 22 percent of all the costs of creating the blacklist. That sounds like a “contribution” to those of us who don’t speak diplo-babble.

Which brings us to the bottom line.

U.N. High Commissioner Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein is the last person on Earth who should be telling American companies how to run their businesses.

And on the off-chance that U.N. letterhead makes American CEOs nervous, they need to be reminded that they owe their allegiance to American law and public policy.

It is past midnight for Congress and President Trump to step up and answer this U.N. assault on American businesses and our ally Israel.

Three simple, morally unambiguous steps will do it:

- The expeditious adoption of the Israel Anti-Boycott Act.

- The immediate resignation of the United States from the specious Human Rights Council

- The refusal to send Prince Zeid another penny.","Protect American business from blackmail – Congress, pass the Israel Anti-Boycott Act",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/24/protect-american-business-from-blackmail-congress-pass-israel-anti-boycott-act.html

Rose, now 69, served as a medic in the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group, an elite division of the Special Forces. It was so secret that, for more than four decades, he never spoke about it to anyone – not even the people he served with.

Those that served with him, however, never forgot the bravery he showed during a four-day mission, called “Operation Tailwind,” in the landlocked country in September 1970.

Rose, then a sergeant, ran through a hail of gunfire to treat more than 50 soldiers who were fighting the North Vietnamese Army – using one hand to hoist wounded men onto his back while he fired on the enemy with his other hand.

In spite of his own injuries, he didn’t sleep for days to make sure all 16 American soldiers deployed with him made it home.

They did.

Forty-seven years later, Rose was commemorated for his ""extraordinary selfless service"" on Monday when he received the Medal of Honor during a ceremony with President Trump at the White House.

""For many years the story of Mike's heroism has gone untold. But today we gather to tell the world of his valor and proudly present him with out nation's highest military honor,"" Trump said.

The president recounted the details of Rose's time in battle before awarding him the medal, recognizing ""the true American hero that he is.""

Following the ceremony, Rose told reporters that he considered the award to be ""a collective medal"" for all of the servicemen who fought in the battle and was ""convinced that they have been recognized for the great service that did to this country.""

""This is our medal, it's not mine. We all earned it,"" Rose said.

Rose enlisted in April 1967 at the urging of his father – to avoid getting drafted by the Navy or the Marine Corps. In 1968, he graduated as a Special Forces medic and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group before being reassigned to the 46th Special Forces Company headquartered in Thailand a year later.

It was there, in April 1970, that Rose was assigned to the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group. The unit’s real purpose was to join forces with local fighters to attack North Vietnamese forces in Laos – officially off limits for combat, USA Today reported.

On Sept. 11, 1970, the unit – comprised of Americans, Vietnamese and indigenous paramilitary Montagnard personnel – were sent deep into enemy territory. As soon as they made contact, two Americans and two Montagnards were wounded, and Rose jumped into action.

The Army said the gunfire got so intense Rose had to crawl from position to position to treat the wounded.

“The actions that Mike performed during that operation, you can’t imagine it, you can’t put it into words,” said retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley, who was in charge of the unit, on Friday. “We were going into an area that U.S. forces had not been in….Had we not come out the day we were extracted, we probably would not have left.”

During the extraction of the troops, one of the helicopters crashed to the ground, injuring many on board and killing one.

Ignoring his own injuries – sustained earlier in the mission – Rose re-entered the destroyed helicopter to pull a solider to safety. McCarley said the soldier shouldn’t have survived, but did, thanks to Rose.

“I had the opportunity to meet with him [years later]…it had not affected him in any way,” he added. “Mike did a miraculous job.”

Despite the many who were wounded, only three men died during the four days of almost constant gunfire deep in enemy territory.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more. I’m proud of him, [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.” - Retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley

“My job was to focus on the individuals that were hurt,” he said on Friday. “When you focus, you don’t concern yourself on getting hurt or killed. You just have to do your job and keep going down the road.”

For his bravery, Rose earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation’s second-highest award for valor.

But what happened during those four days in Laos were never mentioned.

“When we left MAG SOC, the unit did not exist. If anyone asked me, I was going to be a mail clerk during the Vietnam War,” Rose said.

That is until 1998, when a report by CNN and Time magazine revealed Rose and the soldiers in Operation Tailwind were sent to Laos to capture American defectors and had used deadly Sarin nerve gas during the attack.

A Pentagon investigation dismissed the report, saying the mission focused on collecting intelligence on the logistics of the North Vietnamese army and destroying their supplies.

While the story of Rose’s valor has now led to a Medal of Honor, however, the covert operations by the U.S. in Laos are still obscured as somewhere “deep in enemy-controlled territory.”

McCarley said he was disappointed Rose had previously only received the Distinguished Service Cross, saying he deserved the top honor.

For more than 40 years, McCarley and others in the military and government fought to get the award upgraded.

Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more,” McCarley said. “I’m proud of him [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.”

Rose, who was joined by his wife, Margaret Rose, and their children and grandchildren -- as well as 10 of the men who served with him in Laos -- said he considers it a privilege to be part of the small group of service members who have received the Medal of Honor.

“We cannot forget these men and women who served this country valiantly,” he said.","Army Capt.

It has been over three years since Russia illegally annexed Crimea. Yet the international community has barely lifted a finger to restore Ukraine’s sovereignty over Russian-occupied territory in Crimea and the Donbas.

Instead, we have seen half-hearted gestures and “tough talk” with very little to back it up. While America has imposed strong sanctions on Russia, our European allies have failed to match our resolve.

Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has kept thousands of his troops in eastern Ukraine, sustaining a deadly war of attrition that has hobbled Ukraine’s government, economy and society.

We can and must do more.

Currently, Putin is advocating for a United Nations “peacekeeping” mission in the Donbas, the area of eastern Ukraine occupied by Russian troops and Kremlin-backed separatist forces. Putin says the mission will protect European monitors sent to observe the conflict, but the truth is more sinister.

Ukrainians now look to the United States as their only hope for a successful future of peace and prosperity.

Putin is trying to use the creation of the peacekeeping mission to force de facto recognition of the separatist quasi-states in eastern Ukraine. To set up the peacekeeping mission, Putin wants the Ukrainian government and U.N. forces to engage directly with separatist leaders, even though Moscow calls the shots. It’s a transparent attempt to secure increased diplomatic recognition for Russian-armed, Kremlin-controlled militias. Ukraine has rejected the idea out of hand.

America must speak up louder in opposition to Putin’s twisted attempt to use U.N. peacekeepers to achieve his own strategic interests. We’ve heard from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about how critical it is that we give our full support to Ukraine.

I worked with Hillary Clinton and her team when she came to Yalta to attend Ukrainian businessman and philanthropist Victor Pinchuk’s European Strategy Conference in 2013 to deliver this exact message just a few months before Putin illegally annexed Crimea.

Ukrainians now look to the United States as their only hope for a successful future of peace and prosperity.

In working for Pinchuk, I gained a first-hand understanding of how important America is to Ukrainians when it comes to beating back Russia, promoting democracy and advancing Western values.

Ukrainians have earned our support. They show their thankfulness for ongoing American efforts in surprising ways.

For example, Victor Pinchuk’s son, Roma – along with Ukrainian executives Fadi Hraibi and Daniel Valk – have come to America’s aid in areas of Houston hit hard by Hurricane Harvey.

The three Ukranians are heading the Interpipe Harvey Cleanup mission in conjunction with the relief organization Samaritan’s Purse. They’re working in low-income areas of Houston devastated by Harvey to clear trees from homes and yards, put tarps on roofs and remove mud from homes. Their focus is helping Houstonians who don’t have natural disaster insurance and the elderly.

We are lucky to have allies and friends like this.

Roma Pinchuk’s work in Houston is an example of Ukraine making the effort to secure a true partnership with America – an effort Ukrainians have been making for decades. Their work sends a loud message that Ukrainians are committed to our success and are partners in a relationship that must be reciprocal.

America faces a world where fewer and fewer countries share our values and where democracy is under attack all over the globe. Ukraine is a rare bright spot. Government leaders, businesspeople, activists and voters all enthusiastically support integrating their country and society with the West, right in Putin's back yard.

America ought to reciprocate the good will of the Ukrainian people and the generosity of individuals like Pinchuk by strongly supporting Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Putin's neo-Soviet imperialism, as well as assisting its transition to democratic governance and a free economy.

When it comes to standing up to Putin at the U.N. it costs America nothing to deploy our veto power on behalf of Ukraine. But to Ukrainians, it means everything.",America must stand up to Putin's aggression and support Ukraine,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/23/america-must-stand-up-to-putins-aggression-and-support-ukraine.html

The account created a stir earlier this year when Gizmodo reported that it likely belonged to Comey. At the time the account used the handle @projectexile7. The account’s name has remained Reinhold Niebuhr.

TWITTER AIMS TO BOOST USER SAFETY, UPDATES ITS RULES

While the origins of the @FormerBu handle are unclear, Reinhold Niebuhr was an American theologian who died in 1971. Comey wrote a thesis on Niebuhr while a student at the College of William and Mary.

The account’s first tweet was sent out on March 30 – a meme of Will Ferrell saying “actually I’m not even mad – that’s amazing” and a link to the FBI jobs website.

A second tweet – a photo of the Hudson River, was sent out on Oct. 18. A photo of Little Round Top, Gettysburg, was tweeted the following day with the message “good place to think about leadership and values.”

A photo tweeted on Oct. 20 showed a figure in a cornfield accompanied by the message “Good to be back in Iowa.”

With speculation again mounting that Comey was behind the account, a photo of migrating birds was tweeted Sunday. “Watching migrating white pelicans in Iowa thinking about Niebuhr’s Serenity Prayer,” read the accompanying message.

Comey was finally unmasked on Monday when he tweeted an image of himself standing on any empty road, apparently in Iowa. “Goodbye Iowa. On the road home. Gotta get back to writing. Will try to tweet in useful ways,” he wrote.

President Trump took a swing at Comey last week when he tweeted that the former FBI director “totally protected Hillary Clinton” in the private email case. Trump made the attack following the release of FBI documents that show Comey began drafting a statement on the Clinton email investigation months before interviewing key witnesses and Clinton herself.

The NFL players kneeling during the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” in football stadiums across the country are engaging in protests based on false claims and misleading media reports that give the impression that police are killing African-Americans at a rate greater than they are killing whites.

In addition, my own research shows that contrary to some claims, blacks have good relations with police they deal with in their neighborhoods.

After Colin Kaepernick, then a quarterback with the San Francisco 49ers, started kneeling during the playing of the national anthem 13 months ago, he said: “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color…. There are bodies in the street and people (police) are getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”

However, a study last year by Harvard Economics Professor Roland Fryer, who is black, concluded that for the Houston police department: “On the most extreme use of force – officer-involved shootings – we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account.” Unfortunately, he doesn’t have the race of the officer doing the shooting and the data for just one police department doesn’t allow the investigation of police policies.

Using four national databases of crime statistics representing confrontations between police and civilians in many parts of the U.S., the study did find that blacks were more likely than whites to be treated with some lower level of force by police during confrontations – such as being handcuffed, pushed to the ground or pepper-sprayed. That is a legitimate issue that merits further study. But it’s not the same as saying racist white cops are – to use Kaepernick’s inflammatory phrase – “getting away with murder” of African-Americans.

Love Saxa, a group that advocates for marriage between a man and a woman, is under fire from LGBTQ groups on campus, PRIDE and Queer People of Color, according to The Hoya, Georgetown’s student publication. A pro-choice student senator filed a notice on September 25, arguing Love Saxa’s definition of marriage and relationships violates university standards by fostering hatred or intolerance.

The notice, which would identify Love Saxa as a hate group, could strip Love Saxa of its funding and bar it from using campus facilities. The group receives $250 a year from the Georgetown, which is the country’s oldest Catholic university.

Love Saxa petitioned for a delay because it was not given enough time to defend itself and had not seen the notice, according to the Catholic News Agency. A hearing, originally set for Monday, is now scheduled for Oct. 30.

The controversy began last month, when the president of Love Saxa, Amelia Irvine, published an op-ed titled “Confessions of a College Virgin” in The Hoya, talking about abstinence before marriage and the group’s definition of marriage.

“Love Saxa’s definition of marriage does not include same-sex couples, as we believe that marriage is a conjugal union on every level – emotional, spiritual, physical and mental – directed toward caring for biological children. To us, marriage is much more than commitment of love between two consenting adults.”

The student newspaper then targeted Love Saxa in an editorial titled “Defund Intolerance.”

“Love Saxa does not deserve the benefit of university recognition” and “should be ineligible for any university benefits,” The Hoya wrote, claiming the group’s “mission advocates against equal rights for the LGBTQ community” and “fosters intolerance.”

Love Saxa put out a statement condemning the Hoya’s actions as “intolerant of the values and beliefs” of Georgetown.

“Love Saxa exists to promote healthy and loving relationships at Georgetown,” said Irvine. “Our definition of ‘healthy relationships’ and ‘sexual integrity’ is synonymous with those of the Catholic Church, and therefore those of Georgetown University. If the Hoya wishes to call Love Saxa a hate group, we anticipate that it will not be long until other traditional religious groups are labeled ‘hate groups’ as well.”

The university released a statement that did not appear take sides -- just yet.

“As a Catholic and Jesuit institution, Georgetown listens deeply and discerningly to the plurality of voices that exist among our students, faculty, and staff and is committed to the care of each member of our community,” said a Georgetown University spokesperson. “As the students on the Student Activities Commission review the complaint regarding Saxa formally submitted by individual students on Oct. 22, we encourage all students to follow our community commitment to open dialogue and mutual respect.”

Irvine is optimistic that the university will uphold the group’s right to exist, but issued a warning to her fellow classmates.

Three people were shot and killed in the quiet neighborhood of Seminole Heights. The shootings all took place within a one mile radius, a fact that has led police to believe that there is a link between the killings.

All three victims, who didn’t know each other, rode the bus and were alone when they were shot on the street. None of the victims were robbed.

Nearly two weeks after the first shooting, police are left with no motive and no suspect. With so much uncertainty surrounding the killings, some residents are locking themselves inside their homes.

Business owners have reported a downturn in recent days.

Maria Maldonado, who lives near the scene of two of the shootings, refused to let her 7-year-old son play in the yard.

“We don’t open the door or nothing. A lot of people are scared. I’m scared for my son, for the neighborhood,” she said.

Majed Forahaa, a local store owner, said he has a concealed carry permit for a handgun that he keeps with him while has working. When it’s time to walk to his care the end of his night, Forahaa says he holds it in his hand.

Police have even had to escort children to class on Monday as parents weigh their fear against sending their children to school.

Even the city bus altered its usual route to avoid making a pattern.

Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn said the city has put dozens of officers in the area around the clock. The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also helping, he said.

“There aren’t a lot of facts, or evidence, yet, but it’s not for lack of Tampa Police Department trying. We literally have put bodies out here by the dozens. We’re going to find this guy and we’re not leaving this neighborhood till we do,” Buckhorn said.

Police said 22-year-old Benjamin Mitchell was the first person killed on Oct. 9. Two days later, 32-year-old Monica Hoffa was killed in a vacant lot. Anthony Naiboa, 20, was shot and killed Oct. 19.

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

RELATED: Grow Them Under a Canopy for Shade

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

Turn the lights down. If you’ve got absolutely no time to get ready for guests, you can try this last-ditch technique: Turn the lights down low, or close the blinds. The darker the room, the less dirt your guests will see. The darkness will hide many of your sins.",8 tricks to speed-clean your house before unexpected guests arrive,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/8-tricks-to-speed-clean-your-house-before-unexpected-guests-arrive.html

Even more shocking was the response I received from my granddaughter, who is a nurse at a hospital in San Antonio, Texas.
All the jobs I have ever had, there has been sexual harassment.
i.e., sexual harassment.","While trying not to indulge in schadenfreude over those hypocritical Hollywood elites who’ve claimed to stand for “women’s rights,” only to be accused of sexually harassing them, I noticed “#MeToo” trending on Twitter. At #MeToo, women who have been sexually harassed are invited to post their experiences and many have done so, including four female U.S. senators.

I asked my adult daughter and oldest granddaughter if they had ever encountered sexual harassment. My daughter said at a previous job her boss “invited” her to sit on his lap. She refused and no longer works there.

Even more shocking was the response I received from my granddaughter, who is a nurse at a hospital in San Antonio, Texas. I reprint her account (with her permission) because it contains a lesson, not only for men, but for the male-dominated culture.

I will not use her last name to protect her from more bad experiences. Crystal writes:

“It’s a tough subject to speak on. Personally, I have been sexually harassed many times in my workplace and generally speaking. All the jobs I have ever had, there has been sexual harassment. I am a nurse and have had doctors make inappropriate comments. I’ve felt very uncomfortable and have tried to ignore or ‘laugh off’ the remarks for fear of retaliation. These are doctors I have needed orders from for my patients. The last thing I need is for them to be mad at me. So, when I see the ones who have made inappropriate remarks, I smile and say hello. I’m sure if I ever went to report (them) it would somehow be turned on me like I did something wrong. So I just ‘laugh it off’ and move on, because, just like Harvey (Weinstein), doctors are the ones bringing in the big bucks and are granted immunity for certain things ... i.e., sexual harassment.

“As a mother … I think it’s important to teach our children to stick up for themselves always, and it’s never OK for someone to harass them in any way. It’s equally important for boys and girls to learn this. It’s important to teach right and wrong and promote what is right ALWAYS.”

“Generally speaking when instances occur outside of work I have stood up for myself, and am then treated as if I am wrong for doing so.”

Commenting on pictures of Hollywood actresses hugging Weinstein, Crystal continues: “I understand why these women are all smiles with this man. He is powerful in their community. He has power over their career. And I’m sure he is the reason they are famous. Like me, and so many others, these women were afraid to speak up and to stand up to this man fearing their livelihood would be negatively affected.

“Females deal with this BS constantly ... it’s never comfortable, especially when you have to continue seeing or working with the person/people. It’s always an awkward situation to be in, especially when the person has a higher position of power.

“As a mother … I think it’s important to teach our children to stick up for themselves always, and it’s never OK for someone to harass them in any way. It’s equally important for boys and girls to learn this. It’s important to teach right and wrong and promote what is right ALWAYS.”

Powerful stuff, but in an age when the lines between right and wrong, good and bad are blurred, if not eliminated, and with culture and opinion polls defining moral standards which are constantly in flux, sexual harassment is only one of many consequences when “societal norms” are obliterated.

Perhaps the best way to address this is to put more women in charge — the right kind of women, like Crystal.","Cal Thomas: #MeToo: My daughter and granddaughter, too",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/24/cal-thomas-metoo-my-daughter-and-granddaughter-too.html

Reality TV star Ksenia Sobchak said she hopes to appeal to the growing number of liberal voters unhappy with Putin’s many years in office.

Opinion polls show Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for nearly two decades, will win reelection comfortably if he decides to seek what would be his fourth term in March.

However, a significant minority of voters accuse him of overseeing a corrupt system that has isolated Russia from the rest of the world.

Many of them have taken part in mass protests organized by Putin critic Alexei Navalny.

Russian officials say Navalny is ineligible to run for president due to a criminal conviction which has left an opening for a genuine opponent.

Sobchak is seen by many as an alternative option to those that have had enough of Putin.

The reality TV star, who has been described by Vogue magazine as the Russian version of socialite Paris and is the daughter of Putin’s former mentor, said she had decided to run because she was tired of the same politicians, including Putin, running year after year.

The 35-year-old said she had the right to run for Russia’s top political job under the country’s constitution, which stipulates that all candidates must be 35 or older.

“I decided to exercise that right because I am against all of those (candidates) who usually exercise that right,” she said.

“When I was 18 and was studying in university, Vladimir Putin became president of Russia. Children who were born that year will go and vote themselves this year. Just think about that.”

But some Russian liberals fear Sobchak’s participation will play into the Kremlin’s hands by splitting the opposition vote.

Sobchak is the daughter of Anatoly Sobchak, the reformist former mayor of St. Petersburg who hired Putin as an official in City Hall in the 1990s.

Sobchak, who died in 2000, became a mentor to Putin. Sobchak’s mother, Lyudmila Narusova, sits in the upper house of the Russian parliament.

Sobchak’s Instagram account, often featuring photographs of her dressed in designer outfits and appearing at glitzy society events, has 5.2 million followers.

After graduating from the prestigious MGIMO University in Moscow, she became a nationwide celebrity when she hosted a Russian reality TV show called Dom 2.

She became active in opposition politics around the time that Putin, in 2012, was reelected to the presidency after stepping down for four years to comply with constitutional term limits.

She appeared at opposition rallies, spoke out against the Kremlin on social media, and recast herself as a news anchor for the Rain broadcaster.",Russia’s version of Paris Hilton runs for president against Putin,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/18/russia-s-version-paris-hilton-runs-for-president-against-putin.html

Gallup reported Friday that 3.5 million fewer people reported having health insurance through the first nine months of this year as Trump’s threats and GOP congressional inaction provoked widespread uncertainty.
The administration attack on health care also includes cutting the ObamaCare enrollment period in half and cutting the advertising budget by 90 percent.
“Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.”You think?","Editor's note: This originally appeared in The Hill.

“If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.”

For years, Republicans used that exaggerated pledge to thrash the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and President Obama for not keeping his promise. Politifact labeled it as “lie of the year” in 2013.

Politifact will have a lot of lies to choose from this year, given the hurricane of falsehoods and broken promises on health care made by President Trump.

Who can forget Trump’s oft-repeated promise that “We will repeal and replace ObamaCare, and we will do it very, very quickly?”

ObamaCare has not been repealed. It has not been replaced. Apparently in Trump-speak, “very, very quickly” means sometime during his tenure in office — or more likely, never.

Trump says he wants to “let ObamaCare implode.” This is far worse than a mountain of lies. This is subversion of an American law by the president.

After all, Republicans had seven years to come up with a plan that they promised would provide insurance to more people, more cheaply and with better protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

Here is another broken Trump promise: “We’re going to have insurance for everybody. We’re going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better.”

Well, we are still waiting.

The Republican House can say they passed a plan, but it was inferior to ObamaCare. It left more Americans uninsured — 20 million more, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) — and pressed lower quality care on those who kept coverage.

But lacking a plan of his own, Trump initially endorsed the House plan and held a Rose Garden press conference to celebrate it as “incredibly well-crafted.”

Within a few weeks, the president admitted the bill was “mean” to people in need of health care.

Now Trump continues to attack ObamaCare — with no realistic plan to replace it.

Steve Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist, told the conservative Values Voter Summit recently that the president is taking action to “blow up those exchanges.”

Trump says he wants to “let ObamaCare implode.”

This is far worse than a mountain of lies. This is subversion of an American law by the president.

Gallup reported Friday that 3.5 million fewer people reported having health insurance through the first nine months of this year as Trump’s threats and GOP congressional inaction provoked widespread uncertainty.

In Pennsylvania, insurance premiums on track for a 7.6 percent hike next year will instead be going up 30 percent thanks to Trump destabilizing the marketplace by ending subsidies to cover insurance for the poor.

The CBO estimates the cost of ending the subsidies will add $6 billion to the deficit in 2018 alone.

The administration attack on health care also includes cutting the ObamaCare enrollment period in half and cutting the advertising budget by 90 percent. And they are cutting money for the Navigator system to help people enroll.

This means fewer healthy people will sign up to balance out enrollment by people with medical needs — a dynamic that will further destabilize the system.

To the extent that the ACA currently has problems, it is the direct result of sabotage by Republican politicians.

Never forget that it was Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio who authored a measure to drain money from “risk corridors” created to protect insurance companies.

The original sin was when GOP governors and state legislatures refused to expand Medicaid, blocking 4 million poor Americans from benefitting from the ACA.

“I would ask what’s conservative about unaffordable premiums,” asked Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. “What’s conservative about creating chaos so millions can’t buy health insurance?”

And the American people want ObamaCare in its current form to work.

A poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation taken earlier this month found that a whopping 71 percent of Americans said the Trump administration should “do what they can to make the current health care law work.”

The same KFF poll found that 51 percent of Americans still have a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and 40 percent have an unfavorable view.

Why is Trump defying the overwhelming majority of Americans who want the law to succeed?

Last week, Alexander, the chairman of the Senate Health Committee, and the ranking member, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., unveiled a bipartisan compromise bill to shore up a key ObamaCare subsidy to benefit low-income Americans for two years.

The bill came in reaction to President Trump’s threats to end these cost sharing reductions (CSRs).

Trump falsely claimed that these were “bailouts” to insurance companies, when they are help for poor people.

“The fact of the matter is the president is trying to sabotage the American health care system, trying to put a gun to the head of our constituents by taking away their health care or raising their costs in order to force us to repeal a bill the American public doesn’t want us to repeal,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Fox News Sunday recently.

The real problem here is that while Trump is playing politics he is treating people in need of health care as collateral damage, a cruel afterthought.

There is one true statement from Trump on ObamaCare that will stand the test of time.

“Now, I have to tell you, it’s an unbelievably complex subject,” he said in February. “Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.”

Then came a report that Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation is looking at the dealings of Tony Podesta, a powerful Democratic lobbyist and the brother of former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.

Meanwhile, Fusion GPS, the firm behind the controversial anti-Trump dossier, has gone to court to block Congress from getting its bank records after its representatives pleaded the Fifth in a Capitol Hill appearance last week.

Hillary Clinton on Monday brushed off the revival of the uranium deal controversy as “baloney” meant to distract from GOP controversies.

But Republicans beg to differ.

“Now it’s the Democrats who have some explaining to do,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement overnight. “I hope they will cooperate with the investigation, be forthcoming with the American people and I expect the media to cover these new developments with the same breathless intensity that they have given to this investigation since day one.”

NBC News first reported early Monday that Tony Podesta and The Podesta Group are now subjects in the special counsel’s Russia investigation, following inquiries regarding former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s finances.

REPORT: MUELLER PROBE EXPANDS TO TONY PODESTA'S DEALINGS

According to Monday’s NBC News report, Mueller’s team started looking into a Manafort-involved PR campaign for a pro-Ukraine nonprofit reportedly backed by a pro-Russia party; the Podesta Group reportedly was one of many firms that worked on the campaign. According to the report, Mueller’s investigators have since launched a criminal inquiry into whether the company violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which requires people in the U.S. who lobby on behalf of foreign entities to register as foreign agents and disclose their work.

Podesta's firm eventually filed a registration for the work, after the media reported on the business and Congress started asking questions. But in a statement on Monday, a spokesperson for The Podesta Group claimed the company was in compliance -- citing a series of filings dating back years -- and is “fully” cooperating with the special counsel’s office.

“The Podesta Group fully disclosed its representation of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine (ECFMU), and complied with FARA by filing under the lobbying disclosure act over five years ago and within weeks of starting our work,” the spokesperson said. “Any insinuation to the contrary is false. The Podesta Group has fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s office and taken every possible step to provide documentation that confirms compliance with the law.”

Meanwhile, new details have emerged since last week on the 2010 approval of the sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company. The U.S. was involved because the sale gave the Russians control of part of the uranium supply in the U.S.

The Hill reported, however, that the FBI had evidence as early as 2009 that Russian operatives used bribes, kickbacks and other dirty tactics to expand Moscow’s atomic energy footprint in the U.S., related to a subsidiary of the same Russia firm.

Several Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill are now asking questions about how the deal was approved the next year by an inter-agency committee. Among them, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. – who has raised concerns about the Uranium One transaction since 2010 – wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Oct. 19 that he’s “extremely disheartened and disturbed” by reports indicating the government approved the deal despite the DOJ having “evidence of corruption by Russian nuclear energy officials in the United States.”

He asked for “all documents” disclosed by the department to the committee – of which the DOJ was a member – concerning the investigation prior to the approval.

The Hill has since reported that as Hillary Clinton began her role as secretary of state, a Russian spy posing as an accountant became close to a Democratic donor in hopes of gathering intelligence on Clinton’s State Department. (The spy was later arrested.) Lawmakers have also revived questions that first surfaced in 2015 about payments to both Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation from “interested parties.”

Addressing the matter Monday on C-SPAN, Clinton said “it’s the same baloney they’ve been peddling for years, and there’s been no credible evidence by anyone. In fact, it’s been debunked repeatedly and will continue to be debunked.”

The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee said these issues are just part of the “distraction and diversion” from the investigation into Russian meddling and possible coordination with Trump associates in last year’s election.

“The closer the investigation about real Russian ties between Trump associates and real Russians … the more they want to just throw mud on the wall,” Clinton said.

But White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday that the only “collusion” is on the other side.

“If you want to see collusion with anyone and the Russians, look no further than the Democrats. Look no further than Tony Podesta and the Clinton crew,” she said.

On another front, Fusion GPS has gone to court in an attempt to block a House committee subpoena for the company’s banking records.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., had issued a subpoena on Oct. 4 for those TD Bank records. But, according to documents reviewed by Fox News, Fusion is seeking a ""temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction"" to block the release of those records.

Fusion's filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia claimed that complying with the subpoena would ""deny Plaintiff and its clients their rights to free speech and expressive association as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution.""

House Republican lawyers countered Monday in their own court filing that the company is a for-profit business and not an “association” engaged in protected activity under the First Amendment. “Plaintiff’s argument is too clever by half, and an insult to the efforts of true advocacy organizations,” they said.

Fusion has refused to tell congressional committees who paid for the dossier or reveal its sources. Two top officials from the political research firm invoked their Fifth Amendment right and refused to answer questions last Wednesday before the same House panel.",Republicans see tables turned as Dems face fresh Russia controversies,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/24/republicans-see-tables-turned-as-dems-face-fresh-russia-controversies.html

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor.

That pretty much tells the story of a Palestinian construction worker in Israel who was taken into custody for posting a picture of himself on Facebook last week.

The photo showed the man leaning against a bulldozer, smiling, with a cigarette and a cup of coffee in one hand. Along with the picture, he wrote the words “Good morning” in Arabic.

And — score another win for Murphy’s Law — that’s where everything went wrong.

FAKE NEWS ADS ARE REPORTEDLY POPPING UP ON FACT-CHECKING WEBSITES

As reported in Haaretz, there is just a one-letter difference in the Arabic language between a colloquial phrase for “Good morning” and another for “Attack them” — and Facebook’s automatic translation algorithms picked the wrong one when they converted the words into Hebrew.

When Israeli police were alerted to a picture of a man standing next to a bulldozer along with the words “Attack them” in Hebrew, they became understandably alarmed, because bulldozers have been used as weapons in hit-and-run terrorist attacks.

And rather than consult with an Arabic-speaking officer who could have immediately identified that the man had written “Good morning,” the police instead went directly to the construction site outside Jerusalem and arrested the culprit “on suspicion of incitement,” a spokeswoman told The Times of Israel.

By Peter Berkowitz, The Wall Street Journal



News broke last week about possible Russian wrongdoing in the U.S., and it didn’t involve the Trump campaign. The Hill reported that in 2009 the FBI “gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States.”

The FBI kept that information from Congress and the public, the Hill reported, even as Hillary Clinton’s State Department in 2010 approved a deal that transferred control of more than 20% of America’s uranium supply to a Russian company. The Hill also reported the FBI had documents showing that during this period Russia engineered the transmission of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation.

The FBI director at the time: Robert Mueller, now special counsel in charge of investigating “Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election and related matters.” The revelations can only heighten anxieties about Mr. Mueller, the FBI and the rule of law.

The special counsel’s open-ended mandate covers not only “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump” but also “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.”

Because Mr. Mueller has interpreted his mandate expansively, his effort may become the most politically disruptive federal investigation of our young century—more than the FBI’s investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s private email server and mishandling of classified information, more than Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald’s investigation into the 2003 disclosure of CIA employee Valerie Plame’s identity.

The artwork, nicknamed “Española,” is the only missing piece from the 16 Cabrera did in a series of casta, or caste, paintings. The painting's location remained a mystery for decades, until two years ago, when Ilona Katzew, the curator of Latin American art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, received a cryptic letter written in the voice of the little girl featured in the artwork.

“You should know that I am well and living less than two (2) miles from LACMA,” Española wrote in the letter to Katzew, the Los Angeles Times reported. “I have been in the same family for I believe 60 years, although I do not know how I was acquired.”

Since opening the letter, Katzew has puzzled over where in that two mile radius “Española” is hiding, but clues to the painting’s whereabouts are few and far between.

The three-paragraph letter gave no more indication of the painting’s location or means of contacting the owner. The mailing label was trimmed down to remove any information about its origin. The postage was a pair of 37-cent stamps – retired a decade before the letter was sent – and a commemorative stamp honoring writer Jack London that was issued in 1988.

Five photos of the painting – the only ones known to exist of the work - were also included with the letter, but the only information that Katzew was able to glean from them was that the artwork was in a modern frame and that it was apparently hanging high on a wall.

In the letter, however, Española hints that she would be willing go on display “for a limited period of time” if the conditions were right.

“If you ever gather a reunion of all my siblings, I would welcome the opportunity to be on display for a limited period of time,” the letter noted. “I am not lost, I just do not wish to be found.”

The 16 paintings in Cabrera’s casta series – an art style that explored interracial marriages and children in the Spain’s New World colonies – were purportedly sent to Spain from Mexico shortly after the artist’s death and displayed in the home of the Viceroy of New Spain, Joaquin de Montserrat.

In 2015, 14 of the painting were housed in museums across the U.S., Spain and Mexico. The most recently discovered one – a painting of a Spanish father, his half-Spanish, half-African wife, and their albino baby – was found under a couch in a northern California home and quickly obtained by LACMA.

“My owner has enjoyed seeing #6,” Española’s letter said in reference to the most recently acquired painting, “and I am pleased that we are all now accounted for despite the diaspora.”

But it’s been two years since the most recent Cabrera was acquired – and since Española’s letter – and Katzew hasn’t had any other contact with the painting’s owner. But she’s hoping that with LACMA opening a show on 18th-century artwork next month, Española’s owner might reach out again.",Cryptic letter taunts museum curator looking for missing masterpiece,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/23/cryptic-letter-taunts-museum-curator-looking-for-missing-masterpiece.html

A film inspired by the love affair between a ballerina and Russia's last czar is having its Moscow premiere despite sparking outrage from some Russians.

Hard-line nationalists and some Orthodox believers see ""Matilda"" as blasphemy against Emperor Nicholas II, who is glorified as a saint in the Russian Orthodox Church.

The controversy has highlighted the increasing assertiveness of radical religious activists and a growing conservative streak in Russia's society.

The film loosely tells the story of Nicholas II's infatuation with ballerina Matilda Kshesinskaya.

Experts at Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), which is part of the U.K.’s University of Warwick, harnessed specialist 3D scanning technology to identify the astrolabe, believed to be over 500 years old. Key navigation tools, astrolabes were used to measure the altitude of the sun during voyages.

Measuring almost 7 inches in diameter, the astrolabe was recovered in 2014 from the wreck of Portuguese explorer ship Esmeralda, which sank in the Indian Ocean during a storm in 1503. Part of a fleet led by famed Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, Esmeralda was discovered off Oman’s Al Hallaniyah island by U.K.-based archaeology specialist Blue Water Recoveries in 1998. Working with the Omani government, Blue Water Recoveries excavated the site in 2014, revealing the historic artifact.

While experts suspected the disk to be an astrolabe, the lack of navigational markings on the artifact made it difficult to say for certain. Researchers then approached Professor Mark Williams at WMG to unlock the device’s secrets.

3D scanning technology revealed etches around the edge of the disk, each separated by five degrees, proving that it was indeed an astrolabe. The markings would have allowed sailors to measure the height of the sun above the horizon at noon to work their location, according to a statement released by the University of Warwick.

“It was fantastic to apply our 3D scanning technology to such an exciting project and help with the identification of such a rare and fascinating item,” said Williams, in the statement.

The astrolabe, which is thought to date from between 1495 and 1500, bears the Portuguese coat of arms and the personal emblem of Don Manuel I, who was King of Portugal between 1495 and 1521.

""It's a great privilege to find something so rare, something so historically important, something that will be studied by the archaeological community and fills in a gap,” said David Mearns of Blue Water Recoveries, who led the recovery effort, in a statement. “It was like nothing else we had seen […] it adds to the history, and hopefully astrolabes from this period can be found.""

Charleston Hartfield, 34, was buried Friday following private graveside services. His burial came after a funeral that drew more than 2,000 family members, friends and police and military officers, with honors that included a motorcade down the Las Vegas Strip.

The married father of two was off-duty and attending the Oct. 1 concert where a gunman opened fire from a hotel room.

LAS VEGAS SHOOTING DETAILS STILL MURKY AS MANDALAY BAY ORDERED TO KEEP EVIDENCE

However, a year before his death, Hartfield began a computer file detailing the instructions for his funeral.

“If you’re reading this, then I’ve been called home,” Hartfield’s note read. The file was found by his wife, Veronica, following his death.

“Nothing I type will make this any easier, so I will get to the facts. My largest request: Please do not allow anyone to wear black. Black is totally depressing and I don’t want anyone expressing their sorrow over my passing,” Hartfield’s instructions read.

Hartfield asked that Nina Simone and Johnny Cash songs also be played during his funeral.

“I would like for everyone to enjoy themselves. And remember me for who I was. The truth only. None of that stuff about how great I was. Only real stories,” the officer wrote.

Everyone broke that rule over the next hour.

Friends, his cousin, brother and sister, and police and military officials including Brig. Gen. Zachary Doser, the head of the Nevada Army National Guard, characterized the man most called ""Chucky"" as an inspiration, a mentor and a quick wit.

Doser praised Hartfield, who at age 34 had accumulated 17 years of military service in Iraq and with a quartermaster unit in the Nevada Guard, as the epitome of ""everything good about being an American.""

Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo called Hartfield, an 11-year police veteran, a “remarkable officer” killed by “an unremarkable person.”

COUNTRY STARS HONOR LAS VEGAS SHOOTING VICTIMS AT CMT ARTISTS

Investigators have not determined what motivated the shooter, Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired accountant, real estate investor and high-stakes gambler, to plan and execute his attack.

Lombardo said Hartfield 's death was considered on-duty because he tried to shield, protect and shepherd people in a concert crowd from danger.

""That night, in a hail of gunfire, Charlie's last actions spoke for him,"" Lombardo said. ""He took actions to save lives.""

Hartfield asked to be buried in a veteran’s area so he could continue to “protect” the U.S. with the other buried veterans.

“The only way I would like to be placed in the ground is if it’s in a veteran’s area. That way myself and the crusty old vets can hold formations and continue to protect and serve our great country once more,” Hartfield wrote.

The ad features two figures, one heavier and another with a much slimmer silhouette, complete with an arrow pointing from the heavier one to the slimmer one. Next to the images is a bold yellow “CAUTION: Skinnypigs will make you look better naked.”

On Twitter, people took issue with both the message and the location.

Sarah Davy wrote, ""That's so shocking in so many ways. Negative body image, inappropriate location & a truly awful company name.""

Still another Twitter user accused Skinnypigs of ""purporting outdated and dangerous gender stereotypes.”

Skinnypigs owner, Jonathan Hair, was not on board with the attacks his business was receiving, and went on the defensive, resulting in a heated back-and-forth on the social media site.

Hair tweeted from the Skinnypigs handle, “You don't even realise that modern feminism is so polluted with self loathing, man hating looms. We have equality now, it's a good thing. While we are giving advice, stop being a feminazi, you are in the wrong side of history. You'll see when you're all growed up.""

Hair even directly attacked one of his critics, saying, ""Thanks for the input, you'd look far less stupid if you looked into what Skinnypigs is and has achieved if you did a little research.""

In another he added: ""Oooo a feminazi eh, I should have known with the glasses.""

He told another critic: ""Just another whiny feminazi who will end up bitter and alone with house full of cats (but thinks she can change the world by complaining).""

His responses fueled his opponents’ fire, and many launched more attacks about the perceived fat-shaming sign, and vowed to no longer give business to Skinnypigs.

The Twitter storm swelled to include Skinnypigs die-hards, who came to their favorite fitness center's aid by sharing their own weight-loss success stories.

One Twitter user said, ""Getting ready for Skinnypigs, a place [where] we support, encourage and empower each other.""

Hair spoke to Mirror Online and defended his responses, saying he had “nothing to be sorry for.”

""It is open season on me at the moment,"" he said. ""To be honest I wish I just ignored it.

He continued, saying, ""All the hate I was getting, people calling me sexist.

The Hill committees have been at it for many months now and haven’t come up with much of anything.

Things have reached the point where the New York Times, in an above-the-fold piece yesterday, is clearly signaling that the investigators are coming up empty-handed.

But while the Times offers numerous reasons why the probes are stalled, there is no mention of another possible explanation: that there isn’t much there to find.

Now I don’t know exactly what the committees have found. And I don’t know what Robert Mueller and his team of prosecutors have found. People like Mike Flynn and Paul Manafort appear to have problems, and just yesterday came an NBC report that the special counsel is investigating Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta. (His firm says it’s fully cooperating.)

But potential charges about improper payments and lobbying aren’t the same as the core question of whether Trump aides and associates colluded with Moscow to influence the election. The one instance we know about, the meeting with Russian lawyers arranged by Donald Trump Jr., didn’t lead to anything. And the White House by all indications is cooperating with Mueller.

Again, I draw no premature conclusions. But administration officials, addressing what the president calls a “witch hunt,” have privately wondered what the media will do if it turns out there’s no there there.

The Times piece says the Hill investigations suffer from some common maladies:

“All three committees looking into Russian interference — one in the House, two in the Senate — have run into problems, from insufficient staffing to fights over when the committees should wrap up their investigations. The Senate Judiciary Committee’s inquiry has barely started, delayed in part by negotiations over the scope of the investigation. Leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee, while maintaining bipartisan comity, have sought to tamp down expectations about what they might find.”

Could the media be tamping down expectations as well?

“Nine months into the Trump administration,” the Times says, “any notion that Capitol Hill would provide a comprehensive, authoritative and bipartisan accounting of the extraordinary efforts of a hostile power to disrupt American democracy appears to be dwindling.”

The story has an opening anecdote about Jared Kushner offering to stay beyond his allotted time when questioned by the House Intel committee. Republican congressman Trey Gowdy said he was in a no-win situation: If you leave now, Democrats will say you did not answer all the questions. If you stay, they will keep you here all week.

Congressional investigations are often stymied by partisan politics, as the president’s party plays defense and the opposition party plays attack dog.

But there’s also the possibility of hitting a dry hole.

“If there’s not something there,” Mark Warner, ranking Democrat on the Senate Intel panel, said recently, “I’ll be the first to acknowledge that.”",Media admit that the Hill's Russia probes seem to be going nowhere,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/24/media-admit-that-hills-russia-probes-seem-to-be-going-nowhere.html

Country star Alan Jackson, the late guitarist and singer Jerry Reed and songwriter Don Schlitz were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on Sunday.

Country icon Loretta Lynn returned to the Hall of Fame for the first time since she suffered a stroke in May to formally induct Jackson. Lynn, who cancelled her tour dates this year to recover, said Jackson was the only person that could make her leave her house.

She recalled meeting Jackson when he was a nervous young artist decades ago and knowing then that he would ""be one of the greatest singers in country music.""

""He hadn't let me down,"" said Lynn, who is also a member of the Hall of Fame.

The 59-year-old Jackson is still one of country music's most successful solo artists, having sold nearly 45 million albums in the United States and had 26 singles reach the top of the Billboard country charts.

With his baritone voice and knack for telling stories about small town Southern life, the Newnan, Georgia-born singer was among a wave of neo-traditionalists that broke through in the 1990s.

He joked that when he was signed to Arista Nashville, a label started by Clive Davis, they had no idea how popular he would become.

""I was just a token country singer they signed for that label and bam, I took off,"" Jackson said.

Many of his hits became instant classics, from the barroom staple ""Chattahoochee"" to the somber ""Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)"" written after the Sept. 11 attacks.

But he's also been characterized as shy and uneasy in the media spotlight.

""I am not really shy, just socially awkward,"" Jackson said. ""I just don't like to talk too much.""

Instead, he let his songs speak for him, often writing about his father, his wife and the everyday joys and sorrows of the average man. Other hits include ""It's Five O'Clock Somewhere,"" ''A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'Bout Love)"" and ""When Somebody Loves You.""

George Strait, Alison Krauss and Lee Ann Womack each performed one of Jackson's songs in his honor.

Reed, who died at age 71 in 2008, was first known as an in-demand studio musician with a unique finger picking style on the guitar. He played for and wrote songs for stars like Elvis Presley and Porter Wagoner.

Reed, originally from Atlanta, became more popular when his songs began charting. His hit song ""When You're Hot, You're Hot"" earned him a Grammy award.

In later years, he started appearing in TV and movies, most notably playing Burt Reynolds' sidekick in ""Smokey and the Bandit."" He also sang many of the songs on the soundtrack, including ""East Bound and Down.""

His daughters, Seidina Hubbard and Lottie Zavala, accepted the honor on his behalf.

Hubbard said one of her fondest memories of growing up was listening ""to the beautiful sound of that guitar in the house all the time.""

Performing some of his songs were guitarists Tommy Emmanuel, John Knowles and Steve Wariner, while Jamey Johnson performed one of his personal favorites, ""East Bound and Down.""

Schlitz, 65, from Durham, North Carolina, had his first songwriting hit in 1978 when Kenny Rogers recorded his song, ""The Gambler,"" which became Rogers' signature song throughout his career.

Other songs he helped write include ""On the Other Hand"" and ""Forever and Ever, Amen,"" both sung by Randy Travis; ""When You Say Nothing at All,"" recorded by both Keith Whitley and Alison Krauss; and ""Strong Enough to Bend,"" by Tanya Tucker.

He was elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012 and helped to create the popular songwriters in the round format at Nashville's famed Bluebird Café.

Aloe Blacc and Vince Gill sang a duet version of ""The Gambler,"" while singers Charlie Worsham and Mary Chapin Carpenter also performed his songs in his honor.

Schlitz gave some advice to his grandchildren seated in the audience from what he had learned in his career.

""No one does this alone. In your life, be a part of something bigger than yourself,"" Schlitz said.",Loretta Lynn returns after stroke to honor Alan Jackson,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/loretta-lynn-returns-after-stroke-to-honor-alan-jackson.html

The hagfish is more than 300 million years old and it lives out of sight in the deepest depths of the ocean. Without a jaw, this spineless ancient creature scavenges the ocean floor for food.

It feasts on dying animals from the inside out and although it is snakelike, hagfish do not have scales. To defend itself, the hagfish unleashes slime (similar to slime featured in ""Ghostbusters"") - and it is this slime that has military scientists excited.

WILL COMBAT VEHICLES USE URINE FOR FUEL?

Spider silk has long been pursued as an option to building ultralight weight and ultra-strong body armor. Hagfish slime threads are almost as strong and light as spider silk, but could prove far easier to harvest in the necessary large volumes to be practical.

Made of mucus and threadlike fibers, the clear slime’s fibers are ultra-strong and flexible.

Will synthetic slime become the basis of new body armor for the military? Bottled into a spray to protect Navy divers? Scientists are unlocking these and more potential from this unique fish.

Hagfish slime and its unique capabilities are being studied and pioneered by scientists like the Navy team at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division in Florida.

Slime defense

Hagfish defend themselves by oozing slime on their threats, some of which risk slime suffocation.

When combined with seawater, the slime rapidly expands and creates huge volumes. One mere foot-long hagfish can possess hundreds of miles of slime thread inside and can expand 10,000 times in volume in milliseconds.

Even a shark attempting to eat a hagfish will find it hard to succeed and will battle a face and gills full of slime – risking slime suffocation.

To clean off their slime, hagfish tie themselves in knots.

How could it be used for body armor?

The slime is simple, but incredibly strong with very interesting properties with great defense potential.

When the wet fibers are stretched and dried out, the fibers become a sort of soft thread that could be woven to create a range of apparel materials.

Scientists believe that this hagfish slime, and its ultra-strong stretchy thread, could be the key to next-level bullet-proof vests.

Just how strong is hagfish slime? Hagfish may not be pretty, but they’ve got staying power and this is in large part down to its ability to defend itself and survive. The hagfish have been around for centuries during extinction after extinction - even outlasting the dinosaurs.

In fact, dinosaurs became extinct 60 million years ago, but hagfish date back 330 million years.

WILL A SINGLE BOMB STOP NORTH KOREA?

How will they farm slime?

Any team working to crack slime applications will need to figure out how to reproduce the slime and at high volumes.

Natural hagfish reproduction still remains a mystery. Hagfish breeding in captivity has not yielded success, therefore hagfish farms are an unlikely solution. Artificial reproduction in a lab is more probable.

Spider silk has been similarly pursued for its strength and posed similar practical problems in terms of replicating at a mass level. Hagfish slime proteins are smaller and so could prove easier to replicate.

Remarkably, the Navy team has already replicated the material and can now focus on applying the synthetic slime to provide military advantages.

Potential applications

Replicated slime could replace petroleum based-products like Kevlar. Similar to spider silk, there is potential it could eventually provide enhanced strength at a lighter weight than current bulletproof armor.

Beyond bulletproof vests, there are other interesting military applications.

For example, special operations could find creative tactical uses for a material that can instantly change, massively expand and ensnare or “clog.”

Different delivery systems are being explored. Just as the slime protects the fish, the synthetic slime could potentially be developed into a spray to protect divers against sharks.

An artificial slime also means that it can be tinkered with and modified. Scientists are working on enhancing the synthetic slime’s stickiness- its ability to attach to various surfaces. Enhancing the slime’s stability in different environments is another potential objective that would expand its potential utility for the military.

Another application could be applying the slime as a ship coating to prevent barnacles and algae from attaching.

On the homeland, there’s lots of other potential such as using the slime to protect firefighters.

What’s next?

Eventually, some products derived from the hagfish slime could work their way into uses outside of the military.

Shannon White, an executive within the Besh Restaurant Group (BRG), has confirmed that the 49-year-old New Orleans restaurateur “has decided to step down from all aspects of operations and to provide his full focus on his family,” and that the BRG will increase its “efforts in sexual-harassment training.”

The claims against Besh and his restaurant staff were first published over the weekend by The Times-Picayune of New Orleans, which reported that 25 former and current employees within the BRG had come forward with accusations against the James Beard-recognized chef and several of the male supervisors within his company.

'TOP CHEF' JUDGE TOM COLICCHIO CHANGES RESTAURANT NAME OVER CONCERNS OF RACIAL INSENSITIVITY

In one complaint submitted to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, former social-media manager Lindsay Reynolds ""vulgar and offensive comments, aggressive un-welcomed touching and sexual advances were condoned and sometimes even encouraged by managers and supervisors.""

Another unidentified woman claimed that Besh, who has been married for 26 years, had ""insisted [she] drink heavily” on a work trip, and later visited her hotel room, where he ""immediately started to kiss and fondle"" her while she ""was barely conscious, and easily overwhelmed.” The complained added that Besh ultimately “engaged in oral sex and fell asleep"" beside her, the Times-Picayune reported.

Besh’s restaurant partner, Octavio Mantilla, was accused of inappropriate touching by Madie Robison, who worked as a graphic designer with BRG. Robison says she also felt pressured to attend pool parties at a supervisor’s house, where Mantilla introducing her to a bunch of men as “our design goddess.” Mantilla however, told the Times-Picayune he does not remember saying or doing these things.

Reynolds added that both Mantilla and Besh had “hit on basically every woman in the office who was young and pretty,” and likened the environment of the BRG offices to that of AMC’s “Mad Men.”

Complicating matters was the lack of a human resources department within the BRG making it more difficult for the women file complaints against supervisors or co-workers. Besh and Mantilla did eventually hire a human resources manager as of Oct. 11, the Times-Picayune reports.

GORDON RAMSAY DEMANDS APOLOGY FROM JAMIE OLIVER OVER COMMENT ABOUT FAMILY

On Oct. 21, the Times-Picayune also obtained a statement from Besh in which he apologized for the lack of “clear mechanism” for employees to voice concerns, but wrote that a “complaint procedure” had indeed been in place, though it was admittedly insufficient.

While he did not specifically address any of the allegations against himself or his staff, he did admit to being in a consensual relationship outside of his marriage about two years ago, and apologized to “anyone past and present who has worked with me who found my behavior as unacceptable as I do.”

""I alone am entirely responsible for my moral failings. This is not the way the head of a company like ours should have acted, let alone a husband and father,” said Besh, who also served with the United States Marine Corps. for six years. “But it should not taint our incredible team of more than 1,000 employees, nor undermine our unyielding commitment to treating everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of gender, race, age and sexual preference.""

In response to the accusations against the BRG, celebrity chefs Anthony Bourdain and Jose Andres have taken to Twitter to respond, with Bourdain citing it as the “beginning of the end of institutionalized Meathead Culture in the restaurant business,” and Andres adding that “respect, dignity, humanity is non negotiable.

While Timberlake was singing his hit song “Rock Your Body” during the 2004 Halftime show, he ripped a part of Jackson’s costume to reveal her right breast, which was only covered by a nipple shield. The incident, dubbed a wardrobe malfunction, caused public outrage and a delay in all live broadcasts.

CBS was fined a record $550,000 from the Federal Communications Commission. The fine was later overturned.

Jackson was the first to come out and apologize for the incident but her career took a downward spiral, Rolling Stone reported. CBS’ parent company Viacom blacklisted Jackson’s music videos from being aired on their networks, which include MTV and Vh1.

Patrick Ferraiuolo, president of the Correction Captains’ Association, also said the door-to-door delivery violated the rules at the infamous lock-up.

“Since when is bringing food in from the outside not considered contraband?” Ferraiuolo fumed. “It’s not jail food that’s part of the everyday menu.”

Retired city correction officer and union delegate David Fitzgerald said Rikers jailbirds should have to wait until they’re sprung to enjoy pizza, which a 2016 Harris poll rated America’s “ultimate comfort food.”

“It’s deplorable and disgusting because you have officers that aren’t even afforded a meal leave, and you’re rewarding these inmates with pizza and sodas for good behavior,” Fitzgerald said.

The purchase from the Domino’s chain also ran counter to comments made last week by Mayor de Blasio, who urged New Yorkers to patronize “your local neighborhood stores.”

Ex-Commissioner Joseph Ponte began treating jailbirds to slices in 2014 in a counseling program that guards dubbed “Hug-a-Thug.” In 2015, he also began rewarding teenage inmates with pizza and $25 a week in exchange for not fighting and following orders.

Ponte, appointed by de Blasio, quit in May amid outrage over his use of a city-owned SUV and gas card to travel to Maine.

He was replaced this month by Cynthia Brann, a deputy who was also caught misusing her official vehicle and repaid the city for nearly 20 shopping trips to places including the Woodbury Commons Outlets and Roosevelt Field Mall.

The Correction Department said the pizzas cost about $400 and provided two slices each to 75 inmates who “reached a key milestone” in a “work skills program.”

It also said the unspecified “program provider” would be asked “to work out a deal with a local pizzeria.”

“This was not ‘pizza-gate,’ ” spokesman Peter Thorne said.

“We gave a couple of slices each to inmates participating in a program that helps reduce violence. And we’d do it again, because these programs are working.”

Official figures show serious attacks on Rikers correction officers are down 65 percent — from 92 to 32 annually — since fiscal 2014​.

The Homeland Security Department, the State Department and other U.S. agencies have been reviewing the screening process during the temporary ban.
Even with the ban lifted, refugee admissions are expected to be far lower than in recent years.

Courts have repeatedly blocked that policy, but largely left the temporary refugee policy in place.","President Donald Trump's four-month worldwide ban on refugees ended Tuesday, officials said, as his administration prepared to unveil tougher new screening procedures.

Under an executive order Trump signed earlier this year, the United States had temporarily halted admissions for refugees from all countries, with some exceptions. The end-date written into the order came and went Tuesday with no new order from Trump to extend it, according to a State Department official, who wasn't authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity.

Refugees seeking entry to the U.S. will face what officials described as more stringent and thorough examination of their backgrounds, in line with Trump's ""extreme vetting"" policy for immigrants. The Homeland Security Department, the State Department and other U.S. agencies have been reviewing the screening process during the temporary ban.

The new screening procedures were to be announced later Tuesday. It was unclear exactly what measures would be added, but in the past, officials have spoken about examining applicants' social media posts and other investigative measures to identify those who may sympathize with extremists or pose a national security risk to the United States.

Refugees already face an extensive backlog and waiting periods that can take years. Any additional screening would likely extend the timeline.

Even with the ban lifted, refugee admissions are expected to be far lower than in recent years. Last month, Trump capped refugee admissions at 45,000 for the fiscal year that started Oct. 1, a cut of more than half from the 110,000 limit put in place the year earlier by President Barack Obama. And the actual number admitted this year could be far lower than Trump's 45,000 cap, which sets a maximum but not a minimum.

The refugee restrictions were in addition to Trump's broader ""travel ban"" on people from several countries. Courts have repeatedly blocked that policy, but largely left the temporary refugee policy in place.

Trump has made limiting immigration the centerpiece of his policy agenda. In addition to the travel ban, which initially targeted a handful of Muslim-majority nations, the president rescinded an Obama-era executive action protecting young immigrants from deportation and vowed to build a wall along the southern border with Mexico.

During his presidential campaign, Trump pledged to ""stop the massive inflow of refugees"" and warned that terrorists were smuggling themselves into naive countries by posing as refugees fleeing war-torn Syria.

""Thousands of refugees are being admitted with no way to screen them and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free health care, even as our own veterans, our great, great veterans, die while they're waiting online for medical care that they desperately need,"" Trump said last October.

Instead, Trump has advocated keeping refugees closer to their homes.

The end of the ban comes amid an alarming refugee crisis in Myanmar, where security forces in August began what human rights groups have called a scorched-earth campaign against villages inhabited by Rohingya Muslims. More than 600,000 Rohingya from northern Rakhine State have fled to Bangladesh.

A high school football team is playing for more than touchdowns and stats after a relative reached out and asked if they could honor a 3-year-old girl facing a terminal illness. In response, the Dixon High School varsity team in California took the field last week with “Frankie Strong” stickers on their helmets, and played for the girl who is headed to New York for further treatments, Fox 40 reported.

Frankie, whose last name was not disclosed, was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma last year, and will have surgery to remove three of the tumors in the near future. Her uncle, Craig Militano, whose son Jake plays on the Dixon football team, said that several other tumors cannot be removed.

“She just wants to play and be a kid,” Militano told the news outlet. “It’s hard to do that when you have a tube in your nose.”

Sessions said the gang’s members are suspected in a series of killings in New York City's suburbs and the U.S. “will use whatever laws we have” to get them off the street.

The new designation directs prosecutors to pursue all legal avenues, including racketeering, gun and tax laws, to target the gang, said Sessions, a Republican former U.S. senator from Alabama.

Sessions designated the gang with Central American ties as a ""priority"" for the Department of Justice's Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, which has historically focused on drug trafficking and money laundering. MS-13, or La Mara Salvatrucha, is generally known for extortion and violence rather than distributing and selling narcotics.

""They leave misery, devastation and death in their wake. They threaten entire governments. They must be and will be stopped,"" the attorney general said, while in Philadelphia.

The gang has become a prime target of President Trump's administration amid its broader crackdown on immigration.

Members of the gang are suspected of committing several high-profile killings in New York, Maryland and Virginia. The gang's violence drew the Republican president's attention after two teenage girls was beaten and hacked to death in a suspected gang attack on Long Island.

The girls were among 22 people believed to have been killed by the gang on Long Island since the start of 2016. Most of the people arrested in those killings were in the U.S. illegally, law enforcement officials have said.

After Trump took office, he directed federal law enforcement officials to focus resources on combating transnational gangs, including MS-13. But the new designation will allow officials to target MS-13 with a ""renewed vigor and a sharpened focus,"" said Sessions, who flew to El Salvador in July, in part to learn more about how the gang's activities there affect crime in the U.S.

MS-13 originated in Los Angeles in the 1980s, then entrenched itself in Central America when its leaders were deported.

Making a street gang like MS-13 a priority marks a shift for the drug enforcement task force, said James Trusty, who headed the Department of Justice's organized crime and gang section before he left in January.

Some MS-13 cases have drug connections, but ""you'd be hard-pressed to come up with evidence that MS-13 is part of a cartel,"" he said. ""The most common aspect of MS-13 prosecutions has been murder and witness intimidation or retaliation, not drug trafficking.""

Online DC court records show Edwards was charged with first-degree sexual abuse for an incident at a gas station in Southeast D.C on Sept. 25.

In that incident, Edwards allegedly parked his car, grabbed a woman by the neck and said, ""You are going to take this ___.”

The victim of the September incident told police Edwards had previously helped her by giving her rides to and from work, but on that September night Edwards sexually assaulted her.

Mathews’ body was discovered in a culvert not far from her home in a Dallas suburb, at about 11 a.m. Sunday, the Richardson Police Department said. They said several indications show the body is the 3-year-old girl, but officials are waiting for positive identification.

""We didn't want this to come this way. We didn't want this to happen in this manner. We thought we would find her alive,” Omar Siddiqi, a search volunteer, told FOX4 Dallas.

Mathews' father, Wesley Mathews, was charged with child endangerment.

Mathews, who has a developmental disability, disappeared on Oct. 7 when her father ordered her to stand next to a tree behind the fence of their home at 3 a.m. because she refused to drink her milk. Coyotes often frequented the area, according to Dallas News. Mathews told police he couldn’t find the toddler when he went to check on her 15 minutes later. Her mother was reportedly sleeping throughout the ordeal.

Search teams scavenged the wooded area until cadaver dogs spotted the body Sunday. The girl’s parents were notified of the discovery and no additional charges were filed as of Sunday night.

The couple adopted Mathews two years ago from an orphanage in India, the Times of India reported. Bihar's State Adoption Resource Agency officials confirmed to the news site the couple had adopted her. The girl, who was known as Saraswati before her adoption, was placed in an orphanage when she was 1 after she was abandoned by her biological family.

""During her initial days, Saraswati used to remain quiet but gradually she opened up at the center,"" said Babiti Kumari, the former secretary of the Mother Teresa adoption center that closed in September.

When Wesley Mathews and his wife adopted Mathews, she was malnourished and physically underdeveloped. She also did not have the language skills of a typical 3-year-old child, the Dallas News reported.

The Mathews attended a court hearing on Monday to determine whether they could regain custody of their 4-year-old biological daughter, who was placed in protective custody after Sherin went missing. The girl will remain in foster care at least until a Nov. 13 hearing, or until a judge orders a change in custody.

The FBI in the case seized 47 items from the Mathews’ house, including “hair-like” fibers, a washer and dryer, five cellphones, three laptops, trash bags and a digital camera.

The carrier is expected to make its way to the Persian Gulf to relieve the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz.
""The exercise will employ tactical data link systems to exchange track data among all the participating ships,"" the Navy said.
Japan was alarmed by North Korea twice launching ballistic missiles over Japanese territory, in August and in September.
He added: ""The threat posed by North Korea has grown to the unprecedented, critical and imminent level.""","A second U.S. Navy aircraft carrier strike group entered the western Pacific, the Navy's 7th fleet announced Tuesday, amid an increasing war of words between the United States and North Korea.

USS Theodore Roosevelt – the “Big Stick” – left its San Diego home port earlier this month on a scheduled deployment to the West Pacific and Persian Gulf. It will now join the USS Ronald Reagan strike group off the Korean Peninsula.

The carrier is expected to make its way to the Persian Gulf to relieve the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz.

""Entering 7th Fleet is an exciting opportunity to integrate with other U.S. Navy units in the [area of operations], as well as operate with our partners and allies in the region,"" said Rear Adm. Steve Koehler in a statement. ""We look forward to continued partnerships that lead to mutual security and common views about operating at sea.”

It is rare to have two U.S. Navy aircraft carriers stationed in the region.

The last time it happened was back in June when the Carl Vinson and Reagan strike groups were together for a few days in the Peninsula for training purposes – but it marked the first time since the 1990s that two U.S. carriers were near the Korean Peninsula.

""USS Theodore Roosevelt is prepared to carry out the full spectrum of possible missions, from humanitarian relief to combat operations,"" Capt. Carlos Sardiello, Theodore Roosevelt's commanding officer, said in a statement. ""When a carrier leaves on deployment, we have to be ready for anything.""

The deployment comes as the U.S., Japan and South Korean maritime forces are conducting a trilateral exercise aimed at improving ballistic missile defenses.

""The exercise will employ tactical data link systems to exchange track data among all the participating ships,"" the Navy said.

On Monday, Japan's defense minister asserted North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities have grown to an ""unprecedented, critical and imminent"" level, requiring ""different responses"" to the threat.

The minister, Itsunori Onodera, said the rising threat compels his country to endorse the U.S. view that ""all options"" must be considered, which President Trump says includes possible military action. Japan was alarmed by North Korea twice launching ballistic missiles over Japanese territory, in August and in September.

Onodera's comments, made through an interpreter, came at the outset of a so-called trilateral meeting in the Philippines with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and South Korea's defense minister, Song Young-moo.

""The country has steadfastly improved it nuclear and missiles capability,"" Onodera said. He added: ""The threat posed by North Korea has grown to the unprecedented, critical and imminent level.""

""Therefore, we have to take calibrated and different responses to meet that level of threat,"" he said, without elaborating on what ""different"" responses Japan favors.

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

The temperature in downtown Los Angeles on Monday set a record of 102. That was 24 degrees above normal.

It was expected to be in the mid-90s for the late Tuesday afternoon start of Game 1 of the World Series at Dodger Stadium.","California hit with 2nd day of stifling heat, wildfire risk",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/24/california-hit-with-2nd-day-stifling-heat-wildfire-risk.html

Making a street gang like MS-13 a priority marks a shift for the drug enforcement task force, said James Trusty, who headed the Department of Justice's organized crime and gang section before he left in January.","U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday promised an all-out assault on the brutal MS-13 street gang “just like we took Al Capone off the streets.”

Sessions said the gang’s members are suspected in a series of killings in New York City's suburbs and the U.S. “will use whatever laws we have” to get them off the street.

The new designation directs prosecutors to pursue all legal avenues, including racketeering, gun and tax laws, to target the gang, said Sessions, a Republican former U.S. senator from Alabama.

Sessions designated the gang with Central American ties as a ""priority"" for the Department of Justice's Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, which has historically focused on drug trafficking and money laundering. MS-13, or La Mara Salvatrucha, is generally known for extortion and violence rather than distributing and selling narcotics.

""They leave misery, devastation and death in their wake. They threaten entire governments. They must be and will be stopped,"" the attorney general said, while in Philadelphia.

The gang has become a prime target of President Trump's administration amid its broader crackdown on immigration.

Members of the gang are suspected of committing several high-profile killings in New York, Maryland and Virginia. The gang's violence drew the Republican president's attention after two teenage girls was beaten and hacked to death in a suspected gang attack on Long Island.

The girls were among 22 people believed to have been killed by the gang on Long Island since the start of 2016. Most of the people arrested in those killings were in the U.S. illegally, law enforcement officials have said.

After Trump took office, he directed federal law enforcement officials to focus resources on combating transnational gangs, including MS-13. But the new designation will allow officials to target MS-13 with a ""renewed vigor and a sharpened focus,"" said Sessions, who flew to El Salvador in July, in part to learn more about how the gang's activities there affect crime in the U.S.

MS-13 originated in Los Angeles in the 1980s, then entrenched itself in Central America when its leaders were deported.

Making a street gang like MS-13 a priority marks a shift for the drug enforcement task force, said James Trusty, who headed the Department of Justice's organized crime and gang section before he left in January.

Some MS-13 cases have drug connections, but ""you'd be hard-pressed to come up with evidence that MS-13 is part of a cartel,"" he said. ""The most common aspect of MS-13 prosecutions has been murder and witness intimidation or retaliation, not drug trafficking.""

In a 2014 Huffington Post blog post he stated, ""I collaborated with consenting adult women who were fully aware of the nature of the work, and as is typical with any project, everyone signed releases. I have never used an offer of work or a threat of rebuke to coerce someone into something that they did not want to do. I give everyone that I work with enough respect to view them as having ownership of their free will and making their decisions accordingly, and as such, it has been difficult to see myself as a target of revisionist history.""

FNC Leads Cable News Industry with More Women in Anchor/Host Roles Across Daytime and Primetime Programming

NEW YORK — OCTOBER 4, 2017 — FOX News Channel (FNC) is expanding the FOX & Friends franchise by one hour, announced Suzanne Scott, president of programming for FNC. Beginning October 9th, FOX & Friends FIRST will be presented from 4-6AM/ET and FOX & Friends will continue in the 6-9AM/ET timeslot. The 4AM hour of FOX & Friends First will be solo-hosted by Heather Childers, while the 5AM hour will be co-anchored by Jillian Mele and Rob Schmitt.

With the expansion of the franchise, FNC now has more women anchoring and hosting programs than any other cable news network on weekdays from 4AM-12AM/ET. Additionally, upon the debut of Fox News @ Night on October 30th, FNC will have live weekday programming for 20 hours a day.

In making the announcement, Scott said, “As FOX & Friends continues to mark its most-watched year in network history, we are thrilled to give our viewers more of the morning franchise they love.”

FOX & Friends FIRST is presented prior to the network’s signature morning show, previewing the day ahead by covering the latest news headlines in politics, business, entertainment and health. The early morning program is the number one cable news program in its timeslot, dominating CNN and MSNBC in both total viewers and the 25-54 demographic.

On pace to have its highest-rated year in network history, FOX & Friends has been FNC’s signature morning program for more than 19 years. Co-hosted by Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade, the show has eclipsed the competition for 190 consecutive months.

While with CSN Philly, she earned an Emmy Award for her co-host role on the local morning news program, Breakfast on Broad. Earlier in her career, Mele spent seven years with WCAU-TV (NBC 10) in Philadelphia, PA and reported in various capacities, including as a news, sports and traffic reporter. She got her on-air start as a local news anchor for stations in Presque Isle, Maine, and Binghamton, NY. Mele received a B.A. in arts and communication from La Salle University.

Rob Schmitt was named a weekend news anchor and general assignment reporter at FNC in June 2016 and has served as a substitute anchor for various programs including FOX & Friends First, and FOX Report. Prior to joining FNC, he was an anchor for WNBC-TV (NBC 4) in New York, helming the 12 Noon News while also contributing reports to the 5PM/ET and 6PM/ET news programs. Before joining WNBC-TV, Schmitt worked as an anchor and reporter for CBS2/KCAL9 (CBS) in Los Angeles, CA, and began his career at WPLG-TV (ABC) in Miami, FL.

Bob Corker reignited their feud on Tuesday, exchanging a series of digs after the retiring Republican lawmaker ramped up his criticism of the administration and its policies.

""Sen. Corker is the incompetent head of the Foreign Relations Committee, & look how poorly the U.S. has done,"" Trump tweeted Tuesday. ""He doesn't have a clue as the entire World WAS laughing and taking advantage of us. People like liddle' Bob Corker have set the U.S. way back. Now we move forward!""

Tuesday's war of words began when Corker, R-Tenn., the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, blasted Trump on morning shows on ABC and NBC.

“Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal & couldn’t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts,” Trump tweeted following those interviews. “Corker dropped out of the race in Tennessee when I refused to endorse him, and now is only negative on anything Trump. Look at his record!”

Corker fired back minutes later.

""Same untruths from an utterly untruthful president. #AlertTheDaycareStaff,"" Corker tweeted.

The dispute raised tensions just hours before the president was set to visit Capitol Hill for a working lunch with GOP senators. With tax reform on the agenda, Trump fired another warning shot later Tuesday morning:

""Isn't it sad that lightweight Senator Bob Corker, who couldn't get re-elected in the Great State of Tennessee, will now fight Tax Cuts plus!""

Corker later told Fox News that Trump's ""political model ... is to divide."" Asked if he thinks Trump is ""debasing"" the nation,"" Corker said, ""I don't think there's any question that's the case.""

The tweets and comments extend a weeks-long feud between Trump and Corker.

Corker, who announced last month that he would not seek re-election in 2018, earlier suggested that the White House had become an ""adult day care center.""

“I don’t make comments I haven’t thought about,” Corker said on ABC’s “Good Morning America” Tuesday, referring back to that tweet.

TRUMP TURNS ON GOP SEN. CORKER OVER 'COMPETENCE' COMMENT

Corker also told “Good Morning America” Tuesday that he is not satisfied with Trump’s presidency or his treatment of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

TRUMP CALLS 'LIDDLE' BOB CORKER A 'FOOL' OVER NYT INTERVIEW

“When you look at the fact that we’ve got this issue in North Korea and the president continues to kneecap his diplomatic representative, the secretary of state, and really move him away from successful diplomatic negotiations with China, which is key to this, you’re taking us on a path to combat,” Corker said on “Good Morning America,” adding that he would like Trump to “leave it to the professionals for a while.”

Corker added: “The president undermines our secretary of state [and] raises tensions in the area by virtue of the tweets that he sends out.”

On tax reform, Corker also said that much of the discussion should be left to the committees.

And, despite being one of Trump's early supporters, Corker told CNN he would not support Trump for re-election: “Let’s just say, I would not do that again.”
