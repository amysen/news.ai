The fiscal update will show a sharp improvement in the nation’s balance sheet since the March budget, as stronger economic growth boosted revenues, but is unlikely to project balanced budgets anywhere on the horizon, economists said.

“It basically boils down to the fact that the economy looks like it’s going to grow by more than 3 percent this year, when they were basing their assumptions on growth of less than 2 percent back in March,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.

In March, the government projected a budget deficit of C$28.5 billion in the 2017-2018 fiscal year, which ends in March, up from the C$17.8 billion shortfall the previous year. At the time, economists said their economic assumptions looked easy to beat, all but guaranteeing they could boast of an improvement later.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has been badly shaken by a conflict-of-interest controversy surrounding Morneau, but hopes the fiscal update will reset pubic focus on the strong economy.

The Liberals won a surprise majority in 2015 pledging to run C$10 billion annual deficits to spur the economy, and the Bank of Canada has said the fiscal stimulus, which included a family tax credit, boosted growth in recent quarters.

The fiscal update will include a pledge to boost payments made to families under the Canada child benefit program, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp reported, citing multiple sources.

A spokesman for Finance Minister Morneau declined to confirm the report, but hinted at further spending rather than fiscal restraint, and said there will be “good news” for the middle class.

“We will not only update on how well (our policy has) been working, but giving back as well, by re-investing in the people who are creating jobs and growing the economy - the small business tax cut is a good example of that,” Dan Lauzon said in an email.

Morneau, seeking to counter a backlash against a tax reform that targeted wealthy individuals and family businesses, said last week the government will cut the small business tax rate to 9 percent from 10.5 percent.","Canada to unveil smaller budget deficit, hopes will shift focus",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CT21L-OCADN

Facebook has its European headquarters in Ireland and has argued that only the Irish data protection authority has the power to police it for its processing of Europeans’ data. Nonetheless other European privacy regulators, including the French, Belgian and German authorities, have taken action against the U.S. company.

Yves Bot, advocate general at the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), said in a non-binding opinion that any national authority could take action against a company for breaching data protection laws in the context of its activities in the country, even if the company is established in another member state.

The case stems from a dispute about a German fan page on Facebook which collected data on visitors to that page by storing a cookie on their hard drive.

A German court asked the ECJ whether a German data protection authority had jurisdiction over Facebook given its Irish subsidiary Facebook Ireland was responsible for its data processing activities in Europe.

Bot said that since the data processing at issue via the installation of cookies “is specifically intended to enable Facebook better to target the advertisements which it publishes,” it could be considered as being part of the activities undertaken by Facebook Germany, which is responsible for the promotion and sale of advertising space in Germany.

A spokeswoman for Facebook said: “We respectfully disagree with the Advocate General and await the European Court’s decision.”

Opinions from Advocate Generals tend to be followed by the Court’s judges in a majority of cases. A final ruling should follow in the coming months.

A new EU data protection law will come into force in May next year which seeks to make life easier for multinational businesses like Facebook by introducing a “one stop shop” principle whereby they would only have to deal with the authority in the member state of their main establishment.

But Bot pointed out that the new law was not yet in effect and the current framework enables each member state to apply its own national legislation, thereby making the “application of multiple national legislations possible”.",Facebook dealt setback by EU court adviser in privacy dispute,https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-court-facebook/facebook-dealt-setback-by-eu-court-adviser-in-privacy-dispute-idINKBN1CT2B9

Xi rapidly consolidated power after assuming party leadership in late 2012 and then the presidency the next year.
The party gave Xi the title of “core” leader a year ago, a significant strengthening of his position.","BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s ruling Communist Party enshrined President Xi Jinping’s political thought into its constitution on Tuesday, putting him in the same company as the founder of modern China, Mao Zedong, and cementing his power ahead of a second five-year term.

A key Xi ally, top corruption fighter Wang Qishan, will not be on the new Politburo Standing Committee, the apex of power in China, to be revealed on Wednesday as he was not among those named on Tuesday to the 204-member Central Committee.

Whether or not the powerful Wang would remain on the Standing Committee, which currently has seven members, despite being beyond the customary retirement age of 69, had been among the key questions to be answered at the week-long party congress, which ended on Tuesday. Wang could still assume another senior role over the next few months.

As expected, the party unanimously passed an amendment to include “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” as one of its guiding principles.

The party will announce its new Standing Committee, headed by Xi, at around midday (0400 GMT) on Wednesday, culminating a twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle.

As expected, the amended constitution affirmed that Xi’s signature fight against corruption, which has ensnared more than 1.3 million officials, will continue.

Unexpectedly, Xi’s “Belt and Road” initiative, an ambitious programme to build infrastructure linking China with its neighbours and beyond, was also included in the party constitution.

Also included was a commitment to supply-side industrial reforms, and giving play to the “decisive role” of market forces in resource allocation, a commitment Xi had made early in his first terms that many investors say he has failed to deliver on.

“The party exercises overall leadership over all areas of endeavour in every part of the country,” the party said in a statement reflecting Xi’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the party and its place in contemporary Chinese society.

If no clear successor to Xi is named to the new Politburo Standing Committee, it will further fuel speculation that Xi may look to retain power beyond the customary second five-year term.

“This is about further erasing any distinction between Xi Jinping and the party,” said Jude Blanchette, who studies the party at The Conference Board’s China Center for Economics and Business in Beijing, referring to Xi’s thought getting into the constitution.

“Add on to this having supply-side structural reform and One Belt One Road written into this, which were Xi’s signature policies, this makes questioning or non-compliance with those tantamount to betrayal of the party.”

THE MARKET AND THE PARTY

Xu Hongcai, deputy chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, a Beijing think-tank, said party control was needed to push through the market reforms key to restructuring the world’s second-largest economy.

“To build a market economic system in such a big country, it’s impossible without the leadership of the party,” he said.

Others have argued that the two are contradictory.

“When you put ‘supply-side reform’ and ‘market playing a decisive role’ in the same document, then that just shows they have to almost choose one,” said Alex Wolf, Senior Emerging Markets Economist with Aberdeen Standard Investments in Hong Kong.

China’s blue-chip shares climbed to a 26-month high on Tuesday, led by infrastructure and property stocks, as Xi wrapped up a congress that began with his three-and-a half hour speech envisioning a more prosperous, confident China. The yuan strengthened against the dollar.

CROWNING GLORY?

Xi rapidly consolidated power after assuming party leadership in late 2012 and then the presidency the next year. The party gave Xi the title of “core” leader a year ago, a significant strengthening of his position.

Whether Xi was able to have his name “crowned” in the party constitution had been seen as a key measure of his power, elevating him to a level of previous leaders exemplified by Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.

No other leader since Mao has had an eponymous ideology included in the document while in office. Deng’s name was added after his death in 1997.

A list of 133 committee members for the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection released on Tuesday included Zhao Leji, who heads the party’s Organisation Department, a strong sign that he will take over from Wang as anti-corruption chief.

China’s top banking regulator, Guo Shuqing, and veteran banker Jiang Chaoliang, front runners to succeed Zhou Xiaochuan as central bank governor, both made it to the Central Committee.

The constitutional amendment, along with Xi’s work report and a work report of the graft watchdog to the congress, were passed by a show of hands.

When Xi next asked for any “no” votes or abstentions for the amendment or two work reports, the sound of “none” echoed throughout the chamber, as officials shouted out from different sides of the hall.","China enshrines 'Xi Jinping Thought', key Xi ally to step down",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-congress/china-enshrines-xi-jinping-thought-key-xi-ally-to-step-down-idUKKBN1CT0C5?il=0

A report a year ago by South Africa’s anti-graft agency known as Public Protector recommended a judicial probe be held to look into allegations of systemic corruption by Zuma, some of his ministers and heads of state-owned companies.

The report focused on allegations that Zuma’s friends, businessman brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, had influenced the appointment of ministers.

The 75-year-old Zuma, whose rule has long been dogged by scandal, and the Gupta brothers have denied the accusations.

The president, who previously described the “State of Capture” report as “unfair” in parliament, wants the court to send it back to the watchdog for further investigations.

He questioned the right of the report’s author, Public Protector former head Thuli Madonsela, to call for a judicial inquiry.

The report, whose public release Zuma had sought to block through the courts, called for an inquiry be set up by the president and for a judge to be appointed within 30 days of its release.

“Is she competent to then direct the president to hold a commission on inquiry? With respect to this submission, she’s not,” Zuma’s lawyer Ishmael Semenya told the court, referring to Madonsela.

The hearing is expected to continue until Thursday and a ruling is expected at a later date.

Zuma this year faced a series of corruption allegations, most recently over leaked emails that suggest the Gupta brothers may have used their influence to secure state contracts for their companies. Zuma and the Gupta brothers have denied these allegations.

Separately, Zuma is facing the possibility of more court charges. The Supreme Court this month upheld a High Court ruling to reinstate 783 corruption charges filed against him before he became president in 2009.

Na segunda-feira, a Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel) rejeitou a assinatura de um Termo de Ajustamento de Conduta (TAC) com a Oi que envolveria a conversão de cerca de 5 bilhões de reais em multas em investimentos.

“O papel da AGU é fundamental e essa decisão da Anatel ajuda muito a AGU no seu encaminhamento. A AGU precisa saber quais os recursos com os quais ela conta para seu trabalho de desenvolver um projeto de renegociação”, disse Kassab a jornalistas, após evento em Brasília.

O ministro reiterou que o governo federal fará o que for possível para evitar uma eventual intervenção na operadora de telefonia em recuperação judicial.

L‘esposizione complessiva sugli Npl delle banche italiane è scesa di 50 miliardi di euro a 212 miliardi di euro nei tre mesi a giugno, registrando il maggiore calo di tutti gli altri paesi sia in termini assoluti che relativi, secondo i dati Bce.

Tra gli altri paesi colpiti dalla crisi, le banche spagnole hanno ridotto i crediti deteriorati per 4,7 miliardi di euro, quelle greche per 2,3 miliardi e quelle portoghesi per 1,9 miliardi.

Complessivamente, i 114 istituti analizzati dalla Bce sommano Npl per 843 miliardi di euro alla fine di giugno, in discesa di 71 miliardi di euro rispetto ai tre mesi precedenti.

All‘inizio del mese la Bce ha pubblicato delle proposte, in consultazione, che obbligherebbero le banche a svalutare totalmente i nuovi crediti dubbi in un arco temporale definito e ha anticipato misure simili allo studio per lo stock esistente.

La nuove linee guida hanno scatenauto un intenso dibattito e nei giorni scorsi fonti della banca centrale hanno detto che i supervisori della Bce devono rivedere le proposte sulla gestione dei crediti problematici dopo le lamentele dell‘Italia secondo cui potrebbero ostacolare la ripresa del paese.

Secondo gli ultimi dati della Banca d‘Italia a a fine agosto il totale delle sofferenze lorde in capo agli istituti di credito residenti in Italia ammontava a 172,845 miliardi di euro dai 173,576 del mese precedente.

Già a luglio il dato aveva registrato un‘ampia contrazione di oltre 18 miliardi, spiegabile principalmente con il deconsolidamento dal bilancio di Npl per 16,2 miliardi da parte di UniCredit.

Facebook has its European headquarters in Ireland and has argued that only the Irish data protection authority has the power to police it for its processing of Europeans’ data. Nonetheless other European privacy regulators, including the French, Belgian and German authorities, have taken action against the U.S. company.

Yves Bot, advocate general at the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), said in a non-binding opinion that any national authority could take action against a company for breaching data protection laws in the context of its activities in the country, even if the company is established in another member state.

The case stems from a dispute about a German fan page on Facebook which collected data on visitors to that page by storing a cookie on their hard drive.

A German court asked the ECJ whether a German data protection authority had jurisdiction over Facebook given its Irish subsidiary Facebook Ireland was responsible for its data processing activities in Europe.

Bot said that since the data processing at issue via the installation of cookies “is specifically intended to enable Facebook better to target the advertisements which it publishes,” it could be considered as being part of the activities undertaken by Facebook Germany, which is responsible for the promotion and sale of advertising space in Germany.

A spokeswoman for Facebook said: “We respectfully disagree with the Advocate General and await the European Court’s decision.”

Opinions from Advocate Generals tend to be followed by the Court’s judges in a majority of cases. A final ruling should follow in the coming months.

A new EU data protection law will come into force in May next year which seeks to make life easier for multinational businesses like Facebook by introducing a “one stop shop” principle whereby they would only have to deal with the authority in the member state of their main establishment.

But Bot pointed out that the new law was not yet in effect and the current framework enables each member state to apply its own national legislation, thereby making the “application of multiple national legislations possible”.",Facebook dealt setback by EU court adviser in privacy dispute,https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-court-facebook/facebook-dealt-setback-by-eu-court-adviser-in-privacy-dispute-idINKBN1CT2B9?il=0

Last June’s referendum result on Brexit was close – 52 percent voted for Britain to leave the European Union; 48 percent to stay – but indisputable. Unlike in the U.S., no one believes that Russia altered the outcome. And this was a vote not to “drain the swamp” of Westminster, but to strengthen it. As Gisela Stuart, one of the few Labour MPs who campaigned enthusiastically for Brexit as the head of the “Vote Leave” campaign put it, the electors “wanted to restore genuine democratic government and take back control of the laws that govern them.”

Brexit is what happened when people were given a voice. No doubt that many who voted for it were uninformed; some were voting for a better yesterday; many were fearful of the effects of mass immigration – especially of Muslims. A few Britons didn’t want any foreigners at all. But above all, they wanted to “take back control,” and believed that political power should reside in the British parliament – which is comprehensible in its workings and dignified by centuries of existence – rather than in a series of institutions in Brussels, confusing in their overlapping and largely mysterious operations.

No matter that those with more sophisticated views of governance saw the desire as foolish: “an attempt to create a romantic idea of what Britain could be like out of the EU,” said the Liverpool University political scientist Andrew Crines. The majority wanted politics to be at least within their understanding, their representatives – liked or loathed – familiar.

It is this view that has rumbled along beneath the surface for most of the 44 years in which Britain has been a member of the European Union; it is what Prime Minster Theresa May meant in her Brexit speech to politicians in Florence on Friday, when she said that the EU “never felt to us like an integral part of our national story.”

That feeling was quiescent at times, especially during the 13 years of a Labour government, from 1997 to 2010, fevered at others. It was most turbulent during Conservative administrations: the last three Conservative Prime Ministers – Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) John Major (1990-1997) and David Cameron (2010-2016) all lost power because they were fatally weakened by the internal argument on Europe within their party. No one gives Theresa May much hope of avoiding the Brussels curse which has wreaked so much damage on her predecessors.

The British prime minister is seen as someone clinging on to power, at the mercy of fellow ministers who could, at any time, bring her down. The most ambitious of these, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, has revealed his desire to lead his country most clearly. In an article in the Telegraph, he lauded the UK in the most elevated rhetoric employed in the Brexit cause, largely devoid of his trademark jests, expressing a bounding belief that “we can become the greatest country on earth.”

Giving only the briefest mention to his prime minister, he took over 4000 words to make the vision of a liberated Britain his own, striking a Churchillian pose with “I do not underestimate the scale of the task ahead as we take back control of our destiny” – the kind of rhetoric wholly absent from May’s cautious, if more precise, speeches.

Her Florence speech, clearly something of a compromise between her cabinet factions, vague on many details, nevertheless laid down a process, if not a destination: honoring commitments (that is, probably a 20 billion GBP – about $27 billion – payment to the EU), adopting new laws to protect the existing rights of European citizens living in the UK and passing through a two-year transition to give both sides, especially the UK, time to adjust to a customized relationship not based on the trade pacts which other, non-EU countries, have with the EU.

May’s all-but-impossible job is – as she interprets it – to keep a party and a cabinet with many Remainers in it relatively united, and to retain at least the acquiescence of the senior diplomats and civil servants, of the Bank of England and the main institutions of state, many – probably most – of whom believe Brexit to be most grievously self-wounding, consigning Britain not to greatness but to marginality.

Speaking in Washington earlier this week, Mark Carney, the Canadian who leads the Bank of England, warned of higher inflation, interest rate rises and slower growth, and forecast that Britain – unlike the other advanced countries – would be “an example of deglobalization, not globalization.”

The former close aide to the prime minister, Nick Timothy – whom May was told to fire after nearly losing the election in June – wrote ahead of May’s Florence speech that Chancellor Philip Hammond, was “maneuvering” towards a partial Brexit, failing to promote its advantages and, in his behind-the-scenes arguments with Boris Johnson, playing “games” with the future of the country.

These “maneuvers,” and many more at every level of government, are deployed around the office of an embattled prime minister who, with a relatively modest personality (for a senior politician), has no powerful public presence with which to offset the impression of barely-controlled chaos. Meanwhile, every institution at home and abroad affected by Brexit – there are many – call loudly and daily for a certainty at which the government has not yet arrived, and an easy transition which it cannot guarantee.

In a much-discussed book, “The Road to Somewhere”, the journalist David Goodhart (disclosure: a former Financial Times colleague, and a friend, of this columnist) sees in British society a widening split. On one side there are those who are anywhere people: at home in a globalizing world, with liberal views, enthusiastically pro-European, scornful of rootedness - “progressive individualists.” On the other, somewhere people, much more rooted in family and local work and friendships, not (in the main) bigoted but slow to adapt, worried by too-rapid change - “decent populists.”

Admitting that each side usually shares aspects of the other, he argues that the somewhere people have lost out in status, income and visibility in the last few decades, to the point where they often tell pollsters that they barely recognize the country they live in. Much more strongly represented in the working and lower middle class, less often university-educated, generally older than the anywheres, they still are the largest bloc in the country – and in the referendum, their pent-up vexations were allowed a release.

Their decision was probably not a wise act, but it was a thoroughly democratic one. They have given their country’s leadership one monster of a job: to reconcile what is a still globalizing world with their need for esteem and a restored sense that their country is recognizable, and that it is theirs.

A European Union bank structural reform law was proposed in 2014, a relatively late addition to rules rolled out after the 2007-09 banking crisis which resulted in taxpayer bailouts.

It was meant to be Europe’s answer to the U.S. Volcker Rule, a crisis-era measure banning Wall Street banks from speculating with their own money which is due to be scaled back significantly by U.S. regulators.

The EU draft law gave regulators powers to force banks to split off trading activities, but got bogged down over the criteria used to do so.

At the same time the mood among some policymakers was moving from the need for more new rules to nurturing economic growth in a region where the bulk of loans come from banks.

The European Commission said in its new workplan on Tuesday that it was withdrawing the measure with “no foreseeable agreement” in prospect.

“In addition, the main financial stability rationale of the proposal has in the meantime been addressed by other regulatory measures in the banking sector, and most notably the entry into force of the Banking Union’s supervisory and resolution arms.”

Big banks have since had to comply with other rules, such as issuing bonds that can be written down to replenish capital.

Gunnar Hoekmark, the center-right Swede who was steering the measure through the European Parliament, said the EU executive had made the right decision.

“It was my firm belief that splitting up universal banks by separating retail from trade, investment and market making, would create instability and hinder investments and a more dynamic banking sector,” Hoekmark said in a statement.

A key Xi ally, top corruption fighter Wang Qishan, will not be on the new Politburo Standing Committee, the apex of power in China, to be revealed on Wednesday as he was not among those named on Tuesday to the 204-member Central Committee.

Whether or not the powerful Wang would remain on the Standing Committee, which currently has seven members, despite being beyond the customary retirement age of 69, had been among the key questions to be answered at the week-long party congress, which ended on Tuesday. Wang could still assume another senior role over the next few months.

As expected, the party unanimously passed an amendment to include “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” as one of its guiding principles.

The party will announce its new Standing Committee, headed by Xi, at around midday (0400 GMT) on Wednesday, culminating a twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle.

As expected, the amended constitution affirmed that Xi’s signature fight against corruption, which has ensnared more than 1.3 million officials, will continue.

Unexpectedly, Xi’s “Belt and Road” initiative, an ambitious program to build infrastructure linking China with its neighbors and beyond, was also included in the party constitution.

Also included was a commitment to supply-side industrial reforms, and giving play to the “decisive role” of market forces in resource allocation, a commitment Xi had made early in his first terms that many investors say he has failed to deliver on.

“The party exercises overall leadership over all areas of endeavor in every part of the country,” the party said in a statement reflecting Xi’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the party and its place in contemporary Chinese society.

If no clear successor to Xi is named to the new Politburo Standing Committee, it will further fuel speculation that Xi may look to retain power beyond the customary second five-year term.

“This is about further erasing any distinction between Xi Jinping and the party,” said Jude Blanchette, who studies the party at The Conference Board’s China Center for Economics and Business in Beijing, referring to Xi’s thought getting into the constitution.

“Add on to this having supply-side structural reform and One Belt One Road written into this, which were Xi’s signature policies, this makes questioning or non-compliance with those tantamount to betrayal of the party.”

THE MARKET AND THE PARTY

Xu Hongcai, deputy chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, a Beijing think-tank, said party control was needed to push through the market reforms key to restructuring the world’s second-largest economy.

“To build a market economic system in such a big country, it’s impossible without the leadership of the party,” he said.

Others have argued that the two are contradictory.

“When you put ‘supply-side reform’ and ‘market playing a decisive role’ in the same document, then that just shows they have to almost choose one,” said Alex Wolf, Senior Emerging Markets Economist with Aberdeen Standard Investments in Hong Kong.

China’s blue-chip shares climbed to a 26-month high on Tuesday, led by infrastructure and property stocks, as Xi wrapped up a congress that began with his three-and-a half hour speech envisioning a more prosperous, confident China. The yuan strengthened against the dollar.

CROWNING GLORY?

Xi rapidly consolidated power after assuming party leadership in late 2012 and then the presidency the next year. The party gave Xi the title of “core” leader a year ago, a significant strengthening of his position.

Whether Xi was able to have his name “crowned” in the party constitution had been seen as a key measure of his power, elevating him to a level of previous leaders exemplified by Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.

No other leader since Mao has had an eponymous ideology included in the document while in office. Deng’s name was added after his death in 1997.

A list of 133 committee members for the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection released on Tuesday included Zhao Leji, who heads the party’s Organisation Department, a strong sign that he will take over from Wang as anti-corruption chief.

China’s top banking regulator, Guo Shuqing, and veteran banker Jiang Chaoliang, front runners to succeed Zhou Xiaochuan as central bank governor, both made it to the Central Committee.

The constitutional amendment, along with Xi’s work report and a work report of the graft watchdog to the congress, were passed by a show of hands.

When Xi next asked for any “no” votes or abstentions for the amendment or two work reports, the sound of “none” echoed throughout the chamber, as officials shouted out from different sides of the hall.","China enshrines 'Xi Jinping Thought', key Xi ally to step down",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CT0C9-OCATP

IHS Markit’s euro zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index for October, seen as a good guide to overall economic growth, fell to 55.9 from September’s 56.7, still comfortably above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.

October’s reading was below all expectations in a Reuters poll, which had forecast a more modest dip to 56.5, but was still much higher than it has averaged in recent years.

“Despite declining in October, the euro zone Composite PMI suggests that the economic recovery continued at a healthy pace at the start of Q4,” said Stephen Brown at Capital Economics.

Germany’s private sector posted the highest increase in new orders in 6-1/2 years in October, implying Europe’s largest economy started the fourth quarter on a solid footing. France’s business rebound meanwhile showed no sign of slowing as activity rose more than expected.

“Based on the German and French figures, the average PMI for Spain and Italy probably fell, perhaps because issues in Catalonia weighed on business activity in Spain,” Brown said.

Catalonia’s independence drive and its potential fallout has affected markets. Madrid has said it will impose direct rule on the region, which accounts for a fifth of Spain’s economy.

The robust growth came as firms jacked up prices. The output prices index climbed to 53.3 from 52.7, its highest since June 2011.

Inflation has stubbornly refused to reach the European Central Bank’s 2 percent target ceiling but a recent Reuters poll predicted policymakers will say on Thursday they plan to start trimming monthly asset purchases in January. [ECILT/EU]

A PMI covering the bloc’s dominant service industry sank to 54.9 from 55.8, missing all expectations in a Reuters poll that predicted a reading of 55.6.

But suggesting firms think the slowdown won’t last, they hired staff at the second fastest rate in over nine years. The employment index rose to 54.3 from 53.7 and has only been higher once -- in March -- since early 2008.

Manufacturing growth, on the other hand, accelerated. The factory PMI came in at 58.6 compared to September’s 58.1, its highest since February 2011. It was forecast at 57.8 and was better than anyone polled by Reuters predicted.

An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, dipped to 58.7 from 59.2.

Indicating the momentum might continue, new orders picked up. The sub index was 58.7 compared to September’s 58.5, matching a more than six-year high set in June.

Auto trade associations representing General Motors Co (GM.N) Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and nearly every other major automaker, are part of the coalition dubbed “Driving American Jobs” and backing an advertising campaign to convince the White House and voters that the agreement has been crucial in boosting U.S. automotive sector production and jobs.

Trump has threatened to withdraw from the trade deal with U.S., Canada and Mexico, which is heavily utilized by automakers who have production and supply chains spread across the three countries.

In the most recent round of talks to renegotiate NAFTA last week, Trump proposed changes to the rules of origin for autos, which are used to determine how much of an auto is made in a certain place. The proposed rules were viewed as untenable for automakers, as well as Mexico and Canada.

The auto industry joins the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other large business groups that have become more vocal in recent weeks about Trump’s efforts to change the 23-year-old accord, saying they would be detrimental to American jobs.

The auto coalition, which includes the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association and American International Automobile Dealers Association, said ending NAFTA, which underpins $1.2 trillion in annual trade between the three countries, would put U.S. auto sector jobs at risk.

They pointed to $9.5 billion in new investments announced this year by the auto and auto parts sector and feature the personal stories of auto sector employees throughout America - from plant workers to auto dealership personnel.

“We need you to tell your elected officials that you don’t change the game in the middle of a comeback. We’re winning with NAFTA,” the group said on its website.

The campaign comes amid rising concern that the Trump administration could opt early next year to withdraw after giving six months notice, a move that could expose automakers to high tariffs who are building trucks in Mexico and impose new tariffs on parts and cars made throughout North America.

President Donald Trump told the Fox Business Network in an interview that aired Sunday he thinks the deal will “probably” be renegotiated, but said he will withdraw if it is not fair. “We can’t allow the world to look at us as a whipping post. Not going to happen anymore,” Trump said.

The Chamber of Commerce accused the Trump administration of trying to sabotage the talks with “poison pill proposals,” including demands for more favorable treatment for the U.S. side on car production, and a “sunset clause” to force regular negotiations.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said earlier this month the Trump administration was focused on trying to get an agreement that was fair but said he had “seen no indication that our partners are willing to make any changes that will result in a rebalancing and a reduction in these huge trade deficits.”

Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in the region must be from North America to be able to enter the marketplace tariff-free.

A couple of miles (km) from the bustling Otay Mesa border crossing in San Diego, eight towering chunks of concrete and steel stand as high as 30 feet (9 meters) tall against the sky, possible models for what Trump has promised will one day be a solid wall extending the full length of the southern border, from California to Texas.

Whether any of the eight different prototypes, constructed over the last month, become part of an actual wall remains highly uncertain.

The U.S. Congress has so far shown little interest in appropriating the estimated $21.6 billion it would cost to build the wall.

Still, border patrol officials on Monday welcomed the momentum on Trump’s pledge, which generated a groundswell of voter support that helped elect him to office.

“Our current infrastructure is well over two decades old,” Roy Villareal, deputy chief patrol agent of the U.S. Border Patrol’s San Diego sector, said during a tour with media organizations on Monday morning. “Is there need for improvement? Absolutely.”

Currently, 654 miles (1,052 km) of the 1,900-mile (3,058-km)border with Mexico is fenced, with single, double or triple fences. The second line of fencing in San Diego, about 18 feet (5.50 m) tall, has been breached nearly 2,000 times in the last three years, Villareal said.

Even if Trump’s wall never gets funded, Villareal said, the border patrol might incorporate one or more of the new wall designs as it replaces worn sections of the existing fence.

Six contractors from across the country were selected to build the eight prototypes, all of which will be completed this week.

The builders paid attention to aesthetics in their bid to win lucrative contracts. One wall segment features deep-blue steel and another has a brick facade, standing in sharp contrast to the area’s existing border fence, a ramshackle structure of corrugated steel left over from the Vietnam War.

In late November, a private company, which border patrol officials declined to name, will begin a 30- to 60-day process of testing the wall prototypes to determine how easy they would be to climb over or dig beneath.

The final selection could be a combination of the prototype designs, Villareal said.

While solid, concrete walls have a daunting presence, they might have an adverse effect on some border patrol activities, since agents would not be able to see potential crossers approaching the wall.

“It’s not so much the size of the wall, it’s the ability to see whether it’s 10 people or 30 people with ... rifles,” said Rowdy Adams, a former border patrol agent who left the agency in 2011 after 30 years. “It’s important to see that and set your response plan in place.”

Two of the eight prototypes have a see-through design.

Environmentalists have warned that a solid wall would prevent wildlife, including a dwindling population of federally protected ocelots, from crossing.

A concrete wall may also prove challenging to build without participation from some of the world’s largest concrete suppliers.

Diane Rwigara and her mother, Adeline, who was also refused bail, said they planned to appeal. Her sister Anne, who is a U.S. citizen, was granted bail.

All three women are charged with inciting insurrection while Diane is also accused of forging the signatures of some people she said backed her run for president. Rwigara has said the charges are intended to silence her family and supporters as punishment for her political ambitions.

Rejecting the bail request, the lead judge on a three-member panel said there was “strong evidence” to prosecute Rwigara.

“Both Diane Rwigara and Adeline Rwigara must be remanded for 30 days,” she said.

The 35-year-old accountant has repeatedly accused Kagame of stifling dissent and criticized his Rwandan Patriotic Front’s near total grip since it fought its way to power to end a genocide in 1994.

She had planned to run against Kagame in the August poll but her candidacy was blocked by the electoral board on the grounds that she had not submitted enough supporters’ signatures and some of the names she did send in belonged to dead people.

Kagame won the election with 98.8 percent of the vote.

Adeline and Anne Rwigara had earlier told the court that they and Diane were tortured and deprived of food while in jail awaiting trial, including being kept in solitary confinement and “handcuffed day and night”.

On Friday, a U.N. subcommittee on the prevention of torture suspended a visit to Rwanda, citing obstructions by authorities.

The Rwandan government denied impeding the investigators’ work and said the allegations were baseless.

Diane’s brother Arioste Rwigara said the bail denial was “absurd” and the charges against his mother and sisters were like those used by “tyrannical governments of the middle ages”.

Kagame won international praise for restoring stability in Rwanda and presiding over a rapid economic recovery after the genocide, in which an estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and politically moderate ethnic Hutus were killed.

But human rights groups say he has muzzled independent media and suppressed potential democratic opponents. Some critics of the government have been imprisoned or killed.

“The hawkish speculation about a new Fed chair has added some downside pressure,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen.

President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday he is “very, very close” to making his decision on who should chair the U.S. Federal Reserve.

A hawkish candidate would be expected to favour higher interest rates, boosting the value of the dollar and making the greenback-denominated metal more expensive for holders of other currencies.

Spot gold slipped 0.3 percent to $1,277.51 an ounce by 1250 GMT, after hitting its lowest since Oct. 6 at $1,271.86 in the previous session.

U.S. gold futures for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,278.90 per ounce.

Spot gold has shed 6 percent since touching a 1-year high of $1,357.54 on Sept. 8, largely due to a rebound in the dollar on expectations that the Fed will boost interest rates in December.

The Fed will raise rates in December and twice next year, according to a Reuters poll of economists, who now worry that the central bank will slow its tightening because of expectations that inflation will remain low.

“Stocks, even though we had a correction yesterday, are holding near record highs, removing some of the demand on that front. Geopolitics have faded a bit recently and that has added to the downwards move,” Hansen added.

MSCI’s 47-country world share index hovered near its recent all-time highs after a drop in General Electric shares on Wall Street had seen the ViX volatility index spike up.

“I‘m very surprised we’re up here. Risk is still on if you look at stock markets. Generally gold should be lower ... I was expecting gold to drift down to $1,260 area,” said the Hong Kong-based trader.

“We’ll probably consolidate around $1,275-$1,285 until some Fed news comes out.”

Platinum gained 0.1 percent to $922.30 an ounce while palladium dipped 0.1 percent to $958 an ounce.

“I think there’s still belief in the market that palladium can continue to outperform,” Hansen said.

“If we see the (palladium-platinum) spread widen above $50 then we could probably see another extension up towards the $75 area.”

President Maithripala Sirisena’s government in 2015 agreed with the U.N. to investigate alleged war crimes in the final phase of a 26-year civil war. It then requested a two-year extension to fulfill that commitment.

Both sides in the conflict - the government military and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam - were equally responsible for war crimes, according to the U.N.

The government has agreed to establish a special court to investigate the alleged crimes and return land occupied by the military in the north.

However, much of the process has been delayed by the government amid worries it will lose popularity among Sinhala Buddhists, Sri Lanka’s majority community, analysts say.

After a two-week fact-finding mission, U.N. special rapporteur Pablo de Greiff said such delays raise questions about the determination of the government to undertake a comprehensive transitional justice program.

“Long delays between the acknowledgment of obligations to establish transitional justice measures and the fulfillment of these involves risks: no one should be under the impression that waiting is a costless alternative,” he told reporters in Colombo after concluding his mission.

He also said the process has been increasingly ethnicized.

”As a result, transitional justice is represented

as if it were essentially a threat to the majority community, of interest to one of the minorities only – and all others left at the margins,” he said.

Many Sri Lankans oppose foreign involvement, and supporters of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa believe the U.N. resolution on the need to investigate war crimes aims to punish the military unfairly.

The international community has urged a judicial process to hold out a realistic prospect of punishment for senior figures in Rajapaksa’s government and military, as well as Tamil Tiger rebels, who waged a bitter final battle in which the U.N. has said up to 40,000 people were killed.",U.N. says Sri Lanka's delay in post-war reconciliation involves risks,https://www.reuters.com/article/sri-lanka-rights-un/u-n-says-sri-lankas-delay-in-post-war-reconciliation-involves-risks-idINKBN1CS2I0

Instead, the struggle will, as it did during the fight against the Sunni extremists of Islamic State, involve shifting Sunni and Shi’ite allegiances.

For the moment, there seems to be an easing in the historic tensions between the two main – and often warring – branches of Islam. Religious differences are not the focus; this is a classic geopolitical power struggle for control of Iraq, Syria, and Kurdistan, and for expanding diplomatic and strategic reach throughout the region.

Iran is lined up to be the big winner in Syria. Islamic State's defeat will significantly lessen Sunni influence, and Tehran’s role as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's protector will only increase now that it appears Assad will remain in control of some portion of the country. Iran will have pieced together a land corridor to the Mediterranean. The Saudis will be left with little influence.

The same goes for the United States. American forces have been largely relegated to playing traffic cop among various on-again off-again allies such as the Turks and Kurds, each with its own agenda in Syria. Any influence Washington thinks it still has is further diluted by the presence of the Russians, who are there to support Assad while maintaining a permanent presence in the heart of the Middle East. American efforts may wind up as little more than fumbling around to keep Israel and Jordan from overreacting to the increased Iranian influence on their borders.

In Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, Riyadh appears to be pivoting towards warmer relations with the Shi’ite government in Baghdad. That a Saudi airline is announcing the first return of direct service between the two countries since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 is no coincidence, nor is it an isolated event.

The Saudis also appear ready to take advantage of a looming intra-Shi’ite power struggle in Baghdad among Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, and Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Sadr, the most religiously zealous of the group, has always been something of a nationalist and is wary of Iranian influence. It is thus not surprising he made friendly trips under official invitation to Sunni Riyadh, and the United Arab Emirates, in recent months.

Sadr is an interesting choice for the Saudis to use to gain influence in Baghdad. Real progress for Riyadh means untangling years of close Iranian cooperation in Iraq, to include limiting the power of the Iranian-backed militias. Sadr has significant influence in that respect, and can use his popularity and credibility to sell Saudi cooperation to his followers who remember Saudi funding of al Qaeda in Iraq and Islamic State over the years. Enhancing Sadr's Shi’ite religious status can further Sunni Saudi goals. During his visit, the Saudis gifted Sadr with $10 million for “rebuilding,” and also astutely threw in some visas for this year’s Hajj pilgrimage for Sadr to distribute.

The Saudis otherwise have little to work with in Iraq compared to Iran. Tehran’s ties to officials in Baghdad are just a tiny part of a deep relationship forged in the bloody fight against the American occupiers and the ousting of Islamic State. Iranian money continues to support Iraq, and the Shi’ite militias are still mostly under Iranian influence.

Iran is also probably the most stable Muslim nation in the Middle East. It has existed more or less within its current borders for thousands of years, and is largely religiously, culturally, and linguistically homogeneous (though keep an eye on the Kurdish minority.) While governed in significant part by its clerics, the country has held a series of increasingly democratic elections. And unlike the Saudi monarchs, Iran’s leaders do not rule in fear of an Islamic revolution. They already had one.

Power struggles create flashpoints, and the Saudi-Iranian fight post-Islamic State is no exception. The Saudi-Iranian proxy war in Yemen has settled into a version of World War One-style trench warfare, with neither side strong enough to win nor weak enough to lose. In an ugly form of stasis, the conflict seems likely to stay within its present borders.

The powder keg is Kurdistan. Though arguably a de facto state since 2003, after the Kurds voted formally voted for independence in a Sept. 25 referendum, Iran and the Iranian-backed government in Baghdad were pressed to make clear they will not tolerate an actual Kurdish nation. With Islamic State nearly defeated and combat-tested Shi’ite militias ready for their next tasks, Tehran and Baghdad no longer need to keep the Kurds on their side. Fighting has already broken out around Kirkuk, an oil-rich city in Iraqi Kurdistan, between forces supported by Baghdad/Tehran and Kurdish fighters – leaving a gap for the Saudis to offer financial or covert support to the Iraqi Kurds.

Saudi involvement could morph an Iraqi civil war into a new proxy struggle right on Iran’s own western border, with the possible complication of further unrest inside Iran by its Kurdish minority.

While it may seem odd to write about the changing balance of power in the Middle East largely leaving out the United States, that may well describe America’s range of options post-Islamic State.

Washington’s influence in Baghdad is limited and relations with Iran are in shambles under the Trump administration. It is highly unlikely America will join Iran to fight against Kurdish allies who helped defeat Islamic State. Nor are American troops likely to battle Iranian-led militias in support of Kurdish independence that Washington says it doesn’t really support right now.

That leaves the United States sidelined, with few options other than perhaps supporting the Saudis from afar in whatever anti-Iranian meddling they do in Iraq. A long fall from the heady days of 2003 when America was going to remake the Middle East. The victor after some 14 years of overlapping struggles? In the post-Islamic State Middle East, look for Tehran to emerge dominant.",Commentary: What you need to know about the post-IS battle for the Mideast,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-afterislamicstate-commentary/commentary-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-post-is-battle-for-the-middle-east-idUSKBN1CT2CL

The subpoena, which has not been made public, requests information regarding how each complaint related to sexual harassment or other discrimination was handled by the Weinstein company, the person familiar with the probe said.

It also asks for management’s criteria for hiring, promoting, casting, rejecting or terminating applicants or employees, the person said. The source added that the New York subpoena is part of an investigation into whether executives at the company violated state civil rights or New York City human rights laws.

Harvey Weinstein was fired from the company earlier this month in the wake of media reports that he sexually harassed or assaulted women in incidents dating back to the 1980s.

Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.

Representatives for the Weinstein Company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In response to a request for comment on the investigation, the attorney general’s office emailed a statement from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman that said, “No New Yorker should be forced to walk into a workplace ruled by sexual intimidation, harassment, or fear.

”If sexual harassment or discrimination is pervasive at a company, we want to know.”

The New York Times reported earlier this month that Weinstein, 65, had reached eight previously undisclosed settlements with women who accused him of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact. The New Yorker magazine reported that 13 women had claimed that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them.

The New York City Police Department has said it is investigating an allegation of sexual assault by Weinstein in 2004. The Los Angeles Police Department also said earlier this month that it is investigating a 2013 sexual assault allegation against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.",New York opens sexual harassment probe of Weinstein Co.: source,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CS2RD-OCAEN

Die Tarifkommission strebe für die über 100.000 Mitarbeiter bei VW und der Tochter Financial Services eine Tariferhöhung um sechs Prozent für zwölf Monaten an, teilte die Gewerkschaft am Dienstag in Hannover mit. Damit entspricht die prozentuale Forderung dem, was sich die IG Metall bei den bundesweiten Verhandlungen mit den Arbeitgebern in der Metall- und Elektroindustrie vornimmt.

Niedersachsens IG-Metall-Chef Thorsten Gröger sagte, auch die VW-Mitarbeiter hätten ein ordentliches Gehaltsplus verdient. “Die große Mehrheit der Beschäftigten hat die Entwicklungen im Zusammenhang mit der Dieselaffäre nicht zu verantworten.” VW-Betriebsratschef Bernd Osterloh fügte hinzu, die Belegschaft habe sich in den vergangenen zwei Jahren trotz des Abgasskandals über das normale Maße hinaus engagiert. “Nur deshalb gehen die Zahlen der Kernmarke Volkswagen wieder nach oben.” Zudem wolle die Gewerkschaft erreichen, dass Volkswagen den Beitrag zur betrieblichen Altersversorgung dauerhaft verbessere. Um die Digitalisierung und den Wandel zum Mobilitätsdienstleister zu bewältigen, würden auf lange Sicht mehr Auszubildende in diesen Zukunftsbereichen benötigt.

Volkswagen erklärte, bei dem Unternehmen sei noch keine Forderung eingegangen.

The two stocks contributed nearly 140 points to the Dow’s 170 point rise.

the S&P 500 .SPX was up 4.39 points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,569.37 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 14.78 points, or 0.22 percent, at 6,601.61.

However, gains in the S&P and the Nasdaq were kept in check by healthcare companies.

Biogen (BIIB.O) slipped 6.56 percent after reporting disappointing U.S. sales of Spinraza, a potential blockbuster drug.

Centene (CNC.N) dipped 4.19 percent after saying that White House moves to cut off Obamacare subsidies would knock 7-12 cents per share off the health insurer’s fourth-quarter earnings.

That along with a 1.4 percent drop in Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and a 2.5 percent decline in AbbVie AAB.N made the healthcare index .SPXHC the worst performer among the S&P sectors.

Financial stocks .SPY also jumped 0.69 percent, led by gains in Bank of America B.ACN and JPMorgan (JPM.N).

General Motors GKM.N rose 2.50 percent after the No.1 U.S. automaker reaffirmed its full-year earnings forecast and promised to slash stocks of unsold vehicles.

Whirlpool (WHR.N) tumbled 10.02 percent after the home appliances maker reported profit and sales below estimates and lowered full-year earnings guidance.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

Quarterly sales and profit beat Street estimates despite problems with its new fuel-saving geared turbofan (GTF) engines, which caused its customers to delay deliveries of planes.

United Technologies was forced to take a $196 million charge in the quarter after it held back some shipments of GTF engines and offered spares to airlines, which had been facing problems with engines already in service.

Shares of United Technologies initially rose nearly 2 percent, before retreating to stand just under 1 percent. Airbus, the biggest customer of GTF engines, rose 2.4 percent to a record.

“It was unfortunate we couldn’t meet our commitments to Airbus (AIR.PA) and Bombardier (BBDb.TO), but they understood the need to keep the customers flying,” Chief Executive Greg Hayes said on a conference call.

Easing a months-long standoff over delays in supplying engines, Hayes said the company also planned to make some design changes to improve engine durability.

Reuters reported on Monday that Airbus had seen evidence of progress on technical problems at Pratt & Whitney and was more confident in the pace of shipments despite losing some engines to the spares pool: a shift confirmed by United Technologies on Tuesday..

United Technologies is spending more money to speed up production of its GTF engines that power Airbus’ newest narrow-body jet, the A320neo, and Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft.

The company said it shipped 254 GTF engines year-to-date, and remained on track to build 350-400 GTF engines in 2017. United Technologies had delivered 138 of these engines in 2016.

Hayes also defended United Technologies’ $23 billion proposal to buy Rockwell Collins (COL.N) to forge a giant new aerospace supplier after criticism from Boeing (BA.N), saying the U.S. planemaker had benefited from United Technologies’ earlier purchase of aero parts maker Goodrich.

United Technologies raised its 2017 adjusted earnings per share forecast to $6.58-$6.63 from $6.45-$6.60. The company also increased the lower end of its sales forecast range to $59.0 billion from $58.5 billion, but kept the top end at $59.5 billion.

Adjusted earnings per share fell to $1.73 in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $1.76, but beat analysts’ expectations of $1.69, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Facebook has its European headquarters in Ireland and has argued that only the Irish data protection authority has the power to police it for its processing of Europeans’ data. Nonetheless other European privacy regulators, including the French, Belgian and German authorities, have taken action against the U.S. company.

Yves Bot, advocate general at the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), said in a non-binding opinion that any national authority could take action against a company for breaching data protection laws in the context of its activities in the country, even if the company is established in another member state.

The case stems from a dispute about a German fan page on Facebook which collected data on visitors to that page by storing a cookie on their hard drive.

A German court asked the ECJ whether a German data protection authority had jurisdiction over Facebook given its Irish subsidiary Facebook Ireland was responsible for its data processing activities in Europe.

Bot said that since the data processing at issue via the installation of cookies “is specifically intended to enable Facebook better to target the advertisements which it publishes,” it could be considered as being part of the activities undertaken by Facebook Germany, which is responsible for the promotion and sale of advertising space in Germany.

A spokeswoman for Facebook said: “We respectfully disagree with the Advocate General and await the European Court’s decision.”

Opinions from Advocate Generals tend to be followed by the Court’s judges in a majority of cases. A final ruling should follow in the coming months.

A new EU data protection law will come into force in May next year which seeks to make life easier for multinational businesses like Facebook by introducing a “one stop shop” principle whereby they would only have to deal with the authority in the member state of their main establishment.

But Bot pointed out that the new law was not yet in effect and the current framework enables each member state to apply its own national legislation, thereby making the “application of multiple national legislations possible”.",Facebook dealt setback by EU court adviser in privacy dispute,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-court-facebook/facebook-dealt-setback-by-eu-court-adviser-in-privacy-dispute-idUKKBN1CT2BF

About 600,000 people have crossed the border since Aug. 25 when Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts were met by a counter-offensive by the Myanmar army in Rakhine state which the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.

“This is an untenable situation,” Shameem Ahsan, Bangladesh’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told a U.N. pledging conference. “Despite claims to the contrary, violence in Rakhine state has not stopped. Thousands still enter on a daily basis.”

Vital humanitarian aid must continue, Ahsan said, adding: “It is of paramount importance that Myanmar delivers on its recent promises and works towards safe, dignified, voluntary return of its nationals back to their homes in Myanmar.”

Bangladesh’s interior minister was in Yangon on Monday for talks to find a “durable solution”, he said.

But Myanmar continued to issue “propaganda projecting Rohingyas as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh”, Ahsan said, adding: “This blatant denial of the ethnic identity of Rohingyas remains a stumbling block.”

Myanmar considers the Rohingya to be stateless, although they trace their presence in the country back generations.

Filippo Grandi, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, later told journalists that the two countries had begun talks on “repatriation”.

Conducive conditions have to be “recreated” in Rakhine, he said. “This must include a solution to the question of citizenship, or rather lack thereof for the Rohingya community,” Grandi said.

Khaled al-Jarallah, deputy foreign minister of Kuwait, called on Myanmar authorities to “cease the practice of stripping the Rohingya minority of their right of citizenship, which as a result deprives them of the right to property and employment”.

“THE WALKING DEAD”

Jordan’s Queen Rania visited Rohingya refugee camps on Monday and called for a stronger response from the international community to the plight of the Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh to escape “systematic persecution” in Myanmar.

“One has to ask, why is the plight of this Muslim minority group being ignored? Why has the systematic prosecution been allowed to play out for so long?” she asked after touring the camps.

The United Nations has appealed for $434 million to provide life-saving aid to 1.2 million people for six months. A total of $344 million has been raised so far, a final U.N. statement said.

“We need more money to keep pace with intensifying needs. This is not an isolated crisis, it is the latest round in a decades-long cycle of persecution, violence and displacement,” U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock told the talks.

An estimated 1,000-3,000 Rohingya still enter Bangladesh daily, William Lacy Swing, head of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. He called them: “these most rejected and vulnerable people in the world.”

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Europe remains a battleground between nationalist forces, conventional right or left governments and parties which cleave to broadly liberal positions. It is not alone. Across the world, the same impulses to define a state according to ethnic or historic criteria, or to put existing states “first,” grow in diverse forms.

Two referenda illuminate the trend. One, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq on Sept. 25, produced an almost 93 percent vote in favor of Kurdish independence, followed by an immediate demand from the Iraqi government to invalidate the vote and a threat to use the army to suppress any move to independence. On Sunday the citizens of the Catalonia region will vote on whether to secede from Spain – provided that the Spanish state, which has already arrested leaders of the referendum and confiscated voting materials, does not carry out threats to block all voting stations.

The tone in the democratic world is often set by the United States – no longer the champion of greater openness and cooperation, but now the promoter of America First. Work began earlier this week on prototypes for Donald Trump’s “beautiful” wall between Mexico and the United States; the president extended his travel ban to the citizens of three more states (Chad, North Korea and Venezuela) while dropping one, Somalia, from the list – this to align immigration “with his America First foreign policy vision.”

Europe, though, is the hub of nationalist struggles. In large part, this is because the nationalist politicians pit themselves against the continent’s large ambition to create a European Union which, in its enthusiasts’ view, should become a powerful, federal state through progressive integration – a perspective powerfully supported by the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker in his “state of the Union” address earlier this month.

Immigration has been and remains the spur for the nationalists. Its growing unpopularity fills out their sails and brings them votes from all over the political compass, including a significant proportion from working class voters accustomed to voting left, even far left.

In Germany’s general election last weekend, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) soared to become the third-largest party in the Bundestag (parliament) behind the governing CDU/CSU center-right coalition and the center-left SPD, largely on strong opposition to immigration. One of the AfD leaders, Alexander Gauland, called Chancellor Angela Merkel’s opening of the borders to some one million migrants “a gift” to his party, which it gratefully accepted and used more successfully than even the party thought possible. Some commentators believe the shock to the German system – built for decades on a moderate consensus opposed to right-wing extremism of any kind – will “condemn Europe to permanent crisis.”

In Sweden, which has taken proportionately more migrants than any other European country over the past two years, crime, including shootings and riotous behavior, seems to have increased. The extent of that has been distorted by the right, but a careful analysis in the National Review does conclude that Sweden has “a growing problem with crime that is linked to immigration.”

The phenomenon was enough for the Migration Minister from neighboring Norway, Sylvi Listhaug – a member of the nationalist Progress Party, part of the governing coalition - to make a media-trailed visit to a Swedish “no-go area,” claiming during the visit that there are ""conditions of lawlessness and criminals in control"" in places with ""a large quantity of people with immigrant backgrounds."" The subtext was that this would not be permitted to happen in Norway. Her Swedish counterpart cancelled a scheduled meeting with her, saying her statement was “complete nonsense.""

In Central Europe, the Visegrad Group of states – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – have rejected requests from fellow members of the European Union to take in a quota of migrants. Earlier this week in Prague, I asked the leader of the ANO party, Andrej Babis, strongly favored to be prime minister after the October general election, what his policy toward the EU would be. He answered that he would demand a return of powers from Brussels to the national level, since the EU had no business dictating national policy – a popular view in the country. He has already made clear that he is wholly opposed to migrants being received in Europe.

In her speech on Brexit in Florence last week, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that the British had “never felt entirely comfortable” in the EU. It’s probably a fair summation of a national mood; most British have always seen the EU as a transactional, rather than political, union. When a sizable part of the population came to believe that the EU is both incomprehensible and overbearing, Brexit resulted.

Across the English Channel, Emmanuel Macron has put himself at the head of a revived and fiercely proactive campaign to rouse the EU to continue its forward march. In a speech Tuesday, the French president proclaimed that “the only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic.” Integration – in defense, security and within the eurozone, had to be more profound, he said.

It was the vision in which one will not compromise with the nationalist forces – forces which will weaken Merkel, his strongest ally, as she tries to balance Germany’s contending forces rather than embrace his euro-optimism.

Brexit has had the headlines, and attracted the most derision from the EU enthusiasts. But nationalism – the wish to create, or to strengthen, the nation state against real or mythic enemies – remains a dominant current in the politics of the democratic countries.

Ma anche la Spagna ha fatto meglio sul fronte degli investimenti (3,047 miliardi), “ma otto deal hanno pesato per 2,4 miliardi”.","MILANO, 24 ottobre (Reuters) - L‘industria del private equity italiana nel primo semestre ha registrato un rallentamento, conseguenza dell‘assenza, rispetto ad un anno prima, delle grandi operazioni.

E’ quanto emerge dall‘analisi condotta da Aifi, l‘associazione di categoria, in collaborazione con PwC-transaction services, presentata nel corso di un incontro con la stampa.

L‘ammontare investito tra gennaio e giugno è stato pari a 1,916 miliardi, in calo del 61% rispetto ad un anno prima. “Sono mancati i large e mega deal (equity investito superiore a 150 milioni)”, ha spiegato Anna Gervasoni, direttore generale di Aifi. A dominare gli investimenti sono sempre più gli operatori internazionali, che hanno pesato per 1,365 miliardi.

Il numero di operazioni, però, è salito del 10%, a 139, segno che l‘industria resta vivace, ma la taglia media dei deal, dopo l‘exploit dell‘anno scorso, è tornata allo standard medio-piccolo.

Innocenzo Cipolletta, presidente di Aifi, non ha nascosto una certa delusione, parlando di “andamento mediocre”. Gervasoni ha aggiunto che le prime indicazioni sui nove mesi “sono in linea con il semestre”; quindi, difficilmente a fine anno vedremo i numeri record del 2016.

Buono l‘andamento della raccolta: 1,195 miliardi (+61%); nell‘intero 2016 sono stati raccolti 1,313 miliardi. Ma il dato è fortemente influenzato da 711 milioni raccolti da QuattroR, “soggetto istituzionale” legato a Cdp. Interessante, analizzando la distribuzione della raccolta indipendente non istituzionale, il peso di investitori individuali e family office (48%), segno, ha notato Gervasoni, che “la tendenza è guardare sempre più al canale alto e altissimo” del risparmio.

Per quanto riguarda il private debt, nel primo semestre sono stati raccolti 295 milioni, contro 375 milioni di un anno prima, perché gli operatori che hanno seminato negli anni scorsi ora stanno raccogliendo: gli investimenti, infatti, sono balzati del 123% in numero e del 179% in ammontare.

In calo l‘ammontare dei disinvestimenti: al netto dei write-off è calato del 18%, a 1,232 miliardi. Ma il numero dei disinvestimenti è salito del 44%, a 72.

More than 15,000 people have crossed the U.S.-Canadian border illegally to claim refugee status in Canada this year. Many were in the United States legally and some interviewed by Reuters said they might have stayed were it not for an immigration crackdown.

The influx, mainly at the Quebec/New York border, prompted the military to set up a temporary tent encampment in Quebec and sparked a backlash from anti-migrant groups.

Lawyers who have handled dozens of cases said that members of refugee tribunals, who evaluate requests for asylum, have grown more sympathetic toward people who have spent time in the United States and who say they now fear immigration policies under Trump.

Trump took office in January with a goal of sharply cutting refugee admissions, in line with the hard-line immigration policies that were a focal point of the Republican’s 2016 election campaign.

Of the 592 claims from border crossers finalized between March and September, 69 percent - or 408 in total - were accepted, according to Immigration and Refugee Board figures. An additional 92 appeals of rejected claims are pending.

That 69 percent acceptance rate is higher than the acceptance rate for all refugee claims from people who came to Canada through any method last year.

In a January asylum hearing whose transcript was seen by Reuters, a tribunal member told a Syrian refugee claimant and her daughter who had crossed near Lacolle, Quebec, that their explanation for not staying in the United States was “reasonable,” citing the woman’s worries about the new U.S. government.

“Certainly, that seems to be playing out as you have feared, and today on the news I know that President Trump has suspended the Syrian refugee program,” the member is quoted as saying. “You have provided, in my view, a reasonable explanation of your failure to claim in the U.S.”

A European Union bank structural reform law was proposed in 2014, a relatively late addition to rules rolled out after the 2007-09 banking crisis which resulted in taxpayer bailouts.

It was meant to be Europe’s answer to the U.S. Volcker Rule, a crisis-era measure banning Wall Street banks from speculating with their own money which is due to be scaled back significantly by U.S. regulators.

The EU draft law gave regulators powers to force banks to split off trading activities, but got bogged down over the criteria used to do so.

At the same time the mood among some policymakers was moving from the need for more new rules to nurturing economic growth in a region where the bulk of loans come from banks.

The European Commission said in its new workplan on Tuesday that it was withdrawing the measure with “no foreseeable agreement” in prospect.

“In addition, the main financial stability rationale of the proposal has in the meantime been addressed by other regulatory measures in the banking sector, and most notably the entry into force of the Banking Union’s supervisory and resolution arms.”

Big banks have since had to comply with other rules, such as issuing bonds that can be written down to replenish capital.

Gunnar Hoekmark, the centre-right Swede who was steering the measure through the European Parliament, said the EU executive had made the right decision.

“It was my firm belief that splitting up universal banks by separating retail from trade, investment and market making, would create instability and hinder investments and a more dynamic banking sector,” Hoekmark said in a statement.

The run-up to the Feb. 9-25 Olympics has been overshadowed by the escalating crisis on the Korean peninsula triggered by North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile tests but organizers said the Games would be safe. The traditional ceremony, introduced for the first time ahead of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, did not benefit this time from the Greek sun. Light rain and clouds forced the high priestess, played by actress Katerina Lechou, to deploy Monday’s backup flame instead of the reflector used to light the flame with the sun’s rays. “Our dream of hosting the Olympic winter Games has now become a reality. Korea is only the second Asian nation to have the honor of hosting the winter Games,” Games chief Lee Hee-beom said. “We want the international community to understand that we are committed to hosting a safe and secure Olympic winter Games.” The ceremony inside the stadium, site of the ancient Olympics, was also attended by South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach and the President of Greece, Prokopis Pavlopoulos. “The Olympic Games are sacred and universal,” Bach said. “They stand above and beyond all the differences that divide us. In our fragile world that seems to be drifting apart, the Olympic Games have the power to unite humanity in all its diversity.” Former Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-sung, among the most successful and decorated athletes from his country, was the first South Korean to run with the torch, picking up the flame from Greece’s Nordic skier Apostolos Aggelis, the first torch-bearer, just outside the ancient stadium.

“We will make sure to show the world how we have grown up, how we can organize this sports event,” Park told reporters after his short run.

“This is bigger than Seoul (summer Olympics) 1988. These are the largest winter Olympics ever and I am excited to be part of it.” The flame is due to arrive in South Korea on Nov. 1 for the start of the domestic torch relay as organizers look to boost local enthusiasm amid low ticket sales. Tensions on the Korean peninsula have risen in recent months as Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump exchanged threats and insults over the North’s nuclear and missile development program.

The effort, led by Democrat Ron Wyden and Republican Rand Paul, would require a warrant for queries of data belonging to any American collected under the program. The bill’s introduction is likely to add uncertainty to how Congress will renew a controversial portion of a spying law due to expire on Dec. 31.

Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is considered by U.S. intelligence officials to be among their most vital tools used to combat national and cyber security threats and help protect American allies.

It allows U.S. intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on and store vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the United States.

The surveillance program, classified details of which were exposed in 2013 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, also incidentally scoops up communications of Americans, including if they communicate with a foreign target living overseas.

Those communications can then be subject to searches without a warrant, including by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a practice that the USA Rights Act authored by Wyden and Paul would end.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) speaks at a press conference about the latest Republican Effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. September 25, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein

The measure is expected to be introduced with support from a wide berth of civil society groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and FreedomWorks, a Wyden spokesman said.

It would renew Section 702 for four years with additional transparency and oversight provisions, such as allowing individuals to more easily raise legal challenges against the law and expand the oversight jurisdiction of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a government privacy watchdog.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House of Representatives earlier this month introduced legislation seeking to add privacy protections to Section 702, including a partial restriction to the FBI’s ability to access U.S. data when seeking evidence of a crime.

But that was criticized by privacy groups as too narrow.

Separately, the Senate Intelligence Committee is expected to privately vote on Tuesday on a bill to reauthorize Section 702 that privacy advocates say will lack their reform priorities.

Wyden sent a letter on Monday urging committee leaders to allow a public vote, saying the bill “will have enormous impact on the security, liberty, and constitutional rights of the American people” and should be debated in the open.",Senators push bill requiring warrant for U.S. data under spy law,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-surveillance-congress/senators-push-bill-requiring-warrant-for-u-s-data-under-spy-law-idUSKBN1CT18J?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Rosa Weber atendeu a um pedido da Rede Sustentabilidade, que sustentou que a norma tinha o “inconfessável propósito” de inviabilizar uma das mais importantes políticas públicas, a de combate ao trabalho escravo.

Numa dura peça, o partido havia apontado em sua petição que a portaria foi uma das “mais abjetas barganhas” da história do país. “Trocou-se a impunidade na escravidão pela impunidade na corrupção”, criticou.

A Rede cita o fato de que a bancada ruralista no Congresso --setor sempre crítico à legislação sobre o tema-- é numerosa e coesa, tornando-se essencial para o presidente Michel Temer, especialmente no momento em que tramita na Câmara dos Deputados uma segunda denúncia criminal contra ele.

“Assim, certamente não foi por mera coincidência a edição, nesse exato momento, da malsinada Portaria do Ministério do Trabalho nº 1.129/2017, que, se cumprida, praticamente destruirá a política pública brasileira de combate ao trabalho escravo”, afirmou o partido.

A ministra também contestou a exigência de ato prévio do ministro do Trabalho para divulgar a chamada “lista suja” do trabalho escravo.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

The Irish airline, which sparked outrage in recent weeks by cancelling 20,000 flights, was due to introduce the changes aimed at speeding up boarding and eliminating delays from next week but will instead implement them from Jan. 15.

Ryanair cut its checked bag fees to 25 euros from 35 euros - at a cost of 50 million euros per year - and increased checked bag allowance to 20kg from 15kg when it announced the changes in September in a bid to reduce the volume of carry-on bags.

It said at the time that too many customers were availing of changes introduced in 2014 - when the airline moved to rid itself of a reputation for poor service - which permitted two carry-on bags free of charge.

“From (their) data, we know mothers sometimes browse at night, so we can offer flash sales when we know customers are browsing,” says Ambrose Chan, the Thai company’s CEO.

Southeast Asia is the world’s fastest-growing internet market, home to 600 million consumers from Vietnam to Indonesia via Singapore, many of them tech- and social media-savvy. They are rapidly spending more time and money online. A Nielsen study in 2015 estimated Southeast Asia’s middle-class will hit 400 million by 2020, doubling from 2012.

Consumer goods firms, such as Unilever (UNc.AS) and Japanese cosmetics firm Shiseido (4911.T), say the e-commerce boom allows them to push deeper into markets that can otherwise be difficult to understand and tough to penetrate due to poor retail networks and infrastructure.

“Data from Lazada has been used to position certain products where consumer preferences are different. For example, Thai customers like to buy diapers in special cartons, while Malaysians prefer multiple packs,” says Chan.

To reach more customers and get a better handle on their online behavior, consumer goods companies are forging partnerships with e-commerce firms like Lazada and fashion website Zalora.

POWERFUL, INSIGHTFUL

A customer who clicked on a 50 milliliter product may instead buy a smaller 30 ml product, said Pranay Mehra, vice president, digital and e-commerce at Shiseido Asia Pacific, noting that data and online selling experience can help firms bundle offers, decide on packaging and distribution, and influence where to set up a physical presence.

“This data is very powerful and very insightful, if used properly,” Mehra added.

Unilever, whose products range from Hellmann’s mayonnaise to Dove soap, said it is seeing more demand from rural consumers in developing markets like Indonesia and Vietnam.

“With all our e-commerce partners, we’re using data to help us find innovative solutions to unlock key barriers of high cost delivery and poor credit card penetration in remote areas,” said Anusha Babbar, e-commerce director at Unilever Southeast Asia and Australasia.

The conglomerate, which works with the likes of Singapore online grocer RedMart, Indonesia’s Blibli and Vietnam’s Tiki, said it introduced its St Ives skincare brand on Lazada after seeing a trend towards natural products and shopper search data.

DATA AND LOGISTICS

“Traditional retailers will struggle to see customer behavior,” said Lazada Thailand’s CEO, Alessandro Piscini. “We can tell if a customer is pregnant from their search behavior.”

Lazada, he said, plans to use data science to help its merchants customize offers for specific customer groups based on age, gender and other preferences.

Zalora, which sells clothing and accessories online in markets including Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, said it was working on ad-hoc projects with some brands to help them understand their customers based on data.

Lazada and Zalora are among the few e-commerce platforms that operate in multiple Southeast Asian countries. But the region is becoming a new battleground as Amazon (AMZN.O) and JD.com (JD.O) make beachheads in Singapore and Thailand.

Lazada Thailand will focus on partnering with fast-moving consumer goods companies to maintain its lead, Piscini said, and is expanding its logistics footprint across a region that has poor roads, clogged cities and thousands of often remote islands.

To be sure, online still contributes a tiny portion to consumer goods companies’ sales, but some local firms are going beyond partnerships and investing in their own e-commerce capabilities.

Thailand’s top consumer goods manufacturer Saha Group (SPI.BK) (SPC.BK) has seen online sales of some of its brands rise tenfold since it began a partnership with Lazada in June, but online still represents just 1-2 percent of total sales.

Saha is using e-commerce data to customize offerings.

“We now make real-time offerings to customers. Before, promotions would be seasonal,” Chairman Boonsithi Chokwatana told Reuters.

The company, whose products include instant noodles, toothpaste and laundry detergent, is investing 2 billion baht ($60 million) in logistics to support its e-commerce ambitions, including a 21-storey warehouse and a big data team, he said.",Consumer goods firms harness online data to tap Southeast Asia e-commerce boom,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecommerce-seasia/consumer-goods-firms-harness-online-data-to-tap-southeast-asia-e-commerce-boom-idUSKBN1CR0YC

The $80 billion payments firm, which announced estimates-beating third-quarter earnings on Thursday, is worth as much as American Express – more, if an after-hours bump in its stock holds up. At 31 times the next 12 months’ estimated earnings, it trades at a higher multiple than Visa or MasterCard. Justifying such a rapid rise requires Chief Executive Dan Schulman to execute well on four crucial strategies.

The PayPal logo is seen at a high-tech park in Beersheba, southern Israel August 28, 2017. Picture taken August 28, 2017. REUTERS/Amir Cohen

PayPal’s split from eBay in 2015 helped the company to capture multiple tailwinds as consumers increased their shift toward more convenient payment options than cash and checks – and grew increasingly impatient with the slow pace of technological change at traditional banks. The rise of e-commerce has helped, too. The biggest benefit, however, is the growth of smartphones.

Mobile transactions are growing about 50 percent annually, and now account for more than a third of volume, according to the company. PayPal’s Venmo service has even faster velocity. It’s a payments-cum-social media service that lets people send money to each other for free and post comments about what it’s for. Venmo handled $9 billion of payments last quarter, 93 percent more than the same period last year.

Trouble is, Schulman’s outfit gets precious little financial benefit for this service. Charging merchants to take Venmo payments, a service which launched this week, should change that. The risk is that the millennials who made the person-to-person feature so successful may balk at paying stores in the same manner.

Schulman’s second challenge is to ensure PayPal’s burgeoning lending business doesn’t overheat. The company’s loan portfolio now exceeds $6 billion, but the bigger it gets, the more investors will worry about rising defaults, which could drive down PayPal’s stock multiple. He also needs to make progress on his goal of increasing average usage of PayPal from two to three times a month toward his aspirational goal of two to three times a week.

Finally, Schulman needs to renegotiate the firm’s contract with eBay that expires in 2020. That accounted for 22 percent of revenue last year. There’s a lot of mutual dependence that ought to mean the odds of a split are low. But eBay has plenty of options. That Square could lose Starbucks and Costco could ditch American Express should convince Schulman to tread carefully.

He does, though, have momentum on his side. The future is his to lose.",Breakingviews - PayPal’s future rests on striking quadruple whammy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paypal-hldg-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-paypals-future-rests-on-striking-quadruple-whammy-idUSKBN1CO33D

The results are the first since Vishal Sikka quit as chief executive in August after a long row between the board and the company founders that frazzled investors and saw the return of Nandan Nilekani, a co-founder and a former CEO, as chairman.

Nilekani had said at the time he would prioritise finding a CEO, reconstituting the board and shaping future strategy. The company said the search for a new CEO is “progressing well” and it plans to stay the course on its future strategy.

“The management team along with the board of directors undertook a comprehensive review of our strategy ... Our current strategy continues to be relevant and we just need to accelerate the execution,” said U.B. Pravin Rao, interim CEO.

The Infosys board also reaffirmed that an internal investigation into alleged improprieties related to the acquisition of automation firm Panaya found no evidence of wrongdoing.

The company also said it would not make all findings of the investigation public. This drew criticism from some, who felt it leaves investors in the dark, especially as the founders, led by Narayana Murthy had faulted Sikka and former chair R. Seshasayee for not releasing all the findings previously.

“Investors will be left wondering as to the reasons why there was a need for a change of board in August,” said Shriram Subramanian, founder of shareholder advisory firm InGovern.

Sikka, Seshasayee and two others resigned from the board in August, ending a protracted battle with the founders, who accused the board of corporate governance lapses.

OUTLOOK CUT

Infosys cut its expected full-year revenue growth to 5.5 percent-6.5 percent in constant currency, compared with its previous guidance of a 6.5-8.5 percent increase.

Profit after tax rose 3.3 percent to 37.26 billion rupees ($573 million) in the second quarter, beating the average analysts’ estimate of 35.23 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Bengaluru-based Infosys said its revenue from operations rose 1.5 percent to 175.67 billion rupees in the second quarter. Revenue from the financial services segment rose marginally to 47.18 billion rupees.

Harit Shah, research analyst at Reliance Securities, said he had expected a trimming in the revenue growth forecast but had hoped for a smaller cut.

“The churn of top management and these board-related issues could have meant an impact in terms of clients freezing their programmes,” said Shah.

Infosys’s ADRs were trading down 3.5 percent at 1550 GMT after earlier dipping nearly 5 percent.

Contestualmente l‘autorità che vigila sul mercato ha anche approvato l‘offerta di scambio con cui i titolari di azioni Mps derivanti dal burden sharing del bond subordinato retail possono ricevere titoli di debito senior. L‘offerta partirà il 30 ottobre e, salvo proroghe, durerà fino al 17 novembre.

Con il ritorno in Borsa da domani della banca senese si chiude una lunga parentesi che ha visto l‘istituto fuori dal listino dopo la sospensione del 22 dicembre del 2016 in seguito al fallito tentativo di ricapitalizzazione sul mercato.

Da allora Mps è stata ricapitalizzata con l‘aiuto pubblico e il Tesoro è entrato temporaneamente nel capitale con una quota attuale del 52,18% che salirà al massimo al 67,76% dopo il riacquisto delle azioni che verranno portate in conversione dagli ex obbligazionisti retail che hanno subito il burden sharing.

L‘offerta per questi soggetti, si spiega in una nota di oggi di Mps, è subordinata alla pubblicazione del decreto del Mef in cui si definisce il riacquisto delle azioni oggetto di scambio da parte dell‘azionista pubblico.

”Ove, per qualsivoglia ragione il MEF non adotti il predetto Decreto o, comunque, non lo pubblichi (ad esito dell‘apposizione del visto sullo stesso da parte della Corte dei Conti) in

Da un recovery rate di 49,5 su 100 sui bond subordinati, secondo la valutazione emersa nell‘asta dei Cds del 21 settembre sulle obbligazioni subordinate di Mps, si può desumere quindi una valorizzazione da parte del mercato delle azioni di Mps attorno al 49,5% di 8,65 euro, ovvero 4,28 euro, un valore in linea con l‘indicazione giunta nelle ultime settimane dal mercato ‘over the counter’ del titolo azionario, con prezzi attorno a 4,20 euro.

Warriors 133, Mavericks 103

Stephen Curry escaped a suspension from the league on Monday night, then led the Golden State Warriors to a 133-103 victory over the Dallas Mavericks at American Airlines Center.

Curry had to wait until Monday afternoon to get a verdict from the NBA office whether he would be allowed to play. During Golden State’s 10-point loss at Memphis on Saturday, he lost his cool and chucked his mouthpiece in the direction of the referee.

Once he learned he would get only a fine, the two-time league MVP finished with a game-high 29 points. He made up for cold 3-point shooting (2 of 10) by going 13 of 13 from the free-throw line to help the Warriors improve to 2-2 on the season.

Kevin Durant finished with 25 points, eight rebounds and six assists, and Klay Thompson added 21 points for Golden State. Draymond Green had 10 points, eight assists and seven rebounds.

Grizzlies 98, Rockets 90

Mike Conley keyed a 13-0 run in the fourth quarter to help Memphis rally for a victory over Houston.

With the Rockets leading 88-78 just past the midpoint of the fourth quarter, Conley sandwiched two 3-pointers around a three-point play from James Ennis III on which Conley provided the assists. The second Conley trey matched the Grizzlies’ biggest lead at 94-90. Memphis closed the game on a 20-2 run.

Marc Gasol paced the Grizzles (3-0) with 26 points. Conley added 17 points and four assists. Ennis chipped in a double-double with 14 points and 11 boards. Eric Gordon led Houston with 27 points and added seven assists. Backcourt partner James Harden posted 22 points and eight assists but also registered a game-high seven turnovers.

Spurs 101, Raptors 97

LaMarcus Aldridge scored 20 points and Dejounte Murray added 16 points and 15 rebounds as San Antonio outlasted Toronto to remain unbeaten.

The score was tied at 85 with 5:55 to play before the Spurs used a Danny Green 3-pointer, two Kyle Anderson baskets and a Green turnaround hook shot to forge a 9-0 run that staked them to a 94-85 lead with 3:08 left.

Green had 17 points for San Antonio, which played again without injured forward Kawhi Leonard and point guard Tony Parker. DeMar DeRozan led the Raptors and all scorers with 28 points. Serge Ibaka and C.J. Miles added 13 points each. Jakob Poeltl had 10 points and 12 rebounds for Toronto.

Heat 104, Hawks 93

Josh Richardson scored eight of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, and Wayne Ellington scored 19 of his 20 in the second quarter to lead Miami past Atlanta.

Richardson, in his third year in the NBA, put up just his fourth career game of 20 or more points. He was pivotal to the Heat’s effort in the fourth quarter, scoring on a layup, a mid-range jumper and four free throws.

Ellington made 6 of 7 3-point tries in the second quarter, tying Brian Shaw for a franchise record. In 1992-93, Shaw made six 3-pointers in a quarter and 10 for the game. Atlanta was led by Kent Bazemore (20 points), Taurean Prince (20 points) and John Collins (14 points, 11 rebounds).

76ers 97, Pistons 86

Ben Simmons posted a triple-double in his fourth career game, and Philadelphia collected its first win of the season by downing Detroit.

Simmons, the top pick in the 2016 draft, piled up 21 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists. He missed all of last season after undergoing foot surgery but has double-doubles in each of his first four games. Joel Embiid powered for 30 points and nine rebounds, and Robert Covington added 13 points for Philadelphia.

Reggie Jackson led Detroit with 16 points and seven assists, and he added six rebounds. Avery Bradley supplied 15 points for the Pistons, and Andre Drummond contributed 14 points with 14 rebounds.

Bucks 103, Hornets 94

Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 32 points and Chris Middleton added 20 to lead Milwaukee to a victory over Charlotte.

Antetokounmpo surpassed 30 points for the fourth time in four games this season. With 147 combined points in those games, he passed Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -- who scored 146 to open the 1972-73 season -- for the most points through four games in franchise history.

Mirza Teletovic hit five 3-pointers to finish with 15 points as Milwaukee went 9 of 26 from long distance and shot 47.1 percent overall. Frank Kaminsky hit three of his four 3-point shots and led Charlotte with 18 points off the bench. Jeremy Lamb added 17 points, and Kemba Walker and former Bucks player Johnny O‘Bryant finished with 15 and 14, respectively.

Wizards 109, Nuggets 104

Bradley Beal scored 20 points, John Wall had 19 points and 12 assists, and Washington beat Denver.

Otto Porter Jr. added 17 points and 10 rebounds for the unbeaten Wizards, who began their four-game Western Conference road trip with a solid performance. All five Washington starters scored in double figures.

Nikola Jokic broke out with 29 points and nine rebounds, and Paul Millsap had 17 points and eight rebounds for the Nuggets, who struggled with ball control. Denver committed 24 turnovers -- eight by Jokic -- and lost despite outshooting Washington 48.8 percent to 44 percent.

Suns 117, Kings 115

Marquese Chriss scored 19 points, and Mike James put Phoenix ahead to stay on a basket with 14.1 seconds left as the Suns overcame two tumultuous days to hang on for their first win.

The Suns led by as many as 22 points and were up by 11 with 3:08 to play in the game. However, five 3-pointers in the fourth quarter by Sacramento’s Garrett Temple keyed a 14-3 run, and Kings rookie De‘Aaron Fox tied the game at 112 on an 8-foot floater with 58 seconds left.

James, who had 18 points and seven assists in his first start in place of the departing Eric Bledsoe, hit a 5-foot bank shot to give the Suns the lead for good. The win came a day after Earl Watson was fired as head coach and hours after Bledsoe was sent home after tweeting that he no longer wanted to play for the Suns.",Highlights of Monday's NBA games,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1CT0J1-OCASP

“The Financial Conduct Authority announces today that it is investigating the circumstances surrounding a cybersecurity incident that led to the loss of UK customer data held by Equifax Ltd on the servers of its U.S. parent,” the watchdog said in a statement on Tuesday.

“This statement is made given the public interest in these matters.”

The announcement follows a letter from Nicky Morgan, chair of the House of Commons’ Treasury Committee to the watchdog, asking if Equifax had violated terms of its license to operate in the country, and whether the regulator had the power to compel the company to provide compensation to UK consumers.

Equifax said it was already working closely with the FCA and other authorities.

“We welcome this opportunity to learn the lessons from this criminal cyber-attack in order for all businesses to better protect consumers in the future,” the company said in a statement.

Equifax has said that 15.2 million records on British citizens were involved in the breach, including sensitive data on what it said were 693,665 individuals, for whom credit protection services were offered.

Gli investitori continuano a registrare gli indicatori positivi che giungono dal fronte macroeconomico, ma sullo sfondo si stagliano le incognite geopolitiche.

Hans Bevers, capo economista di Degroof Petercam AM, sottolinea che “gli indicatori di fiducia economica continuano a sorprendere positivamente, evidenziando un forte slancio di crescita ciclica tra i diversi settori e regioni. Il quadro economico strutturale”, prosegue Bevers, “è ancora indebolito dalle condizioni demografiche avverse, dalla più lenta crescita della produttività, dall‘eccessivo debito, dal difficile ribilanciamento economico in Cina e dai fattori geopolitici. Rischi politici come la Corea del Nord si aggiungono all‘incertezza geopolitica, soprattutto perché, per come si presentano i fatti, un rapido allentamento delle tensioni sembra improbabile”.

Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant.
If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response.
The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas.
The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico.","It seems there’s a template that critics follow for Donald Trump versus the Hurricanes: they say he won’t do enough, that it isn’t being done fast enough, that everything will collapse (ready Katrina headlines) and then the draining, heroic reality of the response takes hold. With post-Maria Puerto Rico the latest example of that trope, it’s time for a better understanding of how disaster management works.

A disaster destroys in hours infrastructure that took decades to build. Millions of people lose the services that separate a middle-class suburb from an impoverished slum – clean water, sewers, power, hospitals, roads. And Maria was the strongest storm to strike the area in 80 years.

Meanwhile, the media tends to focus on drama and controversy. They often overplay the story via anecdotal reporting (“Here’s Mrs. Hernandez without electricity,” says the reporter [pause], “with no help in sight”) and underplay the work being done, especially at the beginning of the response where progress is hard to see. First responders on laptops methodically solving supply problems are not very mediagenic, after all.

At the moment of any disaster, needs are at 100 percent while the response is at a zero point. The response starts in deficit. It always looks grim, especially to participants and outside observers unfamiliar with the process. They want what is a marathon to play out like a sprint.

In dealing with a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military follow a standard playbook. I know, I worked with both on and off for two decades while with the State Department. I trained with them, and was on the ground for relief efforts after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (more than 6,000 dead) and 2004 Asian tsunami (280,000 dead.) I worked the Washington DC-end of many other disasters. I read after-action reporting from 20-30 other such events.

The critical initial step is a needs assessment, from which everything else flows. Everyone wants to jump in and do something, but responders need time to visit sites, confer with local officials, and determine what is needed and where the needs are greatest. It is a slow process in a chaotic environment, delayed by weather, roads, and communications. From the outside it can look like nothing is being done; Mrs. Hernandez still doesn’t have electricity even as helicopters are flying around, apparently ignoring her!

The needs assessment gets the right help to the right places in order of priority. As an example, I was part of a liaison team with the American Navy at Phuket, Thailand following the Asian tsunami of 2005. Without any local input, the U.S. first helicopters brought in huge fresh water bladders. It turned out most of the water was unneeded; the city had warehouses full of the bottled version.

It took a day for us to track down, but the most urgent need the Navy could address was a buildup of medical waste at local hospitals. Waste pre-disaster was trucked out daily; the tsunami wrecked the roads, and so boxes of soiled bandages and infected sharps accumulated. When American resources turned to help dispose of that, hospitals were able to run at peak capacity. Lives were saved. The water bladders lay abandoned in parking lots around town.

Other decisions that can flow from a needs assessment might include restoring power to one school to shelter 50 families before fixing 50 individual homes. It can mean blocking people from calling internationally so limited cell capacity can be directed to local emergency calls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, set as a priority reopening dialysis centers across Puerto Rico. Somebody else didn’t get helped first to make that possible.

At the early-to-intermediate stages of a disaster response people in less affected areas will wait in long lines for supplies. It looks bad on TV, but can actually mean the system is working, as help was directed to a higher priority. It takes good reporting to know if that’s the case. Instead, progress is often too quickly defined as “make everything back to the way it was before the storm.”

The military plays a key role in disaster response. The problem is Americans are conditioned to believe there are unlimited resources of all types, instantly movable across notable distances.

Military units tend to have war fighting as their primary job, and most are somewhere doing that, or training to do that. Shifting to a disaster mission can happen quickly but not instantly. It’s also essential to gather people with the right skills – electrical engineers, teams that desalinate sea water for drinking, and sewage crews (3.4 million people’s waste festering with fecal-borne disease is a dreaded secondary killer in this disaster.)

Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant. Unlike Texas or Florida, no one can self-evacuate, by car or even on foot. Same for incoming aid. Everything must travel by plane, or, more likely, ship.

Puerto Ricans now need some two million gallons of fresh water a day. A gallon weighs about eight pounds, so that’s 16 million pounds of water. A C-130 cargo plane can carry some 42,000 pounds. So that’s 380 flights a day, every day, just for water. There are bigger aircraft, but the bottom line is always the same: you simply have to move the epic quantities required to respond to an epic island disaster by ship to a port, then inland by truck.

That last step, moving supplies from a port (or airport) to those who need them is known as the “last mile” problem. It haunts every disaster response.

Success with the last mile depends on local infrastructure. If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response. Next comes the need for trucks, fuel for those trucks, drivers, security, and personnel and equipment to offload the ships and load the vehicles. If you’re missing one link in the chain, the aid does not move.

These are tough realities, not excuses for why more hasn’t been done for desperate people. It can be a complex, methodical process, addressing a single problem (get water to that village) as a cascading string of nested problems. While the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s remark that Puerto Rico relief is the “most logistically challenging event” the United States has ever faced seems exaggerated, it does underscore the size of the job at hand.

So don’t be distracted by the apocalyptic tweets between Trump and his critics; they exist independent of the ground truth. Because while no response is ever fast and robust enough, the systemic breakdowns that hit New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have largely been fixed, well-before Trump even took office.

Responses are always imperfect; lack of drinking water remains a critical issue. The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas. For Harvey, the death toll was at least 70, Irma 72. Katrina saw 1,836 fatalities with over 700 people still missing.

But a tipping point will take place, where adequate services are restored and people will start to receive the help they need. Problems will reduce from regions without power to villages without power to an isolated home without power. The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico. Everything else right now seems to be just Twitter wars.","Commentary: For hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, an insider’s guide to disaster management",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-disaster-commentary/commentary-for-hurricane-hit-puerto-rico-an-insiders-guide-to-disaster-management-idUSKCN1C805X

Building on their traditional expertise in factory automation, the conglomerates’ digital divisions are adding cutting-edge software and systems that help customers design, build and test their products faster and more cheaply.

In so doing they bring new value to companies historically linked mainly to customers in the power, energy and mining sectors that have had to slash spending in the past few years due to a precipitous drop in commodity prices.

Not only is the divisions’ growth outstripping that of legacy fossil-fuel businesses, but a trend toward breaking out their earnings separately in company reports allows investors to see value that was previously buried.

“Your industrial company today is not your dirty factory bending metals and producing simple and large objects,” said Andreas Fruschki, director of equity research, Europe at AllianzGI.

“It’s a more high-tech, nimble assembly site.”

Their efforts are attracting the attention of investors looking for less obvious technology plays as the tide turns against U.S. stocks like Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google, due to their uncomfortably lofty valuations.

Meanwhile in Asia the soaring market capitalization of a handful of companies such as China’s Alibaba and Tencent means investors in exchange traded funds (ETFs) who want exposure to a range of companies are finding themselves increasingly exposed to a single sector.

The growth opportunities in European industrials are still limited by legacy businesses, however, said Neil Campling, head of global TMT research at Northern Trust Capital Markets.

The oil & gas and mining sectors have cut capital expenditure to $706 billion in 2016 from $1.29 trillion in 2013, according to figures from S&P Global, which added that a slight recovery is expected in 2017.

“But you’re certainly seeing that factory automation, machine vision, automation, industry 4.0, improvements in supply chain systems, all these kinds of things ... (are) enjoying very strong growth,” Campling added.

INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE

Siemens’ Digital Factory, widely seen as the global leader in industrial software, only started reporting separate results in the German company statements in 2015.

The 13 percent of 2016 revenue it contributed is still small fry compared with the power and energy divisions’ 40 percent. But while sales in Siemens’ power and gas segment declined 11 percent in the fiscal third quarter, digital saw 11 percent growth and accounted for more than a fifth of total profits.

Swiss power grids maker ABB is also winning investors’ attention thanks to its robotics segment, although oil & gas, mining and other industries still account for more than 40 percent of company revenues.

ABB Ability, a digital software and services platform that can connect to robots for remote monitoring and diagnostics, which partners with Microsoft and IBM, is starting to contribute to growth, ABB CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer said in a press release after the company released results for the second quarter that ended June 30.

Robotics orders jumped 12 percent year-on-year in the quarter to more than 25 percent of the company’s total.

While some technology assets have been developed in-house or through collaboration, others have come from acquisitions.

Siemens has spent more than $5 billion in the past 18 months acquiring industrial software companies while shedding legacy businesses like hearing aids and household appliances and preparing to list its giant healthcare unit.

ABB this year bought automation software firm B&R for almost $2 billion, the biggest acquisition under its current chief executive, to better challenge Siemens.

“The more exciting themes now are themes like automation, and that is definitely one we’ve angled our portfolios towards,” said Tim Crockford, European equities portfolio manager at Hermes.

Crockford added German forklift truck and robotics maker Kion Group to his portfolio in 2016 on expectations for growing demand for warehouse automation, driven by e-commerce, via its acquisition of U.S. firm Dematic last year.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch singled out Swedish machinery maker Atlas Copco for its SmartLink data monitoring program for air compressors, which looks to anticipate problems before they arise, an example of how the “Internet of things” is transforming the way equipment works.

“Industrial companies with big software businesses generate stronger growth and profitability than their automation peers,” BAML said in a research note last month.

While the European industrials sector has outperformed the broader MSCI Europe benchmark over the past year, the companies still haven’t reached the heights of tech stocks like semiconductor manufacturers.

“There are no ‘pure’ plays in Europe,” Barclays capital goods analysts wrote in a note.

Both players had lost their opening ties on Sunday so were desperate for a victory to keep their future fate in the eight-woman event in their own hands and neither appeared willing to budge in a titanic three hour and 13-minute marathon.

In the end, the 37-year-old Williams emerged from a bruising encounter that featured 20 breaks of serve with a victory built on her calmness at the key moments and ruthlessness when offered a chance to attack her opponent’s weak second serve.

“Sometimes you need some luck. I don’t know if I had any tonight as I had to work for every point,” Williams said in a courtside interview.

“It’s not easy when you lose the first match. Both of us were in the same situation and you have to fight, what else can you do, to live another day.”

The match started with Ostapenko trying to force the pace with the high-risk strategy that carried her to French Open glory, while Williams was content to pick up free points as her opponent sprayed a plethora of attempted winners wide or long.

The Latvian edged ahead in the opener, however, and even served for the set at 5-3 but the veteran American dug deep and reeled off six consecutive games to first steal the set and then move ahead in the second.

The 20-year-old battled back as the pair traded two breaks apiece before Williams brought up a her first match point in the 10th game that she failed to convert when she dumped a forehand into the net as Ostapenko continued to go for her shots.

The Mercedes-Benz parent has problems aplenty, which bumper third-quarter sales do little to change. A plan to carve out its car and truck units might help lift its valuation if that eventually led to a separate listing. But at the current pace of progress, investors have no reason to give the company much credit.

Friday’s third-quarter results were a reminder of the rocky ride that Daimler faces in the short term. One-off costs such as diesel-emissions fixes meant third-quarter operating profit fell by 14 percent from a year earlier to 3.5 billion euros. That was despite record sales of almost 600,000 Mercedes-Benz and smart automobiles. But the real challenges for auto groups like the Mercedes maker are far bigger and include a margin-sapping shift to electric vehicles and potentially declining car ownership from the growth of ride-hailing apps.

There’s no fighting these trends, but Daimler could do shareholders a favour by spinning off its trucks and buses arms, which merit a higher valuation than the conglomerate’s lowly multiple of 7.7 times forward earnings. First, the division faces less fierce competition than the cars business. Second, online shopping has created a boom in logistics and delivery vehicles. Daimler trucks and buses together brought in more than 37 billion euros of revenue last year, but barely show up in the German group’s share price because of a huge conglomerate discount. Spinning them off could boost the group’s value by more than 30 billion euros, Evercore ISI analysts estimate.

Months after the historic women’s march on Washington and in the midst of the “#MeToo” sexual harassment outcry, Halloween 2017 is becoming yet another platform in the United States for women and girls to show strength.

This year’s most-searched Halloween costume is Wonder Woman, according to Google’s Frightgeist search tool.

Star Wars heroine Rey, the self-reliant young woman who shines as a survivor against all odds, is among the film series’ characters who rank in the top 10 children’s costumes for 2017, according to the National Retail Federation.

And, makers of homemade costumes this year are getting online tips for re-purposing pink “pussyhats.” They were worn by many of the hundreds of thousands of women who took part in marches in Washington and other U.S. cities on Jan. 21, the day after Donald Trump’s inauguration as president, to denounce his years-ago boast about grabbing women’s genitals.

“The year or more of sexual harassment scandals has shifted people’s thinking about what they want to become on Halloween,” said Barnard College Psychology Professor Tovah Klein.

“Costumes empower children - as in ‘I can be strong, I can be invincible, I can fight for justice.' And right now, with Wonder Woman and other characters, girls are embracing this strong side,” Klein said.

Raising her light saber, 9-year-old Abby of Maplewood, New Jersey, demonstrated her warrior stance dressed as Rey, a steel-colored cloth crossed over her chest, with pants to match her tunic.

“I feel more brave when I‘m Rey,” said Abby, a fourth-grader who has celebrated Halloweens past by dressing up as princesses.

“I like Rey more than princesses. She’s very tough. She’s fighting. She’s helping a lot of other people survive,” said Abby, whose parents asked that her last name be withheld for privacy.

More than 179 million people in the United States will celebrate Halloween 2017, spending a record high of $9.1 billion, with the largest outlay on costumes, the retail federation said.

To be sure, feminist-fueled Halloween costumes are nothing new. But this year, they carry a special resonance.

Trump’s brag about assaulting women, which he later called “locker room talk,” was made public when a 2005 video surfaced during his 2016 presidential campaign. A year later, sexual abuse allegations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein sparked the “#MeToo” movement. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

“It’s about how we picture ourselves and how we picture other women,” said Way, 41, a married nursing student.

“If we see ourselves as strong, and if we see our mothers and our friends as strong enough to help us and to help carry us, then that makes the conversation move forward,” she said.","U.S. Halloween princesses make way for Wonder Woman, pink 'pussyhats'",https://www.reuters.com/article/halloween-day-usa-women/u-s-halloween-princesses-make-way-for-wonder-woman-pink-pussyhats-idINKBN1CT2A4?il=0

Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, a Vietnamese, are charged with murdering Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a chemical nerve agent, at Kuala Lumpur’s budget international terminal on Feb. 13.

Defense lawyers say the women thought they were involved in a prank for a reality TV show when they encountered a man at the airport and did not know they were handling poison.

The two women were brought back to the scene as part of an entourage of court officials, led by trial judge Azmi Ariffin and accompanied by over 200 police officers and dozens of journalists, on a visit to retrace the events that unfolded before, during and after Kim Jong Nam’s death.

Defense lawyers requested the visit after video recordings of the women on airport closed-circuit television were screened in court.

Gooi Soon Seng, Siti Aisyah’s lawyer, said the visit was necessary to verify the surroundings and locations where the prosecution say the murder took place.

“The CCTV footages were taken from various cameras and various places, so from there we couldn’t get a complete picture on how (the incident) took place,” Gooi told a news conference after the visit.

The site visit covered various locations in the terminal shown in the videos, such as a restaurant where Siti Aisyah was seen meeting an unidentified man, the toilets where police witnesses said both women had gone to after the attack on Kim Jong Nam, the clinic where the victim sought medical aid and the taxi stands where both suspects were seen after the attack.

Huong appeared unwell midway through the three-hour site visit, while Siti Aisyah broke down in tears. Both women were then provided wheelchairs.

Defense lawyers later said both Huong and Siti Aisyah were exhausted from being weighed down by their bulletproof vests.

Recordings on Feb. 13 show Huong approaching Kim and grasping his face from behind near the airport’s check-in counters before quickly leaving. Siti Aisyah could not be seen but was identified by a police witness as a figure running in another direction. The videos also show the women heading to separate bathrooms to wash their hands.

Both women were seen meeting with two men, identified only as Mr. Chang and Mr. Y, before Kim Jong Nam’s death. According to police, the men had applied liquid on the women’s hands, and were among four suspects-at-large charged together with the women for the murder.

‘CLOSELY-WATCHED TRIAL’

The airport visit comes as the high-profile trial entered its third week. Twelve witnesses have testified so far.

Forensic and chemical weapons experts said Kim Jong Nam had died of nerve agent poisoning, and that VX had been found on Siti Aisyah and Huong’s clothes. Traces of the poison were also found under Huong’s fingernails.

Prosecutors say Siti Aisyah and Huong conspired with four others who are still at large to kill Kim Jong Nam.

South Korean and U.S. officials have said that Kim Jong Un’s regime was behind his half-brother’s death.

European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier addresses a news conference in Brussels, Belgium September 7, 2017.
“A disorderly exit would bring enormous problems - mainly for Britain, but also for us,” he said in the interview with Handelsblatt and four further European newspapers.
He added: “Britain would leave the single air traffic space, losing take-off and landing rights.
“We will have to arrange future co-operation on defense and security policy in a separate treaty,” he said.","BERLIN (Reuters) - Britain must choose from a range of existing off-the-peg models for its relationship to the European Union when it leaves the bloc, Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier has told a group of newspapers.

Barnier, who is leading the EU’s negotiations with Britain after last year’s Brexit vote, told Handelsblatt that while it was in both sides’ interest to maintain a close relationship, the range of possible relationships was limited.

“The only way to do it without difficulties is by staying within the internal market. That would be the Norway model, but the British government rejects it,” he said. “Another option would be a free trade agreement like the CETA-deal with Canada.”

Even a Canada-style deal would take several years to negotiate. Asked if there would be a specific British model after the country left on March 30, 2019, Barnier said: “No.”

European leaders decided this weekend that Britain had not made enough progress on exit negotiations to begin work on devising a future relationship, leading to concern in Europe and the world that Britain could crash out of the bloc in disorderly fashion, with serious economic and political consequences.

“A disorderly exit would bring enormous problems - mainly for Britain, but also for us,” he said in the interview with Handelsblatt and four further European newspapers. That would affect everything from food supply to healthcare.

He added: “Britain would leave the single air traffic space, losing take-off and landing rights. It would no longer be a member of the Euratom treaty and could no longer import nuclear material from the EU for hospitals and power stations.”

The process of designing a longer-term relationship with the EU was also fraught with difficulties, he added, warning that the EU would need to find ways to head off any British attempts to undercut European environmental or welfare standards.

“We will have to arrange future co-operation on defense and security policy in a separate treaty,” he said. “We will have to ward off British attempts to influence our decision-making processes in this area.”

GM reported a net loss due to charges related to the sale of its European operations, but the automaker’s operating results beat Wall Street expectations and the company reaffirmed a forecast that 2017 financial results would be in line with last year’s record performance.

The automaker also assured investors it was on track to cut stocks of unsold vehicles in the U.S. to a manageable 70-days’ supply by the end of the year.

GM, rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI), and heavy machinery maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) all are benefiting from a strong U.S. economy, continued growth in China and a recovery in demand from Latin America.

In the case of the automakers, U.S. car and light truck sales have so far defied predictions of a significant slump. September sales hit the fastest pace in 12 years as residents of Texas and Florida rushed to replace cars damaged by storms.

The latest results sent GM shares up 2.3 percent to the highest levels since its initial public offering in 2010, amid a broad rally by U.S. manufacturing stocks.

GM over the past several months has regained its status as the largest U.S. automaker by market capitalization over electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).

Some of GM’s share price surge has come from investors betting on its investments in self-driving and electric cars. The company’s profits, however, are driven entirely by demand for its petrol-fueled trucks and SUVs in North America, and its growing sales in China.

The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it expects U.S. vehicle sales to remain stable at an annual pace of about 17 million light vehicles in 2017, “and we expect that in 2018 as well,” GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens told reporters on Tuesday.

The U.S. auto industry has been coming off a strong run of sales that culminated in a record 17.55 million units in 2016. Industry analysts have predicted a slight decline for U.S. new car sales in 2017, driven in part by a flood of nearly-new, low-mileage off-lease vehicles into the market.

GM’s share price has risen nearly 30 percent this year, in part as the company has highlighted efforts to put self-driving cars on the road. However, spending on autonomous vehicles and ride services amounted to just $150 million in the latest quarter, the company indicated in its financial report.

GM posted lower revenue for the quarter as it shuttered plants in North America to reduce production and tackle bloated inventory levels, especially of unpopular sedan models as consumers move increasingly to pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

GM had 76 days’ supply of unsold vehicles at the end of September, down from 88 days a month earlier and over 100 in the summer. The company’s wholesale volumes were down 26 percent versus the same quarter in 2016.

GM is taming its inventory problem in the United States in part by laying off about 3,100 temporary and full-time hourly workers, mainly at factories that build compact and midsize sedans. The rapid shift by U.S. consumers to SUVs and pickup trucks in response to low, stable gasoline prices has left GM with too many North American factories tooled to produce low-profit sedans, analysts said.

GM showed a pre-tax profit in North America despite the steep production cuts and heavy discounts. Stevens credited cost-cutting and a shift to higher-profit trucks and sport utility vehicles. The company cut North American production costs by $2 billion during the first nine months of 2017.

GM posted a quarterly net loss on Tuesday due to charges stemming from the sale of its Opel unit in Europe to France’s Peugeot SA (PEUP.PA).

Detroit-based GM posted a third-quarter net loss of $2.98 billion, or $2.03 per share, compared with a profit of $2.77 billion, or $1.71 per share a year earlier. Excluding discontinued operations, GM posted a net profit of 8 cents per share.

But excluding one-time charges, the company earned $1.32 a share, above analyst expectations of $1.14.

Revenue in the quarter fell to $33.6 billion from $38.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $32.72 billion.","GM's earnings beat, forecast lift shares; supply glut shrinks",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-results/gms-earnings-beat-forecast-lift-shares-supply-glut-shrinks-idUSKBN1CT1KG?il=0

For the first time since his elevation as heir to the kingdom, he will play host to a Davos-like gathering of the global investing elite. Heavyweights from SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are rolling into Riyadh to see at first hand his plans to make the city a regional financial powerhouse. Hanging over the affairs will be the up-in-the-air status of the biggest deal in capital-markets history.

Since the so-called Future Investment Initiative came together a few months ago under the auspices of Saudi’s massive Public Investment Fund, questions about the viability of a planned $100 billion initial public offering of stock in Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, have intensified. Chief among them is the difficulty of reaching the $2 trillion valuation for the group that the ruling family wants, according to news stories. Last week Reuters reported that China offered to buy 5 percent of Aramco in a deal that could circumvent an IPO.

The snag with the Chinese option is that Saudi Arabia has other objectives beyond raising cash to fatten the kingdom’s finances and fund social welfare. The Aramco offering is a key step towards making Riyadh a regional, if not international, capital for capital. It is part of the crown prince’s blueprint for reducing Saudi Arabia’s reliance on oil – a feat never fully achieved by a major resource economy in the modern era.

As noted in a report by State Street Global Advisors on the eve of the FII confab, which kicks off on Tuesday, “the Saudi Aramco transaction should be leveraged in a much more significant way to change the relationship between the Saudi kingdom, the stewards of the economy, its citizens and the international investment community.”

The crown prince is banking on Riyadh’s appeal as a financial hub to meet the extraordinary ambitions of his Vision 2030 plan to move away from hydrocarbons – wise given the accelerating adoption of electric vehicles – towards other industries, including financial services. Transforming the $700 billion economy and better sharing the wealth with 33 million subjects, two-thirds of whom are under the age of 30, is of existential importance for the Saudi monarchy.

Market authorities have taken strides to make the Tadawul, the Saudi bourse, an easier place for foreigners to buy shares and even short them. As a result, Saudi stocks are being considered for inclusion in indexes widely followed by investment professionals. The FTSE Russell is mulling whether to upgrade Saudi Arabia to emerging-market status. So is MSCI, which will decide by next June whether to include Saudi shares in its MSCI Emerging Markets Index. If it does, the country’s weighting, at around 2.4 percent according to State Street, could lead to inflows of around $38 billion.

But the big numbers are those associated with privatizations, with Aramco top of the list. Speaking to Reuters, Vice Minister for Economy and Planning Mohammed al-Tuwaijri estimated there could be $200 billion forthcoming from the sale of various assets ranging from housing and water to telecommunications and even religious-tourism services.

Beyond bringing in foreign direct investment, selling shares to the Saudi public could tighten the monarchy’s grip on the hearts, minds and wallets of its people. As State Street observes in its paper, such deals could involve a “National Privatization Fund”, which like a mutual fund could be offered to citizens at a discount, minimizing “public controversies over the sale of public assets”. In effect it might foster a sense of inclusive capitalism, neutralizing criticism of the royal family’s excesses, like the $500 million Italian yacht the crown prince acquired, according to news reports.

Other innovations could include increased transparency about the ownership of assets that are, effectively, the state’s patrimony. If Aramco incorporates good governance into its bylaws that, too, could help nurture an ownership culture among Saudis and reduce any mistrust of the ruling family. From this could follow other benefits, like the creation of a fixed-income market, albeit one compliant with sharia standards on lending and usury. That in turn would let banks off the hook for much of the risk while channeling capital to small and medium-sized enterprises, and away from state juggernauts.

The FII kicks off with a welcome from the crown prince followed by a panel that includes Aramco Chief Executive Amir Nasser. They need to sound convincing that the IPO of the biggest company ever to go public is on track. If the sale of the oil group is delayed or diverted, it would make the rest of Saudi’s Vision 2030 looks increasingly cloudy, too.",Breakingviews - Cox: Aramco clouds Saudi's coming-out party,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-aramco-ipo-breakingviews/breakingviews-cox-aramco-clouds-saudis-coming-out-party-idUSKBN1CT0CP

Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer -

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

Spain says it will impose direct rule on Catalonia from Friday to prevent an illegal push for independence, invoking unprecedented powers to dismiss the regional government. Madrid said an election would not change those plans.

The Catalan parliament meets on Thursday to agree on a response to Madrid, and many analysts believe the economically powerful region could formally declare independence.

Secessionists in Catalonia say their independence referendum on Oct. 1 - which attracted a 43 percent turnout and was mostly boycotted by those Catalans who want to remain in Spain - has given them a mandate for statehood.

Catalonia said on Monday it was confident that its officials, including the police, would defy attempts by Madrid to enforce direct rule.

Spanish political and business leaders, along with most Catalonian newspapers, have urged Catalan President Carles Puigdemont to call a regional election before he is stripped of his authority.

They say direct rule from Madrid would be a humiliation for Catalonia and pose a serious risk of unrest.

Puigdemont has so far remained silent on the matter of an election but an ally of his pro-independence government said he was actively considering this option.

“We have evidence this is currently on the table,” Carles Riera, a Catalan lawmaker for the anti-capitalist CUP party, told a news conference.

Calling an election would be a face-saving move for Puigdemont as it could either strengthen his mandate if pro-independence parties won or allow him a graceful exit if they did not.

DEBATE?

The Spanish government said a snap election would be a first step but Puigdemont would also have to withdraw an ambiguous declaration of independence he made earlier this month.

The government had moved to cancel Catalonia’s autonomous status because it believed there had been a “serious failure” by Puigdemont to meet his obligations, Justice Minister Rafael Catala said in a radio interview.

“Everything is not fixed just by calling an election.”

Catala said that if Puigdemont appeared before the Spanish Senate, it would help to resolve the crisis.

A top official in the Senate said that if Puigdemont decided to appear before the house, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would likely come to the chamber as well so that a proper debate could be organised between the two.

The Senate said on Tuesday it had invited Puigdemont to appear before the chamber on Thursday at 5 p.m (1500 GMT) or Friday at 10 a.m (0800 GMT).

The Madrid government has so far refused to meet the Catalan leader until he drops his call for independence and Catala said any appearance by Puigdemont had to be within a legal and constitutional framework.

“If his appearance is within the constitution and the law we’ll be delighted ... But if it’s just to ratify his position on Catalonia’s independence, sadly we will not be able to do anything else than continuing with the measures already set by the government,” Catala said.

The political uncertainty has taken its toll on Spain’s wealthiest region, with hundreds of companies moving their headquarters out of Catalonia.

Volkswagen’s Spanish unit SEAT, one of the biggest employers in the region, said it would move its registered office if it felt there was no longer legal security in Catalonia, although it had so far not made a decision.

“Relocating the registered office would respond to the need to seek legal protection, and would make sense the moment we felt it was no longer afforded in the territory where we are located,” SEAT Executive Committee Chairman Luca de Meo said in a letter to the company’s more than 14,000 employees in the region.",Catalan secessionists mull snap election as Madrid hangs tough,https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia/catalan-secessionists-mull-snap-election-as-madrid-hangs-tough-idINKBN1CT1PP

Some of GM’s share price surge has come from investors betting on its investments in self-driving and electric cars. The company’s profits, however, are driven entirely by demand for its petrol-fueled trucks and SUVs in North America, and its growing sales in China.

The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it expects U.S. vehicle sales to remain stable at an annual pace of about 17 million light vehicles in 2017, “and we expect that in 2018 as well,” GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens told reporters on Tuesday.

The U.S. auto industry has been coming off a strong run of sales that culminated in a record 17.55 million units in 2016. Industry analysts have predicted a slight decline for U.S. new car sales in 2017, driven in part by a flood of nearly-new, low-mileage off-lease vehicles into the market.

GM’s share price has risen nearly 30 percent this year, in part as the company has highlighted efforts to put self-driving cars on the road. However, spending on autonomous vehicles and ride services amounted to just $150 million in the latest quarter, the company indicated in its financial report.

GM posted lower revenue for the quarter as it shuttered plants in North America to reduce production and tackle bloated inventory levels, especially of unpopular sedan models as consumers move increasingly to pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

GM had 76 days’ supply of unsold vehicles at the end of September, down from 88 days a month earlier and over 100 in the summer. The company’s wholesale volumes were down 26 percent versus the same quarter in 2016.

GM is taming its inventory problem in the United States in part by laying off about 3,100 temporary and full-time hourly workers, mainly at factories that build compact and midsize sedans. The rapid shift by U.S. consumers to SUVs and pickup trucks in response to low, stable gasoline prices has left GM with too many North American factories tooled to produce low-profit sedans, analysts said.

GM showed a pre-tax profit in North America despite the steep production cuts and heavy discounts. Stevens credited cost-cutting and a shift to higher-profit trucks and sport utility vehicles. The company cut North American production costs by $2 billion during the first nine months of 2017.

GM posted a quarterly net loss on Tuesday due to charges stemming from the sale of its Opel unit in Europe to France’s Peugeot SA.

Detroit-based GM posted a third-quarter net loss of $2.98 billion, or $2.03 per share, compared with a profit of $2.77 billion, or $1.71 per share a year earlier. Excluding discontinued operations, GM posted a net profit of 8 cents per share.

But excluding one-time charges, the company earned $1.32 a share, above analyst expectations of $1.14.

Revenue in the quarter fell to $33.6 billion from $38.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $32.72 billion.","GM's earnings beat, forecast lift shares; supply glut shrinks",https://in.reuters.com/article/gm-results/gm-shares-rise-on-earnings-beat-forecast-idINKBN1CT1NP

Over 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar since Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response by the Myanmar army that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.

At a meeting in Myanmar’s capital Naypyitaw, attended by Myanmar’s home affairs minister lieutenant general Kyaw Swe and his Bangladeshi counterpart Asaduzzaman Khan, the countries signed two agreements covering security and border cooperation.

The two sides have also agreed to “to halt the outflow of Myanmar residents to Bangladesh,” and “to form a joint working group,” Tin Myint, permanent secretary from Myanmar’s home affairs ministry told reporters after the meetings.

“After joint working group, the verification, (the) two countries have agreed to arrange different steps so that these people can return to their homeland safely and honourably and in secure conditions,” said Mostafa Kamal Uddin, secretary from Bangladeshi home affairs ministry.

The officials did not elaborate on the specific steps the authorities would take for the repatriation, adding that the bulk of discussions was dedicated to border and security cooperation agreements which have been long in the making.

Tin Myint said the two countries agreed “to restore normalcy in Rakhine to enable displaced Myanmar residents to return from Bangladesh at the earliest opportunity.”

He also said Myanmar had sent a list of suspects who had fled to Bangladesh and requested the authorities there to investigate and return them to Myanmar.

Thousands of refugees have continued to arrived cross the Naf river separating Myanmar’s western Rakhine state and Bangladesh in recent days, even though Myanmar says military operations ceased on Sept. 5.

The United States said on Monday it was considering a range of further actions over Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority.

While on Tuesday the officials said the talks were friendly, tensions are still high between the two countries. Bangladesh last month accused Myanmar of repeatedly violating its air space and warned that any more “provocative acts” could have “unwarranted consequences”.

On border and security, the two sides decided to establish border liaison offices, carry out regular meetings between two security forces, jointly combat drug trafficking across the border and set up a mechanism to communicate directly.

Bangladesh has for decades faced influxes of Rohingya fleeing persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where the Rohingya are seen as illegal migrants. It was already home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya before the latest crisis.

Though Rohingya families have lived in Myanmar for generations, they are denied citizenship and access to basic civil rights such as freedom of movement, decent education and healthcare.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar.

Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, a Vietnamese, are charged with murdering Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a chemical nerve agent, at Kuala Lumpur’s budget international terminal on Feb. 13.

Defense lawyers say the women thought they were involved in a prank for a reality TV show when they encountered a man at the airport and did not know they were handling poison.

The two women were brought back to the scene as part of an entourage of court officials, led by trial judge Azmi Ariffin and accompanied by over 200 police officers and dozens of journalists, on a visit to retrace the events that unfolded before, during and after Kim Jong Nam’s death.

Defense lawyers requested the visit after video recordings of the women on airport closed-circuit television were screened in court.

Gooi Soon Seng, Siti Aisyah’s lawyer, said the visit was necessary to verify the surroundings and locations where the prosecution say the murder took place.

“The CCTV footages were taken from various cameras and various places, so from there we couldn’t get a complete picture on how (the incident) took place,” Gooi told a news conference after the visit.

The site visit covered various locations in the terminal shown in the videos, such as a restaurant where Siti Aisyah was seen meeting an unidentified man, the toilets where police witnesses said both women had gone to after the attack on Kim Jong Nam, the clinic where the victim sought medical aid and the taxi stands where both suspects were seen after the attack.

Huong appeared unwell midway through the three-hour site visit, while Siti Aisyah broke down in tears. Both women were then provided wheelchairs.

Defense lawyers later said both Huong and Siti Aisyah were exhausted from being weighed down by their bulletproof vests.

Recordings on Feb. 13 show Huong approaching Kim and grasping his face from behind near the airport’s check-in counters before quickly leaving. Siti Aisyah could not be seen but was identified by a police witness as a figure running in another direction. The videos also show the women heading to separate bathrooms to wash their hands.

Both women were seen meeting with two men, identified only as Mr. Chang and Mr. Y, before Kim Jong Nam’s death. According to police, the men had applied liquid on the women’s hands, and were among four suspects-at-large charged together with the women for the murder.

‘CLOSELY-WATCHED TRIAL’

The airport visit comes as the high-profile trial entered its third week. Twelve witnesses have testified so far.

Forensic and chemical weapons experts said Kim Jong Nam had died of nerve agent poisoning, and that VX had been found on Siti Aisyah and Huong’s clothes. Traces of the poison were also found under Huong’s fingernails.

Prosecutors say Siti Aisyah and Huong conspired with four others who are still at large to kill Kim Jong Nam.

South Korean and U.S. officials have said that Kim Jong Un’s regime was behind his half-brother’s death.

Kim Jong Nam, who was living in exile in Macau, had criticized his family’s dynastic rule of North Korea and his brother had ordered his execution, according to some South Korean lawmakers.

The maker of Post-It Notes (MMM.N) jumped 6.12 percent and Caterpillar (CAT.N) 6.07 percent after the two companies reported stellar quarterly results and gave upbeat forecasts.

The two stocks contributed nearly 140 points to the Dow’s 170 point rise.

United Technologies (UTX.N) and McDonald’s (MCD.N) also notched up gains after reporting results.

“At these levels, only companies that have both top-line and bottom-line beats could make the market move higher,” said Rick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey.

The S&P industrial sector .SPLRCI rose 0.75 percent, topping the 11 major S&P indexes. The sector has gained about 15 percent this year, in line with the broader S&P 500 index, but has underperformed sectors such as technology and healthcare.

“It offers some hope to investors that this rally will broaden out, which it needs to do, to sustain at these levels,” Heckler said.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

A socially conservative province where the Catholic and Protestant faiths exert strong influence, Northern Ireland allows abortion only when a mother’s life is in danger. The penalty for undergoing or performing an unlawful abortion is life imprisonment.

As a result, women facing tragic circumstances such as a pregnancy resulting from rape or a diagnosis of fatal fetal abnormality, meaning that a baby will not survive outside the womb, have been forced to carry their pregnancies to term.

“The impact of the criminal law in Northern Ireland does amount to inhuman and degrading treatment by the state,” said Nathalie Lieven, lead counsel for the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission which is spearheading the legal action.

The commission, an independent body, launched legal action against Northern Ireland’s government in 2014, arguing that the law violates the human rights of women and girls. The case has been working its way through the courts ever since.

A panel of seven Supreme Court judges in London will hear arguments for and against the proposed changes during a three-day hearing. They will give their judgment at a later date.

Lieven began by giving the judges an overview of detailed evidence provided by several women and girls.

One of them, Ashleigh Topley, was told when she was four-and-a-half months pregnant in 2013 that her baby’s limbs were not growing and she was going to die.

FILE PHOTO: Women gather in Parliament Square for a protest in support of legal abortion in Northern Ireland, and against a Tory coalition with the DUP, in central London, Britain, June 24, 2017. REUTERS/Marko Djurica/File Photo

Topley was told there was nothing to be done and she had to carry on with the pregnancy until her baby died inside the womb, or until she went into labor which would cause the baby to die.

Topley had to endure 15 weeks of anguish as the pregnancy progressed. She has described how people would ask her if it was her first child, if she wanted a boy or a girl, and other well-meaning questions which exacerbated her suffering.

In the end, Topley went into labor at 35 weeks and the baby girl’s heart stopped.

Other cases described to the judges included that of a girl under 13 years old who was pregnant as a result of sexual abuse by a relative. After police and social services got involved, the distraught girl had to be taken outside of Northern Ireland for the first time in her life to have an abortion.

Northern Ireland’s elected assembly voted against changing abortion laws in February 2016.

The law is far less restrictive in the rest of the United Kingdom, and hundreds of Northern Irish women travel to England every year to have unwanted pregnancies terminated.

As well as the parties in the case, the court will hear from organizations that support changing the law, such as Humanists UK, Amnesty International and a United Nations working group on discrimination against women.

It will also hear from groups who oppose any reform, such as Catholic bishops from the province and the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which describes the legal action as a “crusade against disabled babies”.

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

In 2015 he took nearly two months of leave, prompting Modi’s party to accuse him of “holidaying” while parliament was in session.","NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Rahul Gandhi, the scion of India’s most fabled political dynasty, will within weeks be crowned leader of the Congress party, handing him a freer rein to prove if he can mount a credible challenge to the dominance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The great-grandson of India’s founding prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, has struggled to convince voters - and many in his party - that he is leadership material, especially after a drubbing in the 2014 general election.

Modi’s depiction of the 47-year-old as an undeserving “prince” has helped sideline Gandhi since the last national vote, during which time Congress has suffered some of its worst ever local election results.

But this year the economy has stumbled, and Congress politicians hope a round of state elections, beginning in Modi’s home state of Gujarat, offer them - and their leader - a shot at revival ahead of the next national poll in 2019.

Gandhi will soon take over as Congress president from his 70-year-old mother, Sonia Gandhi, a symbolic promotion that three Congress officials said they hoped would free his hand to shift the narrative from a clash of personalities - which Modi has so far resoundingly won - to a debate about policies.

“You will see many changes and every change will be a reaffirmation of what Congress’s core beliefs are,” said party MP and senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, who works closely with Rahul Gandhi.

“The right time has come to strike a chord with the masses against Modi’s governance style, and we will not miss it.”

FOCUS ON JOBS

Congress insiders acknowledge their leader has sometimes made it easy for Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to question his commitment to politics.

“The key problem with Rahul Gandhi has been his lack of consistency,” said a senior party figure, who declined to be identified. “He frequently takes a break after few roadshows and it is this inconsistency that has been a huge issue.”

But Congress officials say Gandhi has recently been finding his stride criticising Modi for failing to create jobs, while the party has won a handful of recent by-elections.

Gandhi is traversing Gujarat, the western state where Modi made his name, to fire up his party workers.

He has ditched some of the party rallies for one-on-one meetings with trade unions, dairy workers and small traders - a traditional Modi powerbase that has been hit hard by recent economic reforms championed by the prime minister.

Modi has taken notice.

Last week he told workers from his Hindu nationalist BJP that the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty would “destroy Gujarat”.

His party president, recently dispatched to the Gandhi family heartland in northern India, said this month that Gandhi needed to swap his “Italian” glasses for “Gujarati” spectacles to see the economic development the BJP had brought to the region, in a jibe at his Italian-born mother’s roots.

“BJP would love it to be a war of personalities. Congress has to frame it as a war of two different approaches, even ideologies,” said Sandeep Shastri, a political scientist and Congress expert at Jain University.

Gandhi, who rarely talks to the media, declined a Reuters interview request.

UNLIKELY TO WIN

REUTERS/Pawan Kumar/File Photo

Rahul’s father, grandmother and great-grandfather were all prime ministers in post-independence India. But critics deride Gandhi as a political lightweight who depends on his family name for power.

Bursts of political energy have been followed by lengthy absences. In 2015 he took nearly two months of leave, prompting Modi’s party to accuse him of “holidaying” while parliament was in session.

Congress now governs states home to less than 10 percent of India’s 1.3 billion population, its powerbase shrivelled under the onslaught of Modi’s popularity.

Congress insiders acknowledge the party is unlikely to win the December election in Gujarat, but cutting into the BJP majority in the state would send a powerful signal that Congress under Gandhi has a fighting chance against a still-popular Modi.

Gandhi has set up a new social media team in New Delhi to work on his image, and officials say he has been forging better ties with regional parties that are often key powerbrokers in India politics.

On a recent tour of Gujarat, Gandhi reached out to the frustrations of the state’s powerful business community with a new tax regime, including small traders such as those selling dry fruits.

Different tax rates on almonds and cashews, imposed under a new national sales tax Modi’s government launched in July, had left traders confused and damaged sales during the peak festival season.

“We have to show him as the face of the party before Gujarat elections,” said a close aide, who declined to be named.

BJP leaders say they are untroubled, and that any small bounce in Gandhi’s standing will die down once the economy strengthens. Modi has called the slowdown a blip.

“What does his claim to fame rest on?,” said Nalin Kohli, a national spokesman for the BJP. “Two months of campaigning does not make him an active politician.”",Rahul Gandhi seeks revival in PM Modi's backyard,https://in.reuters.com/article/india-politics-rahul-gandhi/indias-gandhi-scion-seeks-revival-in-pm-modis-backyard-idINKBN1CT01N

The effort, led by Democrat Ron Wyden and Republican Rand Paul, would require a warrant for queries of data belonging to any American collected under the program. The bill’s introduction is likely to add uncertainty to how Congress will renew a controversial portion of a spying law due to expire on Dec. 31.

Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is considered by U.S. intelligence officials to be among their most vital tools used to combat national and cyber security threats and help protect American allies.

It allows U.S. intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on and store vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the United States.

The surveillance program, classified details of which were exposed in 2013 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, also incidentally scoops up communications of Americans, including if they communicate with a foreign target living overseas.

Those communications can then be subject to searches without a warrant, including by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a practice that the USA Rights Act authored by Wyden and Paul would end.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) speaks at a press conference about the latest Republican Effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. September 25, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein

The measure is expected to be introduced with support from a wide berth of civil society groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and FreedomWorks, a Wyden spokesman said.

It would renew Section 702 for four years with additional transparency and oversight provisions, such as allowing individuals to more easily raise legal challenges against the law and expand the oversight jurisdiction of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a government privacy watchdog.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House of Representatives earlier this month introduced legislation seeking to add privacy protections to Section 702, including a partial restriction to the FBI’s ability to access U.S. data when seeking evidence of a crime.

But that was criticized by privacy groups as too narrow.

Separately, the Senate Intelligence Committee is expected to privately vote on Tuesday on a bill to reauthorize Section 702 that privacy advocates say will lack their reform priorities.

Wyden sent a letter on Monday urging committee leaders to allow a public vote, saying the bill “will have enormous impact on the security, liberty, and constitutional rights of the American people” and should be debated in the open.",Senators push bill requiring warrant for U.S. data under spy law,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-surveillance-congress/senators-push-bill-requiring-warrant-for-u-s-data-under-spy-law-idUSKBN1CT18J

The idea is to respond faster to fashion trends and offer more customization. After London it plans shoe models inspired by Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo and Shanghai.

“It is an opportunity for us to disrupt with brand new technologies and bring that as fast as possible to consumers,” David Drury, director of development for footwear sourcing, told Reuters.

Adidas relies on more than one million workers in factories in Asia, particularly in China and Vietnam, to produce about 600 million pairs of shoes and items of clothing and accessories per year.

But it is shifting some production closer to its major markets so it can deliver new styles quicker, and counter rising wages in Asia and hefty shipping costs.

FILE PHOTO: An India Rupee note is seen in this illustration photo June 1, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo

Once the world’s fastest-growing major economy, India has seen its growth rate plummet to the lowest in three years, far below levels needed to create enough jobs to absorb the million Indians joining the work force every month.

Modi’s government has tried to respond by stepping up public spending, but the slowdown has stressed its finances, making it imperative for private investment to pick up the slack.

Officials privately admit they have struggled to revive private investment because state-owned banks, which provide much of the credit in the economy, are saddled with a mountain of bad debt that has crimped their ability to offer new credit.

The decision to recapitalise the banks is meant to clear that bottleneck, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said at a press conference in New Delhi.

“The decision to recapitalise public sector banks with 2.11 trillion rupees will address the bank balance sheet problem and push growth forward,” Jaitley said.

By some estimates, banks need as much as $65 billion in additional capital by March 2019 to fill the hole left by soured loans and to meet new regulatory capital requirements.

The official announcement, which was followed by a series of tweets from government ministers holding it up as “unprecedented”, comes after a flurry of activity in the government over the past few weeks, driven by the prime minister’s office.

Modi, who swept to power in a landslide victory for his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2014 promising a reform agenda to revive economic growth, faces state elections later this year and a re-election bid by 2019.

He has faced criticisms after a surprise scrapping of high-value bank notes last November and a new goods and services tax effected earlier this year disrupted businesses across the country.

People close to Modi have previously told Reuters he wants to control the political damage and ensure the economic slowdown remains temporary.

Mohan Guruswamy, an economist in New Delhi, said the government should have taken action three years ago to revive the banking sector.

FILE PHOTO: India's Finance and Defence Minister Arun Jaitley attends a two-day meeting of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, comprising federal and state finance ministers, in Srinagar May 18, 2017. REUTERS/Danish Ismail/File Photo

“Now it’s more expensive, and we will not see results soon,” Guruswamy said.

FISCAL CONSOLIDATION

Finance ministry officials said the bank recapitalisation would be followed by a series of reforms in the sector. They said the details would come later.

Of the planned 2.11 trillion rupees sum, recapitalisation bonds will account for 1.35 trillion rupees, while 760 billion rupees will come from budgetary support and equity issuance, said Rajiv Kumar, India’s financial services secretary.

It was not immediately clear what the impact will be on the country’s fiscal deficit, which Jaitley aims to keep at 3.2 percent of GDP for the current fiscal year to March.

“India’s banking was the weakest link in the revival of the economy,” said N.R. Bhanumurthy, an economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a Delhi-based think-tank partly funded by the finance ministry. “The government should complete the process as early as possible.”

Bhanumurthy added that the move might have an impact on the government’s fiscal deficit target this year.

Twenty one state-run banks account for more than two-thirds of India’s banking assets. But they also account for a bulk of the record 9.5 trillion Indian rupees ($145 billion) of soured loans.

In addition to repairing their balance sheets, the banks need billions of dollars in new capital to meet global Basel III banking rules, due to fully kick in by March 2019.

Fitch Ratings estimates Indian banks will need $65 billion of additional capital by March 2019 to meet Basel III global banking rules. Moody’s expects the top 11 state lenders alone will need nearly $15 billion.

Bank stocks rallied ahead of the news conference on expectations of a recapitalisation plan. The state bank index closed 3.8 percent higher.

Il presidente del Consiglio, Paolo Gentiloni, ha ricordato che “Porto Marghera è uno dei luoghi storici dell‘industria italiana, una raffineria a lungo vista come un impianto che provocava problematiche ambientali, ora ci troviamo in una raffineria verde e la più avanzata a livello mondiale. Oggi non solo è possibile, ma è successa la riconversione”.

Il numero uno di Eni, Claudio Descalzi, ha ripercorso gli ultimi anni di crisi del settore della raffinazione che, in Europa, ha portato alla chiusura di 23 raffinerie e a un eccesso di 40-50 milioni di tonnellate e “questo ci stava portando a chiudere le raffinerie più vecchie come Gela e Venezia. Noi abbiamo fatto una scelta diversa e Venezia si è aperta a questo sviluppo”.

In questo modo è stato possibile mantenere l‘occupazione media nella raffineria di Porto Marghera di 500 unità, “oggi l‘impianto lavora circa 350mila tonnellate all‘anno utilizzando come carica olio di palma, ma si sta già trasformando e potremo trattare oli fritti o esausti, come quello di McDonald‘s, grassi animali e residui vegetali”.

Descalzi ha sottolineato che questi investimenti Eni li farà anche nel resto del Paese: “Negli ultimi anni abbiamo investito 4 miliardi e nei prossimi quattro ne investiremo altrettanti. Questo vale anche per Gela che inizierà il prossimo anno e insieme a Venezia produrranno 1,1 milioni di tonnellate di biodiesel l‘anno che è sufficiente per soddisfare tutta la domanda italiana e oltre, stiamo vendendo sia in Italia che all‘estero”.

Questo ammontare di investimenti include anche lo sviluppo della chimica verde. “Due anni fa abbiamo firmato un protocollo di accordo per trasformare la chimica verde e stiamo studiando il mercato. I sindacati hanno scritto una lettera a me e al premier per chiedere che cosa succede con la chimica verde, confermo che stiamo finalizzando il progetto per aggiornarlo alle ultime ricerche sulla chimica verde, poi deve trovare un mercato”, ha concluso l‘AD di Eni.

Despite the first profit miss after five quarters in a row of beating estimates, Lockheed forecast sales would grow two percent next year as the company banks on increased defense spending under U.S. President Donald Trump.

Compared with the same quarter last year, Lockheed’s net earnings from operations fell 13.8 percent to $939 million, or $3.24 per share, from $1.1 billion, or $3.61 cents per share. Increased sales of $12.2 billion from $11.6 billion a year ago, were below Wall Street’s expectations.

Analysts had expected $3.26 per share on revenue of $12.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Lockheed’s aeronautics division, which makes the F-35 fighter jet, was the only Lockheed business unit to increase profitability from the comparable quarter last year.

Operating profit from Lockheed’s Space Systems business unit halved to $218 million, partly due to a non-recurring pre-tax gain in the third quarter of 2016, and slightly lower sales volume in two government satellite programs.

Still, the Bethesda, Maryland-based company increased its full-year 2017 sales forecast to $51.2 billion, from $50 billion, citing its continued focus on operational performance and $200 million worth of property sales.

But even the raised outlook for 2018 came with caveats as it included a drop in projected cash flow compared with 2017.

The company sees 2017 ending with diluted higher earnings per share between $12.85 and $13.15, up from its previous estimate of $12.30 to $12.60 per share. In addition, Lockheed said it would raise its quarterly dividend rate by 10 percent to $2.00 per share.

Even Whole Foods stores that do not share space with major rivals can face constraints imposed by local governments.

Gabe Kadosh, vice president at real estate firm Colliers International, said Amazon and Whole Foods “want to have freedom to do whatever they want.","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market met a new foe this summer during talks to lease a top retail space in a San Francisco mall: the Target next door.

As City Center mall’s largest tenant, Target Corp had a say over changes to the property. According to people familiar with the lease discussions, Target balked at sharing the mall with Whole Foods because it feared competition from the grocery chain’s new owner, Amazon.com Inc.

Early attempts to persuade Target failed, and Whole Foods may now have to concede certain Amazon initiatives - such as lockers where customers can pick up goods ordered online - if it wants the location, the people said. Talks are ongoing.

A Reuters examination of real estate agreements and interviews with 20 retail landlords, lawyers and brokers show that the strings attached to operating in malls like City Center present an emerging and little-scrutinized challenge to Amazon’s quest to re-shape Whole Foods.

Across the United States, large retailers including Target, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc and Best Buy Co Inc have legal rights in many lease agreements that allow them to limit what Amazon can do with nearby Whole Foods stores, and where it can open new ones.

Documents reviewed by Reuters show bans on Amazon lockers and delivery operations near a Target store in Illinois and also in Florida, where a new Whole Foods is set to open. Lockers for retrieving online orders are a way for Amazon to spur sales through the grocery chain.

In Manhattan and other locations, the leases of Whole Foods’ big box neighbors bar it from selling a range of goods that Amazon has in its massive online inventory, from electronics to toys and linens.

Even Whole Foods stores that do not share space with major rivals can face constraints imposed by local governments. A city council resolution in White Plains, New York, restricted the hours when Whole Foods can use a loading dock prior to the grocer locating in the mall.

Amazon declined to answer questions about how these restrictions across the country impact its plans.

In a statement, Target said it is “focused on what’s best for the company and delivering on the reasons our guests love Target. Our more than 1,800 stores across the country are a strategic asset and a vital part of Target’s future.”

The company did not discuss details of the restrictions reported by Reuters, but said, “It’s inaccurate to characterize lease agreements as our corporate strategy.”

Reuters could not determine the full extent of limits on Whole Foods stores because lease deals vary from mall to mall, and many are not public. While restricting how neighbors operate is a standard practice in retail, Amazon is new to feeling the heat.

Some mall owners and real estate brokers say Whole Foods will still find landlords who are eager to have the high-profile tenant driving traffic in their malls, and see rivals trying to keep Whole Foods out as short-sighted.

But with nearly all of Whole Foods’ 473 stores subject to lease agreements and plans to add up to 85 stores, according to regulatory filings, Amazon has launched into brick-and-mortar with more constraints and entrenched enemies than in the online world it dominates.

“Many people assume this big, 800-pound gorilla is going to come and beat up all of these retailers,” said Terrison Quinn, a senior vice president at brokerage SRS Real Estate Partners. “I just don’t think that’s going to be the case.”

DOZENS OF RESTRICTIONS

Amazon wasted no time in making changes when the $13.7 billion Whole Foods deal closed in August. The world’s largest online retailer cut grocery prices, started selling its Echo home speaker in stores and disclosed plans to add lockers to some locations and Whole Foods items to Prime Now, its two-hour delivery program.

Analysts expect such moves will boost online orders and revenue for Amazon. But big box rivals have a number of ways to fight back.

Retailers routinely negotiate guarantees that their landlords will not alter malls in a way that hurts sales, whether leasing to a strip club or starting construction projects without approval, real estate lawyers said.

These leases, which often last 10 to 20 years with options to renew, may even name competitors barred from opening a store.

A 16-page memo in July detailing the lease restrictions governing Miami’s Pinecrest Place mall, obtained by Reuters, offers a glimpse of the legal protections retailers are securing.

Target required an affiliate of national landlord Regency Centers Corp to bar “Any lockers, lock-boxes or other type of storage system that is used to receive or store merchandise from a catalog or online retailer.”

The document then specifies more than a dozen other restrictions for the mall, from leasing space to a pet shop or toy store to operating “a fulfillment center in connection with receiving, storing or distributing merchandise from a catalog or online retailer.”

Regency announced in April that Whole Foods will open in the center, meaning the store cannot have Amazon lockers or fulfill orders for Prime Now.

A May memo of lease for a Target in Evanston, Illinois, obtained by Reuters, contains similar prohibitions against lockers and online fulfillment.

In another case, Target raised similar concerns about Amazon for a prospective Whole Foods location at the Stonestown Galleria in San Francisco, people familiar with the matter said.

A Reuters analysis showed that 7 percent of existing Whole Foods' U.S. stores are within a quarter mile, or roughly five-minute walk, of a Target.

OPPOSITION ABOUNDS

Target is not alone in placing limits on Amazon.

Lidl, a German grocery chain expanding in the United States, said in a deal this year it would “prohibit the operation of pickup facilities” by rivals such as “Wal-Mart and Amazon... that sell grocery items” near a planned store on Long Island in New York, according to a person familiar with the matter. The language is becoming common, the person said.

Will Harwood, a spokesman for Lidl, said, “We adhere to industry norms and standard real estate practices when securing sites.”

A Bed Bath & Beyond store in lower Manhattan bars its next-door tenant - Whole Foods - from selling linens, bathroom items, housewares and frames, its memo of lease said. The company declined to comment.

And a Best Buy store just north of Miami has the exclusive right in its shopping center to sell electronics. A lease carve-out, which states other tenants can sell gadgets on less than 250 square feet of floor space, allowed for the mall’s Whole Foods to display the Echo speaker, according to a memo seen by Reuters and a reporter who visited the location.

“It is pretty standard for anchor tenants of a shopping center to reserve the right in their leases to prohibit improvements to a center - including the addition of new tenants - without approval and consent,” said Jeff Shelman, spokesman for Best Buy.

Gabe Kadosh, vice president at real estate firm Colliers International, said Amazon and Whole Foods “want to have freedom to do whatever they want. The challenge is in brick and mortar, and in multi-tenant shopping centers, you can’t just do that.”",Amazon rivals turn to legal fine print to stem Whole Foods strategy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-realestate/amazon-rivals-turn-to-legal-fine-print-to-stem-whole-foods-strategy-idUSKBN1CT0ES

Air Berlin had been in exclusive talks with Lufthansa and easyjet, but while a deal was agreed with Lufthansa for large parts of its business, talks with easyJet continued over the weekend.

“Air Berlin is in talks with two bidders - easyjet and Condor. The race is wide open,” the source said.

EasyJet has said it is interested in operations covering about 25 planes, predominantly at Berlin’s Tegel airport. EasyJet currently flies only from Berlin Schoenefeld and analysts say a deal could allow it to build its share in Berlin and possibly offer domestic routes within Germany.

Condor had expressed interest in Air Berlin when the carrier filed for insolvency back in August, however the creditors chose to negotiate with Lufthansa and easyJet.

Time is ticking for a deal to be done, however. The last Air Berlin flight is due to take place on Friday.

The airline had hoped to be able to present deals for remaining assets to a creditor committee today, but instead was only able to present a deal for its cargo marketing unit Leisure Cargo.

Condor and easyJet declined to comment.

The request was made by Damian Collins, chair of parliament’s Digital, Media and Sport Committee as part of its effort to gather evidence for an inquiry it is conducting into fake news.

“Part of this inquiry will focus on the role of foreign actors abusing platforms such as yours to interfere in the political discourse of other nations,” Collins wrote in a letter to Zuckerberg circulated to media by the committee.

He asked Facebook to provide examples of all adverts bought by Russian-linked accounts, of all pages set up by Russian-linked accounts, information on the targeting of such adverts and pages and how many times they were viewed.

“I believe that the information I have requested is in line with that already supplied to Facebook to several United States Senate Committees, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, in relation to the 2016 U.S. presidential election,” wrote Collins.

The committee of British lawmakers launched its inquiry into fake news in January but it was suspended when a general election was called for June. The closing date for submitting evidence is Nov. 7.

The inquiry aims to shed light on issues such as the impact of fake news on public understanding of the world and response to traditional journalism, the responsibilities of social media platforms and how people can be educated to assess news sources.

The issue of whether and how much Russia intervened in the 2016 U.S. presidential election is a huge issue in Washington, where it is the subject of multiple investigations.

Facebook said on Oct. 2 that some 10 million people in the United States saw politically divisive ads on its network that were purchased in Russia in the months before and after the presidential election.

In Britain, interest in whether Russia also played a part in domestic political processes such as the June 2016 referendum on withdrawing from the European Union and the June 2017 general election has been increasing in recent weeks.

Last week, another MP, Ben Bradshaw, called on the government to get to the bottom of reports of opaque funding sources for some elements of the pro-Brexit campaign, citing “widespread concern over foreign and particularly Russian interference”.

U.S. President Donald Trump broke ranks with other major powers this month by refusing to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the deal, even though international inspectors say it is.

Jubeir said the nuclear deal had shortcomings, and that he agreed with Trump’s assessment that Iran was working to destabilise the region and was funding militant organisations.

Following Trump’s decision, U.S. Congress has until mid-December to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact.

Jubeir said that new sanctions on Iran would be welcome, and that a delay could mean that by the time sanctions had impact, Iran could have already developed “a dozen” nuclear bombs.

“The international community needs to support those (sanctions) in order to send a very strong message to Iran that your behaviour, your nefarious activities, have consequences,” Jubeir said.

There is now a 30 percent chance Britain will leave the EU without a trade deal when two-year divorce talks end in March 2019, up from 25 percent in a September poll, according to the median forecast in the latest Reuters survey of economists.

“It is in everybody’s interests that a transitional arrangement is put in place by 2019. Given the EU’s habit of finding a last-minute solution, we believe that a deal will be found. But the risk of failure is non-negligible,” said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank.

British Prime Minister Theresa May won a modest reprieve on Friday when European Union leaders signalled they were ready to move negotiations forward in the coming months.

But she now faces a political balancing act as she tries to meet EU demands for more concrete pledges on Britain’s divorce bill without triggering a backlash from Brexit campaigners at home, some of whom would prefer she walk away from talks.

The overwhelming majority of respondents in the poll, however, said the most likely ultimate outcome was still an EU-UK free trade agreement, possibly with a transitional arrangement.

The second most probable outcome was Britain leaving without a deal and being forced to trade with the continent under basic World Trade Organization rules, the poll showed.

Third was European Economic Area membership, under which Britain would pay to maintain full access to the EU Single Market - but without having any say over its policies.

The least likely option was Britain reversing its decision to leave the European Union, the poll showed.

While the sample of respondents was different and slightly larger than the Reuters poll published on Sept. 1, the overall conclusions about Britain’s likely future trading relationship with the European Union were the same.

There was no noticeable change among those who contributed to both polls although a majority increased their risk forecast.

“Our base case remains that there will eventually be a deal and talks will move on to trade at the December meeting - based on our view that the alternative is so bad a deal must happen - but the next couple of months will be politically very tricky indeed for Theresa May,” said Daniel Vernazza at UniCredit.

European Council President Donald Tusk said on Tuesday it was up to Britain to determine if there would be a good deal or no deal and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said they were not negotiating with London in a hostile way.

WRONG MOVE

Britain’s economy has so far dodged the widely-predicted post-referendum recession but is now lagging, rather than leading, the other Group of Seven industrialised economies in the midst of a resurgence in the global economy.

According to the poll, UK growth will be 0.3 percent per quarter through to the middle of next year, behind projections for 0.5 percent for the EU bloc. [ECILT/EU]

In the aftermath of last year’s decision to leave the EU, the Bank of England cut borrowing costs to a record low of 0.25 percent but it has since turned more hawkish and given strong signals it intends to raise rates soon.

As a result, a large majority of economists polled - 46 out of 64 - said the Bank would put those 25 basis points back on its Bank Rate on Nov. 2 - although about three-quarters of those surveyed also said now was not the right time to do so.

“A rate rise or two won’t crash the economy, but will be negative for household and business spending at the margins,” said Elizabeth Martins at HSBC.

“Given, we don’t see an urgent need to tighten from an inflation perspective, any tightening may come to be seen as unnecessary at best.”

Consumers played a major role in driving economic growth last year but high inflation, largely driven by the fall in sterling since the referendum which has made imports more expensive, means they are more likely to rein in spending.

Average consumer prices rose 3.0 percent in September compared with a year earlier, the fastest increase in more than five years and much steeper than the 2.0 percent the Bank of England would like.

Inflation is not expected to fall back to target anytime soon, with the poll predicting it will average 2.6 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2019.

However, after an initial November rate rise no action is expected from the central bank next year. For now, it is forecast to add another 25 basis points in 2019.

Namibia said that it rejected allegations that it had not submitted a report for more than a year to the Security Council’s sanctions committee on North Korea.

“The Government of Namibia wishes to categorically state that it has submitted reports to the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee as required, the last having been submitted on 8 April 2017,” Lineekela Mboti, the permanent secretary in the Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation, said in a statement.

Hugh Griffiths, who is the coordinator of the body charged with monitoring sanctions enforcement on North Korea, said Namibia had contracted North Korean workers and state companies to construct an ammunitions factory in clear violation of UN sanctions dating back nearly a decade.

Griffiths alleged in a report on CNN that the UN panel had not received responses from Namibia to specific queries for more than a year.

“It is not enough to talk in the media. It is not enough to say you have been exonerated by the UN for North Korean sanctions violations because that is not true,” Griffiths was quoted by CNN as saying.

Mboti said Namibia terminated the contracts with Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation and Mansudae Overseas Projects in the southern African nation, “which will remain in place” for as long as the UN Security Council sanctions continued.

The aim of this policy is to enable U.S. weapons manufactures to sell their products overseas quickly by trimming the bureaucratic red tape now governing the export of non-military grade weapons and ammunition. According to the Reuters report, the new plan would mean that commercial gun exports would no longer be given the same scrutiny as missile and fighter jet sales, which often require congressional approval. The shift would also move weapons like assault rifles and handguns from the State Department’s tightly-restricted Munitions list to the Commerce Control Lists, which allows for more streamlined licensing for international sales. While the administration has explained these new procedures as a logical extension of a U.S. president who is solidly pro-business, the transfer of authority from Foggy Bottom will have unintended and damaging foreign policy repercussions.

In contrast to the significant decline in major conventional conflicts over the last 50 years, unconventional conflicts within a sovereign state’s territory, such as the current war in Syria, have become the new normal. Small weapons like AK-47’s assault rifles, Kalashnikovs, sniper rifles, and low-grade explosives are used in most of these confrontations. Indeed, the ease with which a combatant with little military training can use semi-automatic weapons on the battlefield is part of the weapons’ appeal.

Light arms have many advantages for guerilla armies: an AK-47 is a lot cheaper than a tank, a missile defense system, or a fighter aircraft and it can be smuggled across porous borders. As Senators Ben Cardin, Patrick Leahy, and Dianne Feinstein wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in opposing the new rules, the civil wars and rebellions currently taking place are being fueled by the illegal sales of what many Americans would categorize as sports rifles or hunting equipment.

Relaxing the rules on small arms exports is counterproductive to the U.S. objective of de-escalating these conflicts. The new administration policy has the potential to squander the inclusive diplomatic processes Washington has encouraged in order to promote peaceful approaches to conflict resolution in states as varied as South Sudan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Multiple agencies and departments within the U.S. government would in effect be working against one another, with the State Department hoping to end the very hostilities that are sustained by American-manufactured weapons.

Washington would not be deliberately arming combatants in a civil war, but the handguns and assault rifles American firearms manufacturers sell on the open market could find their way to a conflict zone through smuggling and diversion. In one highly-publicized case last year, corrupt Jordanian intelligence officers sold a cache of rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles that were destined for the moderate Syrian opposition to arms merchants on the underground market. The FBI later determined that one of those weapons was likely to have been responsible for the shooting deaths of two American contractors in Jordan that same year.

The civil war in Libya illustrates the insecurity that can result when governments send weapons into a conflict zone without crafting the necessary oversight and security measures that help prevent them from being sold off elsewhere. During the 2011 armed rebellion against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Washington's Arab partners – with the secret blessing of the Obama administration – delivered military assistance to the rebels trying to oust the regime. While the military aid helped to drive Gaddafi from power after eight months of combat, that same equipment eventually helped fuel the civil war still ravaging Libya. Libyan militias previously concerned with overthrowing Qaddafi began stockpiling arms to increase their political leverage for later internal battles. The availability of weapons in Libya remains so overwhelming that U.N. experts have categorized the North African country as a regional weapons bazaar. Weapons that were sent into the country to aid the Libyan rebellion have been diverted to other regional conflicts, either through arms smuggling across lightly defended borders or through illicit arms deals. African officials claim that some of these arms likely assisted the jihadist Boko Haram group to recover after serious territorial losses against the Nigerian army.

According to the Small Arms Survey, the United States is already the world’s top exporter of small arms, having reached a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. While this figure is small compared to the far larger conventional weapons contracts U.S. defense manufacturers sign every year, the possibility that even a fraction of these commercial weapons could leak into a conflict zone would have a deeply negative impact.

The question is whether the monetary benefits that are likely to result from the administration’s new rules are enough to compensate for the instability and violence that are likely to increase with more small arms available for sale around the world. The ease with which U.S. arms companies will now be able to export their products may be terrific from a business perspective. But from the standpoint of international peace and security, this policy is a dangerous gamble for the White House to take.

A key Xi ally, top corruption fighter Wang Qishan, will not be on the new Politburo Standing Committee, the apex of power in China, to be revealed on Wednesday as he was not among those named on Tuesday to the 204-member Central Committee.

Whether or not the powerful Wang would remain on the Standing Committee, which currently has seven members, despite being beyond the customary retirement age of 69, had been among the key questions to be answered at the week-long party congress, which ended on Tuesday. Wang could still assume another senior role over the next few months.

As expected, the party unanimously passed an amendment to include “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” as one of its guiding principles.

The party will announce its new Standing Committee, headed by Xi, at around midday (0400 GMT) on Wednesday, culminating a twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle.

As expected, the amended constitution affirmed that Xi’s signature fight against corruption, which has ensnared more than 1.3 million officials, will continue.

Unexpectedly, Xi’s “Belt and Road” initiative, an ambitious program to build infrastructure linking China with its neighbors and beyond, was also included in the party constitution.

Also included was a commitment to supply-side industrial reforms, and giving play to the “decisive role” of market forces in resource allocation, a commitment Xi had made early in his first terms that many investors say he has failed to deliver on.

“The party exercises overall leadership over all areas of endeavor in every part of the country,” the party said in a statement reflecting Xi’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the party and its place in contemporary Chinese society.

If no clear successor to Xi is named to the new Politburo Standing Committee, it will further fuel speculation that Xi may look to retain power beyond the customary second five-year term.

“This is about further erasing any distinction between Xi Jinping and the party,” said Jude Blanchette, who studies the party at The Conference Board’s China Center for Economics and Business in Beijing, referring to Xi’s thought getting into the constitution.

“Add on to this having supply-side structural reform and One Belt One Road written into this, which were Xi’s signature policies, this makes questioning or non-compliance with those tantamount to betrayal of the party.”

THE MARKET AND THE PARTY

Xu Hongcai, deputy chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, a Beijing think-tank, said party control was needed to push through the market reforms key to restructuring the world’s second-largest economy.

“To build a market economic system in such a big country, it’s impossible without the leadership of the party,” he said.

Others have argued that the two are contradictory.

“When you put ‘supply-side reform’ and ‘market playing a decisive role’ in the same document, then that just shows they have to almost choose one,” said Alex Wolf, Senior Emerging Markets Economist with Aberdeen Standard Investments in Hong Kong.

China’s blue-chip shares climbed to a 26-month high on Tuesday, led by infrastructure and property stocks, as Xi wrapped up a congress that began with his three-and-a half hour speech envisioning a more prosperous, confident China. The yuan strengthened against the dollar.

CROWNING GLORY?

Xi rapidly consolidated power after assuming party leadership in late 2012 and then the presidency the next year. The party gave Xi the title of “core” leader a year ago, a significant strengthening of his position.

Whether Xi was able to have his name “crowned” in the party constitution had been seen as a key measure of his power, elevating him to a level of previous leaders exemplified by Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.

No other leader since Mao has had an eponymous ideology included in the document while in office. Deng’s name was added after his death in 1997.

A list of 133 committee members for the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection released on Tuesday included Zhao Leji, who heads the party’s Organisation Department, a strong sign that he will take over from Wang as anti-corruption chief.

China’s top banking regulator, Guo Shuqing, and veteran banker Jiang Chaoliang, front runners to succeed Zhou Xiaochuan as central bank governor, both made it to the Central Committee.

The constitutional amendment, along with Xi’s work report and a work report of the graft watchdog to the congress, were passed by a show of hands.

When Xi next asked for any “no” votes or abstentions for the amendment or two work reports, the sound of “none” echoed throughout the chamber, as officials shouted out from different sides of the hall.","China enshrines 'Xi Jinping Thought', key Xi ally to step down",https://www.reuters.com/article/china-congress/china-enshrines-xi-jinping-thought-key-xi-ally-to-step-down-idINKBN1CT0C7

Halawa, who was born and raised in Dublin and is a son of the most senior Muslim cleric in Ireland, was 17 when he was arrested along with hundreds of others in 2013 as part of a crackdown on protests in Egypt.

“It still feels like a dream, it’s a moment I’ve waited for four years. I‘m a free man. I‘m hoping I can get my life back, get back to college and get my career,” a smiling Halawa, draped in an Irish flag, told reporters upon his arrival home.

Halawa thanked the Irish people, the government and his family for working hard to secure his release. A member of the Irish government, which had lobbied for his return, was among the well-wishers.

Halawa and three of his sisters were charged along with nearly 500 others with crimes including breaking into a mosque, killing 44 people, and illegal possession of firearms in violence that followed the military’s overthrow of Egypt’s Islamist president, Mohamed Mursi, in 2013.

The Halawas said they were on vacation visiting extended family in Egypt and joined a protest against the military’s ouster of Mursi while they were there.

The defendants had all faced the death penalty and though none received it, hundreds were given hefty jail sentences. Halawa’s sisters were released shortly after their arrests.

“This case has been one of the most complex, sensitive and difficult consular cases to which the Irish Government has ever responded. I and all of my colleagues are very pleased Ibrahim’s ordeal is now at an end,” Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said in a statement.

Halawa has said he was regularly tortured during his period in detention. The Egyptian authorities have repeatedly denied allegations of abuses from rights groups.

“They all claim that (torture) and we have often denied (it took place),” a senior Egyptian interior ministry source said.

The world’s largest restaurant chain by revenue has been working to boost flagging traffic at its U.S. restaurants, where it gets most of its profit, after customers defected to fast-food rivals and pricier fast-casual options like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N).

In the past year, McDonald’s has introduced cook-to-order, fresh beef Quarter Pounders, new items with a variety of buns and sauces like the Signature Sriracha sandwich, as well as mobile ordering and delivery.

“We served more customers, more often,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said on a conference call to discuss third-quarter earnings. “The U.S. business regained its stride.”

Global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 6 percent for the quarter, beating the 4.5 percent gain expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.

Those sales rose a better-than-expected 4.1 percent in the United States, where traffic improved for the second quarter after more than four straight years of declines. China, the UK and Canada also turned in strong performances.

“Given that the fast food and casual dining segments as a whole struggled over the third quarter, this is an encouraging set of results which suggests McDonald’s is gaining both market and customer share,” GlobalData Retail’s Managing Director Neil Saunders said.

McDonadl’s shares were last up 1.5 percent in midday trading and not far from a record high hit on Friday.

Aggressive promotions in the United States included soft drinks of all sizes for $1, McCafe smoothies and espresso drinks for $2 and the McPick 2 offer of two menu items for $5.

The changes, part of a turnaround plan under Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook, came after Chipotle, Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and others raised the bar on what consumers can expect from fast food.

McDonald’s shares have climbed 65 percent since Easterbrook was named CEO in March 2015, outperforming a 22 percent rise in the S&P 500 and Chipotle’s 52 percent drop.

Fast-casual chains have fallen far short of expectations after a wave of initial public offerings in recent years. Shares in Zoe’s Kitchen Inc (ZOES.N) and Noodles & Co (NDLS.O) are trading below their IPO prices, while Shake Shack Inc (SHAK.N) is far short of its all-time high of nearly $93 in May 2015.

Lower priced fast-food chains seem to be benefiting from last year’s sharp slowdown in customer traffic to fast-casual chains including Chipotle, which is still trying to recover from a string of food safety incidents in 2015, Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said in a recent report.

“I think it’s safe to say that the reports of fast food’s death were greatly exaggerated,” said Senatore, who added that McDonald’s and its fast-food peers have posted the best fundamental results and stock returns of the broader industry since late 2015.

Excluding items, McDonald’s earned a profit of $1.76 per share, just missing an average analyst estimate of $1.77 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

During the quarter, McDonald’s had higher taxes and expenses, but also had gains from selling its China and Hong Kong businesses.

Total revenue fell 10 percent to $5.75 billion, due to restaurant sales to franchisees and strategic partners. Doing so eliminates the cost of operating those units and replaces restaurant sales with more predictable rent and royalty payments.","McDonald's sales strong as deals, new burgers lure back diners",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-results/mcdonalds-sales-strong-as-deals-new-burgers-lure-back-diners-idUSKBN1CT1OH?il=0

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

One of the biggest so-called initial coin offerings to date, which raised some $230 million for a blockchain project called Tezos, has led to a spat between its architects and a Swiss foundation that controls the digital cash, according to a Reuters special report. Even in the world of crypto-currencies, traditional financial motivations apply.

ICOs, a hot financial trend with well over $2 billion raised this year, fall somewhere on the spectrum between crowd-funding and issuing non-voting shares. Participants contribute existing digital currencies like bitcoin and ether. Some may simply want to bankroll the project in question, but most hope to grab a slug of whatever new online coinage is on offer – in the Tezos case, “tezzies” – and to see it appreciate, as ether has done nearly 40-fold this year alone.

The creators of Tezos, Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, got the fund-raising formula right. However, they set up a governance structure in which a legally independent Swiss foundation controls the digital cash raised. Now they are at loggerheads with its president, Johann Gevers, who told Reuters the couple were trying to control the foundation. They have accused him of “self-dealing, self-promotion and conflicts of interest.”

The Breitmans stand to collect a portion of the proceeds – now in theory worth roughly double their original value – as Tezos project milestones trigger the foundation’s purchase of their company, Dynamic Ledger Solutions. Yet although it seems a sensible step in the experimental world of ICOs to incorporate checks on the use of the funds raised, the Swiss foundation may have been a method too vulnerable to human whims.

Meanwhile, China and South Korea have banned ICOs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed concerns. Project details can be very sketchy and it’s not always clear what contributors are entitled to receive. Kathleen Breitman likens the Tezos fundraising to making a donation and receiving a tote bag in return, but people interviewed by Reuters seem more like investors who are expecting returns.

The backstory is intriguing. The Breitmans met at a crypto-anarchist lunch. He, the son of a French playwright and actor, went on to work at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, while she later toiled at Ray Dalio’s secretive hedge-fund firm Bridgewater Associates. An early backer was Silicon Valley doyen Tim Draper. Right now, though, an old-fashioned mantra seems to be at work: “follow the money.”","Breakingviews - ICOs validate old-school ""follow the money"" mantra",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitcoin-funding-breakingviews/breakingviews-icos-validate-old-school-follow-the-money-mantra-idUSKBN1CO29V

A European Union bank structural reform law was proposed in 2014, a relatively late addition to rules rolled out after the 2007-09 banking crisis which resulted in taxpayer bailouts.

It was meant to be Europe’s answer to the U.S. Volcker Rule, a crisis-era measure banning Wall Street banks from speculating with their own money which is due to be scaled back significantly by U.S. regulators.

The EU draft law gave regulators powers to force banks to split off trading activities, but got bogged down over the criteria used to do so.

At the same time the mood among some policymakers was moving from the need for more new rules to nurturing economic growth in a region where the bulk of loans come from banks.

The European Commission said in its new workplan on Tuesday that it was withdrawing the measure with “no foreseeable agreement” in prospect.

“In addition, the main financial stability rationale of the proposal has in the meantime been addressed by other regulatory measures in the banking sector, and most notably the entry into force of the Banking Union’s supervisory and resolution arms.”

Big banks have since had to comply with other rules, such as issuing bonds that can be written down to replenish capital.

Gunnar Hoekmark, the centre-right Swede who was steering the measure through the European Parliament, said the EU executive had made the right decision.

“It was my firm belief that splitting up universal banks by separating retail from trade, investment and market making, would create instability and hinder investments and a more dynamic banking sector,” Hoekmark said in a statement.

Over 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar since Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response by the Myanmar army that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.

At a meeting in Myanmar’s capital Naypyitaw, attended by Myanmar’s home affairs minister lieutenant general Kyaw Swe and his Bangladeshi counterpart Asaduzzaman Khan, the countries signed two agreements covering security and border cooperation.

The two sides have also agreed to “to halt the outflow of Myanmar residents to Bangladesh,” and “to form a joint working group,” Tin Myint, permanent secretary from Myanmar’s home affairs ministry told reporters after the meetings.

“After joint working group, the verification, (the) two countries have agreed to arrange different steps so that these people can return to their homeland safely and honourably and in secure conditions,” said Mostafa Kamal Uddin, secretary from Bangladeshi home affairs ministry.

The officials did not elaborate on the specific steps the authorities would take for the repatriation, adding that the bulk of discussions was dedicated to border and security cooperation agreements which have been long in the making.

Tin Myint said the two countries agreed “to restore normalcy in Rakhine to enable displaced Myanmar residents to return from Bangladesh at the earliest opportunity.”

He also said Myanmar had sent a list of suspects who had fled to Bangladesh and requested the authorities there to investigate and return them to Myanmar.

Thousands of refugees have continued to arrived cross the Naf river separating Myanmar’s western Rakhine state and Bangladesh in recent days, even though Myanmar says military operations ceased on Sept. 5.

The United States said on Monday it was considering a range of further actions over Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority.

While on Tuesday the officials said the talks were friendly, tensions are still high between the two countries. Bangladesh last month accused Myanmar of repeatedly violating its air space and warned that any more “provocative acts” could have “unwarranted consequences”.

On border and security, the two sides decided to establish border liaison offices, carry out regular meetings between two security forces, jointly combat drug trafficking across the border and set up a mechanism to communicate directly.

Bangladesh has for decades faced influxes of Rohingya fleeing persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where the Rohingya are seen as illegal migrants. It was already home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya before the latest crisis.

Though Rohingya families have lived in Myanmar for generations, they are denied citizenship and access to basic civil rights such as freedom of movement, decent education and healthcare.

Hundreds in Rakhine on Sunday protested to urge Myanmar’s government not to repatriate the Rohingya.","Myanmar, Bangladesh agree to cooperate on Rohingya refugee repatriation",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-myanmar-rohingya/myanmar-bangladesh-agree-to-cooperate-on-rohingya-refugee-repatriation-idUKKBN1CT298?il=0

Particularly since Congress, which is empowered to write American laws, declined to make similar changes to the Obama-era health law when Trump urged legislators to do so, most of the framers of the Constitution would presumably be appalled by these actions. Yet this is not just a problem with the current president. The expansion, and sometimes misuse, of executive power is a result produced in large measure by the framers’ choices to dilute accountability and responsibility in the federal government, and their designing a presidential system in which a minority party can regularly win.

Trump has mounted a two-pronged attack on the ACA following the failure of legislative repeal efforts. First, he issued an order that will weaken the regulations in the ACA requiring private insurance to cover certain essential services. This will allow some consumers to purchase cheaper plans that don’t cover very much. A subset of young and healthy people will have lower premiums, but premiums will shoot up for everyone else, as the market of people buying decent insurance becomes older and sicker. (And, of course, for young people who end up needing expensive medical treatment, what looks like a bargain will turn into a disaster.)

We know exactly how this will play out because Tennessee has used a loophole to allow barebones insurance to be offered to consumers. After weeding out the young and healthy, Tennessee’s market offers among the nation’s highest premiums on its health insurance exchange.

Although Trump’s order has no justification as public policy, it is probably legal. Barack Obama issued numerous executive orders designed to implement the Affordable Care Act, as well as taking aggressive action on issues like immigration and climate change after Congress failed to act. Given the complexity of the regulatory state and the strong tendency of Congress to gridlock, a rigid conception of executive power would probably be worse for democratic accountability and functioning governance. Policy-wise, there’s no equivalence between Obama’s attempts to make the Affordable Care Act work as intended and Trump’s explicit attempts to sabotage it. But in terms of formal executive power, there’s ample precedent for Trump’s actions. Legal challenges to Obama’s actions suspending some of the ACA’s regulations never got any traction.

Trump’s second action is even worse as policy and it also has a shakier legal foundation. Trump announced that he was ending subsidy payments to insurers that would give them incentives to cover poorer and sicker people without raising premiums on others. People buying insurance will bear the brunt of the action through higher premiums or deductibles. Since more buyers will be eligible for subsidies, the perverse effect of the action will be to insure fewer people while spending more money. (The funding might be restored by Congress: Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray have reached a deal in which Republicans will be bribed not to end the payments if states are given more leeway to loosen the law’s insurance market regulations. Trump supports the agreement, although it is not yet clear if it will have the votes to pass the Senate or House.)

The withholding of payments presents potential legal problems. Nineteen state attorneys general filed suit against the administration, arguing that the administration did not comply with the procedures necessary to stop the payments promised by the law, and also that the action violated the “take care” clause of Article II. The former argument in particular is not frivolous, but the potential of these lawsuits is unclear.

While this kind of executive policymaking is not what the framers had in mind, it’s still going to become more common. The American separation-of-powers system always tends towards stasis. There are so many choke points: a bicameral legislature, the Senate filibuster, the presidential veto, and judicial review. When Congress is unable to act, executive power is likely to fill the vacuum.

The problem is compounded by the various ways in which the Constitution distorts democratic choice. Because of factors like vote suppression, gerrymandering, nearly unlimited campaign spending, and institutions that over-represent white rural voters such as the Senate and the Electoral College, Republicans have been able to lose the popular vote and still win elections. Winner-take-all elections, instead of proportional representation, mean that the slimmest of victories puts total power in the hands of the officeholders who did not attract many voters. Racially and culturally-polarized politics mean that most rank-and-file Republicans pull the lever for the party despite not agreeing with much of its economic agenda. Once in office, Republicans are committed to policies, such as the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, that appease the Republican donor class and the activist base, but not most Republican voters and certainly not Democrats and independents.

Republican Congresses are left incapable of fulfilling their incoherent campaign promises, such as repealing Obamacare’s regulations and subsidies without taking insurance away from millions of Americans. Caught between their base’s demand to repeal, even without a meaningful replacement, but fearing the wrath of voters in more moderate states, they ended up passing nothing. The inevitable outcome is the Republican president, elected by a minority and unconcerned with reaching beyond his base, enacting the right-wing’s demands by fiat.

When considering Trump’s randomly destructive style of policymaking, it’s worth remembering that in 2016 the plurality of American voters chose Hillary Clinton, the candidate who promised to faithfully execute the Affordable Care Act, only to be denied their choice by a mechanism the Constitution’s authors intended in part to curb “excessive democracy.” The framers feared the powers of the executive branch being abused, but the system they designed has allowed it to happen.",Commentary: Blame the Constitution for Trump’s undemocratic executive orders,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lemieux-executive-commentary/commentary-blame-the-constitution-for-trumps-undemocratic-executive-orders-idUSKBN1CN2NR

Haley plans to visit Gambella in western Ethiopia, where nearly 350,000 refugees have flooded across the border from South Sudan since the country spiraled into civil war in 2013, just two years after it gained independence from Sudan.

“You have to really think hard before you pull U.S. aid because President Kiir doesn’t care,” Haley said. “He doesn’t care if his people suffer and that’s the concern we have as we don’t know that will make a difference.”

“That’s a conversation we will have and we will try and see exactly what will move President Kiir so that he does ... start to really look at creating a safe position for his people,” she told reporters in Addis Ababa late on Monday.

Haley will this week be the most senior member of U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration to visit South Sudan, where she is due to meet with Kiir. But first, she will see how the conflict has threatened to spillover through deadly cross-border raids into Gambella, Ethiopia by gunmen from South Sudan.

Trump’s new aid administrator, Mark Green, visited South Sudan last month, telling Kiir that Washington was reviewing its policy toward his government. He called on Kiir to end the violence and implement a “real” ceasefire.

The war in South Sudan was sparked by a feud between Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar. It has plunged parts of the world’s youngest nation into famine and forced a third of the population - some 4 million people - to flee their homes.

Machar fled and is now being held in South Africa to stop him stirring up trouble, sources told Reuters in December.

A fragile peace deal broke down last year amid gun battles between soldiers and rebels in the capital Juba. International efforts to bring warring sides to new talks have not succeeded.

“We can’t see any more deaths, we can’t see anymore famine, we’ve got to start seeing the situation start to get better and I think that the pressure is only going to continue until President Kiir makes a difference,” Haley said.

There is now a 30 percent chance Britain will leave the EU without a trade deal when two-year divorce talks end in March 2019, up from 25 percent in a September poll, according to the median forecast in the latest Reuters survey of economists.

“It is in everybody’s interests that a transitional arrangement is put in place by 2019. Given the EU’s habit of finding a last-minute solution, we believe that a deal will be found. But the risk of failure is non-negligible,” said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank.

British Prime Minister Theresa May won a modest reprieve on Friday when European Union leaders signalled they were ready to move negotiations forward in the coming months.

But she now faces a political balancing act as she tries to meet EU demands for more concrete pledges on Britain’s divorce bill without triggering a backlash from Brexit campaigners at home, some of whom would prefer she walk away from talks.

The overwhelming majority of respondents in the poll, however, said the most likely ultimate outcome was still an EU-UK free trade agreement, possibly with a transitional arrangement.

The second most probable outcome was Britain leaving without a deal and being forced to trade with the continent under basic World Trade Organization rules, the poll showed.

Third was European Economic Area membership, under which Britain would pay to maintain full access to the EU Single Market - but without having any say over its policies.

The least likely option was Britain reversing its decision to leave the European Union, the poll showed.

While the sample of respondents was different and slightly larger than the Reuters poll published on Sept. 1, the overall conclusions about Britain’s likely future trading relationship with the European Union were the same.

There was no noticeable change among those who contributed to both polls although a majority increased their risk forecast.

“Our base case remains that there will eventually be a deal and talks will move on to trade at the December meeting - based on our view that the alternative is so bad a deal must happen - but the next couple of months will be politically very tricky indeed for Theresa May,” said Daniel Vernazza at UniCredit.

European Council President Donald Tusk said on Tuesday it was up to Britain to determine if there would be a good deal or no deal and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said they were not negotiating with London in a hostile way.

WRONG MOVE

Britain’s economy has so far dodged the widely-predicted post-referendum recession but is now lagging, rather than leading, the other Group of Seven industrialised economies in the midst of a resurgence in the global economy.

According to the poll, UK growth will be 0.3 percent per quarter through to the middle of next year, behind projections for 0.5 percent for the EU bloc.

In the aftermath of last year’s decision to leave the EU, the Bank of England cut borrowing costs to a record low of 0.25 percent but it has since turned more hawkish and given strong signals it intends to raise rates soon.

As a result, a large majority of economists polled - 46 out of 64 - said the Bank would put those 25 basis points back on its Bank Rate on Nov. 2 - although about three-quarters of those surveyed also said now was not the right time to do so.

“A rate rise or two won’t crash the economy, but will be negative for household and business spending at the margins,” said Elizabeth Martins at HSBC.

“Given, we don’t see an urgent need to tighten from an inflation perspective, any tightening may come to be seen as unnecessary at best.”

Consumers played a major role in driving economic growth last year but high inflation, largely driven by the fall in sterling since the referendum which has made imports more expensive, means they are more likely to rein in spending.

Average consumer prices rose 3.0 percent in September compared with a year earlier, the fastest increase in more than five years and much steeper than the 2.0 percent the Bank of England would like.

Inflation is not expected to fall back to target anytime soon, with the poll predicting it will average 2.6 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2019.

However, after an initial November rate rise no action is expected from the central bank next year. For now, it is forecast to add another 25 basis points in 2019.

“They’ll hike now (since they said so), but they’ll be making a mistake, and they’ll recognise that in the coming months, and it’s therefore overwhelmingly likely that they won’t hike again for a long while,” UniCredit’s Vernazza said.

Wentz connected with wide receiver Mack Hollins for 64 yards, threw a 4-yard strike to tight end Zach Ertz and a 9-yard pass to undrafted free agent running back Corey Clement.

Wentz’s fourth score came on a 10-yard pass to wide receiver Nelson Agholor for a 31-17 lead with 11:10 remaining.

Wentz has already thrown 17 touchdown passes through seven games, one more than he had all of last season. He finished the night 17 of 25 for 268 yards with one interception.

The Eagles (6-1) won their fifth straight. The Redskins (3-3) dropped into a second-place tie in the NFC East with the Dallas Cowboys.

Washington got within 24-17 when quarterback Kirk Cousins threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jordan Reed late in the third quarter. Philadelphia came right back and extended its lead to two touchdowns.

The news was not all good for the Eagles, however, as left tackle Jason Peters was carted off the field with a leg injury with 14:06 remaining in the third quarter.

Philadelphia was leading 17-10 when Peters got tangled up with defensive lineman Ziggy Hood. Peters’ leg appeared to bend awkwardly, and the veteran had an air cast placed on it before heading out on a cart. Peters, a nine-time Pro Bowl tackle, did not return.

Rookie kicker Jake Elliott’s 42-yard field goal with 6:19 left gave the Eagles a 34-17 lead. Cousins’ third touchdown pass, his second to Reed, this one for 12 yards, cut the deficit to 34-24 with 3:17 left.

Cousins completed 30 of 40 passes for 303 yards with one interception.

The Redskins drove 66 yards on eight plays on their first possession but settled for a 27-yard field goal from Nick Rose for an early 3-0 lead.

Following some sloppy play through the first quarter, the Eagles put together a solid drive and it resulted in a 50-yard field goal from Elliott with 13:15 remaining in the second to tie the game at 3.

It was Elliott’s 11th consecutive field goal and his fourth from 50 yards or longer this season.

Washington responded quickly and capped a seven-play, 81-yard drive with a 7-yard touchdown pass from Cousins to running back Chris Thompson for a 10-3 advantage with 9:14 left in the first half.

“Ultimately, Obamacare is an inflexible law that Congress must repeal and replace,” the governor said in a statement, adding that premiums under Obamacare had increased by 110 percent for Iowans since 2013.

Iowa sought the waiver after its individual healthcare marketplace shrank to only one insurer for next year, Minnesota-based Medica.

Some of the state’s requests were similar to provisions included in Republican repeal and replace bills this year. For instance, the waiver sought to replace Obamacare’s income-based tax credits with flat age-based credits and eliminate insurer payments that Trump cut off earlier this month.

Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said the move by Iowa demonstrated the need for repairs to Obamacare that he and Democratic Senator Patty Murray have proposed aimed at stabilizing insurance markets. It would also provide states more flexibility in reshaping some parts of Obamacare.

Trump has sent mixed signals over whether he would support the bipartisan fix. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Sunday that he was willing to bring up the proposal for a vote but needed to know where Trump stood.

Alexander said the bipartisan repair proposal would allow the federal government to approve Iowa’s waiver.

Alexander told reporters that the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan scorekeeper, would soon announce its analysis of the bipartisan repair legislation, possibly on Tuesday.",Iowa pulls request to opt out of Obamacare requirements,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-iowa/iowa-pulls-request-to-opt-out-of-obamacare-requirements-idUSKBN1CT01A

In August, fires raging in a remote region of British Columbia choked Vancouver and Seattle with smoke. That month, more than a million acres in Montana burned, forcing schoolchildren to stay inside. In September, terrifying images circulated of fires smoldering in the background of everyday scenes like an airport tarmac in Burbank, California and a golf course in Oregon.

The toll of these fires is the product of bad land use, especially over-development at the perimeter of forests, and subsequent fire suppression efforts that protect those developments at the expense of a vital natural cycle. If U.S. and Canadian authorities don’t adopt the right policies, wildfires will only become more deadly.

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

Following a wet and snowy winter in the West, many hoped this year would see minimal wildfires. But a hot, dry summer that set heat records even in normally-chilly San Francisco destroyed that optimism. This year is no fluke: large wildfires have become more common and damaging in recent years. In 2015, Washington State saw its worst wildfire season on record, including the largest fire in state history. In 2013, a rapidly escalating wildfire in Arizona killed 19 members of an elite firefighting squad. Climate scientists predict that global warming will make wildfires worse as less mountain snowpack and hotter, drier summers conspire to create more conflagrations.

The issue is most acute in the western areas of North America because the region’s rapidly growing population, proliferation of rural vacation homes, and suburban sprawl means more and more people are building too close to forests. From 1960 to the early 2000s, the U.S. population living in what’s known as the “wildland-urban interface,” the locations where homes and businesses butt up against a fire-prone natural environment – think of a subdivision in an Arizona canyon or a cluster of mountain cabins in Colorado surrounded by thick forest – has ballooned by 720 percent, from 25 to 140 million people. According to the U.S. Forest Service, 60 percent of new home construction since 1990 is located in this dangerous zone. As Montana Public Radio, reporting on the wildfire season, described it, “There’s an unquenchable demand for home construction in and near wildfire-prone areas.”

While heavily-forested landscapes are precisely the draw for constructing a cute cabin in the woods or relocating to a small town in the shadow of a tree-lined ridge, they are also increasingly dangerous places for people to live and towns to grow. When human lives and property are under threat, state and local jurisdictions have an obligation to respond. That costs a lot of money – this year has already proven to be the most expensive wildfire season in Montana since 1999, adjusted for inflation – and risks the lives of courageous firefighters.

Just like the need for stricter land-use regulations in the wake of coastal flooding from this season’s devastating hurricanes, it’s time for state and local governments to stop allowing people to live cheek-by-jowl with wildfire-prone vegetation and hold accountable those who take the risk. After all, when local firefighting budgets are exhausted, as they quickly are in heavy fire seasons, the U.S. Forest Service picks up the slack at a cost to all taxpayers. Even worse, voters in some areas with a history of past fires have rejected special assessments to pay for the extra fire prevention and response measures that their lifestyle requires, forcing the cost onto their neighbors who don’t live in fire zones.

Currently, just two states – California and Oregon – have mandatory mitigation measures that require structures in fire-prone zones to be built with fire-resistant materials and homeowners to clear vegetation a certain radius away from the building to prevent fire from engulfing a structure.

Stricter rules are a good first step, but the bigger problem is the people who are living near wildlands in the first place. National Geographic reports that the number of housing units within half a mile of a national forest grew from 484,000 in 1940 to 1.8 million in 2000.

Wildfires serve an important role in ecosystems, clearing underbrush and debris and allowing healthy trees to flourish. When more people live in or near forests, firefighters are ordered to suppress blazes near those houses, disrupting the natural wildfire cycle and making future fires even worse by building up the store of dry vegetation.

Low-density, sprawling development is the chief culprit. Outward expansion happened around every major U.S. city, but the consequences are the most severe in the fire-prone western United States. Many of the major cities with the lowest population densities, such as San Diego, Salt Lake City and Phoenix, are found in the West. Even supposedly eco-friendly West Coast burgs like Portland and Seattle are more spread out than East Coast cities such as Boston or Philadelphia. “In the last half century, about one-fifth of the American people have moved into flame zones, insufficiently aware of the perils awaiting them and inadvertently testing the limits of nature’s tolerance,” writes former National Park Service director Roger Kennedy in “Wildfire and Americans: How to Save Lives, Property, and Your Tax Dollars.”

The West’s historical draw may be as an escape valve from crowded eastern cities, but it’s time to retire that outdated narrative. Westerners who aren’t working the land need to live in dense housing in or near cities, not on big lots out at the edge of a wild forest. There are risks even if that forested hillside is close to the central city – like the Oakland hills, where California’s deadliest fire raged in 1991. Perversely, homeowners there used insurance payouts to build even bigger houses in the hills, though thankfully insurance companies are finally wising up and even refusing to re-insure in fire-prone areas.

The forest should be for visiting and maybe staying overnight in a tent, not for living in permanently. When the smoke from British Columbia made life unbearable in my Seattle apartment over the summer, I retreated to the cleaner air of Olympic National Park. The beautiful temperate rainforest would be a heavenly place for a cabin if I could afford one, but the responsible course of action is to follow the old hiker’s maxim: take only pictures, leave only footprints.",Commentary: There’s a way to reduce the wildfire toll.

Air Berlin had been in exclusive talks with Lufthansa and easyjet, but while a deal was agreed with Lufthansa for large parts of its business, talks with easyJet continued over the weekend.

“Air Berlin is in talks with two bidders - easyjet and Condor. The race is wide open,” the source said.

Later this week, Apple is set to begin taking pre-orders for its new smartphone, the iPhone X – which starts at $999 and uses artificial intelligence (AI) features embedded in the company’s latest A11 chips.

The phone promises new facial recognition features such as Face ID that uses a mathematical model of a person’s face to allow the user to sign on to their phones or pay for goods with a steady glance at their phones.

“We think that the frameworks that we’ve got, the ‘neural engines’ we’ve put in the phone, in the watch ... we do view that as a huge piece of the future, we believe these frameworks will allow developers to create apps that will do more and more in this space, so we think the phone is a major platform,” Williams said.

He was speaking at top chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (2330.TW) 30th anniversary celebration in Taipei, which was attended by global tech executives.

Williams said technological innovations, especially involving the cloud and on-device processing, will improve life without sacrificing privacy or security.

Both players had lost their opening ties on Sunday so were desperate for a victory to keep their future fate in the eight-woman event in their own hands and neither appeared willing to budge in a titanic three hour and 13-minute marathon.

The club sacked Ronald Koeman on Monday and handed Under-23 manager Unsworth the reins on a temporary basis on Tuesday.

“It doesn’t matter how many games, I’ll stand there a proud man and give it everything I’ve got,” the 44-year-old Unsworth, who made 314 appearances for Everton, told a news conference ahead of Wednesday’s League Cup trip to Chelsea.

The former defender said Koeman paid the price for failing to win - Everton have two league victories in nine games under the Dutchman this season.

“The bottom line for any manager when they lose their job is did you win enough games and unfortunately we’re in a position where you’re going to say ‘no, we haven‘t’,” Unsworth said.

Unsworth, who filled in as caretaker for the final game of the 2015-16 season after Roberto Martinez was sacked, said he had no qualms about taking the interim role for a second time.

”It’s a very easy decision to make... it’s not a difficult decision at all to stand as Everton manager,“ he added. ”If you’re an Evertonian, that makes you very proud.

”I’ll repeat myself from the last time I sat here 18 months ago. Who wouldn’t want this job?

”It is a top job for absolutely any football manager, myself included... an opportunity to hopefully get a run of games where performance levels go up and we produce some wins as well.

“From that, performances and results will dictate any future for me as Everton manager. I want to manage and this is an amazing club to be manager of. I think the time has come to say that. I make no secret of it.”

Unsworth refused to single out individuals responsible for the team’s slump.

“The problem is the team hasn’t won enough games and we have to burden the responsibility together. It’s not down to individuals leaving, individuals not coming in, it’s a team game and we burden that together,” he said.

Spain says it will impose direct rule on Catalonia from Friday to prevent an illegal push for independence, invoking unprecedented powers to dismiss the regional government. Madrid said an election would not change those plans.

The Catalan parliament meets on Thursday to agree on a response to Madrid, and many analysts believe the economically powerful region could formally declare independence.

Secessionists in Catalonia say their independence referendum on Oct. 1 - which attracted a 43 percent turnout and was mostly boycotted by those Catalans who want to remain in Spain - has given them a mandate for statehood.

Catalonia said on Monday it was confident that its officials, including the police, would defy attempts by Madrid to enforce direct rule.

Spanish political and business leaders, along with most Catalonian newspapers, have urged Catalan President Carles Puigdemont to call a regional election before he is stripped of his authority.

They say direct rule from Madrid would be a humiliation for Catalonia and pose a serious risk of unrest.

Puigdemont has so far remained silent on the matter of an election but an ally of his pro-independence government said he was actively considering this option.

“We have evidence this is currently on the table,” Carles Riera, a Catalan lawmaker for the anti-capitalist CUP party, told a news conference.

Calling an election would be a face-saving move for Puigdemont as it could either strengthen his mandate if pro-independence parties won or allow him a graceful exit if they did not.

DEBATE?

The Spanish government said a snap election would be a first step but Puigdemont would also have to withdraw an ambiguous declaration of independence he made earlier this month.

The government had moved to cancel Catalonia’s autonomous status because it believed there had been a “serious failure” by Puigdemont to meet his obligations, Justice Minister Rafael Catala said in a radio interview.

“Everything is not fixed just by calling an election.”

Catala said that if Puigdemont appeared before the Spanish Senate, it would help to resolve the crisis.

A top official in the Senate said that if Puigdemont decided to appear before the house, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would likely come to the chamber as well so that a proper debate could be organised between the two.

The Senate said on Tuesday it had invited Puigdemont to appear before the chamber on Thursday at 5 p.m (1500 GMT) or Friday at 10 a.m (0800 GMT).

The Madrid government has so far refused to meet the Catalan leader until he drops his call for independence and Catala said any appearance by Puigdemont had to be within a legal and constitutional framework.

“If his appearance is within the constitution and the law we’ll be delighted ... But if it’s just to ratify his position on Catalonia’s independence, sadly we will not be able to do anything else than continuing with the measures already set by the government,” Catala said.

The political uncertainty has taken its toll on Spain’s wealthiest region, with hundreds of companies moving their headquarters out of Catalonia.

Volkswagen’s Spanish unit SEAT, one of the biggest employers in the region, said it would move its registered office if it felt there was no longer legal security in Catalonia, although it had so far not made a decision.

“Relocating the registered office would respond to the need to seek legal protection, and would make sense the moment we felt it was no longer afforded in the territory where we are located,” SEAT Executive Committee Chairman Luca de Meo said in a letter to the company’s more than 14,000 employees in the region.",Catalan secessionists mull snap election as Madrid hangs tough,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CT1PE

The maker of Post-It Notes (MMM.N) jumped 6.12 percent and Caterpillar (CAT.N) 6.07 percent after the two companies reported stellar quarterly results and gave upbeat forecasts.

The two stocks contributed nearly 140 points to the Dow’s 170 point rise.

United Technologies (UTX.N) and McDonald’s (MCD.N) also notched up gains after reporting results.

“At these levels, only companies that have both top-line and bottom-line beats could make the market move higher,” said Rick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey.

The S&P industrial sector .SPLRCI rose 0.75 percent, topping the 11 major S&P indexes. The sector has gained about 15 percent this year, in line with the broader S&P 500 index, but has underperformed sectors such as technology and healthcare.

“It offers some hope to investors that this rally will broaden out, which it needs to do, to sustain at these levels,” Heckler said.

Strong earnings and rising hopes of President Donald Trump’s tax plans moving forward have helped the Dow and S&P close at record highs on all five trading days last week.

At 11:02 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 188.55 points, or 0.81 percent, at 23,462.51, after hitting a record high of 23466.72.

Facebook has its European headquarters in Ireland and has argued that only the Irish data protection authority has the power to police it for its processing of Europeans’ data. Nonetheless other European privacy regulators, including the French, Belgian and German authorities, have taken action against the U.S. company.

Yves Bot, advocate general at the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), said in a non-binding opinion that any national authority could take action against a company for breaching data protection laws in the context of its activities in the country, even if the company is established in another member state.

The case stems from a dispute about a German fan page on Facebook which collected data on visitors to that page by storing a cookie on their hard drive.

A German court asked the ECJ whether a German data protection authority had jurisdiction over Facebook given its Irish subsidiary Facebook Ireland was responsible for its data processing activities in Europe.

Bot said that since the data processing at issue via the installation of cookies “is specifically intended to enable Facebook better to target the advertisements which it publishes,” it could be considered as being part of the activities undertaken by Facebook Germany, which is responsible for the promotion and sale of advertising space in Germany.

A spokeswoman for Facebook said: “We respectfully disagree with the Advocate General and await the European Court’s decision.”

Opinions from Advocate Generals tend to be followed by the Court’s judges in a majority of cases. A final ruling should follow in the coming months.

A new EU data protection law will come into force in May next year which seeks to make life easier for multinational businesses like Facebook by introducing a “one stop shop” principle whereby they would only have to deal with the authority in the member state of their main establishment.

But Bot pointed out that the new law was not yet in effect and the current framework enables each member state to apply its own national legislation, thereby making the “application of multiple national legislations possible”.",Facebook dealt setback by EU court adviser in privacy dispute,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-court-facebook/facebook-dealt-setback-by-eu-court-adviser-in-privacy-dispute-idUKKBN1CT2BF?il=0

Mehrheitsbeschlüsse dürften “nicht als verräterisch oder sonstwie denunziert” werden, sagte der CDU-Politiker am Dienstag in der ersten Sitzung des neuen Bundestages in Berlin. Zuvor war er mit 501 Ja- und 173- Nein-Stimmen bei 30 Enthaltungen an die Spitze des Parlaments gewählt worden. “So etwas wie Volkswille entsteht überhaupt erst in und mit unseren parlamentarischen Entscheidungen.” Die möglichen Koalitionspartner Union, FDP und Grüne spielten an anderer Stelle erstmals ihre gemeinsame Mehrheit aus.

“Demokratischer Streit ist notwendig. Aber es ist Streit nach Regeln”, mahnte Schäuble. In den vergangenen Monaten habe es in der politischen Debatte Töne der Verächtlichmachung und Erniedrigung gegeben: “Ich finde, das hat keinen Platz in einem zivilisierten Miteinander.” Es sei Aufgabe des Bundestages, Entscheidungen herbeizuführen, die als legitim empfunden würden. Die Abgeordneten seien nicht abgehoben. “Wir sind aus der Mitte der Bürgerinnen und Bürger gewählt.” Niemand vertrete allein das Volk. Die gestiegene Wahlbeteiligung stehe für gestiegene Erwartungen. “Und wenn wir diese Erwartungen einigermaßen erfüllen, können wir unserem Land einen großen Dienst erweisen.”

Der 75-jährige Schäuble beschrieb sich als einen “Parlamentarier aus Leidenschaft”. Er unterstrich: “Im Parlament schlägt das Herz unserer Demokratie.” Dabei erinnerte er daran, dass er in den 45 Jahren seiner Parlamentszugehörigkeit sowohl Oppositions- als auch Regierungszeiten erlebt habe.

Wenige Stunden vor den ersten inhaltlichen Sondierungsgesprächen für eine Jamaika-Koalition spielten Union, FDP und Grüne erstmals ihre Mehrheit im Bundestag aus. Gemeinsam überwiesen sie einen SPD-Antrag zur Stärkung der Debattenkultur an den Ältestenrat. Vor der Wahl des Bundestagspräsidenten gab es lebhafte 30 Minuten in einer kurzen Debatte über beantragte Änderungen der Geschäftsordnung des Bundestages. Alterspräsident Hermann Otto Solms warnte vor Ausgrenzung und Stigmatisierung. Zugleich plädierte der FDP-Politiker dafür, eine Reform des Wahlrechts anzugehen. Er sprach angesichts von 709 Abgeordneten von einem “aufgeblähten Parlament”. Arbeitsfähigkeit und Ansehen des Bundestags litten unter dieser Größe.

Der Parlamentarische Geschäftsführer der SPD, Carsten Schneider, machte Bundeskanzlerin und CDU-Chefin Angela Merkel mitverantwortlich für den Einzug der AfD: “Ihr Politikstil, Frau Merkel, ist ein Grund dafür, dass wir heute eine rechtspopulistische Partei hier im Bundestag haben.” Sie habe sich im Wahlkampf jeder Debatte über bessere Politikkonzepte verweigert und mit ihrer “Vernebelungsstrategie” die politischen Ränder gestärkt. Unions-Fraktionsgeschäftsführer Michael Grosse-Brömer wies den Vorwurf zurück: Er verstehe, dass die SPD mit ihrem 20-Prozent-Ergebnis nach einem Schuldigen suche. Dafür solle die SPD aber nicht auf das Kanzleramt blicken, sondern auf ihre Parteizentrale im Willy-Brandt-Haus.

Für die AfD warf deren Parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer Bernd Baumann den anderen Parteien vor, seiner Fraktion die Ehre der Sitzungseröffnung durch Tricks versagt zu haben. Ihm entgegnete der Parlamentarische Geschäftsführer der FDP, Marco Buschmann: “Die AfD geriert sich als Opfer einer finsteren Verschwörung.” Der Linken-Politiker Jan Korte ermahnte alle Abgeordneten, sich daran zu erinnern, dass sie ihr Mandat freien Wahlen zu verdanken hätten.

As City Center mall’s largest tenant, Target Corp had a say over changes to the property. According to people familiar with the lease discussions, Target balked at sharing the mall with Whole Foods because it feared competition from the grocery chain’s new owner, Amazon.com Inc.

Early attempts to persuade Target failed, and Whole Foods may now have to concede certain Amazon initiatives - such as lockers where customers can pick up goods ordered online - if it wants the location, the people said. Talks are ongoing.

A Reuters examination of real estate agreements and interviews with 20 retail landlords, lawyers and brokers show that the strings attached to operating in malls like City Center present an emerging and little-scrutinized challenge to Amazon’s quest to re-shape Whole Foods.

Across the United States, large retailers including Target, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc and Best Buy Co Inc have legal rights in many lease agreements that allow them to limit what Amazon can do with nearby Whole Foods stores, and where it can open new ones.

Documents reviewed by Reuters show bans on Amazon lockers and delivery operations near a Target store in Illinois and also in Florida, where a new Whole Foods is set to open. Lockers for retrieving online orders are a way for Amazon to spur sales through the grocery chain.

In Manhattan and other locations, the leases of Whole Foods’ big box neighbors bar it from selling a range of goods that Amazon has in its massive online inventory, from electronics to toys and linens.

Even Whole Foods stores that do not share space with major rivals can face constraints imposed by local governments. A city council resolution in White Plains, New York, restricted the hours when Whole Foods can use a loading dock prior to the grocer locating in the mall.

Amazon declined to answer questions about how these restrictions across the country impact its plans.

In a statement, Target said it is “focused on what’s best for the company and delivering on the reasons our guests love Target. Our more than 1,800 stores across the country are a strategic asset and a vital part of Target’s future.”

The company did not discuss details of the restrictions reported by Reuters, but said, “It’s inaccurate to characterize lease agreements as our corporate strategy.”

Reuters could not determine the full extent of limits on Whole Foods stores because lease deals vary from mall to mall, and many are not public. While restricting how neighbors operate is a standard practice in retail, Amazon is new to feeling the heat.

Some mall owners and real estate brokers say Whole Foods will still find landlords who are eager to have the high-profile tenant driving traffic in their malls, and see rivals trying to keep Whole Foods out as short-sighted.

But with nearly all of Whole Foods’ 473 stores subject to lease agreements and plans to add up to 85 stores, according to regulatory filings, Amazon has launched into brick-and-mortar with more constraints and entrenched enemies than in the online world it dominates.

“Many people assume this big, 800-pound gorilla is going to come and beat up all of these retailers,” said Terrison Quinn, a senior vice president at brokerage SRS Real Estate Partners. “I just don’t think that’s going to be the case.”

DOZENS OF RESTRICTIONS

Amazon wasted no time in making changes when the $13.7 billion Whole Foods deal closed in August. The world’s largest online retailer cut grocery prices, started selling its Echo home speaker in stores and disclosed plans to add lockers to some locations and Whole Foods items to Prime Now, its two-hour delivery program.

Analysts expect such moves will boost online orders and revenue for Amazon. But big box rivals have a number of ways to fight back.

Retailers routinely negotiate guarantees that their landlords will not alter malls in a way that hurts sales, whether leasing to a strip club or starting construction projects without approval, real estate lawyers said.

These leases, which often last 10 to 20 years with options to renew, may even name competitors barred from opening a store.

A 16-page memo in July detailing the lease restrictions governing Miami’s Pinecrest Place mall, obtained by Reuters, offers a glimpse of the legal protections retailers are securing.

Target required an affiliate of national landlord Regency Centers Corp to bar “Any lockers, lock-boxes or other type of storage system that is used to receive or store merchandise from a catalog or online retailer.”

The document then specifies more than a dozen other restrictions for the mall, from leasing space to a pet shop or toy store to operating “a fulfillment center in connection with receiving, storing or distributing merchandise from a catalog or online retailer.”

Regency announced in April that Whole Foods will open in the center, meaning the store cannot have Amazon lockers or fulfill orders for Prime Now.

A May memo of lease for a Target in Evanston, Illinois, obtained by Reuters, contains similar prohibitions against lockers and online fulfillment.

In another case, Target raised similar concerns about Amazon for a prospective Whole Foods location at the Stonestown Galleria in San Francisco, people familiar with the matter said.

A Reuters analysis showed that 7 percent of existing Whole Foods' U.S. stores are within a quarter mile, or roughly five-minute walk, of a Target.

OPPOSITION ABOUNDS

Target is not alone in placing limits on Amazon.

Lidl, a German grocery chain expanding in the United States, said in a deal this year it would “prohibit the operation of pickup facilities” by rivals such as “Wal-Mart and Amazon... that sell grocery items” near a planned store on Long Island in New York, according to a person familiar with the matter. The language is becoming common, the person said.

Will Harwood, a spokesman for Lidl, said, “We adhere to industry norms and standard real estate practices when securing sites.”

A Bed Bath & Beyond store in lower Manhattan bars its next-door tenant - Whole Foods - from selling linens, bathroom items, housewares and frames, its memo of lease said. The company declined to comment.

And a Best Buy store just north of Miami has the exclusive right in its shopping center to sell electronics. A lease carve-out, which states other tenants can sell gadgets on less than 250 square feet of floor space, allowed for the mall’s Whole Foods to display the Echo speaker, according to a memo seen by Reuters and a reporter who visited the location.

“It is pretty standard for anchor tenants of a shopping center to reserve the right in their leases to prohibit improvements to a center - including the addition of new tenants - without approval and consent,” said Jeff Shelman, spokesman for Best Buy.

Gabe Kadosh, vice president at real estate firm Colliers International, said Amazon and Whole Foods “want to have freedom to do whatever they want. The challenge is in brick and mortar, and in multi-tenant shopping centers, you can’t just do that.”",Amazon rivals turn to legal fine print to stem Whole Foods strategy,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CT0ES-OCABS

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling coalition has retained a two-thirds “super majority,” paving the way for him to become the nation’s longest-serving leader.

The win could give the nearly five-year old reflation programme a second wind. But there have been years of bold reform pledges from Abe, with inconsistent follow through. The risk is he uses this fresh mandate to revise the country’s pacifist constitution first, and take his time with reforms. That could deflate a long-running rally in Japanese stocks that has seen the Nikkei index rise 26.9 percent since Nov. 4, 2016.

The glacial pace of policy moves to loosen markets, cut red tape and catalyze entrepreneurship helps explain why Japanese wages are flat even though the country is enjoying its lowest unemployment rate in 23 years. The economy has grown for six straight quarters, the longest expansion since 2006, yet companies remain reluctant to share more profit with workers, or otherwise put their combined $2.7 trillion of cash reserves to work. Real wages rose just 0.1 percent in August after falling 1.1 percent in July, frustrating progress by the Bank of Japan toward its 2 percent inflation goal.

Theoretically Sunday‘s results clear the way for Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party to get more aggressive on the economic front. Abenomics has three “arrows.” Arrow No. 1, the Bank of Japan, is almost certain to maintain monetary easing, keeping the yen and bond yields under pressure. But monetary policy would have greater effect if the government would deploy the fiscal arrow by cutting the nearly 36 percent corporate tax rate. So would making life easier for startups, loosening onerous labor regulations, and improving the utilization of the female workforce – which together comprise Arrow No. 3.

Unfortunately, Abe has a deserved reputation for loose reform talk. His victory in 2014 inspired optimism that deep structural change was imminent, but instead Abe focused on re-writing the constitution. He still wants to amend Article 9, the constitutional clause preventing Japan from fielding a conventional military, as part of his legacy.

But decisively defeating Japan’s entrenched deflationary tendencies would win Abe a permanent place in the economic history books, and universal applause.

Rock, 46, a supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, fostered rumors he would run, presumably in his native Michigan, throughout the year. In July, he launched a website and promoted it through social media: kidrockforsenate.com.

But in a profanity-laced appearance on the Howard Stern radio show he scoffed at the idea of him as a senator, saying it was obvious he was never serious.

“Let’s roll with it for a little while,” he said on Tuesday, recalling his decision to feed the chatter. “Everyone gets their panties in a bunch.”

Along with the ongoing decimation of Iraq's Sunni population, the referendum means that in practice ""Iraq"" no longer exists. In its place is a Shiite state dominated by Iran, the de facto new nation of Kurdistan, and a shrinking population of Sunnis tottering between annihilation or reservation-like existence, depending on whether the United States uses the last of its influence to sketch out red lines or abandons the people to fate.

The waste comes in that a better version of a de facto tri-state Iraq was available in 2006. Every life lost (out of a million some, including 4,424 Americans), every dollar spent (in the trillions), and every unanticipated outcome suffered (rise of Islamic State, conflict in Syria, de-democratization of Turkey) since then has been unnecessary.

Tania Karas: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes

The post-World War One failure to create a Kurdish state resulted in 30 million Kurds scattered across modern Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq destroyed civil order in much of the area populated by those Kurds, and opened the door to Iranian influence. Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies directed political violence against Iraqi Sunnis, paving the way for a Sunni protector, Islamic State, to move in.

When the American-trained (cost: $25 billion) Iraqi national army dropped its weapons and ran in 2014, and Shiite militias proved too weak to fill the breach, Obama reinserted the American military into Iraq, saving the Kurds, by then also under threat from Islamic State. The United States subsequently turned those Kurdish fighters loose in Iraq and later Syria against Islamic State. It was expediency over strategy; there was no force otherwise available in bulk.

And it kind of worked. In the short run.

The Kurds, with American help, blunted Islamic State’s progress. The problem was that while American diplomacy, the carrot-and-stick of aid, and the difficulty of maintaining long-distance logistics saw the Kurdish forces replaced by Shiite militias in some locations, the Kurds held on to their gains in the north, having in most instances displaced Iraqi Sunnis. Victorious and bloodied, the Kurds were not about to renounce their hard-earned gains.

The need for American arms did force Kurdish leaders to postpone an independence referendum, opposed by Washington, in 2014. Three years later, with Islamic State mortally weakened, Washington no longer holds sway over Kurdish ambitions. And although the Sept. 25 referendum has no legal force, Kurdish leaders will use the vote to push Baghdad for full autonomy. Donald Trump, the fifth consecutive American president to make war on Iraq, may be the last simply for lack of an Iraq to fight over.

The ground truth of autumn 2017 -- a Kurdistan in the north, a Shiite state in the south, a marginalized Sunni population out west -- is pretty much the deal that could have been had in 2006 when then-Senator Joe Biden proposed dividing Iraq into statelets. Biden wanted the United States to leave a ""residual force to combat terrorists and keep the [three] neighbors honest.” The Senate actually passed a resolution supporting Biden's idea.

It probably would have stabilized the region. The Middle East in 2006 was a very different place.

In 2006 Iran faced an American military as yet undamaged by an additional decade of grinding war. That military sat on both Iran's western border with Iraq and its eastern border with Afghanistan. The Iranian nuclear program was years behind where it is today. Syria was a relatively stable place under not-then-yet-enemy of the free world Bashar al-Assad; indeed, the British-educated Assad was initially seen as a minor reformer. Turkey was stable. Russia was not a major player in the Middle East.

With many of 2017's regional Pandoras still in the box, by Middle Eastern standards security in a divided Iraq would have been manageable via a modest American military presence.

Instead, events of the last decade mean the chance of Kurdish independence adding to regional stability is near zero. Iran, fearing that an independent Kurdish state could threaten its own sectarian balance, is already conducting maneuvers on the border, has canceled flights to and from Kurdistan, and will push its proxies in Baghdad to take action. Will Turkey, now politically distant from NATO, move to open war over disputed borderlands with Kurdistan? The Turkish parliament just extended its authorization for cross-border incursions for another year. Will Kurdish minorities in Turkey and Iran see this all as their moment to rise? Will Israel, which backs Kurdish independence in its search for regional allies, supply weapons?

In a best-case scenario, where everyone tacitly acknowledges Kurdistan while maintaining the status quo (as with Taiwan, which officially exists as a part of China even as it acts like an independent nation) there may be a measure of stability in the near term. Baghdad will talk tough even as it allows the Kurds a surprising amount of free reign -- for example, Baghdad has withdrawn its police from contested Kirkuk, leaving Kurdish forces fully in charge of the oil-rich city. Kurdistan already has full control over its own education, security, military, taxes, and diplomatic representation. Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government, has experimented with diplomatically vague language, saying “self-determination wouldn't mean a direct separation from Iraq.”

Darker predictions involve Syrian-Russian forces contesting Kurdish occupiers inside Syria. Iranian-backed Shiite militias have signaled plans to re-enter Kirkuk, and Turkey already has a running war with Kurdish fighters; tank maneuvers are ongoing with new threats gushing out of Ankara.

American policy has been a blurry gray for some time, calling for the referendum to be postponed without actually supporting or opposing independence. Traditionally the State Department favored a united Iraq somehow, while the Pentagon, with its history of in-the-dirt cooperation with Kurdish fighters stretching back to the 1991 no-fly zone and Operation Provide Comfort that essentially established the preliminary borders of Kurdistan, has been more sympathetic towards independence. The wording of America’s reaction (there has been no post-election statement issued as this is written) to the referendum could signal which part of government is making foreign policy in Iraq these days.

What seems clear is the American role going forward will be mostly limited to diplomacy, and that, regardless of who is carrying out the task, is not the country’s strong suit these days. There seems no appetite in Washington for large-scale troop redeployments, the kind of boots-on-the-ground necessary to decisively shape events.

The American military, which once could have played a role similar to its help in bringing peace to former Yugoslavia, instead will exist as a crumple zone among its own warring semi-allies.

Such a scenario exposes what might have been in 2006 when the United States could have managed events, and 2017, when America can do little more than witness them.",Commentary: Why the Kurdish referendum means the end of Iraq,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-kurds-commentary/commentary-why-the-kurdish-referendum-means-the-end-of-iraq-idUSKCN1C125Q

Trump has asked his fellow Republicans who control Congress to pass a package of tax cuts, including a deep reduction in the corporate income tax, by year’s end.

But hours before he was to promote the tax plan at a weekly lunch for Republican senators on Capitol Hill, Trump engaged in a distracting tussle with one of those lawmakers: Bob Corker, a leading fiscal hawk and the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

“Bob Corker, who ... couldn’t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts,” Trump wrote on Twitter, later adding that the senator is “incompetent.”

Alienating any members of his own party could be costly for Trump’s legislative initiatives in the Senate because Republicans control the chamber by just a slim 52-48 margin.

Corker warned Trump in television interviews against interfering in congressional efforts to finalize the legislation to cut taxes and called the president’s visit with Senate Republicans “a photo op.”

“Hopefully, the White House will step aside and let that occur in a normal process,” the Tennessee Republican told NBC’s “Today” program. “That’s the best way for us to have success.”

Corker also described Trump in a Twitter post as “an utterly untruthful president,” and in television interviews accused Trump of debasing the United States.

‘HISTORIC CHANCE’

House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan urged reporters to ignore the Trump-Corker spat and concentrate on the tax plan.

“Put this Twitter dispute aside. The fact is we have an historic chance of fixing this tax code,” Ryan said.

Ryan added that he knows Corker well and predicted that the senator is “going to vote for tax reform.”

Ryan said he wants the House to pass the Republican tax cut bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, echoing Trump’s call to speed up the party’s efforts to get the measure approved before year’s end.

Securing congressional passage of his tax plan is critically important to Trump, who has yet to get major legislation through Congress since taking office in January, including a healthcare overhaul he promised as a candidate last year. Tax cuts were another of Trump’s campaign pledges.

The White House argues that tax cuts are needed to boost economic growth and create jobs, but has shown sensitivity in recent weeks to arguments that it is endangering America’s long-term fiscal health.

One of the key elements of the proposal is to slash the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. While the broad parameters of the tax proposal have been made public, detailed legislation has not yet been unveiled.

Democrats have painted Trump’s plan, with its $6 trillion in tax cuts, as a gift to the rich and corporate America that would balloon the federal deficit.

On the other side of the American culture war, a CBS vice president and legal counsel, Hayley Geftman-Gold, posted a Facebook comment that she was “not even sympathetic” to the victims because “country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” Unlike her right wing opposites, she suffered for her opinion: she was fired from what must have been a lawyer’s dream job.

Should any of these comments ­­­− the work of, at most, a few minutes when not that of a few seconds − be the concern of the state? They easily fall into the category of bad taste. Some remarks, especially Geftman-Gold’s sneeringly callous comment – for which she has since apologized – could cause further misery in those seeking to cope with the trauma of injury or loss of someone close to them.

The general opinion, especially in the United States, is that governments should stay out of it. For Washington, the anger such remarks may rouse and the distress they may cause must be endured in deference to the near-absolute right of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

But should we tolerate such verbal brutality? Can it not be “cured?” Do people have to suffer distress because of the voiced prejudices of others who often – as Limbaugh does – make a rich living from their display? There’s a growing faction saying no, and it has reached, at least in Europe, the stage of state action. The European Union Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourova has told the social media giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, that they must eliminate both hate speech and fake news, or face legislation criminalizing them for not doing so. That’s a sweeping statement: unpacking what it might mean in practice takes us deep into an area which should be marked with signs saying: “Danger! Free speech in Peril!”

Fake news is not the same as hate speech, but it can also be used to inflame social tensions. In Italy, the anti-trust chief Giovanni Petruzella has said that EU countries should create government-appointed bodies to remove fake news and even fine the media for violations. But how is fake news to be distinguished, by either artificial or human intelligence, from true news? It’s a delicate operation, since much news striving to be “true” contains false information, and much fake news has the ring of truth and would take careful investigation to disprove.

In Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech. Called, challengingly, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, NetzDG for short, it commands that Facebook and Twitter take down “blatantly illegal” hate speech within 24 hours or, if the offending material is less obviously illegal, in a week – on pain of a fine of up to 50 million euro ($58.6 million). The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech. It merely points to the passage in the German Criminal Code which declares the ""defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations"" illegal. What is defamation? When is one person’s unbearable insult another’s opinion?

Sticks and stones may break my bones/But words will never hurt me” has been a comfort of sorts to those who have been the victims of taunting and insult, but modern psychiatry claims it isn’t so. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, in a careful parsing of what constitutes harmful speech, argues that “there is a difference between permitting a culture of casual brutality and entertaining an opinion you strongly oppose. The former is a danger to a civil society (and to our health); the latter is the lifeblood of democracy.” Speech of the first kind, which “bullies and torments,” is “from the perspective of our brain cells… literally a form of violence.”

Put that way, it appears obvious: the speech which harms should be criminalized, as much as a physical assault, and in parts of Europe it is being so. Facebook, Twitter and Google are now under increasing state and public pressure to clean up their sites, to stop posting material that causes more than distress but, apparently, real damage to the brain. Embattled UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out at the United Nations last month, calling on the tech companies to go much further and faster in combating the dangerous messages they carry.

At a background-only session with Google staff in London this past week, where these issues were broached, I was told that the concerns of governments and the public were registered, and reform was on the way.

When I quoted the view of Fiyaz Mughal, head of the anti-extremist British advocacy organization Faith Matters, that the companies with which he had been working are “not dealing with the problem” because their “bottom line is money,” I was met with an assurance that this was not so. The automatic default of the communications behemoths to absolutism in free speech has been replaced, it was said, by a finer-grained examination of cause and effect, and of what could reasonably be done to address concerns.

It’s true that to juggle the demands of free speech and those of security now constitutes one of the largest ethical and practical problems facing democratic states − and the tech corporations. And it’s also true that even if Mughal is right that the companies’ first care is the bottom line – for which corporation is that not true? – the large fines now being prepared for not heeding the call to reform would be a large incentive to change.

Yet in the course of this complex balancing act, between security and liberty, profit and regulation, there is the danger of substantial damage to the freedoms of speech and the news media which democracies have been able to safeguard for most of the post-World War Two period.

Facebook has its European headquarters in Ireland and has argued that only the Irish data protection authority has the power to police it for its processing of Europeans’ data. Nonetheless other European privacy regulators, including the French, Belgian and German authorities, have taken action against the U.S. company.

Yves Bot, advocate general at the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), said in a non-binding opinion that any national authority could take action against a company for breaching data protection laws in the context of its activities in the country, even if the company is established in another member state.

The case stems from a dispute about a German fan page on Facebook which collected data on visitors to that page by storing a cookie on their hard drive.

A German court asked the ECJ whether a German data protection authority had jurisdiction over Facebook given its Irish subsidiary Facebook Ireland was responsible for its data processing activities in Europe.

Bot said that since the data processing at issue via the installation of cookies “is specifically intended to enable Facebook better to target the advertisements which it publishes,” it could be considered as being part of the activities undertaken by Facebook Germany, which is responsible for the promotion and sale of advertising space in Germany.

A spokeswoman for Facebook said: “We respectfully disagree with the Advocate General and await the European Court’s decision.”

Opinions from Advocate Generals tend to be followed by the Court’s judges in a majority of cases. A final ruling should follow in the coming months.

A new EU data protection law will come into force in May next year which seeks to make life easier for multinational businesses like Facebook by introducing a “one stop shop” principle whereby they would only have to deal with the authority in the member state of their main establishment.

But Bot pointed out that the new law was not yet in effect and the current framework enables each member state to apply its own national legislation, thereby making the “application of multiple national legislations possible”.",Facebook dealt setback by EU court adviser in privacy dispute,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-court-facebook/facebook-dealt-setback-by-eu-court-adviser-in-privacy-dispute-idUSKBN1CT2BF

Baghili now weighs 36kg (80 lb), according to her father, more than triple the 11kg she weighed last October when Reuters first met her at the al-Thawra hospital in Sana‘a, where she was undergoing treatment for severe malnutrition.

There the 19-year-old was unable to talk, let alone carry her ghostly, skeletal frame, which is now stronger after weeks of specialist care and time at home.

“Saida’s body got better because she’s eating better, but she’s still having trouble swallowing,” her father Ahmed Baghili said at their home in Hodeidah this month.

“She can only eat milk, biscuits and juice.”

Baghili’s plight reflects that of many families in the Arabian Peninsula’s poorest country, where a two-and-a-half-year war between a Saudi-led Arab coalition and the Iran-allied Houthi movement has claimed 10,000 lives.

A quarter of the 28 million population are starving, according to the United Nations, with half a million children under the age of 5 severely malnourished and at least 2,135 people killed by cholera.

Ahmed Baghili is only able to supply the basics for his family of 10, who live in a parched village on the Red Sea coast.

Saida, whose illness began before the war, is able to help her father tend to a farmer’s cattle in exchange for milk, with their income boosted by Ahmed making deliveries on his motorcycle and donations from humanitarian organizations.

However, he says he doesn’t have enough money to send Saida for further treatment and still fears for her health. Her last appointment with a doctor was in December.

”We’re worried she might relapse and then we wouldn’t be able to do anything because we have nothing. We don’t have the transportation fee, we don’t have the fee for anything,” he said.

A data glitch forced Italy’s biggest bank by assets to publish third-quarter results two weeks ahead of schedule. Fortunately, the figures show lower costs and stronger capital. And a fee-boosting partnership with French asset manager Amundi helped offset the drag from low interest rates.

The headquarters of UniCredit bank is seen in Milan, Italy, in this February 8, 2016 file photo

For UniCredit board members who were summoned to approve the results at the crack of dawn on Tuesday, the inadvertent leak of numbers overnight was a nuisance. For investors, the preliminary figures provided early reassurance that CEO Jean Pierre Mustier’s aggressive restructuring plan is paying dividends.

The Milanese bank’s core Tier 1 capital rose to 13.5 percent of risk-weighted assets at the end of September, higher than in the previous quarter and helped by the sale of asset manager Pioneer. This gives UniCredit a buffer to absorb the changes, such as the introduction of new accounting rules which force banks to provision for bad loans in a new way. That should allow it to hit Mustier’s 12.5 percent target ratio at the end of 2019.

There are other comforting signs. Quarterly income from fees was up 4 percent, demonstrating the benefits of the long-term distribution agreement with Amundi, which bought Pioneer in December. The deal allows UniCredit to rejuvenate its offering of investment products while reaping the capital gain from the sale.

Beefing up fee-generating products is a good antidote to Europe’s anaemic interest rate environment. Despite talk of an end to the easy-money phase that has squeezed banks’ traditional sources of income, there is no sign that this will happen soon – or that interest rates will rise very far when it does.

This means that even disciplined banks such as UniCredit might struggle to earn a return that exceeds their cost of capital. That will make consolidation – for example through a combination with Germany’s Commerzbank – increasingly tempting.",Breakingviews - UniCredit gets head start on recovery path,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-unicredit-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-unicredit-gets-head-start-on-recovery-path-idUSKBN1CT1MF

The world’s largest restaurant chain by revenue has been working to boost flagging traffic at its U.S. restaurants, where it gets most of its profit, after customers defected to fast-food rivals and pricier fast-casual options like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N).

In the past year, McDonald’s has introduced cook-to-order, fresh beef Quarter Pounders, new items with a variety of buns and sauces like the Signature Sriracha sandwich, as well as mobile ordering and delivery.

“We served more customers, more often,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said on a conference call to discuss third-quarter earnings. “The U.S. business regained its stride.”

Global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 6 percent for the quarter, beating the 4.5 percent gain expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.

Those sales rose a better-than-expected 4.1 percent in the United States, where traffic improved for the second quarter after more than four straight years of declines. China, the UK and Canada also turned in strong performances.

“Given that the fast food and casual dining segments as a whole struggled over the third quarter, this is an encouraging set of results which suggests McDonald’s is gaining both market and customer share,” GlobalData Retail’s Managing Director Neil Saunders said.

McDonadl’s shares were last up 1.5 percent in midday trading and not far from a record high hit on Friday.

Aggressive promotions in the United States included soft drinks of all sizes for $1, McCafe smoothies and espresso drinks for $2 and the McPick 2 offer of two menu items for $5.

The changes, part of a turnaround plan under Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook, came after Chipotle, Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and others raised the bar on what consumers can expect from fast food.

McDonald’s shares have climbed 65 percent since Easterbrook was named CEO in March 2015, outperforming a 22 percent rise in the S&P 500 and Chipotle’s 52 percent drop.

Fast-casual chains have fallen far short of expectations after a wave of initial public offerings in recent years. Shares in Zoe’s Kitchen Inc (ZOES.N) and Noodles & Co (NDLS.O) are trading below their IPO prices, while Shake Shack Inc (SHAK.N) is far short of its all-time high of nearly $93 in May 2015.

Lower priced fast-food chains seem to be benefiting from last year’s sharp slowdown in customer traffic to fast-casual chains including Chipotle, which is still trying to recover from a string of food safety incidents in 2015, Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said in a recent report.

“I think it’s safe to say that the reports of fast food’s death were greatly exaggerated,” said Senatore, who added that McDonald’s and its fast-food peers have posted the best fundamental results and stock returns of the broader industry since late 2015.

Excluding items, McDonald’s earned a profit of $1.76 per share, just missing an average analyst estimate of $1.77 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

During the quarter, McDonald’s had higher taxes and expenses, but also had gains from selling its China and Hong Kong businesses.

Total revenue fell 10 percent to $5.75 billion, due to restaurant sales to franchisees and strategic partners.

Britain is seeking a so-called implementation period of around two years following its departure from the EU in March 2019, during which its access to the EU single market would stay largely unchanged while new arrangements are put in place.

Businesses are keen to see the details of such a deal as soon as possible to end uncertainty over the trading rules they will face after Britain leaves the bloc.

“In terms of the broad outline of an implementation period, we believe that we can agree that quickly,” May’s spokesman said. He did not provide further detail on when Britain hoped to reach such an agreement.

“We’re clear that we want to achieve this implementation period, that we believe we can do so, and that our priority is to provide certainty for business,” he said.

May left some businesses confused on Monday by saying any implementation period would not be agreed until a deal was struck on Britain’s future trading relationship with the bloc.

That countered expectations that a transitional deal would come well before any deal on trade.

It also highlighted a clear difference between Britain and the EU over when a trade deal would be agreed.

Britain is seeking an “ambitious” deal on trade with the EU to replace its existing arrangement at the end of an implementation period. It believes its current close ties with the bloc mean such a deal will be agreed by October 2018.

But the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said it would take three years to negotiate a trade deal, meaning that if talks start in December it would be ready in time for the end of a transition period running until December 2020.

In response, asked if it was Britain’s position that it could still achieve a trade deal by the end of next year under the two-year exit process, May’s spokesman said: “Yes”.

Commenting on the timeline set out by Britain, an EU official said the bloc wanted to “define a framework for our future relationship” by this time next year so that a withdrawal treaty could “take account” of that future under the terms of the ‘Article 50’ legal exit process.

However, the official said the EU will only negotiate on the details of a free trade deal after Britain has actually left in March 2019 because the EU’s own laws do not allow it to negotiate trade agreements with its own members.

“Article 50 says that the withdrawal agreement has to take into account our future relationship, so we will know the terms of our partnership with the EU by our exit,” a spokeswoman for May said when asked about the position set out by the EU official.

“But as to the details, that’s subject to negotiation and I can’t pre-empt those.”","UK sees swift deal on Brexit transition outline, still at odds with EU on trade",https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-transition/uk-sees-swift-deal-on-brexit-transition-outline-still-at-odds-with-eu-on-trade-idINKBN1CT1RR?il=0

The furore around the letter, which the government distanced itself from, highlighted tensions in Britain’s higher education sector where many have concerns over the country’s decision to leave the European Union.

Conservative MP Chris Heaton-Harris, who has a role in organising how the ruling Conservatives vote in parliament, sent the letter to university chiefs, requesting “the names of professors at your establishment who are involved in the teaching of European affairs, with particular reference to Brexit.”

“If I could be provided with a copy of the syllabus and links to the online lectures which relate to this area, I would be much obliged,” he added.

David Green, vice chancellor at the University of Worcester, said the letter sent a chill down his spine.

“I realised that his letter just asking for information appears so innocent but is really so, so dangerous,” he said in a statement.

Green said he thought he had been targeted after he spoke about wanting a better deal for English students.

Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK which represents university principals, said: “This request suggests an alarming attempt to censor or challenge academic freedom.”

A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said Heaton-Harris sent the letter in his capacity as a Member of Parliament, not on behalf of the government.

“What the Prime Minister has always been very clear on is her respect for the freedom and independence of universities and the role the play in creating open and stimulating debate,” he said.

Heaton-Harris later tweeted: “To be absolutely clear, I believe in free speech in our universities and in having an open and vigorous debate on Brexit.”

Around 90 percent of academics believe that Brexit will have an adverse impact on the higher education sector, according to a survey by trade union the University and College Union (UCU) in January.

The Russell Group of top British universities including Oxford and Cambridge said the content of courses was a matter for individual institutions and that every perspective on Brexit would be taught.

The research center will be located adjacent to the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and draw on the expertise of two of its experts, Prof. Bernhard Schoelkopf and Prof. Michael J. Black.

Schoelkopf is co-inventor of technology that enables computers to understand causality.

“It’s at the heart of every decision taken by machine learning,” said Ralf Herbrich, Amazon’s director of machine learning.

Black is a specialist in computer vision and founder of Body Labs, a company acquired by Amazon that has developed AI to analyze three-dimensional human body motion and shape.

With an understanding of causality, artificial intelligence systems can predict customer behavior in response to automated decisions, Herbrich told Reuters, noting this can be used to order online search results to improve the user experience.

In the western city of Kisumu, around 2,000 demonstrators marched on the election board offices, witnesses said, responding to Raila Odinga’s appeal for protests against Thursday’s repeat presidential ballot. They dispersed peacefully.

Odinga is boycotting the contest against incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta. He says it will not be free and fair because the election board has not made sufficient progress in carrying out reforms he demanded after the original election held in August was annulled.

Odinga had urged his supporters to ensure Thursday’s vote did not take place, repeatedly saying there would be “no elections”.

But on Tuesday he told the BBC he was not calling for protests on polling day itself. “We have not told people to protest on polling day. We have not said that at all. We have told people to stay away,” he said in a radio interview.

When called for clarification, Odinga’s spokesman said he was saying “peaceful protests” would still take place and that the opposition would fully explain their plans on Wednesday.

The country’s Supreme Court is still hearing several cases challenging the legality of Thursday’s poll or Odinga’s withdrawal.

At least 49 people have died in political violence since the August ballot, evoking unwelcome memories of the aftermath of a disputed 2007 poll, when more than 1,200 people were killed.

The political stand-off has also blunted growth in East Africa’s richest economy, a nation valued for its stability and relative freedom in a region roiled by conflict.

Last week Odinga supporters disrupted at least three official pre-polling events. Police said some election board staff were seriously injured.

POLL DELAY?

The head of the election board said last week it was not clear a free and fair poll could take place due to intimidation and political interference.

His comments followed the resignation of an election commissioner, who fled the country and released a statement saying she had been threatened, although she did not say who had done so.

A day before the Aug. 8 poll, another member of the election board had been found tortured and murdered.

On Monday, the International Crisis Group, a global thinktank, called for a delay in the election, saying “proceeding under current conditions would deepen Kenya’s ethnic cleavages and prolong a stalemate that has already claimed dozens of lives and come at a high economic cost.”

Both the election board and the government have said the vote will go ahead, irrespective of whether Odinga contests it, and only a court ruling could legally delay the re-run ballot beyond the end of October.

On Tuesday, police fired tear gas and bullets into the air to disperse protesters in the capital Nairobi.

In Kisumu, an Odinga stronghold, demonstrators said that the polls should not take place, but were unclear on how they should be stopped.

“All we know is that there will be no elections. As to how this will be done, we are waiting for the big announcement by Baba (Odinga) tomorrow,” said one demonstrator, market trader James Ouma.

Around him protesters waved branches and blew whistles as they marched.

Kenyatta officially won the first election, on Aug. 8, by 1.4 million votes, but the Supreme Court annulled that vote on Sept. 1 over procedural irregularities.

After the Supreme Court ruling, Odinga’s team presented a list of demands to the election board.

Some have been met - opposition monitors will now have access to the board’s computers as results come in, a key official has gone on an extended holiday, and results will not be transmitted without a copy of a paper form from tallying centres.

The board said it was impossible to meet other demands - such as changing the technology provider - in the short time frame allotted for new elections.

The company also raised its full-year forecasts for sales and earnings, expecting revenue in its construction business to surge about 20 percent and mining business to jump 30 percent.

The construction industry in North America is turning around after years of slow demand, fueled by a steady housing recovery, an improving labor market and higher spending by oil and gas companies.

Sales in North America, Caterpillar’s biggest market, jumped 27 percent in the third quarter ended Sept 30. Construction revenue from the region rose 31 percent to $2.17 billion and revenue from resources, including mining, rose 28 percent to $581 million.

Some analysts, however, questioned if the company could sustain such high growth rates.

“Sustainability of the scorching pace of growth Caterpillar set in the latest quarter is in question because construction spending in the country has not yet hit an inflection point,” said Jefferies analyst Steve Volkmann.

In the Asia Pacific region, Caterpillar’s third-biggest, sales jumped 57 percent to $1.29 billion, boosted by demand from China.

While China has been the bright spot for Caterpillar in the past few quarters, the pace of growth in the country’s property sector cooled in the third quarter, potentially hurting demand for the company’s iconic yellow earth-moving equipment in the near future.

Caterpillar's shares rose to an all-time high of $140.44, but pared some gains to trade up 5 percent at $138.37. The stock has risen 42 pct this year, compared with an 18 percent increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI.

Excluding restructuring costs, Caterpillar earned $1.95 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.27 per shares, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The earnings beat was even more remarkable as analysts had raised their third-quarter estimates by nearly 30 percent in the past three months.

Net profit rose nearly four-fold to $1.06 billion.

Total revenue rose to $11.41 billion, ahead of market estimates of $10.65 billion.

Wie Reuters am Dienstag von einem Unternehmensinsider erfuhr, will sich der Aufsichtsrat des Börsenbetreibers am Donnerstag auf einer außerordentlichen Sitzung mit der Zukunft von Kengeter befassen. Der Manager steht seit Monaten wegen des Vorwurfs unter Druck, er habe Aktien seines Unternehmens erworben, um von Kursgewinnen zu profitieren - als er bereits plante, die Londoner Börse LSE zu übernehmen. Dieses Vorhaben war später gescheitert.

Am Montag war ein 500.000 Euro schwerer Deal Kengeters mit der Staatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt am Widerstand des zuständigen Amtsgerichts gescheitert. Aufsichtsratschef Joachim Faber habe deshalb extra eine China-Reise abgebrochen und sei vorzeitig nach Deutschland zurückgekehrt, sagte der Insider. “Faber ist zurück und am Donnerstag wird man darüber sprechen, wie es jetzt weitergeht”, sagte die Person, die nicht namentlich genannt werden wollte. Ob Kengeter in der Aufsichtsratssitzung gehört werde, sei unklar.

Ein Unternehmenssprecher sagte Reuters, Faber wolle den Aufsichtsrat über die Ablehnung des Deals durch das Gericht und dessen Begründung informieren. Über das Treffen des Gremiums hatte zuerst die “Wirtschaftswoche” berichtet. Aufsichtsratschef Faber hat sich in der Angelegenheit bislang hinter Kengeter gestellt, allerdings stieg nach Angaben von Insidern deshalb zuletzt auch der Druck auf ihn. Er hatte das umstrittene Aktienoptionsprogramm für Kengeter auf den Weg gebracht.

Die Hängepartie verunsichert die Anleger: Mit einem Minus von mehr als zwei Prozent war die Börse-Aktie am Dienstagnachmittag mit Abstand größter Verlierer im Dax.

GEPLATZTE TRÄUME

Die Deutsche Börse hatte am Montagabend mitgeteilt, das der Deal Kengeters mit der Justiz nicht zustande komme und dem Gericht angesichts der hohen Bedeutung und des öffentlichen Interesses eine Fortführung der Ermittlungen opportun erscheine. Mit dem Gerichtsbeschluss war der Druck auf Kengeter nochmals gestiegen, denn je länger die Ermittlungen der Justiz dauern, desto unwahrscheinlicher wird eine Verlängerung seines Ende März 2018 auslaufenden Vertrages. “Daran ist gegenwärtig überhaupt nicht zu denken”, sagte der Insider.

Doch selbst wenn der Deal geklappt hätte, wäre Kengeter noch nicht vom Haken gewesen. Denn die Finanzaufsicht BaFin und die hessische Börsenaufsicht in Wiesbaden wollen anschließend ihrerseits die Zuverlässigkeit Kengeters in zwei getrennten Verfahren prüfen. Insidern zufolge gibt es in beiden Behörden wegen der Affäre Zweifel an Kengeters Eignung für den Job.

ALLES WIEDER OFFEN

Wie eine Sprecherin der Staatsanwaltschaft Reuters sagte, könnten die weitergehenden Ermittlungen zu einer Einstellung des Verfahrens mangels hinreichenden Tatverdachts führen, aber genauso gut in einer Anklageerhebung münden. Dies sei derzeit völlig offen. In jedem Fall könnten sie mehrere Monate dauern. Sollte am Ende tatsächlich Anklage erhoben werden, würde sich das Verfahren weiter in die Länge ziehen.

Die Sprecherin erklärte zudem, es sei möglich, dass die Ermittlungen bis über das Ende von Kengeters laufendem Vertrag bei der Börse hinaus andauerten - also länger als bis Ende März kommenden Jahres. Kengeter, der seine Unschuld beteuert, hat sich bislang Hoffnungen auf eine Vertragsverlängerung gemacht. Ein Sprecher der Börse sagte, noch sei völlig unklar, welchen Umfang die neuen Ermittlungen annehmen würden und wie hoch dadurch die zeitliche Belastung Kengeters ausfallen werde.

DIE UHR TICKT

Kengeter wird vorgeworfen, dass er im Dezember 2015 für 4,5 Millionen Euro Aktien des Börsenbetreibers gekauft hat - zwei Monate, bevor die Fusionspläne mit der LSE öffentlich wurden. Diese hatten den Aktienkurs massiv nach oben getrieben. Nach Einschätzung der Staatsanwaltschaft gab es zum Zeitpunkt des Aktienkaufs aber schon Gespräche mit der LSE. Der Ex-Investmentbanker Kengeter hatte die Aktien im Rahmen eines Vergütungsprogramms erworben, mit dem ihn der Aufsichtsrat an das Unternehmen binden wollte. Zuletzt war laut Insidern die Unterstützung im Aufsichtrat für Kengeter geschwunden. Als ein möglicher Ersatz für Kengeter wird schon länger der bisherige Finanzvorstand Gregor Pottmeyer gehandelt.

Wie mehrere Unternehmens- und Justiz-Insider Reuters sagten, hat sich das Amtsgericht mit seiner Entscheidung, dem Deal nicht zuzustimmen, die Argumentation der Finanzaufsicht BaFin zu eigen gemacht. Die Behörde hatte Insidern zufolge in einem Gutachten für das Gericht die Höhe der Vergleichszahlung - 500.000 Euro - als zu niedrig bewertet und zugleich das öffentliche Interesse an einer Strafverfolgung betont.

The S&P 500 industrials index .SPLRCI rose 0.7 percent, leading all major groups. Other sectors that are particularly dependent on economic growth, such as financials .SPSY and materials .SPLRCM, also gained.

Results showed a rebound for industrial companies whose shares have been under pressure the past couple of years as many of their key markets, such as energy, mining and agriculture, have struggled, said Edward Jones industrials analyst Matt Arnold.

“What we are seeing in 2017 is a significant snap back in demand. It is driving higher sales at a time when these companies have done a lot to lean themselves out and tighten their belts,” Arnold said.

”What all this means is these companies are translating the sales snap-back into significant earnings growth and it is driving the stocks,” he said.

Shares of diversified manufacturer 3M and heavy machinery maker Caterpillar led the sector’s gains, with both rising more than 5 percent after their results both easily topped Wall Street’s estimates for sales and earnings.

GM reported a net loss due to charges related to the sale of its European operations, but the automaker’s operating results beat Wall Street expectations and the company reaffirmed a forecast that 2017 financial results would be in line with last year’s record performance.

The automaker also assured investors it was on track to cut stocks of unsold vehicles in the U.S. to a manageable 70-days’ supply by the end of the year.

GM, rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI), and heavy machinery maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) all are benefiting from a strong U.S. economy, continued growth in China and a recovery in demand from Latin America.

In the case of the automakers, U.S. car and light truck sales have so far defied predictions of a significant slump. September sales hit the fastest pace in 12 years as residents of Texas and Florida rushed to replace cars damaged by storms.

The latest results sent GM shares up 2.3 percent to the highest levels since its initial public offering in 2010, amid a broad rally by U.S. manufacturing stocks.

GM over the past several months has regained its status as the largest U.S. automaker by market capitalization over electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).

Some of GM’s share price surge has come from investors betting on its investments in self-driving and electric cars. The company’s profits, however, are driven entirely by demand for its petrol-fueled trucks and SUVs in North America, and its growing sales in China.

The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it expects U.S. vehicle sales to remain stable at an annual pace of about 17 million light vehicles in 2017, “and we expect that in 2018 as well,” GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens told reporters on Tuesday.

The U.S. auto industry has been coming off a strong run of sales that culminated in a record 17.55 million units in 2016. Industry analysts have predicted a slight decline for U.S. new car sales in 2017, driven in part by a flood of nearly-new, low-mileage off-lease vehicles into the market.

GM’s share price has risen nearly 30 percent this year, in part as the company has highlighted efforts to put self-driving cars on the road. However, spending on autonomous vehicles and ride services amounted to just $150 million in the latest quarter, the company indicated in its financial report.

GM posted lower revenue for the quarter as it shuttered plants in North America to reduce production and tackle bloated inventory levels, especially of unpopular sedan models as consumers move increasingly to pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

GM had 76 days’ supply of unsold vehicles at the end of September, down from 88 days a month earlier and over 100 in the summer. The company’s wholesale volumes were down 26 percent versus the same quarter in 2016.

GM is taming its inventory problem in the United States in part by laying off about 3,100 temporary and full-time hourly workers, mainly at factories that build compact and midsize sedans. The rapid shift by U.S. consumers to SUVs and pickup trucks in response to low, stable gasoline prices has left GM with too many North American factories tooled to produce low-profit sedans, analysts said.

GM showed a pre-tax profit in North America despite the steep production cuts and heavy discounts. Stevens credited cost-cutting and a shift to higher-profit trucks and sport utility vehicles. The company cut North American production costs by $2 billion during the first nine months of 2017.

GM posted a quarterly net loss on Tuesday due to charges stemming from the sale of its Opel unit in Europe to France’s Peugeot SA (PEUP.PA).

Detroit-based GM posted a third-quarter net loss of $2.98 billion, or $2.03 per share, compared with a profit of $2.77 billion, or $1.71 per share a year earlier. Excluding discontinued operations, GM posted a net profit of 8 cents per share.

But excluding one-time charges, the company earned $1.32 a share, above analyst expectations of $1.14.

Revenue in the quarter fell to $33.6 billion from $38.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $32.72 billion.","GM's earnings beat, forecast lift shares; supply glut shrinks",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-results/gms-earnings-beat-forecast-lift-shares-supply-glut-shrinks-idUSKBN1CT1KG?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Voters in Lombardy and Veneto, which together make up around 30 percent of Italian gross domestic product, asked for more autonomy in referendums at the weekend. Like Catalonia, these territories want to keep more tax revenue. But unlike the fractious Spanish region, they stopped short of demanding independence. Such gentle pressure may yield better results.

Around five million people cast their ballots in northern Italy, home to the once openly separatist Northern League party. More than 95 percent voted to give regional leaders a mandate to keep more money at home when dealing with matters ranging from justice to infrastructure or education. In Veneto 57 percent of voters turned up, while in Lombardy, home to the Milan financial hub, the turnout was below 40 percent.

Like Catalonia, the two Italian regions are major economic engines. They too complain that the money they pay to the central government in tax is out of proportion with what they get back in services. Lombardy’s local government says the gap amounts to 54 billion euros a year. For Veneto the difference is 15.4 billion euros. Meanwhile, the southern region of Sicily gets 10.6 billion euros more than it paid in, Lombardy says.

Since the referendums were legal but non-binding, the Italian government has no formal obligation to make concessions. And money does not flow in just one direction: the state recently paid 5 billion euros to prop up two failed Veneto-based lenders. But allowing export-driven regions that face global competition to keep a greater share of the resources they bring in should not be a taboo subject.

Italy’s central government will find it difficult to push back. Dismissing the wishes of 10 percent of those eligible to vote in general elections next spring would risk damaging the country’s ruling parties. Contrast that with Catalonia, where demands for independence led to a heavy-handed response from the central government, the dismissal of the region’s leadership, and prompted banks and other companies to shift their headquarters. The Spanish region may yet end up negotiating more autonomy. Italy’s regions will hope to achieve similar results with less damage.",Breakingviews - Italy's north teaches Catalonia a self-rule lesson,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italyy-politics-breakingviews/breakingviews-italys-north-teaches-catalonia-a-self-rule-lesson-idUSKBN1CS1JR

(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders brought his strategy of trying to reenergize the Democratic Party by lending his star power to lower-level races to a small city just outside Boston on Monday, with a stop to endorse candidates for alderman and city council.

Sanders, an independent who ran for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2016 presidential election, announced his support for a dozen candidates backed by “Our Revolution” a group formed by supporters of Sanders’ campaign to boost progressive, liberal candidates.

It is unusual for a politician with Sanders’ profile to weigh in on races with no serious Republican contenders, political observers said.

“The local level, more than any other level, is a way to involve people in the political process,” Sanders said in Somerville, Massachusetts, a city of 80,000 people.

Sanders last week pointed to the appearance as one of a series to try to build enthusiasm for lower-level elections. Sanders served four terms as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, before being elected to the Senate.

His remarks on Monday mirrored his 2016 stump speeches, without directly addressing the candidates he was supporting in Somerville and neighboring Cambridge.

Political observers said Sanders, and the candidates he endorsed, will face a challenge in translating the enthusiasm his campaign generated into votes for lower-level races.

In the city’s last municipal election that followed a presidential race, one-in-four registered voters, some 10,241 people, cast ballots. Three out of four who voted in last year’s Hillary Clinton-Donald Trump presidential matchup.

“Sanders envisioned his candidacy as a launching pad for nothing short of a revolution within the Democratic Party,” said Jeffrey Berry, a professor of political science at nearby Tufts University. “The energy is more around ‘How do we fight Trump’ than it is ‘How do we create a Democratic Party in the image of Bernie Sanders.'”

Sanders may not need to tip too many voters to influence the typically low-turnout city races. In the 2013 ward races, just two candidates secured more than 1,000 votes and the four closest races were decided by an average of 166 votes.

“It’s definitely a draw and I think it’s important that he is supporting local candidates,” said Ellora Derenoncourt, a 30-year-old graduate student who was out to show her support for alderman candidate J.T. Scott, a gym owner in his first race.

The event did attract some undecided voters who said Sanders’ endorsement would sway their picks among fields of Democratic candidates.

“Our country has moved so far to their right since the mid-90s that just being a Democrat doesn’t necessarily qualify you as a liberal or progressive,” said Pamela Massey, 59, of Cambridge.

Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator who serves as president of Our Revolution, acknowledged that the group faced a challenge in drumming up enthusiasm for down-ticket races.

“We have to try,” Turner said. “We have to remind people that they have an obligation to participate and so often the level of vitriol that is put out the national level can have a negative effect.”",Bernie Sanders brings local politics focus to Massachusetts races,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-sanders/bernie-sanders-brings-local-politics-focus-to-massachusetts-races-idUSKBN1CS2CF?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

The 41-year-old Englishman was found guilty of breaking rules on betting on matches involving himself and other players following an investigation by the WPBSA.

The ruling body said he bet in his own name, used proxy accounts and an account under his manager’s name, wagering 35,771 pounds ($47,000) between 2003-15.

Bingham’s ban is immediate with three months suspended for a year. The world number 10, who must also pay 20,000 pounds in costs, is free to compete again on Jan. 26.

Under the rules, players are barred from betting on any aspect of sanctioned tournaments. The WPBSA said there was no suggestion Bingham was involved “in any corrupt activity” or failed to perform to the best of his ability in matches.

“It is very disappointing to see such a high profile player fall foul of the WPBSA Betting Rules. Stuart is a great competitor and I have no doubt he has always played to the best of his ability,” WPBSA Chairman Jason Ferguson said.

Como esperado, o partido aprovou por unanimidade uma emenda para incluir o “Pensamento de Xi Jinping Sobre o Socialismo Com Características Chinesas Para Uma Nova Era” como um de seus princípios orientadores.

O partido anunciará seu novo Comitê Permanente, que atualmente tem sete membros e é presidido por Xi, perto do meio-dia local de quarta-feira, culminando assim uma mudança de liderança que ocorre duas vezes por década.

Wang Qishan, aliado-chave de Xi que se destacou no combate à corrupção, não estará no próximo Comitê Permanente do Politburo, o auge do poder chinês, que será revelado na quarta-feira, já que não ficou entre os nomeados nesta terça-feira para integrarem o Comitê Central de 204 membros.

A permanência ou não do poderoso Wang no Comitê Permanente, apesar de ter ultrapassado a idade de aposentadoria costumeira de 69 anos, é uma das principais questões a serem respondidas pelo congresso partidário de uma semana, que terminou nesta terça-feira. Wang ainda pode assumir algum outro cargo de alto escalão nos próximos meses.

Uma surpresa foi a iniciativa “Cinto e Estrada” do presidente, um programa ambicioso de construção de infraestrutura para ligar a China a seus vizinhos e além, também ter sido incluída na Constituição partidária.

Ainda se incluiu um compromisso de reformas industriais voltadas à cadeia de suprimento e uma concessão ao “papel decisivo” das forças de mercado na alocação de recursos, um compromisso que Xi assumiu no início de seus primeiros mandatos e que muitos investidores creem que ele não cumpriu.

The investigation by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) - known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) - was unanimously created by the 15-member U.N. Security Council in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November.

The JIM is due to report by Oct. 26 on who was responsible for an attack on April 4 on the town of Khan Sheikhoun, held by the opposition to Syrian president Bashar Al Assad, that killed dozens of people.

Russia wanted to discuss the report before voting on the extension of the mandate, and its U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia unsuccessfully asked to postpone the vote.

“Don’t try to create the impression that the JIM will be a dead letter unless we adopt this resolution today,” Nebenzia said prior to the vote.

“We are ready to return to extending the JIM after the publication of the report and after we discuss it after the 26 of October.”

A separate OPCW fact-finding mission determined in June that the banned nerve agent sarin had been used in the Khan Sheikhoun attack, which prompted the United States to launch missiles on a Syrian air base.

“Russia has once again demonstrated it will do whatever it takes to ensure the barbaric Assad regime never faces consequences for its continued use of chemicals as weapons,” U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, traveling in Africa, said in a statement.

Das oito áreas que serão ofertadas no leilão marcado para sexta-feira, a Petrobras exerceu direito de preferência para ser a operadora de três: Sapinhoá, Peroba e Alto de Cabo frio - Central.

Nas demais áreas do leilão, a empresa poderá ainda participar, mas sem qualquer prioridade.

“Não necessariamente (faremos lances) apenas (pelas) três, mas as três certamente já estamos com um bom direito assegurado de que dentro das condições econômicas favoráveis, que só serão conhecidas no leilão, nós temos o direito de participar dessas áreas”, disse Parente, a jornalistas.

O executivo ponderou que a empresa, altamente endividada, precisa ser seletiva em suas ofertas, apesar de o leilão trazer oportunidades muito relevantes para a indústria de petróleo.

O leilão vai ofertar áreas com grande potencial petrolífero, sob regime de partilha de produção. Ao todo, as empresas vencedoras terão de pagar mais de 7 bilhões de reais em bônus de assinatura por todas as áreas, mas vence quem oferecer ao governo o maior percentual do óleo produzido.

“Dado o conjunto de boas áreas ofertadas, certamente seria uma boa ideia ou seria possível pensar exclusivamente sob o ponto de vista da qualidade das áreas de uma participação mais ampla, mas a seletividade e a situação da empresa exige que a gente faça lances somente nas áreas que possam ter potencial maior”, afirmou.

Questionado se poderá repetir a parceria de sucesso exibida na 14ª Rodada de licitação, sob regime de concessão, em setembro, com a gigante Exxon Mobil, o executivo afirmou que não revelaria sua estratégia.

“Não esperem de mim que eu faça qualquer comentário sobre as parcerias, só posso dizer que parceria é a maneira usual de se trabalhar nessa indústria e nós vamos de parcerias”, disse o executivo.

VENDAS DE ATIVOS

Parente ressaltou que a empresa mantém a meta de desinvestimentos, de cerca de 21 bilhões de dólares até o fim do ano que vem, uma forma de a companhia reduzir o endividamento.

Segundo ele, as liminares contra as vendas de diversos ativos, conseguidas após ações populares na Justiça, são naturais no processo de desinvestimento no Brasil.

“Respeitando inteiramente o regime legal brasileiro, nós conseguimos reverter a maior parte delas. O que isso significa portanto é que há um atraso, mas não há a impossibilidade de fazer esses desinvestimentos”, afirmou Parente.

Sobre o IPO da BR Distribuidora, que promete ser a parte mais relevante do plano de desinvestimentos, o executivo afirmou que não foi definida uma data ainda e que vai levar em conta as condições de mercado.

Entretanto, ele destacou que deseja “fazer o mais rápido possível”.",Petrobras pode ir além de áreas selecionadas em leilão do pré-sal; atuará em parceiras,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1CT23J-OBRTP

He assailed Trump for telling falsehoods that are easily disproven and questioned why he persisted in doing so.

The latest exchange between the two Republicans was triggered by Trump in a salvo on Twitter in which he anticipated opposition from Corker for his administration’s tax reform plan.

“Bob Corker, who ... couldn’t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts,” Trump wrote on Twitter.

That prompted a retort on Twitter from Corker, “Same untruths from an utterly untruthful president.”

Giant tech firms are unlikely to go away.","If there’s been one common thread running through almost every industry in the last decade, it has been how a handful of tech firms have revolutionized how the world does business. There’s Google for accessing information; Twitter for sharing opinion and news; Facebook for interacting with friends; Amazon for shopping, AirBnB for places to stay and Uber for getting around.

Until relatively recently, most consumers and governments took this as a positive trend. While there were disputes over individual and limited issues – not least the companies’ unwillingness to pay tax or comply with requests from local regulators – they usually were seen as good for the economy and job opportunities. With their slick lobbying and PR operations, the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were courted by politicians and civil society alike.

That is changing. The decision by London authorities to strip Uber of its license to operate in the British capital is part of a wider backlash in a rapidly escalating war between governments and the tech firms they believe have become too powerful and contemptuous of rules and democratic authority. Uber and its biggest rival Lyft were ejected from the Texas capital of Austin last year for refusing to fingerprint their drivers. In 2013 in San Francisco and Oakland, tech giants such as Google and Apple’s private employee buses, which were illegally using public bus stops, were blocked by protesters.

Other cities are clearly watching carefully. New York’s city regulators said Monday they were looking at their own probe into Uber, looking specifically at its impact on the city’s own yellow cab sector.

Political perceptions of these tech firms are changing too. After the so-called “Arab Spring,” many Western governments – and the Obama administration in particular – openly praised the tech firms as being a positive global influence, helping democratize the world.

That assumption unraveled as the same platforms later fueled the rise of far right parties in Europe and the Trump presidential campaign. Under Congressional pressure, Facebook voluntarily turned over details of 3,000 election-related ads that appeared to have been paid for by Russia-linked buyers.

Such scrutiny may only be the beginning. Increasingly, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are being blamed for seismic changes in Western political systems, accused of allowing themselves to be hijacked by automatic bots and hardliners to radicalize politics and often spread extremism.

Getting too close to tech firms now brings its own political dangers. U.S. think tanks that happily embraced funding from Google now find themselves criticized for it, accused of reining in any debate critical of the company and its counterparts.

Instead of spreading opportunity, such firms are increasingly blamed for killing jobs. Amazon’s success is at the heart of what trade analysts referred to as the “retail apocalypse,” the shutting of growing numbers of stores across the United States and beyond. Uber has proved toxic to more tightly controlled taxi industries. The drivers of London’s famous black cabs have been particularly hard hit, and their aggressive lobbying of politicians is seen as one of the key factors behind London mayor Sadiq Khan’s decision to suspend Uber’s operating license.

The decision proved immediately contentious. For all the criticisms of Uber – that it ignores regulators and the employment rights of those who drive for it, and that there have been reports of abuse and sexual assaults by drivers – it has slashed transport costs for its users. It has also provided opportunities – although without much in the way of job security – for hundreds of thousands around the world. An Uber-launched petition to reverse the London ban quickly notched up 600,000 signatures.

For the firms themselves, this is a familiar dynamic. Facebook, Google and Twitter in particular have been tangling with national governments since they began operating in relatively autocratic countries such as Russia, China and those in the Middle East, where those in authority have long felt threatened by the quick and easy access they offer to information. Sometimes, the tech companies have found themselves blocked outright.

Increasingly, the perception has become that many of these firms are simply willing to push their luck to see what they can get away with.

Technology firms do have a difficult balance to strike. Google, Apple and others have long made a virtue of protecting user data against what they see as overly intrusive requests for access by authorities. In some areas, the rights and wrongs are arguable. In others, however – such as the payment of tax – governments and campaigners believe the issues are much more clear-cut.

In many respects, Uber and AirBnB are seen amongst the most egregious examples of companies that have seriously and deliberately pushing the limits of what is strictly legal. While London’s already more stringent taxi regulation means Uber needs a license, in many other cities both it and its drivers operate outside the conventional taxi licensing system. AirBnB lets out rooms in cities that explicitly ban short-term rentals. Both have based their entire business model on working around, if not entirely flouting, pre-existing local regulations. Authorities often seemed to lack the ability, or the political will, to enforce the rules.

The London Uber decision is perhaps the most significant escalation in that war so far. It’s not that the firm will necessarily be ultimately banned from the streets, as it will continue to operate pending an appeal. The most likely scenario is that the firm and regulators reach a deal – although that could be a difficult process.

Early signs are that the firm is indeed willing to compromise. On Monday, its chief executive sent London authorities a contrite letter saying that the firm realized it had to change. Mayor Khan welcomed the statement, saying he favored talks to resolve the issue.

What Khan – a fast-rising star within the opposition Labour Party – has demonstrated, however, is that the firm can only operate if authorities allow it to do so. It is fundamentally replaceable – indeed, that have already been suggestions that a quickly-formed rival with better employment and safety practices might take its place. Something similar happened in Austin: although the Texas state government overruled the ban on Uber and Lyft in May, both companies now face more local competition.

Giant tech firms are unlikely to go away. But neither are national or local governments, democratically elected or otherwise. With a host of new technologies coming down the line – self-driving cars, automatic shops, artificial intelligence – many controlled by the same companies, these fights are only going to get bloodier.",Commentary: Uber’s London fight a sign of tech battles to come,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-uber-commentary/commentary-ubers-london-fight-a-sign-of-tech-battles-to-come-idUSKCN1C223I

The growth of China’s electric vehicle industry - and the ambitions of recycling companies - is underpinned by a government drive to eventually phase out gasoline-burning cars, part of a broader effort to improve urban air quality and ease a reliance on overseas oil.

Led by companies like BYD and Geely, sales of electric vehicles in China reached 507,000 in 2016, up 53 percent over the previous year. The government is targeting sales of 2 million a year by 2020 and 7 million five years later, amounting to a fifth of total car production by 2025.

According to the International Energy Agency, China accounted for more than 40 percent of global electric car sales in 2016, followed by the European Union and the United States. It also overtook the United States as the market with the greatest number of electric vehicles.

Production in China of the lithium batteries that power those cars has also soared. In the first eight months of 2017, Chinese manufacturers produced 6.7 billion batteries, up 51 percent from the year-earlier period, according to industry ministry data.

All that activity could put China in pole position for dominating the global electric car industry, as well as related businesses like batteries and recycling.

China began promoting electric vehicles in 2009, and as the first of those cars reach the end of their lifespan, lithium battery waste could be as much as 170,000 tonnes next year, industry experts estimate. The figure is likely to keep multiplying in tandem with car sales.

Dealing with all that waste poses huge problems for China. Lithium batteries are not yet classified as hazardous waste and are therefore not subject to stringent disposal controls. Battery waste includes heavy metals like cobalt and nickel, as well as toxic residues that could end up in waterways and the soil if not handled properly.

Despite the challenges, battery waste also represents a significant opportunity for the country’s growing recycling industry.

The China Automobile Innovation Centre, an industry think tank, estimates the recycling market could be worth 31 billion yuan ($4.68 billion) by 2023.

Wang Chuanfu, president of BYD Co Ltd, China’s leading electric carmaker, last month described the lithium, copper and cobalt extracted from spent batteries as “treasures”.

Larger companies with high-tech recycling operations are already reaping the benefits, including Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium , Sinolink Securities, a local brokerage, said in a note to investors. The company’s share price has surged more than 200 percent this year.

Sinolink also cited GEM , a self-proclaimed “urban miner” that runs China’s largest automated battery dismantling facility in Shenzhen. GEM’s shares have risen more than 60 percent since January.

RECYCLING CHALLENGES

Still, the industry faces numerous obstacles.

Recycling lithium batteries can be prohibitively expensive for many companies. And the industry has yet to agree on the standardization necessary to handle spent batteries more profitably and in big numbers.

Some executives also say China is not doing enough to encourage the industry with subsidies and enforce existing environmental regulations.

“Speeding up the recycling of lithium batteries is a matter of urgency, and has become a major issue for the development of the new energy vehicle industry,” Zhang Tianren, chairman of the battery maker Tianneng Power, wrote in a proposal submitted to China’s parliament in March.

The commercial viability of the sector has been undermined by soaring waste treatment costs, as well as high taxes, Tianwei’s Zhang said.

In his paper, Zhang cited one recycling company as saying that the value of materials extracted from one tonne of lithium-iron-phospate battery waste stood at 8,110 yuan, but the cost of recycling them would be 8,540 yuan.

Automating the recycling process in China was another major challenge due to a lack of standardized product designs, said Zhang.

Automation was also being held back by poor equipment and technology, especially among smaller producers, Xiao Hai, chief engineer with the Shenzhen-based Clou Electronics, a company that develops new energy products, said at an energy conference in August.

The government, meanwhile, is trying to transform the country’s recycling system into a high-tech regulated industry.

Large-scale battery makers are being pressed to establish their own recycling facilities, and polluting backyard recyclers have been forced to close.

China’s industry ministry last year urged the sector to introduce standardized designs and raise technology to “international” levels by 2020. It plans to publish comprehensive new battery recycling rules before the end of the year.

But Tianneng’s Zhang said regulators were not enforcing policies and penalizing unqualified companies.

“Because policies are not enforced and there is no clear incentive mechanism, lithium battery recycling is not profitable,” he said.

China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which regulates electric cars, did not respond to faxed requests for comment. The Ministry of Environmental Protection also did not respond.

Battery companies have for the moment been bearing much of the cost of recycling. While carmakers are technically liable for recycling batteries, in practice they sign deals with suppliers to recycle batteries on their behalf.

Green Cheng, chief executive of Shenzhen Cham Battery Technology Co. Ltd, said that recycling was a strain on the resources of battery makers.

Shenzhen Cham churns out 300,000 lithium batteries a day at its factory in Dongguan, in southern China, and lists Geely, the automaker, among its partners. The company has to pay a recycling company to dispose of batteries.

“If manufacturers like us are going to be responsible, then the government definitely needs to provide funds to support us,” he said.",China's recyclers eye looming electric vehicle battery mountain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-batteries-recycling-insight/chinas-recyclers-eye-looming-electric-vehicle-battery-mountain-idUSKBN1CR0Y8

The populist New Zealand First, the junior partner in the new Labour-led coalition government, also wants to broaden the central bank’s focus to include greater management of the local dollar’s value against other currencies.

“We have been looking at changing the objectives set out in the Reserve Bank Act,” Ardern told reporters in Wellington.

“The objectives of the Act to possibly include employment is certainly part of our plans.”

Labour flagged the monetary policy changes during its election campaign. New Zealand First has previously mentioned it would like the central bank to better manage the currency, without elaborating.

The New Zealand dollar suffered fresh falls on Tuesday as Ardern and New Zealand First leader Winston Peters confirmed their policy priorities. The kiwi dollar shed all its early gains to push below $0.6940, having briefly been as high as $0.7003 at one point.

Rather than just focussing on inflation, Labour wants the Reserve Bank to have a full employment goal when devising policy settings, bringing it into line with the United States and Australia.

While unemployment in New Zealand is at near decade lows of below 5 percent, job growth was a hot political issue during the recent election.

The unlikely alliance between the centre-left Labour and populist New Zealand First was brokered after a Sept. 23 election failed to deliver a majority to the governing National or opposition Labour.

Peters has been offered the role of deputy prime minister, which he is likely to accept, and Ardern indicated on Tuesday that Peters would also become foreign minister, putting a protectionist at the forefront of New Zealand’s international relations.

Peters was foreign minister in a Labour-led government in 2005, during which time he became among a handful of Western politicians to visit North Korea.

“The general consensus is that he did a good job,” said Richard Shaw, politics professor at Massey University.

“He wasn’t particularly interested in restructuring departments. He’s very good at working the room and is an affable character.”

Labour and New Zealand First share similar policies designed to cut immigration, ban foreigners from buying existing property and raise the minimum wage.

Many of the policies draw on voter concerns that immigration and foreign buyers of local homes are putting too much pressure on infrastructure and house prices, representing a shift in New Zealand’s formerly open door policy.

Ardern said Labour’s immigration policy remained in place, whereby net migration would reduce from by between 20,000 to 30,000. This represents a less dramatic cut than New Zealand First had proposed prior to the election. Net migration is running at just over 70,000 a year.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Ranked #2: Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea, August 4, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

The split is the latest sign of partisan feuding that current and former U.S. officials say is undercutting a House Intelligence Committee probe into Russia’s reported interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Republicans on the committee earlier this month subpoenaed an unidentified bank for the last two years of records of the accounts of Fusion GPS, the political research firm that hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to pull together the dossier on Trump.

The move was an apparent effort to find out who had paid for the work that led to the dossier. The firm assures its clients it will not disclose their identities.

Last week, Fusion GPS sued the unnamed bank in federal court in Washington, requesting a court order to block the subpoena.

In a Monday night court filing, lawyers for the House, saying they represented the Intelligence Committee, asked the court to reject Fusion’s request.

But the legal challenge was made without support from Democrats, throwing into further question a tradition of bipartisanship in Congress on intelligence issues.

Democrats, who are in the minority, and some Republicans on the House panel, want to investigate Russia’s role in the 2016 election, as well as allegations - so far unproven - that Trump’s team colluded with the Kremlin.

Representative Devin Nunes, the Intelligence Committee’s Republican chairman, and his allies have focused instead on other issues, including the activities of Fusion GPS.

Some Republicans, including Senator Charles Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, have charged that Fusion GPS took Russian money while compiling the dossier on Trump.

“Domestic American clients paid for Fusion GPS to research Donald Trump, period. No Russian was involved, in any way, in the payment to Fusion GPS for this work,” Joshua Levy, an outside attorney for the firm, said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday.

A footnote in Monday’s court filing says that House lawyers went to court to enforce the subpoena with the authorization of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the entire House.

But it adds that the House’s “Democratic Leader and Democratic Whip decline to support the Group’s position in this case.”

Representative Nancy Pelosi is the House Democratic leader, and Representative Steny Hoyer is the Democratic whip.

The top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff, was not immediately available for comment.

In their court filing, the House lawyers argue that Fusion GPS has no right to quash a valid congressional subpoena.

“The relief Plaintiff seeks is extraordinary and would directly impede an ongoing congressional investigation of the highest national importance,” they wrote in the filing.

The filing confirms Nunes retains control of the committee’s Russia probe, despite saying in April he would step aside and let fellow Republican Representative Mike Conaway take charge.

The court, which recently banned the sale of firecrackers in the New Delhi area, also ordered a ban on the sale and use of furnace oil - another dirty refinery by-product - in and around the capital and ordered implementation of strict emission norms by the end of December.

“It is a big win for clean air,” Sunita Narain, an environmental activist and a member of a committee set up by the government which recommended the ban of such fuels around the Indian capital, told Reuters.

The order comes after the Environment Protection Authority (EPCA), a government-appointed body, in April recommended to the court that it ban the fuels due to high sulfur levels.

India is the world’s biggest consumer of petroleum coke, a dark solid composed mainly of carbon, which emits 11 percent more greenhouse gases than coal, according to the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy. Burning it also emits several times more sulfur dioxide, which causes lung diseases and acid rain.

Annual demand for the fuel, which is more energy efficient than coal, has nearly doubled over the past four years to more than 27 million tonnes.

India tops deaths from pollution globally, according to The Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health, with 2.5 million Indians dying early in 2015 because of pollution. (reut.rs/2zyeKMV)

Indian health ministry data shows that respiratory issues killed about 10 people per day in the year ended March 2017 in the National Capital Region - a rapidly urbanizing and polluted area around New Delhi that is a third the size of New York state, but houses 2.5 times more people.

Those deaths could be the result of pollution from many sources, including coal, or have other causes.

The ban on the sale and use of petcoke, which will be effective from Nov. 1, could hit the country’s small and medium scale industries, which employ millions of workers and operate on thin margins.

Sulfur-heavy petcoke and other cheap, highly polluting fuels such as furnace oil are widely used by cement factories, dyeing units, paper mills, brick kilns and ceramics businesses.

Puneet Gupta, founder of online coal and petcoke marketplace CoalShastra, said “per-unit delivered energy for petcoke is much cheaper when compared to the next alternate, coal,” making it attractive for buyers. Users say they also prefer the fuel over coal because of its assured supply.

Such companies say banning cheap fuel might stunt their ability to expand and hire more staff, just as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to create jobs.

The measure, which prescribes jail terms of up to two years for violations, aimed to minimise frivolous complaints against officials, said the government of the state, ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party.

In recent years many journalists reporting corruption and attacks on minorities in India have complained of being targeted by online smear campaigns, although there have been no reports of measures elsewhere similar to what Rajasthan proposed.

The Editors’ Guild of India and the opposition Congress party called Rajasthan’s move an attempt to curb media freedom and shield corrupt individuals, criticisms that forced the state to delay discussion on the bill.

“The government has agreed to refer the bill to a panel of legislature members,” a state government spokesman told Reuters by telephone, adding that the bill could be introduced, following amendments, in the next assembly session early next year.

When introduced this week in the state assembly, it set a six-month deadline for courts to secure the government’s permission for any investigations into the actions of judges, magistrates or public servants.

In the absence of such permission, it also sought to block publication of the identity, or other personal, or family details of those being investigated.

""No one shall print or publish, or publicize in any manner, the name, address, photograph, family details, or any other particulars which may lead to disclosure of identity of a judge or magistrate or a public servant,"" it added. (bit.ly/2i0w5GZ)

The bill’s passage by the state legislature would have helped turn into law an executive decree on the subject issued in September that would otherwise have lapsed within six months.

When asked about the status of the decree, the state government spokesman declined to comment.

Rajasthan was only trying to “shield honest officers so that they can perform their duty”, Indian Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters on Monday, but declined further comment, saying it was a state matter.

In an inaugural Bundestag session following the Sept. 24 federal election, lawmakers from the other parties showed their disdain for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party by overwhelmingly rejecting its candidate for deputy speaker.

Convention holds that each party represented in the Bundestag names a deputy speaker. But lawmakers spurned AfD candidate Albert Glaser in three rounds of voting.

Still, the AfD, which has become the first far-right group represented in Germany’s parliament for more than half a century, made clear its intention to shake up German politics on the national stage.

“The people have decided, now a new era begins,” AfD parliamentary leader Bernd Baumann told the chamber.

Schaeuble, who won 501 of 705 votes for the post of speaker, shot back in his maiden speech: “Nobody on their own represents the people.”

GRAVITAS

Germany’s longest serving lawmaker, 75-year-old Schaeuble is one of the country’s most respected politicians and seen as well qualified to tame recalcitrant lawmakers.

By agreeing to move to the Bundestag, Schaeuble has opened the way for the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) to take over his powerful Finance Ministry, helping to unblock talks on an expected new three-way coalition with the Greens.

The conservatives, FDP and Greens convene on Tuesday evening for coalition talks.

FDP leader Christian Lindner told broadcaster n-tv that Schaeuble was an extraordinary figure in German politics:

“He has gravitas, a clear position and a natural authority that will be good to have in a parliament that has just become more diverse, and where some manners may be called into question.”

The AfD’s Baumann shocked other lawmakers by suggesting that they had used Nazi-era tactics to prevent Glaser from taking a deputy speaker post. FDP politician Marco Buschmann said the comments were “beyond tasteless.”

The AfD can nominate an alternative candidate for deputy speaker. Although there is precedent for a party’s first choice being rejected, there is no precedent for a party failing to have any lawmaker accepted in the post.

Spain says it will impose direct rule on Catalonia from Friday to prevent an illegal push for independence, invoking unprecedented powers to dismiss the regional government. Madrid said an election would not change those plans.

The Catalan parliament meets on Thursday to agree on a response to Madrid, and many analysts believe the economically powerful region could formally declare independence.

Secessionists in Catalonia say their independence referendum on Oct. 1 - which attracted a 43 percent turnout and was mostly boycotted by those Catalans who want to remain in Spain - has given them a mandate for statehood.

Catalonia said on Monday it was confident that its officials, including the police, would defy attempts by Madrid to enforce direct rule.

Spanish political and business leaders, along with most Catalonian newspapers, have urged Catalan President Carles Puigdemont to call a regional election before he is stripped of his authority.

They say direct rule from Madrid would be a humiliation for Catalonia and pose a serious risk of unrest.

Puigdemont has so far remained silent on the matter of an election but an ally of his pro-independence government said he was actively considering this option.

“We have evidence this is currently on the table,” Carles Riera, a Catalan lawmaker for the anti-capitalist CUP party, told a news conference.

Calling an election would be a face-saving move for Puigdemont as it could either strengthen his mandate if pro-independence parties won or allow him a graceful exit if they did not.

DEBATE?

The Spanish government said a snap election would be a first step but Puigdemont would also have to withdraw an ambiguous declaration of independence he made earlier this month.

The government had moved to cancel Catalonia’s autonomous status because it believed there had been a “serious failure” by Puigdemont to meet his obligations, Justice Minister Rafael Catala said in a radio interview.

“Everything is not fixed just by calling an election.”

Catala said that if Puigdemont appeared before the Spanish Senate, it would help to resolve the crisis.

A top official in the Senate said that if Puigdemont decided to appear before the house, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would likely come to the chamber as well so that a proper debate could be organised between the two.

The Senate said on Tuesday it had invited Puigdemont to appear before the chamber on Thursday at 5 p.m (1500 GMT) or Friday at 10 a.m (0800 GMT).

The Madrid government has so far refused to meet the Catalan leader until he drops his call for independence and Catala said any appearance by Puigdemont had to be within a legal and constitutional framework.

“If his appearance is within the constitution and the law we’ll be delighted ... But if it’s just to ratify his position on Catalonia’s independence, sadly we will not be able to do anything else than continuing with the measures already set by the government,” Catala said.

The political uncertainty has taken its toll on Spain’s wealthiest region, with hundreds of companies moving their headquarters out of Catalonia.

Volkswagen’s Spanish unit SEAT, one of the biggest employers in the region, said it would move its registered office if it felt there was no longer legal security in Catalonia, although it had so far not made a decision.

The company also raised its full-year forecasts for sales and earnings, expecting revenue in its construction business to surge about 20 percent and mining business to jump 30 percent.

The construction industry in North America is turning around after years of slow demand, fueled by a steady housing recovery, an improving labor market and higher spending by oil and gas companies.

Sales in North America, Caterpillar’s biggest market, jumped 27 percent in the third quarter ended Sept 30. Construction revenue from the region rose 31 percent to $2.17 billion and revenue from resources, including mining, rose 28 percent to $581 million.

Some analysts, however, questioned if the company could sustain such high growth rates.

“Sustainability of the scorching pace of growth Caterpillar set in the latest quarter is in question because construction spending in the country has not yet hit an inflection point,” said Jefferies analyst Steve Volkmann.

In the Asia Pacific region, Caterpillar’s third-biggest, sales jumped 57 percent to $1.29 billion, boosted by demand from China.

While China has been the bright spot for Caterpillar in the past few quarters, the pace of growth in the country’s property sector cooled in the third quarter, potentially hurting demand for the company’s iconic yellow earth-moving equipment in the near future.

Caterpillar's shares rose to an all-time high of $140.44, but pared some gains to trade up 5 percent at $138.37. The stock has risen 42 pct this year, compared with an 18 percent increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI.

Excluding restructuring costs, Caterpillar earned $1.95 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.27 per shares, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The earnings beat was even more remarkable as analysts had raised their third-quarter estimates by nearly 30 percent in the past three months.

Net profit rose nearly four-fold to $1.06 billion.

Total revenue rose to $11.41 billion, ahead of market estimates of $10.65 billion.

The company said it now expects 2017 sales and revenue of $44 billion, up from its previous forecast of $42 billion to $44 billion.

The world’s largest restaurant chain by revenue has been working to boost flagging traffic at its U.S. restaurants, where it gets most of its profit, after customers defected to fast-food rivals and pricier fast-casual options like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N).

In the past year, McDonald’s has introduced cook-to-order, fresh beef Quarter Pounders, new items with a variety of buns and sauces like the Signature Sriracha sandwich, as well as mobile ordering and delivery.

“We served more customers, more often,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said on a conference call to discuss third-quarter earnings. “The U.S. business regained its stride.”

Global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 6 percent for the quarter, beating the 4.5 percent gain expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.

Those sales rose a better-than-expected 4.1 percent in the United States, where traffic improved for the second quarter after more than four straight years of declines. China, the UK and Canada also turned in strong performances.

“Given that the fast food and casual dining segments as a whole struggled over the third quarter, this is an encouraging set of results which suggests McDonald’s is gaining both market and customer share,” GlobalData Retail’s Managing Director Neil Saunders said.

McDonadl’s shares were last up 1.5 percent in midday trading and not far from a record high hit on Friday.

Aggressive promotions in the United States included soft drinks of all sizes for $1, McCafe smoothies and espresso drinks for $2 and the McPick 2 offer of two menu items for $5.

The changes, part of a turnaround plan under Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook, came after Chipotle, Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and others raised the bar on what consumers can expect from fast food.

McDonald’s shares have climbed 65 percent since Easterbrook was named CEO in March 2015, outperforming a 22 percent rise in the S&P 500 and Chipotle’s 52 percent drop.

Fast-casual chains have fallen far short of expectations after a wave of initial public offerings in recent years. Shares in Zoe’s Kitchen Inc (ZOES.N) and Noodles & Co (NDLS.O) are trading below their IPO prices, while Shake Shack Inc (SHAK.N) is far short of its all-time high of nearly $93 in May 2015.

Lower priced fast-food chains seem to be benefiting from last year’s sharp slowdown in customer traffic to fast-casual chains including Chipotle, which is still trying to recover from a string of food safety incidents in 2015, Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said in a recent report.

“I think it’s safe to say that the reports of fast food’s death were greatly exaggerated,” said Senatore, who added that McDonald’s and its fast-food peers have posted the best fundamental results and stock returns of the broader industry since late 2015.

Excluding items, McDonald’s earned a profit of $1.76 per share, just missing an average analyst estimate of $1.77 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

During the quarter, McDonald’s had higher taxes and expenses, but also had gains from selling its China and Hong Kong businesses.

Trump has asked his fellow Republicans who control Congress to pass a package of tax cuts, including a deep reduction in the corporate income tax, by year’s end.

But hours before he was to promote the tax plan at a weekly lunch for Republican senators on Capitol Hill, Trump engaged in a distracting tussle with one of those lawmakers: Bob Corker, a leading fiscal hawk and the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

“Bob Corker, who ... couldn’t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts,” Trump wrote on Twitter, later adding that the senator is “incompetent.”

Alienating any members of his own party could be costly for Trump’s legislative initiatives in the Senate because Republicans control the chamber by just a slim 52-48 margin.

Corker warned Trump in television interviews against interfering in congressional efforts to finalize the legislation to cut taxes and called the president’s visit with Senate Republicans “a photo op.”

“Hopefully, the White House will step aside and let that occur in a normal process,” the Tennessee Republican told NBC’s “Today” program. “That’s the best way for us to have success.”

Corker also described Trump in a Twitter post as “an utterly untruthful president,” and in television interviews accused Trump of debasing the United States.

‘HISTORIC CHANCE’

House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan urged reporters to ignore the Trump-Corker spat and concentrate on the tax plan.

“Put this Twitter dispute aside. The fact is we have an historic chance of fixing this tax code,” Ryan said.

Ryan added that he knows Corker well and predicted that the senator is “going to vote for tax reform.”

Ryan said he wants the House to pass the Republican tax cut bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, echoing Trump’s call to speed up the party’s efforts to get the measure approved before year’s end.

Securing congressional passage of his tax plan is critically important to Trump, who has yet to get major legislation through Congress since taking office in January, including a healthcare overhaul he promised as a candidate last year. Tax cuts were another of Trump’s campaign pledges.

The White House argues that tax cuts are needed to boost economic growth and create jobs, but has shown sensitivity in recent weeks to arguments that it is endangering America’s long-term fiscal health.

One of the key elements of the proposal is to slash the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. While the broad parameters of the tax proposal have been made public, detailed legislation has not yet been unveiled.

Democrats have painted Trump’s plan, with its $6 trillion in tax cuts, as a gift to the rich and corporate America that would balloon the federal deficit.

The British government once hoped that the Oct. 19-20 meeting would be the moment when the Brexit negotiations could move on to discuss trade. That aspiration now seems hopeless. European leaders look set to insist on further delay until there is more progress in the first stage of talks, above all in reaching agreement on how much Britain will have to pay to settle its obligations when it leaves.

Political discord at the heart of the British government and the weakness of Theresa May following the loss of the Conservative majority in the general election have undoubtedly been hampering negotiations. Not unreasonably, European leaders worry about striking a deal with someone who might not be prime minister when Britain leaves the EU in 17 months’ time.

The EU holds the strongest cards because what matters most for Britain is its future trading arrangements with the huge market on its doorstep. The deadline under the Article 50 withdrawal procedure increases the EU’s leverage since Britain must leave with or without a deal in March 2019 (unless the 27 European states agree unanimously on an extension.) Despite hyped-up talk in London about preparing for no deal at all, Britain will do its utmost to avoid what would be a ruinous outcome, grounding flights to Europe and causing long hold-ups at border crossings, such as Dover on the south coast of England.

John Lloyd: We boomers are leaving a toxic legacy

If economic size and time favor the EU, the British government’s strongest card is money - one that it has played in various guises for centuries with its continental neighbors - and it is naturally reluctant to show its full hand too early. Even so May has already made an important concession. As part of the transition period of around two years that she called for in her emollient Florence speech last month, Britain would continue to pay in to the EU budget to ensure that none of the member states was out of pocket owing to the decision to leave. These net payments of around €10 billion ($11.8 billion) a year would fix the immediate problem facing the EU, the hole that would otherwise open up in its finances during the final two years of its current budgetary framework, which runs from 2014 to 2020.

But that extra money from aligning Britain’s effective date of departure with the end of the EU’s budgeting plan will not be enough, for two reasons. One is the way the EU in effect borrows from the future, by making spending commitments that it pays for later. In principle, the EU cannot borrow to pay for expenditure. But, through its accounting procedures, the EU can and does commit it to spending that will be paid for by future receipts from the member states.

What this means is that even after 2020 there will still be payments due on commitments made under the current seven-year spending plan. That pile of unpaid bills, eloquently called the reste ὰ liquider (the amount yet to be settled), is forecast to be €254 billion ($300 billion) at the end of 2020. Estimates of what Britain might owe towards this vary, but taking into account what might have been spent on British projects it could be around €20 billion ($23.6 billion).

On top of that – and the second main reason why the EU is holding out for more – the EU has liabilities, notably arising from the unfunded retirement benefits of European staff estimated at €67 billion ($79 billion) at the end of 2016, which it is expecting Britain to share. Even taking into account some potential offsets from its share of assets, Britain may face a bill of between €30 billion ($35 billion) and €40 billion ($47 billion) on top of the €20 billion ($23.6 billion) paid during the transition period.

Although money is Britain’s strongest card in the negotiations, there are political limits to the amount that the government can stump up. Brexit campaigners used inflated figures to exaggerate the money that could supposedly be switched into the health service from Britain’s contribution to the EU. That means the reality of having to pay a large exit bill could be electorally toxic. Yet in order to secure what really matters for Britain – access on reasonable terms to the huge European market – May’s government will have to confront the public with this cost.

The British predicament is so extreme and rifts between Conservative ministers over how much ground to concede so acute that a breakdown in the negotiations is conceivable later this year. With so much attention focused on the political drama playing out in London, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the EU will face a harsh budgetary future even with a substantial divorce settlement. Indeed the insistence that Britain pay up is a sign of the strains that will come to the fore after the transition period ends. The EU will lose one of its big net contributors, the second largest after Germany in 2015.

The EU’s budget of around 1 percent of GDP is in any case puny given the scale of its ambitions. Those hoping for greater generosity on the part of the remaining rich countries are likely to be disappointed. With German Chancellor Angela Merkel weakened following her poor performance in the federal election, Germany will be even more tight-fisted than before in its efforts to avoid anything that smacks even faintly of a “transfer union.” Yet if the poorer countries receive less, that will sharpen the north-south divide that emerged so starkly during the euro crisis when countries such as Finland resented having to contribute to bailouts – especially to Greece – while southern states smarted at the imposition of austerity. And it will exacerbate tensions with eastern countries such as Poland that are big beneficiaries from the EU budget.

Both Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, and – more important – French President Emmanuel Macron, have recently set out plans to reboot Europe. But these grand visions will count for little unless they are matched by the solidarity of hard cash. At present the EU can make common cause in pursuit of Britain’s exit bill. But once Britain leaves, the bickering over money will begin – and the push toward a stronger union could be tougher than ever to achieve.",Commentary: How money will divide Europe after Brexit,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallace-brexit-commentary/commentary-how-money-will-divide-europe-after-brexit-idUSKBN1CM2BN

Gabe Kadosh, vice president at real estate firm Colliers International, said Amazon and Whole Foods “want to have freedom to do whatever they want.","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market met a new foe this summer during talks to lease a top retail space in a San Francisco mall: the Target next door.

As City Center mall’s largest tenant, Target Corp had a say over changes to the property. According to people familiar with the lease discussions, Target balked at sharing the mall with Whole Foods because it feared competition from the grocery chain’s new owner, Amazon.com Inc.

Early attempts to persuade Target failed, and Whole Foods may now have to concede certain Amazon initiatives - such as lockers where customers can pick up goods ordered online - if it wants the location, the people said. Talks are ongoing.

A Reuters examination of real estate agreements and interviews with 20 retail landlords, lawyers and brokers show that the strings attached to operating in malls like City Center present an emerging and little-scrutinized challenge to Amazon’s quest to re-shape Whole Foods.

Across the United States, large retailers including Target, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc and Best Buy Co Inc have legal rights in many lease agreements that allow them to limit what Amazon can do with nearby Whole Foods stores, and where it can open new ones.

Documents reviewed by Reuters show bans on Amazon lockers and delivery operations near a Target store in Illinois and also in Florida, where a new Whole Foods is set to open. Lockers for retrieving online orders are a way for Amazon to spur sales through the grocery chain.

In Manhattan and other locations, the leases of Whole Foods’ big box neighbors bar it from selling a range of goods that Amazon has in its massive online inventory, from electronics to toys and linens.

Even Whole Foods stores that do not share space with major rivals can face constraints imposed by local governments. A city council resolution in White Plains, New York, restricted the hours when Whole Foods can use a loading dock prior to the grocer locating in the mall.

Amazon declined to answer questions about how these restrictions across the country impact its plans.

In a statement, Target said it is “focused on what’s best for the company and delivering on the reasons our guests love Target. Our more than 1,800 stores across the country are a strategic asset and a vital part of Target’s future.”

The company did not discuss details of the restrictions reported by Reuters, but said, “It’s inaccurate to characterize lease agreements as our corporate strategy.”

Reuters could not determine the full extent of limits on Whole Foods stores because lease deals vary from mall to mall, and many are not public. While restricting how neighbors operate is a standard practice in retail, Amazon is new to feeling the heat.

Some mall owners and real estate brokers say Whole Foods will still find landlords who are eager to have the high-profile tenant driving traffic in their malls, and see rivals trying to keep Whole Foods out as short-sighted.

But with nearly all of Whole Foods’ 473 stores subject to lease agreements and plans to add up to 85 stores, according to regulatory filings, Amazon has launched into brick-and-mortar with more constraints and entrenched enemies than in the online world it dominates.

“Many people assume this big, 800-pound gorilla is going to come and beat up all of these retailers,” said Terrison Quinn, a senior vice president at brokerage SRS Real Estate Partners. “I just don’t think that’s going to be the case.”

DOZENS OF RESTRICTIONS

Amazon wasted no time in making changes when the $13.7 billion Whole Foods deal closed in August. The world’s largest online retailer cut grocery prices, started selling its Echo home speaker in stores and disclosed plans to add lockers to some locations and Whole Foods items to Prime Now, its two-hour delivery program.

Analysts expect such moves will boost online orders and revenue for Amazon. But big box rivals have a number of ways to fight back.

Retailers routinely negotiate guarantees that their landlords will not alter malls in a way that hurts sales, whether leasing to a strip club or starting construction projects without approval, real estate lawyers said.

These leases, which often last 10 to 20 years with options to renew, may even name competitors barred from opening a store.

A 16-page memo in July detailing the lease restrictions governing Miami’s Pinecrest Place mall, obtained by Reuters, offers a glimpse of the legal protections retailers are securing.

Target required an affiliate of national landlord Regency Centers Corp to bar “Any lockers, lock-boxes or other type of storage system that is used to receive or store merchandise from a catalog or online retailer.”

The document then specifies more than a dozen other restrictions for the mall, from leasing space to a pet shop or toy store to operating “a fulfillment center in connection with receiving, storing or distributing merchandise from a catalog or online retailer.”

Regency announced in April that Whole Foods will open in the center, meaning the store cannot have Amazon lockers or fulfill orders for Prime Now.

A May memo of lease for a Target in Evanston, Illinois, obtained by Reuters, contains similar prohibitions against lockers and online fulfillment.

In another case, Target raised similar concerns about Amazon for a prospective Whole Foods location at the Stonestown Galleria in San Francisco, people familiar with the matter said.

A Reuters analysis showed that 7 percent of existing Whole Foods' U.S. stores are within a quarter mile, or roughly five-minute walk, of a Target.

OPPOSITION ABOUNDS

Target is not alone in placing limits on Amazon.

Lidl, a German grocery chain expanding in the United States, said in a deal this year it would “prohibit the operation of pickup facilities” by rivals such as “Wal-Mart and Amazon... that sell grocery items” near a planned store on Long Island in New York, according to a person familiar with the matter. The language is becoming common, the person said.

Will Harwood, a spokesman for Lidl, said, “We adhere to industry norms and standard real estate practices when securing sites.”

A Bed Bath & Beyond store in lower Manhattan bars its next-door tenant - Whole Foods - from selling linens, bathroom items, housewares and frames, its memo of lease said. The company declined to comment.

And a Best Buy store just north of Miami has the exclusive right in its shopping center to sell electronics. A lease carve-out, which states other tenants can sell gadgets on less than 250 square feet of floor space, allowed for the mall’s Whole Foods to display the Echo speaker, according to a memo seen by Reuters and a reporter who visited the location.

“It is pretty standard for anchor tenants of a shopping center to reserve the right in their leases to prohibit improvements to a center - including the addition of new tenants - without approval and consent,” said Jeff Shelman, spokesman for Best Buy.

Gabe Kadosh, vice president at real estate firm Colliers International, said Amazon and Whole Foods “want to have freedom to do whatever they want. The challenge is in brick and mortar, and in multi-tenant shopping centers, you can’t just do that.”",Amazon rivals turn to legal fine print to stem Whole Foods strategy,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-realestate/amazon-rivals-turn-to-legal-fine-print-to-stem-whole-foods-strategy-idUSKBN1CT0ES?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Das oito áreas que serão ofertadas no leilão marcado para sexta-feira, a Petrobras exerceu direito de preferência para ser a operadora de três: Sapinhoá, Peroba e Alto de Cabo frio - Central.

Nas demais áreas do leilão, a empresa poderá ainda participar, mas sem qualquer prioridade.

“Não necessariamente (faremos lances) apenas (pelas) três, mas as três certamente já estamos com um bom direito assegurado de que dentro das condições econômicas favoráveis, que só serão conhecidas no leilão, nós temos o direito de participar dessas áreas”, disse Parente, a jornalistas.

O executivo ponderou que a empresa, altamente endividada, precisa ser seletiva em suas ofertas, apesar de o leilão trazer oportunidades muito relevantes para a indústria de petróleo.

O leilão vai ofertar áreas com grande potencial petrolífero, sob regime de partilha de produção. Ao todo, as empresas vencedoras terão de pagar mais de 7 bilhões de reais em bônus de assinatura por todas as áreas, mas vence quem oferecer ao governo o maior percentual do óleo produzido.

“Dado o conjunto de boas áreas ofertadas, certamente seria uma boa ideia ou seria possível pensar exclusivamente sob o ponto de vista da qualidade das áreas de uma participação mais ampla, mas a seletividade e a situação da empresa exige que a gente faça lances somente nas áreas que possam ter potencial maior”, afirmou.

Questionado se poderá repetir a parceria de sucesso exibida na 14ª Rodada de licitação, sob regime de concessão, em setembro, com a gigante Exxon Mobil, o executivo afirmou que não revelaria sua estratégia.

“Não esperem de mim que eu faça qualquer comentário sobre as parcerias, só posso dizer que parceria é a maneira usual de se trabalhar nessa indústria e nós vamos de parcerias”, disse o executivo.

VENDAS DE ATIVOS

Parente ressaltou que a empresa mantém a meta de desinvestimentos, de cerca de 21 bilhões de dólares até o fim do ano que vem, uma forma de a companhia reduzir o endividamento.

Segundo ele, as liminares contra as vendas de diversos ativos, conseguidas após ações populares na Justiça, são naturais no processo de desinvestimento no Brasil.

“Respeitando inteiramente o regime legal brasileiro, nós conseguimos reverter a maior parte delas. O que isso significa portanto é que há um atraso, mas não há a impossibilidade de fazer esses desinvestimentos”, afirmou Parente.

Sobre o IPO da BR Distribuidora, que promete ser a parte mais relevante do plano de desinvestimentos, o executivo afirmou que não foi definida uma data ainda e que vai levar em conta as condições de mercado.

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

With open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act - better known as Obamacare - set to start in just over a week, the state announced it would no longer wait to hear if federal officials would approve its request aimed at cutting individual healthcare insurance premiums and widening coverage.

The withdrawal prompted a leading U.S. Senate Republican to urge Congress to approve a bipartisan fix to Obamacare, which President Donald Trump has vowed to scrap.

Iowa was viewed as a test case by some for other states that submitted similar, if far less-reaching, waivers and of how the Trump administration would respond to such requests.

Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said the law had not been flexible enough to accommodate the state’s request.

“Ultimately, Obamacare is an inflexible law that Congress must repeal and replace,” the governor said in a statement, adding that premiums under Obamacare had increased by 110 percent for Iowans since 2013.

Iowa sought the waiver after its individual healthcare marketplace shrank to only one insurer for next year, Minnesota-based Medica.

Some of the state’s requests were similar to provisions included in Republican repeal and replace bills this year. For instance, the waiver sought to replace Obamacare’s income-based tax credits with flat age-based credits and eliminate insurer payments that Trump cut off earlier this month.

Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said the move by Iowa demonstrated the need for repairs to Obamacare that he and Democratic Senator Patty Murray have proposed aimed at stabilizing insurance markets. It would also provide states more flexibility in reshaping some parts of Obamacare.

Trump has sent mixed signals over whether he would support the bipartisan fix. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Sunday that he was willing to bring up the proposal for a vote but needed to know where Trump stood.

Alexander said the bipartisan repair proposal would allow the federal government to approve Iowa’s waiver.

Alexander told reporters that the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan scorekeeper, would soon announce its analysis of the bipartisan repair legislation, possibly on Tuesday.",Iowa pulls request to opt out of Obamacare requirements,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-iowa/iowa-pulls-request-to-opt-out-of-obamacare-requirements-idUSKBN1CT01A?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Over 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar since Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response by the Myanmar army that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.

At a meeting in Myanmar’s capital Naypyitaw, attended by Myanmar’s home affairs minister lieutenant general Kyaw Swe and his Bangladeshi counterpart Asaduzzaman Khan, the countries signed two agreements covering security and border cooperation.

The two sides have also agreed to “to halt the outflow of Myanmar residents to Bangladesh,” and “to form a joint working group,” Tin Myint, permanent secretary from Myanmar’s home affairs ministry told reporters after the meetings.

“After joint working group, the verification, (the) two countries have agreed to arrange different steps so that these people can return to their homeland safely and honourably and in secure conditions,” said Mostafa Kamal Uddin, secretary from Bangladeshi home affairs ministry.

The officials did not elaborate on the specific steps the authorities would take for the repatriation, adding that the bulk of discussions was dedicated to border and security cooperation agreements which have been long in the making.

Tin Myint said the two countries agreed “to restore normalcy in Rakhine to enable displaced Myanmar residents to return from Bangladesh at the earliest opportunity.”

He also said Myanmar had sent a list of suspects who had fled to Bangladesh and requested the authorities there to investigate and return them to Myanmar.

Thousands of refugees have continued to arrived cross the Naf river separating Myanmar’s western Rakhine state and Bangladesh in recent days, even though Myanmar says military operations ceased on Sept. 5.

The United States said on Monday it was considering a range of further actions over Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority.

While on Tuesday the officials said the talks were friendly, tensions are still high between the two countries. Bangladesh last month accused Myanmar of repeatedly violating its air space and warned that any more “provocative acts” could have “unwarranted consequences”.

On border and security, the two sides decided to establish border liaison offices, carry out regular meetings between two security forces, jointly combat drug trafficking across the border and set up a mechanism to communicate directly.

Bangladesh has for decades faced influxes of Rohingya fleeing persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where the Rohingya are seen as illegal migrants. It was already home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya before the latest crisis.

The run-up to the Feb. 9-25 Olympics has been overshadowed by the escalating crisis on the Korean peninsula triggered by North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile tests but organisers said the Games would be safe.

The traditional ceremony, introduced for the first time ahead of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, did not benefit this time from the Greek sun.

Light rain and clouds forced the high priestess, played by actress Katerina Lechou, to deploy Monday’s backup flame instead of the reflector used to light the flame with the sun’s rays. “Our dream of hosting the Olympic winter Games has now become a reality. Korea is only the second Asian nation to have the honour of hosting the winter Games,” Games chief Lee Hee-beom said.

“We want the international community to understand that we are committed to hosting a safe and secure Olympic winter Games.”

The ceremony inside the stadium, site of the ancient Olympics, was also attended by South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach and the President of Greece, Prokopis Pavlopoulos.

“The Olympic Games are sacred and universal,” Bach said. “They stand above and beyond all the differences that divide us. In our fragile world that seems to be drifting apart, the Olympic Games have the power to unite humanity in all its diversity.”

Former Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-sung, among the most successful and decorated athletes from his country, was the first South Korean to run with the torch, picking up the flame from Greece’s Nordic skier Apostolos Aggelis, the first torch-bearer, just outside the ancient stadium.

“We will make sure to show the world how we have grown up, how we can organise this sports event,” Park told reporters after his short run.

“This is bigger than Seoul (summer Olympics) 1988. These are the largest winter Olympics ever and I am excited to be part of it.” The flame is due to arrive in South Korea on Nov. 1 for the start of the domestic torch relay as organisers look to boost local enthusiasm amid low ticket sales.

Four of those taken are Filipino, and one is a Ukrainian national, according to the Philippines department of labor and Ukrainian foreign ministry.

Kidnapping for ransom is a common problem in parts of Nigeria. A number of foreigners have, in the last few years, been kidnapped in the Niger Delta, source of most of the crude oil which is Nigeria’s economic mainstay.

“The vessel was attacked by pirates on early Saturday morning when it was approaching one of the ports of Nigeria,” said a spokesman for Peter Doehle Schiffahrts KG.

“Six of the crew were taken off the ship and they are now held by kidnappers in Nigeria,” he said. There were no German nationals among the kidnapped but the spokesman declined to say where those abducted were from.

Those kidnapped comprise four Filipinos, one Ukrainian and one Hungarian, officials from the countries involved told Reuters.

At the time of the statement there was no official contact with the kidnappers and the vessel had moved away from Nigerian waters with the 12 remaining crew safe, the spokesman said.

“The top priority is to try and establish contact with the kidnappers and try to have a quick and safe release of our seafarers,” he said.

“We made all the proper disclosures,” Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June.
The business plan reviewed by Reuters called for raising $5 million to $10 million over two to three years.
“I don’t really care about” using the Tezos technology, he added.","ZUG, Switzerland/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Just three months ago, a tech project called Tezos raised $232 million online in a wildly successful “initial coin offering,” in which new digital currency is parceled out to buyers. At the time, it was the most money ever raised from the public in the white-hot cryptocurrency sector.

But the venture is now in danger of falling apart because of a battle for control playing out behind the scenes, Reuters has learned.

The acrimonious dispute pits Tezos’ two young founders – Arthur and Kathleen Breitman – against Johann Gevers, the president of a Swiss foundation the couple helped establish to handle the coin offering and promote and develop the Tezos computer network.

Under Swiss law, the foundation is supposed to be independent. It holds all of the funds raised, which have mushroomed to more than $400 million in value because the contributions were made in two cryptocurrencies – bitcoin and ether – that have appreciated sharply. But the Breitmans, who still control the Tezos source code through a Delaware company, are seeking to oust the head of the foundation.

An attorney for the Breitmans sent a 46-page letter on Sunday to the two other members of the foundation’s three-person board, calling for Gevers’ prompt removal and seeking to give the couple a “substantial role” in a new structure that would limit the foundation’s responsibilities. The document accuses Gevers of “self-dealing, self-promotion and conflicts of interest.” According to Gevers, the two board members later suggested via email that he step aside for a month while they investigate.

Gevers told Reuters he is not stepping down. “As Arthur has done to others before me,” Gevers said, “this is attempted character assassination. It’s a long laundry list of misleading statements and outright lies.” He said the other two board members “are attempting an illegal coup.”

The Breitmans have been trying to control the foundation as if it were their own private entity, Gevers said, by bypassing the foundation’s legal structure and interfering with management and operations. This has resulted in costly delays in developing and launching the Tezos network and new currency, he said.

“They’re unnecessarily putting the project at risk,” he said.

In a written statement sent to Reuters, the Breitmans reiterated their accusations against Gevers and said they acted “in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.” They said their priority “remains the successful launch of the Tezos network.”

Hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake: The Tezos digital coins, called “Tezzies,” are already priced at a hefty premium in futures trading even though they don’t yet exist. The launching of the Tezos network, which will trigger the coins’ release, has been delayed. Until the network launches – and no date is set – contributors to the fundraiser will receive nothing.

Under the terms of the Tezos coin offering, there’s no guarantee participants will ever receive a single Tez. Participants agreed to accept the risk that the project “may be abandoned.” Despite the feud, Gevers said he remains committed to resolving the feud so that “this project succeeds.”

The tale of how two young entrepreneurs raised a fortune for a project barely out of the starting blocks is reported here in detail for the first time. It highlights the risks inherent in the current frenzy for ICOs, in which tech startups issue new cryptocurrencies to raise capital.

Reuters reported last month that cryptocurrency exchanges – where virtual currencies are bought, sold and stored – have become magnets for fraud and deception. More than 980,000 bitcoins – the most popular virtual currency – have been stolen since 2011. Today they would be worth about $5 billion.

Similar large sums are pouring into initial coin offerings. From January through September, ICOs generated $2.2 billion, more than three times the amount invested in similar startups by traditional venture capital firms, according to Novum Insights, a data provider.

ICOs can be a way for technology projects to raise money online to finance the development of new, open-source computer networks that aren’t necessarily looking to make a profit. Contributors receive new digital coins, or tokens, which they typically need to “pay” to access the new networks.

But the recent flurry of ICOs raising millions of dollars has attracted some dubious business propositions and outright scams, as well as speculators looking to trade the coins for swift gains. Authorities in the United States, Switzerland, China, Singapore and other nations have begun scrutinizing the sector closely for potentially tougher regulation.

“Most ICOs are bought by people looking to ‘flip’ their tokens to a greater fool for a quick profit,” said Alistair Milne, a co-founder of the London-based Altana Digital Currency Fund, which so far has avoided ICOs. More than “90 percent will fall to have a near-zero value in time,” he predicted.

The new cryptocurrencies function through a technology called blockchain, essentially a public ledger maintained by a network of computers. Blockchain applications are being tested by financial services firms, food suppliers, retailers and other businesses as a way to make record-keeping simpler and cheaper. Tezos aims to be a blockchain that’s more reliable than the ones behind bitcoin and ether. Several entrepreneurs and investors in the blockchain industry said the Tezos technology has potential because it would be easier to upgrade and may be more secure than other blockchains.

ANARCHO-CAPITALISM

The son of Jean-Claude Deret, a French playwright and actor, Arthur Breitman studied applied mathematics, computer science and physics in France, before moving to the United States and studying financial mathematics at New York University. He went on to work for the investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

He is still listed as a co-organizer and “dear leader” for the New York Anarcho-Capitalist Meetup in New York, which describes its philosophy as “a type of radical libertarianism that favors the abundant wealth production, rapid technological development, and high standards of living produced by capitalism.” Its website adds, “We are also fairly lazy about fighting the state.”

It was at a crypto-anarchist lunch in 2010 that Breitman first met Kathleen McCaffrey, an American college student from New Jersey. She is described on a political blog called The Politicizer as a libertarian Republican who first became interested in politics after listening to the provocative radio personality Rush Limbaugh at the age of five. She married Breitman in 2013.

Kathleen Breitman, now 27, later worked at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and at R3, a blockchain company. In a July post on the conservative website legalinsurrection.com, she said she “didn’t get along” at the hedge fund but had “a great time” at R3.

Bridgewater didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Arthur Breitman, 35, was an early fan of bitcoin, which first appeared around 2009. But he came to believe there were flaws in the blockchains behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, finding them hard to upgrade and not secure. He tried to come up with something better.

In the summer of 2014, while working at Morgan Stanley in quantitative finance, Breitman released two papers online that presented his concept for a new type of blockchain. He called it Tezos, a name his wife has said he coined after creating an algorithm that searched for the names of unclaimed websites pronounceable in English.

The papers were published under a pseudonym, “L. M Goodman,” but emails and messages from Arthur Breitman reviewed by Reuters make it clear he was the author.

In an email Breitman sent to an acquaintance in early 2015, he said he was seeking to create a business based on Tezos but was trying not to be associated publicly with the project at the time. He expressed worry that his activities might conflict with his employment at Morgan Stanley, messages show.

Reuters reviewed a copy of a “Tezos Business Plan” from early 2015, which listed Breitman as chief executive. The plan projected that if the company survived 15 years, it would be worth between $2 billion and $20 billion. The budget called for paying Breitman $212,180 in salary by year three. In August 2015, Breitman, who was still working at Morgan Stanley, set up a company in Delaware called Dynamic Ledger Solutions Inc, or DLS, to develop Tezos. He listed himself as chief executive.

The U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) requires registered securities professionals to provide prior written notice to their employer to conduct outside business activities if there is “reasonable expectation of compensation.” According to FINRA records, Breitman was registered and did not report any “other business activities.” Morgan Stanley and FINRA declined to comment.

“We made all the proper disclosures,” Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June. “It was a hobby, you know. And like there was never any intention to really commercialize any of the software.” She added: “We had some meetings with like C-suite executives at banks ... but honestly nothing serious.”

“A TERRIBLE SALESMAN”

In 2015, Arthur Breitman was pitching “Tezos Inc.” in the hope of creating a consortium of four to five banks to adopt the technology and fund the operation. The business plan reviewed by Reuters called for raising $5 million to $10 million over two to three years.

By then, blockchain was beginning to pique the interest of large financial institutions for its potential to help cut costs of cumbersome back-office processes, such as the clearing and settlement of securities trades. Tezos’ 37-page business plan called it “an Internet for financial transactions” and said the technology could be used to automate the over-the-counter derivatives trading market.

But Breitman failed to attract backers. He told Reuters in June that he blamed his fundraising failures on the decision to develop the technology first, rather than just selling “a dream” as other blockchain startups were doing.

“I guess I was a terrible salesman as well,” he said.

“I can speak to that,” his wife said.

In April 2016, Arthur left Morgan Stanley, and by that September, the Breitmans had started working on a new strategy for Tezos – to conduct an online fundraiser to distribute digital tokens, whose holders would maintain the Tezos blockchain. But the couple needed funds to keep the project going.

Over the next six months, they received $612,000 from 10 early backers, including several cryptocurrency hedge funds, according to the Tezos.com website.

To conduct the ICO, the Breitmans chose a complex structure. Earlier this year, they helped to create a foundation based in Zug, Switzerland – dubbed “Crypto Valley” because of its many blockchain startups – that is seeking not-for-profit status, emails show. The idea, according to documents on the Tezos website, was that the foundation would raise money via the ICO, then acquire DLS, the Breitman-controlled company that has been developing Tezos.

Working through a Swiss foundation, the Breitmans thought, would provide regulatory oversight but not too much. Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June that she and her husband opted to use a foundation based in Zug because Switzerland has “a regulatory authority that had a sufficient amount of oversight but not like anything too crazy.”

Georg von Schnurbein, co-author of a book on Swiss foundation governance, expressed surprise over cryptocurrency ventures like Tezos setting up not-for-profit foundations in Switzerland. “For me, the public interest is not clear,” he said. While not illegal, he said, creating a foundation with the aim of allowing inventors to profit from a sale conflicted with its status as a not-for-profit, which is supposed to benefit the public. He said federal regulators eventually might prohibit it.

“The issue that there is some kind of for-profit entity and there are transfers right at the beginning is something that is working at the moment, but won’t be sustainable,” he said.

“EXAGGERATED, TO SAY THE LEAST”

As work continued for the ICO, which was originally scheduled to be held in May, the project started running out of cash, Kathleen Breitman told Reuters. She spoke with Tim Draper, the well-known founding partner of Silicon Valley venture capital firm DFJ and a staunch bitcoin supporter. He invested $1.5 million through his firm, Draper Associates, which included taking a minority stake in DLS, the company that controls the Tezos source code.

The Breitmans had also hired Strange Brew Strategies, a U.S. communications company, to promote their project, and Reuters wrote a news story on May 5 about Draper’s involvement.

In pitching the story to Reuters, John O‘Brien, a principal of Strange Brew, had made claims about Tezos’ progress. He wrote: “The applications of Tezos, ranging from derivatives settlement to micro-insurance, are real and recognized by industry giants. Ernst & Young, Deloitte, LexiFi, etc. have adopted Tezos in their development environments and labs.”

On Oct. 3, a spokeswoman for the accounting firm Ernst & Young told Reuters: “The statement is not correct. EY has not adopted Tezos.” A spokesman for Deloitte said Tezos’ code is “one of many technologies we’re considering” with blockchain, but it’s “still early stage and we haven’t used the technology for a client project.”

Jean-Marc Eber, CEO of the French software company LexiFi, said, “The sentence, as stated, isn’t accurate and unfortunately exaggerated, to say the least.” While there had been “informal contacts,” he said, “at this stage, LexiFi has not adopted Tezos’ technology in its development environment or labs.”

Strange Brew declined to answer questions about the statement.

INVESTMENT OR DONATION?

The Tezos fundraiser began on July 1. The Breitmans had wide-ranging expectations about how much they might raise. A document on Tezos.com suggested that if they received more than $20 million, they might use it to “negotiate with a small nation-state” to adopt Tezzies, or acquire mainstream print and TV media outlets to promote the technology. In June, Kathleen Breitman told Reuters that about a year ago, when the price of bitcoin was lower, “we were like, ‘Hey, we would be lucky if we get 20 million.'”

When it ended after 13 days, the project received about 66,000 bitcoins and 361,000 ethers, worth about $232 million at the time. The hoard is now worth about twice that.

Kathleen Breitman told Reuters that participating in the Tezos fundraiser was like contributing to a public television station and receiving “a tote bag” in return. “That’s kind of the same thing here,” she said.

The fundraiser’s terms called the contributions “a non-refundable donation” and not a “speculative investment.”

If deemed a donation, and not a security, the funds raised might not fall under the remit of financial regulators in the United States. In the U.S., investments in assets such as company shares and other securities are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC has been studying ICOs, and in July issued an investor bulletin that warned: “Depending on the facts and circumstances of each individual ICO, the virtual coins or tokens that are offered or sold may be securities.”

Part of the SEC’s assessment is to examine the reasonable expectations of participants in the ICO. Some participants in the Tezos fundraiser told Reuters they viewed the coins at least partly as an investment.

Kevin Zhou, co-founder of the cryptocurrency trading fund Galois Capital, said he invested about five bitcoins in Tezos, which he considers overall one of the better ICOs.

“For me and for a lot of people this is an investment. We are looking for a return,” Zhou said. “I don’t really care about” using the Tezos technology, he added.

Draper told Reuters that cryptocurrencies are commodities like pork bellies, and characterized acquiring Tezzies as a purchase rather than a donation. Asked this month how much he donated during the Tezos fundraiser, he replied via email, “You mean how much I bought? A lot.”

“TOTAL MENSCH”

At the moment, the Tezos Foundation holds all of the fundraising proceeds, while the Breitmans, through their Delaware company, control much of Tezos’ intellectual property. The plan is for the foundation to acquire the Breitmans’ company and release the technology under a free software license, according a “Transparency Memo” on the Tezos website.

Gevers, who founded the Tezos Foundation, said it has a contract that stipulates the Breitmans will either sell the Delaware company to the foundation “within a reasonable point of time” or, if they don‘t, “the foundation can take it.” He declined to provide a copy of the contract.

When the foundation will acquire the Breitmans’ company remains unclear. Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June, “Essentially, you know, they’re going to buy out the company in like July or so, I guess.”

The Breitmans stand to receive millions of dollars if the deal goes through. According to the “Transparency Memo,” the new blockchain “must launch and operate successfully” for three months, then DLS’s shareholders – the Breitmans and Draper – are entitled to receive 8.5 percent of the fundraiser proceeds in cash. That amount, according to Gevers, is about $19.7 million. The shareholders also are slated to receive another 10 percent of the Tezzies issued, with the coin distribution spread out over four years. Those coins currently are worth about $140 million in futures trading.

Prior to the fundraiser, Kathleen Breitman effused about Gevers, 52, a Zug-based South African entrepreneur who has never before run a foundation. During an “Ask Me Anything” session in May on an online chat channel, she posted: “He’s awesome. Total mensch and very philosophically committed to our project.”

Relations later soured. The Breitmans objected to people the foundation suggested it wanted to hire, Gevers said. Another sticking point: The couple’s company hasn’t relinquished control over the foundation’s own website, www.tezos.ch.

“They control the foundation’s domains, websites and email servers, so the foundation has no control or confidentiality in its own communications,” Gevers said.

The Breitmans officially have no role at the Tezos Foundation. The letter from their lawyer this week proposed the creation of two foundation subsidiaries – Tezos AG and Tezos France SA – to develop and support Tezos, with the Breitmans serving as chief executive and chief technology officer of Tezos AG. The couple also would be given “observer status” on the foundation board. The foundation would then “limit” its activities to supervising and supporting the subsidiaries, “rather than conducting any direct operations.”

According to von Schnurbein, under Swiss law “the foundation is completely independent and the foundation board is completely independent.” Gevers said the foundation wants the couple to continue playing a leading advisory role. “They are both very competent people and obviously they started this whole thing. And it would be stupid to exclude them.”

But he added: “You can rest assured as long as I have anything to do with this, the foundation will be independent.”

Gevers said he has filed a complaint with Swiss regulators about the request he received via email this week from the foundation’s two other board members that he step down from the board for a month. A spokesman for Switzerland’s Federal Department of Home Affairs, which oversees the agency that supervises foundations, told Reuters that asking a board member to step aside must be done at a board meeting, not via email. The two board members who emailed Gevers didn’t respond to a request for comment.

As for the hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrencies raised in the ICO, Gevers said the foundation has slowly begun selling the virtual currencies – lately about $10.2 million worth a week – and plans to invest the proceeds in a diverse portfolio. The funds are intended to be used to run the foundation, ensure Tezos works and help to develop products using the technology.

So where are all the bitcoins and ethers raised in the ICO stored? That, Gevers said, was confidential.

“These are not held in any one place,” he said, “but secured through high-security” digital wallets “that no single party has control over.”",Special Report: Backroom battle imperils $230 million cryptocurrency venture,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitcoin-funding-tezos-specialreport/special-report-backroom-battle-imperils-230-million-cryptocurrency-venture-idUSKBN1CN35K

>> This is Halima Aden, the first supermodel in a hijab to strut the catwalk at New York and Milan fashion weeks. Aden was the highlight of a modest fashion show held in London over the weekend, featuring seven designers from Oman, Morocco, Britain and Indonesia. The collections were focused on modest wear.

Clothes that cover most of the body and cater primarily to the fashion conscious Muslim woman.>> Muslim women love fashion. If you go the streets of Dubai, it would not be uncommon to see a CHANEL bag associated with the Hijab, so it's just a matter of now incorporating Muslim women on the cat walks.

The 20 year old supermodel is a former refugee born in Kakuma, a United Nations refugee camp in Kenya. She came to the United States when she was seven years old. Aden made headlines as the first hijab and burkini sporting contestant to take part in the Miss Minnesota USA pageant.

The bold move catapulted her career to new heights, involving many firsts, including being the first hijabi signed by a major modeling agency. Members of the audience said this modest fashion show brought great meaning to them.>> It was great to see. It's nice too see a top model with hijab in such a diverse way.

Again in London it's great.>> In the past two years, the hijab has gone mainstream with Muslim consumers spending on clothing estimated at 243 billion in 2015 or 11% of the global total on apparel according to a report by Thomson Reuters. Jumping on the trend, luxury label Dolce and Gabbana, which released a line of hijabs and abayas last year.",Supermodel celebrates hijab during 'modest' fashion show,https://www.reuters.tv/v/aBg/2017/10/24/supermodel-celebrates-hijab-during-modest-fashion-show

Embora a ideia de os líderes catalães fugirem da Espanha e criarem redes clandestinas no exterior ainda pareça remota, apoiadores franceses da independência catalã não estão correndo riscos. Eles dizem ter 52 casas e apartamentos disponíveis na fronteira com a Espanha.

“Está tudo pronto. Temos a logística para acomodar cerca de 200 pessoas por enquanto, e mais se necessário”, disse Robert Casanovas, ativista e diretor do Comitê de Autodeterminação da Catalunha do Norte -- a área catalã francesa.

Milhares de falantes de catalão moram na fronteira com a França, principalmente na região do leste dos Pireneus, ao longo do litoral do Mediterrâneo, um território cedido pela Espanha à França no século 17.

No final dos anos 1930, autoridades catalãs de primeiro escalão buscaram refúgio do ditador militar espanhol Francisco Franco em solo francês.

Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 .FTSE index ended flat at 7,526.54 points and mid caps .FTMC fell 0.1 percent.

“Away from politics, it’s been quiet on the Brexit front, so I think British investors are looking more at earnings season,” said Henry Croft, research analyst at Accendo Markets. Upcoming results from banks will be closely watched, he added.

Results weighed on Whitbread’s (WTB.L) shares which dropped 4.8 percent to bottom of the index.

While the hotel and coffee shop operator saw a rise in first-half profit, analysts were concerned around signs of an impact from last year’s Brexit vote on the business.

“We remain attracted to the long-term growth prospects for Whitbread, but acknowledge that the potential woes for UK businesses and consumers due to Brexit will make for a bumpy ride,” analysts at Berenberg said in a note.

On the positive side, Antofagasta (ANTO.L), up 2.8 percent, was the biggest gainer among commodity stocks after Barclays raised its price target on the stock.

Shares in RSA Insurance (RSA.L) rose as much as 2 percent after JP Morgan raised its rating on the stock to “overweight” from “neutral”.

“RSA has underperformed in recent months and in our view its valuation again looks attractive,” analysts at JP Morgan said in a note, adding that they believe the pricing backdrop in commercial lines may improve after recent natural catastrophes.

“This statement is made given the public interest in these matters.”

The announcement follows a letter from Nicky Morgan, chair of the House of Commons’ Treasury Committee to the watchdog, asking if Equifax had violated terms of its license to operate in the country, and whether the regulator had the power to compel the company to provide compensation to UK consumers.

Equifax said it was already working closely with the FCA and other authorities.

“We welcome this opportunity to learn the lessons from this criminal cyber-attack in order for all businesses to better protect consumers in the future,” the company said in a statement.

Rosa Weber atendeu a um pedido da Rede Sustentabilidade, que sustentou que a norma tinha o “inconfessável propósito” de inviabilizar uma das mais importantes políticas públicas, a de combate ao trabalho escravo.

Numa dura peça, o partido havia apontado em sua petição que a portaria foi uma das “mais abjetas barganhas” da história do país. “Trocou-se a impunidade na escravidão pela impunidade na corrupção”, criticou.

A Rede cita o fato de que a bancada ruralista no Congresso --setor sempre crítico à legislação sobre o tema-- é numerosa e coesa, tornando-se essencial para o presidente Michel Temer, especialmente no momento em que tramita na Câmara dos Deputados uma segunda denúncia criminal contra ele.

“Assim, certamente não foi por mera coincidência a edição, nesse exato momento, da malsinada Portaria do Ministério do Trabalho nº 1.129/2017, que, se cumprida, praticamente destruirá a política pública brasileira de combate ao trabalho escravo”, afirmou o partido.

A ministra também contestou a exigência de ato prévio do ministro do Trabalho para divulgar a chamada “lista suja” do trabalho escravo.

“Vale ressaltar que, a persistir a produção de efeitos do ato normativo atacado, o Estado brasileiro não apenas se expõe à responsabilização jurídica no plano internacional, como pode vir a ser prejudicado nas suas relações econômicas internacionais, inclusive no âmbito do Mercosul, por traduzir, a utilização de mão de obra escrava, forma de concorrência desleal”, afirmou a ministra.

Siemens confirmed it had awarded so-called global coordinator mandates to banks to float the maker of medical equipment such as x-ray and MRI machines, but declined to name them. The banks declined to comment.

The share offering could be one of the largest by a German company in years. Analysts say the unit, the biggest contributor to Siemens’ third-quarter profit with a 9 percent increase to 579 million euros ($681 million), could be valued at up to 40 billion euros.

The stock market listing could take place in early summer next year, one of the sources said, adding the venue had not been decided, though New York, where several medical technology stocks are listed, is seen as having an edge over Frankfurt.

“The equity story of Healthineers will likely be that of a low-growth, low-risk dividend play with high, guaranteed dividends,” a person familiar with the company said.

Siemens is not in immediate need of cash and maximizing the proceeds is not the key target of the planned deal, people close to the matter said. They added that the size of the share sale may be rather small, and one said it may not exceed 20 percent.

The trains-to-turbines group wants Healthineers to have its own currency for acquisitions and investments as the global healthcare market shifts focus from Siemens’ core business of imaging to molecular diagnosis and patient self-management.

“An IPO of the Healthineers unit would enable Siemens to do share deals when looking at future acquisitions”, one of the people said.

Analysts have mentioned peers such as Varian (VAR.N), Hologic (HOLX.O), Agilent (A.N) and Accuray (ARAY.O) as potential takeover targets.

Siemens said in August that its long-awaited healthcare unit listing would come only next year and would take place in the first half of 2018.

With roots that go back to Thomas Edison’s electric-light company in the 1870s, GE was one of 12 companies selected by Dow Jones when it created its market indicator in 1896. While some, like the American Cotton Oil Co and the National Lead Co, have long since faded into history, GE became a symbol of American industrial prowess. It began electrifying the railways in the 1890s, built the first U.S. jet engine in 1941 and supplied the silicon for Neil Armstrong’s moon boots. Under Jack Welch, it was an avatar of America’s economic revival in the 1980s and 1990s, and became the world’s most valuable company at the turn of the century.

The conglomerate has underperformed for years, though, despite shedding its appliance and finance divisions and making big bets on power and energy. GE shares have produced a total return of minus 2 percent a year for the past 10 years, according to Eikon data, far behind the Dow’s 8.4 percent annualized gain. The stock accounts for just 0.7 percent of the benchmark, well behind Apple’s 4.6 percent and Boeing’s leading 7.7 percent.

The Dow is an oddity as the only major price-weighted U.S. market tracker, and for years GE has had one of the lower weights. There is no minimum weighting required, and the boffins at S&P Dow Jones Indices may be reluctant to drop the oldest constituent, especially as today’s average contains few actual industrial companies. Yet the stock has already broken an unwritten rule that the ratio of the highest- to the lowest-priced stock should be 10 to 1.

GE still boasted a $206 billion market cap by Friday’s close, the 19th largest among U.S. companies, and exclusion from the Dow wouldn’t necessarily trigger massive selling because most indexed funds track broad indexes like the S&P 500. But it’s telling that telecoms group AT&T has underperformed the Dow by 23 percentage points since it was removed to make way for Apple two years ago. Flannery is already considering slashing the dividend to husband resources.

U.S. President Donald Trump broke ranks with other major powers this month by refusing to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the deal, even though international inspectors say it is.

Jubeir said the nuclear deal had shortcomings, and that he agreed with Trump’s assessment that Iran was working to destabilise the region and was funding militant organisations.

Following Trump’s decision, U.S. Congress has until mid-December to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact.

Jubeir said that new sanctions on Iran would be welcome, and that a delay could mean that by the time sanctions had impact, Iran could have already developed “a dozen” nuclear bombs.

“The international community needs to support those (sanctions) in order to send a very strong message to Iran that your behaviour, your nefarious activities, have consequences,” Jubeir said.

Ironically, the government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would have done better to simply ignore the non-binding referendum. It was always likely to produce a vote for independence, if only because those who favored it were far more likely to vote. Broader opinion polls conducted before the weekend ballot never showed majority support for independence, and most estimates suggest it has been ebbing steadily since 2013 to around 40 percent.

The scale of the violence this weekend and the brutality of the national police attempts to stop the ballot – almost 900 injured, according to local authorities – has changed everything. While the referendum was expected to be a polarizing event, the Spanish authorities have now effectively guaranteed it will be seen as a defining moment not just for Catalonia but the country at large. It would be astounding if it did not yield a substantial spike in separatist feeling. In a single day, the Rajoy government may have taken what should have been a manageable issue and escalated it into an existential challenge for Spain.

Catalonia’s governor Carles Puigdemont could always have been hoping to declare independence in the aftermath of the ballot. The widely reported violence, however, delivers a degree of political legitimacy to that fact. That doesn’t mean Spain will necessarily fracture – but it does dramatically increase the chances of that happening in the longer run.

A Spanish break-up will have broad implications for a continent that has spent much of the last decade bouncing from crisis to crisis, but had been having a better year than many U.S. and British pundits had anticipated. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both bested far-right challenges in national elections, growth is improving in eurozone economies and the refugee crisis appears to have stabilized.

Events in Spain, however, are a stark reminder that almost every European country remains trapped in a slow-burning political crisis with an ever-growing chance of unusual, unorthodox and outright aggressive nationalist or radical politics eroding the center ground.

In France, the National Front is clearly poised to take advantage of the faltering popularity of Macron, who defeated far-right leader Marine LePen in May. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in a strong third in last week’s election, and is now in parliament for the first time. The festering sore of Brexit continues to raise a host of challenges for both the EU and Britain, while Greece, Italy and Spain continue to struggle economically despite strong broader European growth.

So far, European nations are struggling to work out what their position should be with Spain. For all the public criticism of what is clearly seen as an unnecessarily heavy-handed Spanish clampdown, few European leaders have been willing to criticize Rajoy in public. Behind closed doors, however, the message will almost certainly be that the weekend’s scenes cannot be repeated.

Spain is not the only European country with separatist regions, and that will certainly be little appetite for a wider upswing in the regional nationalism. Just as serious, however, is the way events in Spain reinvigorate the wider European narrative of crisis.

Already, the euro was trading slightly lower on Monday on the news. Russian broadcasters and social media feeds – always keen to jump on anything that undermines the European political mainstream – gave front-page coverage to the news of riot police using rubber bullets and batons to stop the Catalonia vote. Wider international attention can be expected to continue, potentially exacerbating political polarization at every step.

Rajoy’s government is in a tricky situation. It must realize that more heavy-handed use of law enforcement will simply strengthen the separatist cause. Unlike more authoritarian states, Spain does not have the option of bludgeoning dissent into the ground. But nor can it afford to ignore events in Catalonia, for fear the now-heightened momentum behind the pro-independence movement grows still further.

The most obvious solution would be to offer Catalonians more regional autonomy. So far, however, there are few signs of that – and Rajoy’s early statements praising the police response and denying that the referendum has any legal force look set to aggravate tensions rather than ameliorate them.",Commentary: Spain's missteps supercharge the Catalonia crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-catalonia-commentary/commentary-spains-missteps-supercharge-the-catalonia-crisis-idUSKCN1C724O

A couple of miles (km) from the bustling Otay Mesa border crossing in San Diego, eight towering chunks of concrete and steel stand as high as 30 feet (9 meters) tall against the sky, possible models for what Trump has promised will one day be a solid wall extending the full length of the southern border, from California to Texas.

Whether any of the eight different prototypes, constructed over the last month, become part of an actual wall remains highly uncertain.

The U.S. Congress has so far shown little interest in appropriating the estimated $21.6 billion it would cost to build the wall.

Still, border patrol officials on Monday welcomed the momentum on Trump’s pledge, which generated a groundswell of voter support that helped elect him to office.

“Our current infrastructure is well over two decades old,” Roy Villareal, deputy chief patrol agent of the U.S. Border Patrol’s San Diego sector, said during a tour with media organizations on Monday morning. “Is there need for improvement? Absolutely.”

Currently, 654 miles (1,052 km) of the 1,900-mile (3,058-km)border with Mexico is fenced, with single, double or triple fences. The second line of fencing in San Diego, about 18 feet (5.50 m) tall, has been breached nearly 2,000 times in the last three years, Villareal said.

Even if Trump’s wall never gets funded, Villareal said, the border patrol might incorporate one or more of the new wall designs as it replaces worn sections of the existing fence.

Six contractors from across the country were selected to build the eight prototypes, all of which will be completed this week.

The builders paid attention to aesthetics in their bid to win lucrative contracts. One wall segment features deep-blue steel and another has a brick facade, standing in sharp contrast to the area’s existing border fence, a ramshackle structure of corrugated steel left over from the Vietnam War.

In late November, a private company, which border patrol officials declined to name, will begin a 30- to 60-day process of testing the wall prototypes to determine how easy they would be to climb over or dig beneath.

The final selection could be a combination of the prototype designs, Villareal said.

While solid, concrete walls have a daunting presence, they might have an adverse effect on some border patrol activities, since agents would not be able to see potential crossers approaching the wall.

“It’s not so much the size of the wall, it’s the ability to see whether it’s 10 people or 30 people with ... rifles,” said Rowdy Adams, a former border patrol agent who left the agency in 2011 after 30 years. “It’s important to see that and set your response plan in place.”

Two of the eight prototypes have a see-through design.

Environmentalists have warned that a solid wall would prevent wildlife, including a dwindling population of federally protected ocelots, from crossing.

A concrete wall may also prove challenging to build without participation from some of the world’s largest concrete suppliers.

Facebook has its European headquarters in Ireland and has argued that only the Irish data protection authority has the power to police it for its processing of Europeans’ data. Nonetheless other European privacy regulators, including the French, Belgian and German authorities, have taken action against the U.S. company.

Yves Bot, advocate general at the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), said in a non-binding opinion that any national authority could take action against a company for breaching data protection laws in the context of its activities in the country, even if the company is established in another member state.

The case stems from a dispute about a German fan page on Facebook which collected data on visitors to that page by storing a cookie on their hard drive.

A German court asked the ECJ whether a German data protection authority had jurisdiction over Facebook given its Irish subsidiary Facebook Ireland was responsible for its data processing activities in Europe.

Bot said that since the data processing at issue via the installation of cookies “is specifically intended to enable Facebook better to target the advertisements which it publishes,” it could be considered as being part of the activities undertaken by Facebook Germany, which is responsible for the promotion and sale of advertising space in Germany.

A spokeswoman for Facebook said: “We respectfully disagree with the Advocate General and await the European Court’s decision.”

Opinions from Advocate Generals tend to be followed by the Court’s judges in a majority of cases. A final ruling should follow in the coming months.

A new EU data protection law will come into force in May next year which seeks to make life easier for multinational businesses like Facebook by introducing a “one stop shop” principle whereby they would only have to deal with the authority in the member state of their main establishment.

But Bot pointed out that the new law was not yet in effect and the current framework enables each member state to apply its own national legislation, thereby making the “application of multiple national legislations possible”.",Facebook dealt setback by EU court adviser in privacy dispute,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-court-facebook/facebook-dealt-setback-by-eu-court-adviser-in-privacy-dispute-idUSKBN1CT2BF?il=0

Les Pixel 2 et 2XL, lancés jeudi au prix de départ de 649 dollars, sont à la pointe de l‘offensive lancée par Google pour concurrencer l‘iPhone d‘Apple.

Google a dit dimanche qu‘il voulait déterminer si les écrans du Pixel 2 étaient affectés par un problème de rétention de l‘image, à la suite des informations publiées par le blog AndroidCentral après une semaine d‘utilisation du combiné.

Cette rétention (dite “burn-in”) n‘apparaît habituellement qu‘après plusieurs années d‘usage.

Google devra sans doute arrêter la production s‘il y a un problème, a dit Ryan Reith, analyste du consultant IDC.

“Nous prenons très au sérieux toute information relative à un problème et nos ingénieurs enquêtent très rapidement”, a déclaré à Reuters Mario Queiroz, vice-président de Google chargé des produits Pixel. “Nous en dirons plus dès que nous aurons des données pertinentes”.

Google avait dit auparavant qu‘il pourrait implanter un nouveau logiciel après que des utilisateurs eurent fait état d‘un reflet bleu sur l‘écran de 6 pouces du Pixel 2XL.

Zhou Xiaochuan, head of the People’s Bank of China, grabbed headlines by warning on Thursday of a possible “Minsky moment.” His reference to a potential financial and economic crash follows other urgent calls for reform in recent days. The comments seem aimed at burnishing his legacy, as well as trying to ensure a like-minded successor fills his shoes.

Zhou is quiet, even by his profession’s standards, and usually grants interviews only when he needs to calm markets. Yet on Oct. 9, Caijin magazine published a rare interview in which the central banker made a strikingly direct call for a more open capital account. At a panel on Sunday in Washington, D.C., he stressed the need to tackle the country’s $18 trillion in corporate debt. And on Thursday, he talked at length about leverage and financial risks on the sidelines of the Communist Party Congress.

The 69-year-old governor is expected to step down soon and would no doubt like to burnish his legacy as a reformer who has worked to liberalize China’s markets and open them up to foreign investors. His most tangible accomplishment came last year when the International Monetary Fund included the yuan in its basket of reserve currencies, the Special Drawing Right.

His warning might also be an effort to buy some reputational insurance – a case of “I told you so” if a mounting debt burden causes the economy to shudder. In context, his recent speeches are even-handed. But Zhou has been at this game for 15 years. He must know that merely using the term Minsky moment, or saying the country can never have an open economy with a tightly controlled currency, will resound all the more during the most sensitive time of China’s political calendar.

Top officials are in Beijing for the Communist Party Congress, a once-in-five-years gathering where they will likely discuss Zhou’s successor as well as the remit and personnel of bureaucracies overseeing the financial system. The governor’s remarks all but ensure that the case for reform will be top of mind during these closed-door discussions, and might even tip the balance toward someone in his mold succeeding him as governor.

Perez said that, if he did make an inquiry, Tottenham would value Kane at 250 million euros ($295 million), which would be a world-record transfer fee.

“(But) I haven’t thought about signing Kane. We are happy with (Karim) Benzema and the rest of the team,” Perez told radio station Cadena COPE on Tuesday.

Parts of Real’s forward line have been misfiring this season, while 24-year-old Kane’s red-hot start to the 2017/18 campaign has seen him score 17 times in 16 games for club and country.

That has put him in the frame to be the next Spurs star to join the Champions League holders, with Croatia’s Luka Modric and Welshman Gareth Bale having made the switch from North London to Madrid in recent seasons.

Speculation was fuelled further last week when Real’s former president Ramon Calderon said he expected the club to try to sign Kane to extend their current cycle at the summit of European football.

Kane failed to find the net in Tottenham’s 1-1 Champions League draw with Real in Madrid on Oct. 17. The England striker will have another chance when the teams meet again at Wembley on Nov. 1.

The bill would scrap a constitutional age cap preventing President Yoweri Museveni, 73 and in power for 31 years, from standing in the next election. It is likely to pass, given the ruling party’s majority, when it is voted on later this year.

A staunch ally of Western powers, Museveni is widely seen as an anchor of stability in the often volatile Great Lakes region after decades of violent Ugandan dictators. Critics say he has evolved into just another African strongman using corrupt and ruthless tactics to retain power for life.

Parliamentary spokesman Chris Obore said the one-off payment had been released to the legislators’ bank accounts this week.

“It’s to help them to consult with their constituents on this bill,” he told Reuters.

MPs are among Uganda’s best-paid public servants; their monthly remuneration of about $5,900 already includes expenses for regular travel to their constituencies to consult with voters.

But low-paid public employees like teachers, police and health workers often do not see their salaries paid on time - typical delays can run to three months. Public hospitals are often missing important drugs.

Public anger over waste and corruption is growing, and protests have erupted in different parts of Uganda gainst the bill. Security forces have responded by using tear gas and live bullets to suppress the demonstrations.

Dozens of people have been arrested and two have died in the protests.

At the moment, Museveni cannot run for re-election in 2021 because the existing constitution bars candidates aged above 75 years of age. He backs the private member’s bill, introduced in parliament last month, that seeks to scrap the age cap.

The amendment, which critics say will clear the way for Museveni to rule for the rest of his life, has met broad resistance from some ruling party supporters, opposition, religious leaders and rights activists.

“This is an outright bribe,” John Baptist Nambeshe, one of the MPs opposed to the bill, told Reuters. “To claim that it’s a normal parliamentary facilitation - it defeats logic.”

In total, the East African country is spending about 13 billion shillings ($3.55 million) to facilitate consultations on the bill by 445 legislators, Obore said.

In 2005, MPs were also offered a one-off payment of five million shillings to consult on a draft bill that removed a two-term cap on incumbency from the constitution, allowing Museveni to stand again. Each term is five years.

That was the only other occasion MPs have been paid to consult on a specific bill, and it also attracted wide criticism as a thinly-disguised bribe. The bill was passed.","Ugandan MPs get $8,000 each for work on extending president's rule: spokesman",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CT1FU-OZATP

The results are the first since Vishal Sikka quit as chief executive in August after a long row between the board and the company founders that frazzled investors and saw the return of Nandan Nilekani, a co-founder and a former CEO, as chairman.

Nilekani had said at the time he would prioritise finding a CEO, reconstituting the board and shaping future strategy. The company said the search for a new CEO is “progressing well” and it plans to stay the course on its future strategy.

“The management team along with the board of directors undertook a comprehensive review of our strategy ... Our current strategy continues to be relevant and we just need to accelerate the execution,” said U.B. Pravin Rao, interim CEO.

The Infosys board also reaffirmed that an internal investigation into alleged improprieties related to the acquisition of automation firm Panaya found no evidence of wrongdoing.

The company also said it would not make all findings of the investigation public. This drew criticism from some, who felt it leaves investors in the dark, especially as the founders, led by Narayana Murthy had faulted Sikka and former chair R. Seshasayee for not releasing all the findings previously.

“Investors will be left wondering as to the reasons why there was a need for a change of board in August,” said Shriram Subramanian, founder of shareholder advisory firm InGovern.

Sikka, Seshasayee and two others resigned from the board in August, ending a protracted battle with the founders, who accused the board of corporate governance lapses.

OUTLOOK CUT

Infosys cut its expected full-year revenue growth to 5.5 percent-6.5 percent in constant currency, compared with its previous guidance of a 6.5-8.5 percent increase.

Profit after tax rose 3.3 percent to 37.26 billion rupees ($573 million) in the second quarter, beating the average analysts’ estimate of 35.23 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Bengaluru-based Infosys said its revenue from operations rose 1.5 percent to 175.67 billion rupees in the second quarter. Revenue from the financial services segment rose marginally to 47.18 billion rupees.

Harit Shah, research analyst at Reliance Securities, said he had expected a trimming in the revenue growth forecast but had hoped for a smaller cut.

“The churn of top management and these board-related issues could have meant an impact in terms of clients freezing their programmes,” said Shah.

Infosys’s ADRs were trading down 3.5 percent at 1550 GMT after earlier dipping nearly 5 percent.

The world’s biggest optical lenses manufacturer, also confirmed its 2017 outlook after posting stronger third quarter revenues that were broadly in line with expectations.

The company had cut its annual revenue growth target in July, citing snags in China and Brazil, but its shares rose on Tuesday in response to higher sales and the general outlook.

Essilor Chief Operating Officer Laurent Vacherot said on a call with analysts that the group viewed the European Commission’s in-depth probe into the planned merger with Luxottica, launched last month, “with serenity and confidence”.

Chief Executive Hubert Sagnieres said in a statement Essilor planned to build on its third-quarter momentum between now and the end of this year “while also making major strides in its proposed combination with Luxottica.”

EU antitrust regulators opened a full-scale investigation into the Luxottica deal in September, saying the deal could reduce competition in the ophthalmic lenses and eyewear market. Their conclusions are expected by the end of February.

Luxottica and Essilor had declined to offer concessions during a preliminary EU review.

Vacherot told analysts substantial work had already been done on the merger.

“Authorities need time do to a quality job. The teams are very active and step by step we are preparing and progressing with confidence,” he said.

Essilor shares were up 4.21 percent at 105.25 euros at 1005 GMT, making the stock the best performer on France's benchmark CAC-40 index .FCHI.

“Performance in U.S and EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) has sequentially improved in each quarter and guidance suggests a similar development in the fourth quarter,” analysts at investment bank Jefferies wrote in a note to clients.

CREATING GLOBAL LEADER

Essilor and Luxottica, the maker of Ray-Ban sunglasses, agreed in January on a 46 billion euro ($54 billion) merger to create a global eyewear giant with annual revenue of more than 15 billion euros.

The merger has been approved by competition authorities in several countries including India, Japan and New Zealand but still needs clearance in North America and Europe.

A key regulatory concern for the EU is the possibility that the merged company might persuade opticians to buy eyewear and lenses as a package, leveraging Luxottica’s strong brand portfolio which also includes Persol as well as licensed names such as Chanel and Armani.

Competition lawyers have said that, to win clearance, the two companies may have to offer commitments to Brussels that the markets for lenses and frames will remain open to their rivals.

Given the Feb. 26 deadline set by the European Commission, the merger is not expected to be finalised before 2018 but Vacherot said the group was sticking to an initial target of closing the transaction “around the end of the year.”

Essilor said sales in the quarter ended September were up 2.5 percent on an organic basis to 1.75 billion euros. Analysts polled by Reuters had on average been expecting revenues of 1.77 billion euros.

Sales in North America were up 2.3 percent to 658 million euros despite the ravages in September of hurricanes such as Irma which led to several shop closures in the United States.

Tuesday’s approval puts into law a policy President Joko Widodo set in a decree in July. The policy was aimed at containing hardline groups who have cast a shadow over the long-standing reputation for religious tolerance in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation.

“We have seen mass organisations that are against the Pancasila (state ideology) and have created social conflict,” said Arya Bima, a lawmaker in favour of the policy. “This law doesn’t impede freedom of organisation or assembly, it strengthens it.”

In late 2016 and early this year, groups such as Hizb-ut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) and the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), which call for Islamic law to be imposed in Indonesia, led mass street rallies attacking Jakarta’s governor, a Christian, whom they accused of insulting Islam.

Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, who in April lost an election to get a new term, was jailed one month later after being convicted of blasphemy, in a court ruling widely criticised in Indonesia and overseas as unjust.

The presidential decree Widodo signed in July ordered the disbanding of all organisations deemed to be in conflict with the secular state ideology. HTI, which seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate, was the first organisation to be disbanded under the policy.

Pancasila or ‘five principles’ is Indonesia’s state ideology, which includes belief in god, the unity of the country, social justice and democracy, and which enshrines religious diversity in an officially secular system.

VIOLATION OF RIGHTS?

Under the new law, anyone who “embraces, develops of spreads ideology that is in conflict with the (state ideology) Pancasila” can face imprisonment of six months to life, according to a copy of the draft law reviewed by Reuters.

Rights activists and civil organisations have decried the move, saying it harks back to the era of authoritarian ruler Suharto, who demanded loyalty to Pancasila and took repressive measures against some opponents.

Opposition lawmaker Al Muzamil Yusuf said the new law could “violate democratic rights and remove checks and balances on the government”.

During the protest outside parliament on Tuesday, around 5,200 police and military personnel stood guard around the complex in central Jakarta.

A hashtag supporting Widodo’s policy was a top trending topic on Indonesian Twitter.

“This policy is not about (Widodo) or any political party, it’s about safeguarding the unity of the country,” said user @Senopati.",Indonesia passes law to ban organisations deemed against its ideology,https://in.reuters.com/article/indonesia-islamists/indonesia-passes-law-to-ban-organisations-deemed-against-its-ideology-idINKBN1CT1J4

Facebook has its European headquarters in Ireland and has argued that only the Irish data protection authority has the power to police it for its processing of Europeans’ data. Nonetheless other European privacy regulators, including the French, Belgian and German authorities, have taken action against the U.S. company.

Yves Bot, advocate general at the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), said in a non-binding opinion that any national authority could take action against a company for breaching data protection laws in the context of its activities in the country, even if the company is established in another member state.

The case stems from a dispute about a German fan page on Facebook which collected data on visitors to that page by storing a cookie on their hard drive.

A German court asked the ECJ whether a German data protection authority had jurisdiction over Facebook given its Irish subsidiary Facebook Ireland was responsible for its data processing activities in Europe.

Bot said that since the data processing at issue via the installation of cookies “is specifically intended to enable Facebook better to target the advertisements which it publishes,” it could be considered as being part of the activities undertaken by Facebook Germany, which is responsible for the promotion and sale of advertising space in Germany.

A spokeswoman for Facebook said: “We respectfully disagree with the Advocate General and await the European Court’s decision.”

Opinions from Advocate Generals tend to be followed by the Court’s judges in a majority of cases. A final ruling should follow in the coming months.

A new EU data protection law will come into force in May next year which seeks to make life easier for multinational businesses like Facebook by introducing a “one stop shop” principle whereby they would only have to deal with the authority in the member state of their main establishment.

But Bot pointed out that the new law was not yet in effect and the current framework enables each member state to apply its own national legislation, thereby making the “application of multiple national legislations possible”.",Facebook dealt setback by EU court adviser in privacy dispute,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CT2BF-OCATC

Gabe Kadosh, vice president at real estate firm Colliers International, said Amazon and Whole Foods “want to have freedom to do whatever they want.","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market met a new foe this summer during talks to lease a top retail space in a San Francisco mall: the Target next door.

As City Center mall’s largest tenant, Target Corp had a say over changes to the property. According to people familiar with the lease discussions, Target balked at sharing the mall with Whole Foods because it feared competition from the grocery chain’s new owner, Amazon.com Inc.

Early attempts to persuade Target failed, and Whole Foods may now have to concede certain Amazon initiatives - such as lockers where customers can pick up goods ordered online - if it wants the location, the people said. Talks are ongoing.

A Reuters examination of real estate agreements and interviews with 20 retail landlords, lawyers and brokers show that the strings attached to operating in malls like City Center present an emerging and little-scrutinized challenge to Amazon’s quest to re-shape Whole Foods.

Across the United States, large retailers including Target, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc and Best Buy Co Inc have legal rights in many lease agreements that allow them to limit what Amazon can do with nearby Whole Foods stores, and where it can open new ones.

Documents reviewed by Reuters show bans on Amazon lockers and delivery operations near a Target store in Illinois and also in Florida, where a new Whole Foods is set to open. Lockers for retrieving online orders are a way for Amazon to spur sales through the grocery chain.

In Manhattan and other locations, the leases of Whole Foods’ big box neighbors bar it from selling a range of goods that Amazon has in its massive online inventory, from electronics to toys and linens.

Even Whole Foods stores that do not share space with major rivals can face constraints imposed by local governments. A city council resolution in White Plains, New York, restricted the hours when Whole Foods can use a loading dock prior to the grocer locating in the mall.

Amazon declined to answer questions about how these restrictions across the country impact its plans.

In a statement, Target said it is “focused on what’s best for the company and delivering on the reasons our guests love Target. Our more than 1,800 stores across the country are a strategic asset and a vital part of Target’s future.”

The company did not discuss details of the restrictions reported by Reuters, but said, “It’s inaccurate to characterize lease agreements as our corporate strategy.”

Reuters could not determine the full extent of limits on Whole Foods stores because lease deals vary from mall to mall, and many are not public. While restricting how neighbors operate is a standard practice in retail, Amazon is new to feeling the heat.

Some mall owners and real estate brokers say Whole Foods will still find landlords who are eager to have the high-profile tenant driving traffic in their malls, and see rivals trying to keep Whole Foods out as short-sighted.

But with nearly all of Whole Foods’ 473 stores subject to lease agreements and plans to add up to 85 stores, according to regulatory filings, Amazon has launched into brick-and-mortar with more constraints and entrenched enemies than in the online world it dominates.

“Many people assume this big, 800-pound gorilla is going to come and beat up all of these retailers,” said Terrison Quinn, a senior vice president at brokerage SRS Real Estate Partners. “I just don’t think that’s going to be the case.”

DOZENS OF RESTRICTIONS

Amazon wasted no time in making changes when the $13.7 billion Whole Foods deal closed in August. The world’s largest online retailer cut grocery prices, started selling its Echo home speaker in stores and disclosed plans to add lockers to some locations and Whole Foods items to Prime Now, its two-hour delivery program.

Analysts expect such moves will boost online orders and revenue for Amazon. But big box rivals have a number of ways to fight back.

Retailers routinely negotiate guarantees that their landlords will not alter malls in a way that hurts sales, whether leasing to a strip club or starting construction projects without approval, real estate lawyers said.

These leases, which often last 10 to 20 years with options to renew, may even name competitors barred from opening a store.

A 16-page memo in July detailing the lease restrictions governing Miami’s Pinecrest Place mall, obtained by Reuters, offers a glimpse of the legal protections retailers are securing.

Target required an affiliate of national landlord Regency Centers Corp to bar “Any lockers, lock-boxes or other type of storage system that is used to receive or store merchandise from a catalog or online retailer.”

The document then specifies more than a dozen other restrictions for the mall, from leasing space to a pet shop or toy store to operating “a fulfillment center in connection with receiving, storing or distributing merchandise from a catalog or online retailer.”

Regency announced in April that Whole Foods will open in the center, meaning the store cannot have Amazon lockers or fulfill orders for Prime Now.

A May memo of lease for a Target in Evanston, Illinois, obtained by Reuters, contains similar prohibitions against lockers and online fulfillment.

In another case, Target raised similar concerns about Amazon for a prospective Whole Foods location at the Stonestown Galleria in San Francisco, people familiar with the matter said.

A Reuters analysis showed that 7 percent of existing Whole Foods' U.S. stores are within a quarter mile, or roughly five-minute walk, of a Target.

OPPOSITION ABOUNDS

Target is not alone in placing limits on Amazon.

Lidl, a German grocery chain expanding in the United States, said in a deal this year it would “prohibit the operation of pickup facilities” by rivals such as “Wal-Mart and Amazon... that sell grocery items” near a planned store on Long Island in New York, according to a person familiar with the matter. The language is becoming common, the person said.

Will Harwood, a spokesman for Lidl, said, “We adhere to industry norms and standard real estate practices when securing sites.”

A Bed Bath & Beyond store in lower Manhattan bars its next-door tenant - Whole Foods - from selling linens, bathroom items, housewares and frames, its memo of lease said. The company declined to comment.

And a Best Buy store just north of Miami has the exclusive right in its shopping center to sell electronics. A lease carve-out, which states other tenants can sell gadgets on less than 250 square feet of floor space, allowed for the mall’s Whole Foods to display the Echo speaker, according to a memo seen by Reuters and a reporter who visited the location.

“It is pretty standard for anchor tenants of a shopping center to reserve the right in their leases to prohibit improvements to a center - including the addition of new tenants - without approval and consent,” said Jeff Shelman, spokesman for Best Buy.

Gabe Kadosh, vice president at real estate firm Colliers International, said Amazon and Whole Foods “want to have freedom to do whatever they want. The challenge is in brick and mortar, and in multi-tenant shopping centers, you can’t just do that.”",Amazon rivals turn to legal fine print to stem Whole Foods strategy,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CT0ES-OCATC

A key Xi ally, top corruption fighter Wang Qishan, will not be on the new Politburo Standing Committee, the apex of power in China, to be revealed on Wednesday as he was not among those named on Tuesday to the 204-member Central Committee.

Whether or not the powerful Wang would remain on the Standing Committee, which currently has seven members, despite being beyond the customary retirement age of 69, had been among the key questions to be answered at the week-long party congress, which ended on Tuesday. Wang could still assume another senior role over the next few months.

As expected, the party unanimously passed an amendment to include “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” as one of its guiding principles.

The party will announce its new Standing Committee, headed by Xi, at around midday (0400 GMT) on Wednesday, culminating a twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle.

As expected, the amended constitution affirmed that Xi’s signature fight against corruption, which has ensnared more than 1.3 million officials, will continue.

Unexpectedly, Xi’s “Belt and Road” initiative, an ambitious program to build infrastructure linking China with its neighbors and beyond, was also included in the party constitution.

Also included was a commitment to supply-side industrial reforms, and giving play to the “decisive role” of market forces in resource allocation, a commitment Xi had made early in his first terms that many investors say he has failed to deliver on.

“The party exercises overall leadership over all areas of endeavor in every part of the country,” the party said in a statement reflecting Xi’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the party and its place in contemporary Chinese society.

If no clear successor to Xi is named to the new Politburo Standing Committee, it will further fuel speculation that Xi may look to retain power beyond the customary second five-year term.

“This is about further erasing any distinction between Xi Jinping and the party,” said Jude Blanchette, who studies the party at The Conference Board’s China Center for Economics and Business in Beijing, referring to Xi’s thought getting into the constitution.

“Add on to this having supply-side structural reform and One Belt One Road written into this, which were Xi’s signature policies, this makes questioning or non-compliance with those tantamount to betrayal of the party.”

THE MARKET AND THE PARTY

Xu Hongcai, deputy chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, a Beijing think-tank, said party control was needed to push through the market reforms key to restructuring the world’s second-largest economy.

“To build a market economic system in such a big country, it’s impossible without the leadership of the party,” he said.

Others have argued that the two are contradictory.

“When you put ‘supply-side reform’ and ‘market playing a decisive role’ in the same document, then that just shows they have to almost choose one,” said Alex Wolf, Senior Emerging Markets Economist with Aberdeen Standard Investments in Hong Kong.

China’s blue-chip shares climbed to a 26-month high on Tuesday, led by infrastructure and property stocks, as Xi wrapped up a congress that began with his three-and-a half hour speech envisioning a more prosperous, confident China. The yuan strengthened against the dollar.

CROWNING GLORY?

Xi rapidly consolidated power after assuming party leadership in late 2012 and then the presidency the next year. The party gave Xi the title of “core” leader a year ago, a significant strengthening of his position.

Whether Xi was able to have his name “crowned” in the party constitution had been seen as a key measure of his power, elevating him to a level of previous leaders exemplified by Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.

No other leader since Mao has had an eponymous ideology included in the document while in office. Deng’s name was added after his death in 1997.

A list of 133 committee members for the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection released on Tuesday included Zhao Leji, who heads the party’s Organisation Department, a strong sign that he will take over from Wang as anti-corruption chief.

China’s top banking regulator, Guo Shuqing, and veteran banker Jiang Chaoliang, front runners to succeed Zhou Xiaochuan as central bank governor, both made it to the Central Committee.

The constitutional amendment, along with Xi’s work report and a work report of the graft watchdog to the congress, were passed by a show of hands.

When Xi next asked for any “no” votes or abstentions for the amendment or two work reports, the sound of “none” echoed throughout the chamber, as officials shouted out from different sides of the hall.","China enshrines 'Xi Jinping Thought', key Xi ally to step down",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress/china-enshrines-xi-jinping-thought-key-xi-ally-to-step-down-idUSKBN1CT0C9

Britain is seeking a so-called implementation period of around two years following its departure from the EU in March 2019, during which its access to the EU single market would stay largely unchanged while new arrangements are put in place.

Businesses are keen to see the details of such a deal as soon as possible to end uncertainty over the trading rules they will face after Britain leaves the bloc.

“In terms of the broad outline of an implementation period, we believe that we can agree that quickly,” May’s spokesman said. He did not provide further detail on when Britain hoped to reach such an agreement.

“We’re clear that we want to achieve this implementation period, that we believe we can do so, and that our priority is to provide certainty for business,” he said.

May left some businesses confused on Monday by saying any implementation period would not be agreed until a deal was struck on Britain’s future trading relationship with the bloc.

That countered expectations that a transitional deal would come well before any deal on trade.

It also highlighted a clear difference between Britain and the EU over when a trade deal would be agreed.

Britain is seeking an “ambitious” deal on trade with the EU to replace its existing arrangement at the end of an implementation period. It believes its current close ties with the bloc mean such a deal will be agreed by October 2018.

But the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said it would take three years to negotiate a trade deal, meaning that if talks start in December it would be ready in time for the end of a transition period running until December 2020.

In response, asked if it was Britain’s position that it could still achieve a trade deal by the end of next year under the two-year exit process, May’s spokesman said: “Yes”.

Commenting on the timeline set out by Britain, an EU official said the bloc wanted to “define a framework for our future relationship” by this time next year so that a withdrawal treaty could “take account” of that future under the terms of the ‘Article 50’ legal exit process.

However, the official said the EU will only negotiate on the details of a free trade deal after Britain has actually left in March 2019 because the EU’s own laws do not allow it to negotiate trade agreements with its own members.

“Article 50 says that the withdrawal agreement has to take into account our future relationship, so we will know the terms of our partnership with the EU by our exit,” a spokeswoman for May said when asked about the position set out by the EU official.

“But as to the details, that’s subject to negotiation and I can’t pre-empt those.”","UK sees swift deal on Brexit transition outline, still at odds with EU on trade",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-transition/uk-sees-swift-deal-on-brexit-transition-outline-still-at-odds-with-eu-on-trade-idUKKBN1CT1KM?il=0

Halawa, who was born and raised in Dublin and is a son of the most senior Muslim cleric in Ireland, was 17 when he was arrested along with hundreds of others in 2013 as part of a crackdown on protests in Egypt.

“It still feels like a dream, it’s a moment I’ve waited for four years. I‘m a free man. I‘m hoping I can get my life back, get back to college and get my career,” a smiling Halawa, draped in an Irish flag, told reporters upon his arrival home.

Halawa thanked the Irish people, the government and his family for working hard to secure his release. A member of the Irish government, which had lobbied for his return, was among the well-wishers.

Halawa and three of his sisters were charged along with nearly 500 others with crimes including breaking into a mosque, killing 44 people, and illegal possession of firearms in violence that followed the military’s overthrow of Egypt’s Islamist president, Mohamed Mursi, in 2013.

The Halawas said they were on vacation visiting extended family in Egypt and joined a protest against the military’s ouster of Mursi while they were there.

The defendants had all faced the death penalty and though none received it, hundreds were given hefty jail sentences. Halawa’s sisters were released shortly after their arrests.

“This case has been one of the most complex, sensitive and difficult consular cases to which the Irish Government has ever responded. I and all of my colleagues are very pleased Ibrahim’s ordeal is now at an end,” Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said in a statement.

Halawa has said he was regularly tortured during his period in detention. The Egyptian authorities have repeatedly denied allegations of abuses from rights groups.

“They all claim that (torture) and we have often denied (it took place),” a senior Egyptian interior ministry source said.

The government has been plagued all week about questions about the finance minister, Bill Morneau, the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of human resources management firm Morneau Shepell. Some have questioned whether Morneau would be forced to resign.

The focus has been a rare stumble for Trudeau’s government, which marked two years in office this month and has mostly maneuvered its way out of political trouble partly because of Trudeau’s personal popularity and the youthful momentum of the Liberals after 10 years of Conservative rule.

“They’re politically very astute in a whole bunch of areas but in issues management and parliamentary management they seem to be ham-fisted,” said Andrew Graham, professor at the school of policy studies at Queen’s University.

With Trudeau’s strong defense of Morneau, and the finance minister likely to unveil a smaller budget deficit in Tuesday’s fall fiscal update, Liberals have a temporary chance to refocus on good news.

“Economic conditions are a bedrock of whether people feel good or bad about how politicians are performing, and the economy is doing very well for most people,” said Abacus Data pollster Bruce Anderson.

Morneau said on Thursday he will put his assets in a blind trust and divest stock in a publicly traded family business. That comes after weeks of backlash over tax reform that has become a major obstacle for Trudeau’s government.

Opposition parties from both the political left and right have seized on the ethics scandal, trying to tie Trudeau’s team to what they say is an entitled Liberal Party that has previously faced corruption charges.

“The opposition has changed the focus from substance to ethics, and they won’t let that go that easily,” said Genevieve Tellier, a political professor at the University of Ottawa.

But Tellier said Trudeau’s decision to fill his cabinet with political rookies - including Morneau - rather than turning to the old Liberal guard, could limit the ability of the opposition to land many ethical punches.

Moreover, Morneau is respected by markets.

“I think the prime minister would be very cautious about changing his finance minister. ... (Morneau) presents a reassuring image, he doesn’t scare the markets,” Tellier said.

Ipsos Public Affairs pollster Darrell Bricker put it more bluntly: “They really don’t have a choice but to tough it out and hope some event will transpire to distract the hyenas.”

The expected budget improvement in Tuesday’s fall fiscal update could also give Morneau the leeway to woo voters with more spending or debt reduction.

“The way the numbers are playing out, they are in a fairly favorable fiscal position,” said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.

Morneau spokesman Dan Lauzon said the finance minister has no plans to change his strategy, and would keep focus on fiscal stimulus matters: “He is in this for the long run, and he won’t let distractions get in the way.”",Canada's Liberals look to economy to guide them past ethics scandal,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CP2SE-OCADN

The maker of Post-It Notes (MMM.N) jumped 6.12 percent and Caterpillar (CAT.N) 6.07 percent after the two companies reported stellar quarterly results and gave upbeat forecasts.

The two stocks contributed nearly 140 points to the Dow’s 170 point rise.

United Technologies (UTX.N) and McDonald’s (MCD.N) also notched up gains after reporting results.

“At these levels, only companies that have both top-line and bottom-line beats could make the market move higher,” said Rick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey.

The S&P industrial sector .SPLRCI rose 0.75 percent, topping the 11 major S&P indexes. The sector has gained about 15 percent this year, in line with the broader S&P 500 index, but has underperformed sectors such as technology and healthcare.

“It offers some hope to investors that this rally will broaden out, which it needs to do, to sustain at these levels,” Heckler said.

Strong earnings and rising hopes of President Donald Trump’s tax plans moving forward have helped the Dow and S&P close at record highs on all five trading days last week.

Os preparativos para a Olimpíada, que acontecerá entre os dias 9 e 25 de fevereiro, têm sido ofuscados pela crescente crise na península coreana, desencadeada pelos testes nucleares e de mísseis balísticos da Coreia do Norte.

A tocha foi acesa usando a chama do ensaio geral de segunda-feira, uma vez que o tempo nublado e chuvoso não permitiu que a alta sacerdotisa, interpretada pela atriz Katerina Lechou, usasse o refletor côncavo para acendê-la usando os raios do sol.

A curta cerimônia dentro do estádio usado durante as antigas Olimpíadas gregas também contou com a presença do primeiro-ministro da Coreia do Sul, Lee Nak-yeon.

“Os Jogos Olímpicos são sagrados e universais”, disse o presidente do Comitê Olímpico Internacional (COI), Thomas Bach.

“Eles estão acima e além de todas as diferenças que nos dividem. Em nosso mundo frágil, que parece estar se afastando, os Jogos Olímpicos têm o poder de unir a humanidade em toda a sua diversidade”.

Park Ji-sung, ex-meio-campista do time inglês Manchester United, foi o primeiro sul-coreano a correr com a tocha olímpica, recebendo a chama do praticante grego de esqui nórdico Apostolos Aggelis, o primeiro portador da tocha, do lado de fora do estádio histórico.

A chama chegará à Coreia do Sul no dia 1º de novembro para o início do revezamento interno, durante o qual os organizadores esperam despertar o entusiasmo local, já que a venda de ingressos tem sido baixa.

The maker of Post-It Notes (MMM.N) jumped 6.12 percent and Caterpillar (CAT.N) 6.07 percent after the two companies reported stellar quarterly results and gave upbeat forecasts.

The two stocks contributed nearly 140 points to the Dow’s 170 point rise.

United Technologies (UTX.N) and McDonald’s (MCD.N) also notched up gains after reporting results.

“At these levels, only companies that have both top-line and bottom-line beats could make the market move higher,” said Rick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey.

The S&P industrial sector .SPLRCI rose 0.75 percent, topping the 11 major S&P indexes. The sector has gained about 15 percent this year, in line with the broader S&P 500 index, but has underperformed sectors such as technology and healthcare.

“It offers some hope to investors that this rally will broaden out, which it needs to do, to sustain at these levels,” Heckler said.

Strong earnings and rising hopes of President Donald Trump’s tax plans moving forward have helped the Dow and S&P close at record highs on all five trading days last week.

At 11:02 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 188.55 points, or 0.81 percent, at 23,462.51, after hitting a record high of 23466.72.

the S&P 500 .SPX was up 4.39 points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,569.37 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 14.78 points, or 0.22 percent, at 6,601.61.

However, gains in the S&P and the Nasdaq were kept in check by healthcare companies.

Biogen (BIIB.O) slipped 6.56 percent after reporting disappointing U.S. sales of Spinraza, a potential blockbuster drug.

Centene (CNC.N) dipped 4.19 percent after saying that White House moves to cut off Obamacare subsidies would knock 7-12 cents per share off the health insurer’s fourth-quarter earnings.

That along with a 1.4 percent drop in Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and a 2.5 percent decline in AbbVie AAB.N made the healthcare index .SPXHC the worst performer among the S&P sectors.

Financial stocks .SPY also jumped 0.69 percent, led by gains in Bank of America B.ACN and JPMorgan (JPM.N).

General Motors GKM.N rose 2.50 percent after the No.1 U.S. automaker reaffirmed its full-year earnings forecast and promised to slash stocks of unsold vehicles.

Whirlpool (WHR.N) tumbled 10.02 percent after the home appliances maker reported profit and sales below estimates and lowered full-year earnings guidance.

“Without 1917, Russia may have suffered just three (or fewer) such disasters, like China or Germany, and be considerably more prosperous ... today.”","LONDON (Reuters) - It is 100 years on Wednesday, using Russia’s old calendar, since Vladimir Lenin’s Bolsheviks stormed the Winter Palace in what is now St Petersburg and took power. Not a lot has changed.

Well, not in economic terms, according to research by Renaissance Capital, an investment bank specialising in the region. It says the Russias of 1917 and 2017 have more in common than might be expected.

Take, for example, debt. Just before the Red October revolution, around a third of Russian debt was held by foreigners. Same today.

Pre-1917, foreigners got 5-8 percent dividend yields from Russian utility shares. Same today.

Pre-Soviet Russia lagged the major world powers in industrial might, but was considered on a par with Brazil and Mexico. Pretty much the same as today.

Raw materials were pre-1917 Russia’s mainstay, comprising two-thirds of its exports. It is still two-thirds in 2017, Renaissance, an emerging markets-focused investment bank, says.

Finally, Russia was the world’s biggest exporter of grain back then. The bank calculates that over 2015-17, the countries of old imperial Russia were again the world’s biggest exporter of grain.

This is not to say, of course, that nothing has changed. The Soviet era, for example, brought widespread literacy, although RenCap economist Charlie Robertson notes today’s most successful areas in Russia are where 1917 literacy was the highest.

The Soviet Union also saw industrialisation, albeit uncompetitive compared with Britain, the United States and Japan.

Robertson reckons Russia could well have achieved far more but for the revolution and ensuing Soviet years which he says stopped the development of a modern economy.

“Russia was converging with Italy, industrialising as fast as Japan, and overtaking Spain in the first half of the 20th century,” he wrote in a note.

“If that progress could have been maintained, and without ... famines and repeated invasion by foreign enemies, we think Russia would be more populous, more wealthy and more democratic than it is today,” he said.

In the western city of Kisumu, around 2,000 demonstrators marched on the election board offices, witnesses said, responding to Raila Odinga’s appeal for protests against Thursday’s repeat presidential ballot. They dispersed peacefully.

Odinga is boycotting the contest against incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta. He says it will not be free and fair because the election board has not made sufficient progress in carrying out reforms he demanded after the original election held in August was annulled.

Odinga had urged his supporters to ensure Thursday’s vote did not take place, repeatedly saying there would be “no elections”.

But on Tuesday he told the BBC he was not calling for protests on polling day itself. “We have not told people to protest on polling day. We have not said that at all. We have told people to stay away,” he said in a radio interview.

When called for clarification, Odinga’s spokesman said he was saying “peaceful protests” would still take place and that the opposition would fully explain their plans on Wednesday.

The country’s Supreme Court is still hearing several cases challenging the legality of Thursday’s poll or Odinga’s withdrawal.

At least 49 people have died in political violence since the August ballot, evoking unwelcome memories of the aftermath of a disputed 2007 poll, when more than 1,200 people were killed.

The political stand-off has also blunted growth in East Africa’s richest economy, a nation valued for its stability and relative freedom in a region roiled by conflict.

Last week Odinga supporters disrupted at least three official pre-polling events. Police said some election board staff were seriously injured.

POLL DELAY?

The head of the election board said last week it was not clear a free and fair poll could take place due to intimidation and political interference.

His comments followed the resignation of an election commissioner, who fled the country and released a statement saying she had been threatened, although she did not say who had done so.

A day before the Aug. 8 poll, another member of the election board had been found tortured and murdered.

On Monday, the International Crisis Group, a global thinktank, called for a delay in the election, saying “proceeding under current conditions would deepen Kenya’s ethnic cleavages and prolong a stalemate that has already claimed dozens of lives and come at a high economic cost.”

Both the election board and the government have said the vote will go ahead, irrespective of whether Odinga contests it, and only a court ruling could legally delay the re-run ballot beyond the end of October.

On Tuesday, police fired tear gas and bullets into the air to disperse protesters in the capital Nairobi.

In Kisumu, an Odinga stronghold, demonstrators said that the polls should not take place, but were unclear on how they should be stopped.

“All we know is that there will be no elections. As to how this will be done, we are waiting for the big announcement by Baba (Odinga) tomorrow,” said one demonstrator, market trader James Ouma.

Around him protesters waved branches and blew whistles as they marched.

Kenyatta officially won the first election, on Aug. 8, by 1.4 million votes, but the Supreme Court annulled that vote on Sept. 1 over procedural irregularities.

After the Supreme Court ruling, Odinga’s team presented a list of demands to the election board.

Some have been met - opposition monitors will now have access to the board’s computers as results come in, a key official has gone on an extended holiday, and results will not be transmitted without a copy of a paper form from tallying centres.

The board said it was impossible to meet other demands - such as changing the technology provider - in the short time frame allotted for new elections.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus named Mugabe as a goodwill ambassador on Wednesday at a conference in Uruguay that both men were attending.

But the appointment was rescinded on Sunday following a backlash from Western donors, rights groups and opposition parties.

Last Friday, the state-owned Herald celebrated the largely ceremonial appointment as a ‘New feather in President’s cap’, adding that Mugabe, 93, had accepted the role.

His spokesman told the same newspaper on Tuesday that Zimbabwe’s sole leader since independence from Britain in 1980 had only heard about the appointment via the media.

“Had anything been put to the President ... (he) would have found such a request to be an awkward one,” Charamba was quoted as saying.

“The WHO cannot take back what it never gave in the first place, and as far as he is concerned, all this hullabaloo over a non-appointment is in fact a non-event.”

Charamba did not respond to calls seeking further comment.

Mugabe’s critics were outraged by Tedros’ announcement, saying he was rewarding a man whose government had presided over the collapse of Zimbabwe’s health system.

Charamba said the fact that Zimbabwe was a producer and exporter of tobacco, mostly to China, would have meant Mugabe campaigning against a crop that underpins the economy.

Tobacco is Zimbabwe’s single largest foreign currency earner, bringing in an average $800 million annually in the last four years, according to official data.

“To be seen to be playing goodwill ambassador in respect of an agency which has a well-defined stance on tobacco growing and tobacco selling, that would have been a contradiction,” Charamba said.","Mugabe would have rejected WHO role, says spokesman after its U-turn",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CT17R-OZATP

Britain is seeking a so-called implementation period of around two years following its departure from the EU in March 2019, during which its access to the EU single market would stay largely unchanged while new arrangements are put in place.

Businesses are keen to see the details of such a deal as soon as possible to end uncertainty over the trading rules they will face after Britain leaves the bloc.

“In terms of the broad outline of an implementation period, we believe that we can agree that quickly,” May’s spokesman said. He did not provide further detail on when Britain hoped to reach such an agreement.

“We’re clear that we want to achieve this implementation period, that we believe we can do so, and that our priority is to provide certainty for business,” he said.

May left some businesses confused on Monday by saying any implementation period would not be agreed until a deal was struck on Britain’s future trading relationship with the bloc.

That countered expectations that a transitional deal would come well before any deal on trade.

It also highlighted a clear difference between Britain and the EU over when a trade deal would be agreed.

Britain is seeking an “ambitious” deal on trade with the EU to replace its existing arrangement at the end of an implementation period. It believes its current close ties with the bloc mean such a deal will be agreed by October 2018.

But the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said it would take three years to negotiate a trade deal, meaning that if talks start in December it would be ready in time for the end of a transition period running until December 2020.

In response, asked if it was Britain’s position that it could still achieve a trade deal by the end of next year under the two-year exit process, May’s spokesman said: “Yes”.

Commenting on the timeline set out by Britain, an EU official said the bloc wanted to “define a framework for our future relationship” by this time next year so that a withdrawal treaty could “take account” of that future under the terms of the ‘Article 50’ legal exit process.

However, the official said the EU will only negotiate on the details of a free trade deal after Britain has actually left in March 2019 because the EU’s own laws do not allow it to negotiate trade agreements with its own members.

“Article 50 says that the withdrawal agreement has to take into account our future relationship, so we will know the terms of our partnership with the EU by our exit,” a spokeswoman for May said when asked about the position set out by the EU official.

“But as to the details, that’s subject to negotiation and I can’t pre-empt those.”","UK sees swift deal on Brexit transition outline, still at odds with EU on trade",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-transition/uk-sees-swift-deal-on-brexit-transition-outline-still-at-odds-with-eu-on-trade-idUSKBN1CT1KK?il=0

The fiscal update will show a sharp improvement in the nation’s balance sheet since the March budget, as stronger economic growth boosted revenues, but is unlikely to project balanced budgets anywhere on the horizon, economists said.

“It basically boils down to the fact that the economy looks like it’s going to grow by more than 3 percent this year, when they were basing their assumptions on growth of less than 2 percent back in March,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.

In March, the government projected a budget deficit of C$28.5 billion in the 2017-2018 fiscal year, which ends in March, up from the C$17.8 billion shortfall the previous year. At the time, economists said their economic assumptions looked easy to beat, all but guaranteeing they could boast of an improvement later.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has been badly shaken by a conflict-of-interest controversy surrounding Morneau, but hopes the fiscal update will reset pubic focus on the strong economy.

The Liberals won a surprise majority in 2015 pledging to run C$10 billion annual deficits to spur the economy, and the Bank of Canada has said the fiscal stimulus, which included a family tax credit, boosted growth in recent quarters.

“We will not only update on how well (our policy has) been working, but giving back as well, by re-investing in the people who are creating jobs and growing the economy - the small business tax cut is a good example of that,” Dan Lauzon said in an email.

Morneau, seeking to counter a backlash against a tax reform that targeted wealthy individuals and family businesses, said last week the government will cut the small business tax rate to 9 percent from 10.5 percent.","Canada to unveil smaller budget deficit, hopes will shift focus",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CT21L-OCABS

We need to feel guilty because the poisoned bequest we are leaving behind us stems from our own neglect. We can blame politicians, who are usually in the crosshairs when things go wrong. And some – not all – should take some of the rap. But the charge of neglect can’t come to rest only on them.

The list of our negative bequests is a melancholy and frightening one, usually put aside with a sigh and a passing frisson of dread. That frisson has lingered recently because one element in the legacy, security guaranteed by nuclear weapons, feels less secure given reports that North Korea is now developing nuclear missiles that can strike the United States and much of Europe - as well, of course, as the U.S. allies of South Korea and Japan.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is the culprit here, but Donald Trump’s threat to wipe North Korea off the map has no obvious purpose except to apparently increase Kim’s determination to ramp up the threat.

Deterrence hasn’t worked and there seem to be few viable options. One plan, put forward by the legal scholar and former director of strategy in the National Security Council Philip Bobbitt, would persuade the Chinese to offer North Korea a “nuclear guarantee,” effectively extending Beijing’s nuclear defense to North Korea on condition the latter mothballed its own program. Encouraging a potentially hostile state to enlarge its nuclear capacity is a desperate measure, but one made thinkable by the futility or horror of the alternatives.

Nor is North Korea the only nuclear danger. In an alarming commentary, former U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry wrote that Russia is “well underway” in its nuclear rebuilding program and that the threat of nuclear catastrophe is greater than during the Cold War. “Our public is blissfully unaware of the new nuclear dangers they face,” he wrote.

Nuclear annihilation is the largest of the malignant possibilities we have failed to address. Government debt is less dramatic, but steadily narrows the future economic choices available. To give the citizens in countries covered by welfare states the ability to buy cars, engage in travel and indulge in other leisure pursuits along with the necessities of life, most Western states have taken on huge public debts. That of the United States topped $20 trillion for the first time earlier this year, about $170,000 for each taxpayer. So far, it can afford it: some countries with higher debt relative to GDP can’t. Italy has the highest level of debt in Europe after struggling Greece, and had its credit rating cut from BBB+ to BBB by the Fitch rating agency in April.

Wolfgang Schauble, the controversial outgoing German Finance Minister widely seen as the architect of austerity in the European Union, has warned that “the growth of public and private debt” constituted a very large risk – a fear echoed by the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. The global economy is growing at present, but a collapse through debt could spark another recession, this time with even more serious social and political turbulence in its wake.

The world’s ecology gets no better, and may get worse – as President Trump announced a withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change in June. The move, apparently unpopular with most Americans, including Republicans, is important not so much for the further ecological damage it will do (though it will do some) but as a sign to others that the nation which set itself as an example to follow of care for the environment is now one giving an entirely opposite message.

A study from MIT in August warned of “deadly heat waves” hitting India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, causing “devastation” within a few decades, if carbon emissions are not reduced. That would unleash a flight of refugees that would make the present one pale in comparison.

We’ve become used to learning of breakthroughs in the treatment of disease and chronic conditions, and the eradication, or substantial diminution, of feared diseases like polio. But new infectious diseases are erupting more frequently, spreading more quickly, and evading treatment more efficiently, raising fears of global pandemics starting in sprawling, overcrowded developing world cities, carried worldwide by aircraft. And another modern “plague” – obesity – the result of relative plenty, is rocketing upwards. A study in the medical journal The Lancet showed that among children worldwide, obesity has increased tenfold in the past four decades. Obesity in children and adults is now a major drag on health systems in rich and poor countries alike, prompting heart conditions, diabetes and diseases of the bones and joints.

These and other fundamental threats demand strong government responses, but governments, especially in democracies, are weaker. The Global Economic Forum reports that “there has been an erosion of trust in political institutions and processes” and that “there is a fundamental disconnect between citizens around the world and the elected officials that supposedly represent them.” In other words, the crises are growing as the effectiveness of governments shrinks.

(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders brought his strategy of trying to reenergize the Democratic Party by lending his star power to lower-level races to a small city just outside Boston on Monday, with a stop to endorse candidates for alderman and city council.

Sanders, an independent who ran for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2016 presidential election, announced his support for a dozen candidates backed by “Our Revolution” a group formed by supporters of Sanders’ campaign to boost progressive, liberal candidates.

It is unusual for a politician with Sanders’ profile to weigh in on races with no serious Republican contenders, political observers said.

“The local level, more than any other level, is a way to involve people in the political process,” Sanders said in Somerville, Massachusetts, a city of 80,000 people.

Sanders last week pointed to the appearance as one of a series to try to build enthusiasm for lower-level elections. Sanders served four terms as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, before being elected to the Senate.

His remarks on Monday mirrored his 2016 stump speeches, without directly addressing the candidates he was supporting in Somerville and neighboring Cambridge.

Political observers said Sanders, and the candidates he endorsed, will face a challenge in translating the enthusiasm his campaign generated into votes for lower-level races.

In the city’s last municipal election that followed a presidential race, one-in-four registered voters, some 10,241 people, cast ballots. Three out of four who voted in last year’s Hillary Clinton-Donald Trump presidential matchup.

“Sanders envisioned his candidacy as a launching pad for nothing short of a revolution within the Democratic Party,” said Jeffrey Berry, a professor of political science at nearby Tufts University. “The energy is more around ‘How do we fight Trump’ than it is ‘How do we create a Democratic Party in the image of Bernie Sanders.'”

Sanders may not need to tip too many voters to influence the typically low-turnout city races. In the 2013 ward races, just two candidates secured more than 1,000 votes and the four closest races were decided by an average of 166 votes.

“It’s definitely a draw and I think it’s important that he is supporting local candidates,” said Ellora Derenoncourt, a 30-year-old graduate student who was out to show her support for alderman candidate J.T. Scott, a gym owner in his first race.

The event did attract some undecided voters who said Sanders’ endorsement would sway their picks among fields of Democratic candidates.

“Our country has moved so far to their right since the mid-90s that just being a Democrat doesn’t necessarily qualify you as a liberal or progressive,” said Pamela Massey, 59, of Cambridge.

Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator who serves as president of Our Revolution, acknowledged that the group faced a challenge in drumming up enthusiasm for down-ticket races.

“We have to try,” Turner said. “We have to remind people that they have an obligation to participate and so often the level of vitriol that is put out the national level can have a negative effect.”",Bernie Sanders brings local politics focus to Massachusetts races,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-sanders/bernie-sanders-brings-local-politics-focus-to-massachusetts-races-idUSKBN1CS2CF

A companhia está projetando uma produção de celulose em Aracruz de 2,1 milhões de toneladas em 2018 ante nível regular de produção de 2,3 milhões, disse Castelli em teleconferência com jornalistas.

“Fizemos ajuste de capacidade para o quarto trimestre (deste ano) na Aracruz de 85 mil toneladas em função de custo de madeira mais alto... Queremos anunciar que para 2018 vamos retirar equivalente a 200 mil toneladas de capacidade de produção de Aracruz pelo mesmo motivo”, afirmou o executivo.

Sobre a nova linha de produção em Mato Grosso do Sul, conhecida como Horizonte 2, a projeção de produção em 2018 segue sendo de 1,755 milhão de toneladas, mas a tendência “é ser maior que isso”, disse o executivo. Para este ano, a estimativa de produção da linha foi revista de 377 mil para 477 mil toneladas e a de vendas elevada de 300 mil para 370 mil toneladas.

Mais cedo, a Fibria divulgou que teve lucro líquido de 743 milhões de reais no terceiro trimestre, ante resultado positivo de 32 milhões no mesmo período do ano passado, apoiada em aumento de produção, preços maiores e resultado financeiro positivo.

As ações da companhia lideravam as altas no Ibovespa avançando 4,5 por cento por volta das 13:50, enquanto o índice tinha valorização de 1,15 por cento.

Analistas elogiaram os resultados da empresa, com o JPMorgan escrevendo em relatório que o custo caixa de produção da Fibria no terceiro trimestre caiu 2,2 por cento sobre um ano antes e 7,6 por cento no comparativo trimestral e ficaram 6 por cento abaixo da previsão dos analistas da casa.

“O ponto positivo principal do trimestre foi a forte queda sequencial no custo médio que foi guiada por uma distância menor de aquisição de madeira e melhores preços de venda de energia”, disse o JPMorgan em relatório.

Segundo o diretor comercial da Fibria, Henri Philippe Van Keer, o mercado global de celulose está trabalhando sem estoque e os clientes também estão desestocados o que tem favorecido reajustes de preços uma vez que a demanda por celulose segue robusta.

O cenário é influenciado por reduções de capacidade de fabricantes rivais da Fibria, como CMPC, no sul do Brasil, e APP, na Ásia, por conta de paradas para manutenção ao longo deste ano. Segundo Keer, essa situação de relação oferta e demanda bastante ajustada deve persistir pelo menos até o curso do primeiro semestre do próximo ano.

“A gente está bem otimista sobre preço (de celulose) nos próximos meses. A tendência é subir mais”, disse o diretor comercial da Fibria. “A demanda está muito boa, na China também continua muito boa, não tem estoques e também não tem de produtos acabados. Os clientes não estão reclamando sobre a alta de preços”, acrescentou o executivo.

“A demanda nos Estados Unidos e Europa está boa também. A economia da Europa está mostrando sinais positivos pela primeira vez em 10 anos e o euro está ajudando a minimizar os aumentos (de preços de celulose) em dólares”, disse Keer.

Sobre o panorama de consolidação da indústria, Castelli afirmou que a preferência da Fibria é por movimentos de fusões com troca de ações e realizadas dentro da área de atuação da companhia no Brasil ou América Latina.

“A empresa (Fibria) está forte e preparada para rodada de aquisição se isso acontecer... Mas mesmo com posição super robusta de caixa as consolidações possíveis partem principalmente de uma troca de ações”, disse Castelli. “Não imaginamos que vamos comprar alguém... Agora ninguém tem tamanho suficiente e caixa suficiente para fazer aquisição”, acrescentou.

A Fibria terminou o terceiro trimestre com 6,8 bilhões de reais em caixa e uma relação dívida líquida sobre Ebitda de 3,24 vezes ante 2,33 vezes um ano antes.

Analistas do Credit Suisse estimaram que com o início da produção de Horizonte 2 e fim dos pesados investimentos da empresa no projeto a alavancagem da Fibria vai cair para 2,4 vezes ao final do próximo ano ante limite definido pela empresa de 3,5 vezes.","Fibria vê demanda robusta por celulose, reduzirá produção em Aracruz em 2018",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1CT2BP-OBRBS

The storm left at least 16 dead and the entire island without power; most people won’t get their lights back on anytime soon. The cascading effects have been devastating. More than half of residents remain without drinking water. Hospitals cannot function. Supermarket shelves are empty and few gas stations are open. Communication networks are crippled, and first responders are struggling to make contact with residents in remote or heavily affected areas. Credit cards are useless, and ATMs are out of service.

We know how to do better and we can do better. Nobody should die because the power went out.

We need a dedicated national effort to fortify our electrical grids so that they can get back online much more quickly after inevitable, and increasingly severe, extreme weather events. Natural disasters happen, but often the catastrophes that follow are man-made. And when it comes to the electricity system—the lynchpin upon which so much of our society relies—widespread, long-lasting power outages can quickly devolve into nightmares all their own. Just a few weeks ago, 11 senior citizens died in Florida following prolonged heat exposure due to power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Similar catastrophes were suffered in the wakes of many other earlier storms, including Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.

The centralized electricity grid is widely vulnerable to threats, both natural and manmade. Flooding can submerge and damage equipment, as it did throughout the Northeast during Sandy; heavy winds can rip down trees and power lines, as was seen throughout Florida from Irma; and extreme heat and forest fires can wreak havoc on transmission lines. Climate change stands to escalate these threats, by contributing to higher seas, more intense storms, worsening wildfires and extended heat waves.

That’s why the focus must be on electricity grid resilience. It’s impractical and impossible to stop all outages from occurring. But it is possible to design the system such that when the power does inevitably fail, fewer people are affected from the outset and power is restored more quickly for the rest.

In Florida, policymakers directed the state’s utilities to “storm harden” their systems following the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. One decade and several billion ratepayer dollars later, Irma gave people a chance to see their increased utility bills at work.

Workers repair electrical installations after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in San Juan, Puerto Rico, September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez

The result: an astounding 6.7 million customers—or nearly two out of every three in the state—were plunged into darkness. Surely evidence of a failed approach, right?

Not quite. When it comes to the cascading failures arising from widespread outages, length of the blackout is a key factor in the severity of the impact. Even though all those Floridians lost power after, the utilities were able to get over one million back online overnight, and millions more restored within a few days with help from crews from across America.

In Florida, that pivot toward improving recovery times has meant, for one, simple upgrades, like replacing thousands of wooden utility poles with concrete that can better withstand hurricane-force winds. In the aftermath of Irma, even though crashing trees and flying debris ripped down power lines, restoration times were vastly improved by a reduced need to replace fallen poles.

Other initiatives can be more technologically complex. For example, by installing sensors and grid automation throughout the system, utilities can pinpoint when and where an outage has occurred, and re-route systems to reduce the number of people without power. Similarly, flood monitoring equipment can alert a utility when critical infrastructure is at risk of inundation, allowing the equipment to be pre-emptively turned off to improve post-storm repair times.

Tackling a problem this big, however, is impossible for each utility to do alone. Complicating the push for a more resilient electricity system is the fact that proposed interventions can be expensive, and investment dollars are limited. Additionally, the federal government has offered insufficient assistance, leaving states, cities and territories to largely fend for themselves, even though investing in a more resilient system now can reduce the costs of future relief and recovery efforts.

Utilities’ limited funds mean there are trade-offs, so opportunities must be carefully weighed against one another. But the costs of prolonged outages are far-reaching and challenging to quantify, and resiliency metrics are hard to define and even harder to compare. Efforts must also align with other priorities, especially as the power sector undergoes an unparalleled transition to clean and distributed renewable resources.

The fact also remains that some services are far too critical—drinking water, first responders, communications—and some populations, such as the elderly, disabled, or low-income, to tolerate even a day without power. For these people and services, a resilient grid is not enough.

Diesel generators, which have long-served a backup role when disasters hit, are expensive, heavily polluting, and prone to failure due to infrequent use. And as the long and frustrating lines following recent storms have made clear, maintaining steady access to fuel in the aftermath of a severe storm can be challenging, if not impossible. Microgrids powered by solar and storage, on the other hand, are more reliable during times of crisis, better for health and the environment, and increasingly affordable. This is thanks to lower costs of solar and storage technologies, as well as the fact that these systems can provide onsite power, generating benefits all year, not just during extreme weather events.

So what does this mean for Puerto Rico? Reports suggest parts of the island could remain without power for months, potentially impacting millions of people. This is unacceptable.

Now, as a country, we must pool together resources for a swift response to curtail the devastating crisis at hand. But we must also ensure that as the decimated power grid is pieced back together, this catastrophe—and the far too many that preceded it—were not suffered in vain. The electricity system must be rebuilt for a climate-resilient, clean-energy supporting future, not as a replica of its brittle and underinvested past.",Commentary: How we could have prevented some of Puerto Rico’s misery,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcnamara-electricity-commentary/commentary-how-we-could-have-prevented-some-of-puerto-ricos-misery-idUSKCN1C42ER

Suggesting a transition should run for 21 months from Brexit on March 30, 2019 until the current EU budget expires at the end of 2020, Barnier said Britain would “certainly” remain subject to EU laws and courts during that transition.

“During this period, the EU legal framework including on jurisdiction would continue to apply to Britain,” Barnier said in an interview published on Tuesday in Germany’s Handelsblatt newspaper.

“We don’t have time to invent a new model. So for a short time after the formal exit from the EU the economic status quo would continue to apply, which besides the internal market also includes the customs union and collective political decisions.”

In a version of the interview in Belgium’s L‘Echo, he said of the transition: “The only difference is that the British would no longer take part in decisions on European legislation.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May has proposed a transition of around two years to give time to put a new free trade pact in place, although she faces opposition in London from some Brexit supporters who want a clean, quick break.

Barnier noted that May had rejected the option of staying in the EU single market long-term -- the “Norwegian model” as he called it, referring to Norway’s membership of the EU internal market, accepting all its rules and costs without having a say.

“So we must work on other hypotheses,” Handelsblatt quoted him as saying. “Another option would be a free trade treaty using the example of the CETA agreement with Canada. It would take several years, however, to negotiate such an agreement.”

Asked if that meant there could be “a specifically British model” along the lines of the “bespoke arrangements” May has referred to without giving detail, Barnier replied simply: “No.”

Quoted by L‘Echo, he said a trade deal could be agreed in three years -- meaning that if talks start in December it would be ready just in time for a transition ending in December 2020.

He said his staff were already working on drafting a withdrawal treaty that will include terms for transition.

Barnier said he still hoped that May could provide more detail on her offer to meet financial commitments on withdrawal so that EU leaders could agree in December to end their refusal to negotiate a future trade deal.

May told an EU summit last week that she could not agree a figure until she knows what trade terms the EU offers.

Our soldiers are operating in Nigeria to build a capacity of local forces to defeat violent extremism in West Africa. On the 3rd of October 12 members of a U.S. special operations task force accompanied 30 Nigerian forces on a civil military reconnaissance mission. On the 4th of October U.S. and Nigerian forces began moving back south, and en route to their operating base the patrol came under attack from approximately 50 enemy using small arms fire, rocket-propelled grenades, and technical vehicles.

Approximately one hour after taking fire the team requested support and within minutes a remotely piloted aircraft arrived overhead. During the firefight two U.S soldiers were wounded and evacuated by French air to Nairobi. Three U.S. soldiers who were killed in action were evacuated on the evening of 4 October, and at that time Sergeant La David Johnson was still missing.

On the evening of 6 October, Sergeant Johnson's body was found and subsequently evacuated.>> We've reported that Sergeant Johnson's body was found some one mile away from the initial site of contact, is that consistent with the information you have and is there any assessment at this point as to why that was the case?

And what you're asking is a fair question, but we don't know that definitively right now, I can't answer it definitively. And with regard to being transparent I think we do owe the families and the American people transparency in incidents like this and we intend to deliver just that.

Sebastian Kurz is on course to be the youngest leader in the developed world. His first big decision will be whether or not to form a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party, which came in a virtual tie for second place with the center-left Social Democrats.

Kurz said in post-election interviews that his government would be “pro-European” and intolerant of any anti-Semitism, with which the Freedom Party has been strongly associated – though now softened by its present leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, who has shifted from general xenophobia to a focus on opposing Muslim migration.

Kurz wants stronger borders and drastic reductions in immigration. He agrees with Strache that “several hundred people have made their way from Austria to fight and murder for the Islamic State … (there is) no place for radical thought and political Islam.”

Kurz’s win is remarkable for his youth and his refurbishment of a fading party, but it’s in tune with the rest of a rising anti-European Union mood in Middle Europe. That mood is likely to be strengthened in the outcome of this weekend’s elections in the Czech Republic. There the ANO (""Yes"") center-right party is the likely winner. Its leader, the billionaire industrialist and media owner Andrej Babis, 63, would be the natural choice as prime minister – assuming that legal action threatened against him doesn’t halt his rise. At a conference in Prague last month in which I participated, Babis said that “Europe is failing on security” and that, if the 17 countries using the euro (the Czechs do not) integrate further – “we will be out. We do not need further integration.” Babis knows his fellow citizens: only small minorities are enthusiastic Europeans, or wish their country to join the common currency zone.

A swing against the European Union was not what the end of communism in the region was supposed to ordain. The Czech Republic, like the other former Communist states, sloughed off the Soviet yoke in the late 1980s with an affirmation of freedom. In Czechoslovakia (as it then was), the stubborn dissident writer Vaclav Havel invoked “the power of the powerless” – and in 1989, a few years after being released from powerless detention in prison, won power as president of his country.

Havel saw the central European states as returning to their natural European home, after decades of icy post-war imprisonment in the Soviet bloc. But that home has become one of disputes and mutual disappointment, not of amity. Freedom from communism has, indeed, meant the creation of electoral democracy, of varying degrees of strength and transparency. But it’s also meant corruption in politics and business – bribery was pervasive in the Communist era, but relatively small scale compared to today - periods of high unemployment, a growing suspicion of the European Union as an alien force (though a careful retention of its subsidies) and a strong dislike of immigration, which has meant closed borders and a refusal to participate in the EU’s migrant resettlement program. In the Czech Republic, a new ferociously anti-immigrant and anti-Islam party, headed by Tomio Okamura, a citizen of half-Czech and half Korean-Japanese ancestry has leapt to fourth place in the opinion polls.

Central Europe is now deeply and popularly conservative. Austria, geographically part of it even if it escaped the Soviet embrace, is now more politically in tune with its neighborhood than it has ever been. Indeed Kurz spoke in a Financial Times interview of his wish, if and when chancellor, to be a “bridge” between the post-communist states and the EU -- while sharing many of the former’s concerns.

Building that bridge is going to be a tough job. The countries in which Havel placed so much importance as an enthusiastic addition to Europe – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – no longer find much common ground, except in agreeing to keep out immigrants. Babis says the group, known as the Visegrad Four, is no longer useful. All of its member states have become more closed and hostile to the EU, but in different ways.

Poland differs most strongly in one sense: in a generally pro- Moscow grouping, it is unremittingly hostile to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of the ruling Law and Justice Party, blames for the death of his brother Lech, with other members of the Polish elite, in a plane crash in Russia. Under Kaczynski’s guidance, the Polish government has sought ever-greater control over the justice system and the media, all the while attacking liberal institutions and framing the EU as an external and unwelcome influence which must be defied.

Hungary, with the authoritarian Viktor Orban at the head of a rightist government, combines strong antagonism to the EU, a close relationship with Vladimir Putin’s Russia and a paranoia which has given rise to a clamorous campaign with anti-Semitic undertones centered on the figure of the liberal, Jewish Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, who funded many of the institutions and rising politicians in post-Soviet Hungary – including Orban himself. Soros’ largest contribution, the creation of the highly regarded Central European University, is now under threat of closure.

The veteran Hungarian-Austrian journalist Paul Lendvai, author of a new, fiercely critical biography of Orban, told me that the Hungarian prime minister “is deeply cynical and very skillful. He has imposed his power everywhere. The left is split and demoralized; the only opposition he fears is from Jobbik” – a far-right anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, anti-Romany party that is now, like the Austrian Freedom Party, softening its image to seek a possible future place in a coalition.

The Middle Europeans have, in part, done what the democratic world urged them to do: they have developed an independent politics. But increasingly, their dominant political sentiment is antithetical to, even contemptuous of, the liberal, pro-integrationist ideals of the European Union. These ideals, which Havel would have recognized, are now best expressed by President Emmanuel Macron of France. But, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, once the EU’s undisputed leading actor, begins what is billed as a long negotiation to form a governing coalition after her failure to win an outright majority in Germany’s recent election, she can no longer offer the Frenchman the support on which he counted.

The EU is now caught between a Brexit-ing Britain – with which negotiations are not going well – and an increasingly disenchanted group of Middle Europeans. The relief with which the defeat of the far-right in France and the Netherlands was greeted earlier this year was premature. A determination to close borders, to oppose more powers for Brussels and reluctance to accept its authority grows and spreads – and renders the European dream of unity, for the moment, impossible.",Commentary: Middle Europe turns its back on the EU,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-austria-commentary/commentary-middle-europe-turns-its-back-on-the-eu-idUSKBN1CP26M

Well, not in economic terms, according to research by Renaissance Capital, an investment bank specializing in the region. It says the Russias of 1917 and 2017 have more in common than might be expected.

Take, for example, debt. Just before the Red October revolution, around a third of Russian debt was held by foreigners. Same today.

Pre-1917, foreigners got 5-8 percent dividend yields from Russian utility shares. Same today.

Pre-Soviet Russia lagged the major world powers in industrial might, but was considered on a par with Brazil and Mexico. Pretty much the same as today.

Raw materials were pre-1917 Russia’s mainstay, comprising two-thirds of its exports. It is still two-thirds in 2017, Renaissance, an emerging markets-focused investment bank, says.

Finally, Russia was the world’s biggest exporter of grain back then. The bank calculates that over 2015-17, the countries of old imperial Russia were again the world’s biggest exporter of grain.

This is not to say, of course, that nothing has changed. The Soviet era, for example, brought widespread literacy, although RenCap economist Charlie Robertson notes today’s most successful areas in Russia are where 1917 literacy was the highest.

The Soviet Union also saw industrialization, albeit uncompetitive compared with Britain, the United States and Japan.

Robertson reckons Russia could well have achieved far more but for the revolution and ensuing Soviet years which he says stopped the development of a modern economy.

“Russia was converging with Italy, industrializing as fast as Japan, and overtaking Spain in the first half of the 20th century,” he wrote in a note.

“If that progress could have been maintained, and without ... famines and repeated invasion by foreign enemies, we think Russia would be more populous, more wealthy and more democratic than it is today,” he said.

GM reported a net loss due to charges related to the sale of its European operations, but the automaker’s operating results beat Wall Street expectations and the company reaffirmed a forecast that 2017 financial results would be in line with last year’s record performance.

The automaker also assured investors it was on track to cut stocks of unsold vehicles in the U.S. to a manageable 70-days’ supply by the end of the year.

GM, rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI), and heavy machinery maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) all are benefiting from a strong U.S. economy, continued growth in China and a recovery in demand from Latin America.

In the case of the automakers, U.S. car and light truck sales have so far defied predictions of a significant slump. September sales hit the fastest pace in 12 years as residents of Texas and Florida rushed to replace cars damaged by storms.

The latest results sent GM shares up 2.3 percent to the highest levels since its initial public offering in 2010, amid a broad rally by U.S. manufacturing stocks.

GM over the past several months has regained its status as the largest U.S. automaker by market capitalization over electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).

Some of GM’s share price surge has come from investors betting on its investments in self-driving and electric cars. The company’s profits, however, are driven entirely by demand for its petrol-fueled trucks and SUVs in North America, and its growing sales in China.

The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it expects U.S. vehicle sales to remain stable at an annual pace of about 17 million light vehicles in 2017, “and we expect that in 2018 as well,” GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens told reporters on Tuesday.

The U.S. auto industry has been coming off a strong run of sales that culminated in a record 17.55 million units in 2016. Industry analysts have predicted a slight decline for U.S. new car sales in 2017, driven in part by a flood of nearly-new, low-mileage off-lease vehicles into the market.

GM’s share price has risen nearly 30 percent this year, in part as the company has highlighted efforts to put self-driving cars on the road. However, spending on autonomous vehicles and ride services amounted to just $150 million in the latest quarter, the company indicated in its financial report.

GM posted lower revenue for the quarter as it shuttered plants in North America to reduce production and tackle bloated inventory levels, especially of unpopular sedan models as consumers move increasingly to pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

GM had 76 days’ supply of unsold vehicles at the end of September, down from 88 days a month earlier and over 100 in the summer. The company’s wholesale volumes were down 26 percent versus the same quarter in 2016.

GM is taming its inventory problem in the United States in part by laying off about 3,100 temporary and full-time hourly workers, mainly at factories that build compact and midsize sedans. The rapid shift by U.S. consumers to SUVs and pickup trucks in response to low, stable gasoline prices has left GM with too many North American factories tooled to produce low-profit sedans, analysts said.

GM showed a pre-tax profit in North America despite the steep production cuts and heavy discounts. Stevens credited cost-cutting and a shift to higher-profit trucks and sport utility vehicles. The company cut North American production costs by $2 billion during the first nine months of 2017.

GM posted a quarterly net loss on Tuesday due to charges stemming from the sale of its Opel unit in Europe to France’s Peugeot SA (PEUP.PA).

Detroit-based GM posted a third-quarter net loss of $2.98 billion, or $2.03 per share, compared with a profit of $2.77 billion, or $1.71 per share a year earlier. Excluding discontinued operations, GM posted a net profit of 8 cents per share.

But excluding one-time charges, the company earned $1.32 a share, above analyst expectations of $1.14.

Revenue in the quarter fell to $33.6 billion from $38.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $32.72 billion.","GM's earnings beat, forecast lift shares; supply glut shrinks",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-results/gms-earnings-beat-forecast-lift-shares-supply-glut-shrinks-idUSKBN1CT1KG

“Beautiful Trauma,” Pink’s seventh studio album, sold 408,000 album units in its first week. This comprised sales from albums and songs and streaming consumption, according to figures from Nielsen SoundScan.

The strong first week sales is the biggest debut for a female artist this year and the fourth biggest album debut of 2017, coming in behind Kendrick Lamar’s “Damn.,” Drake’s “More Life” and Ed Sheeran’s “Divide.”

The Billboard 200 chart tallies units from album sales, song sales (10 songs equal one album) and streaming activity (1,500 streams equal one album).

The S&P 500 industrials index .SPLRCI rose 0.7 percent, leading all major groups. Other sectors that are particularly dependent on economic growth, such as financials .SPSY and materials .SPLRCM, also gained.

Results showed a rebound for industrial companies whose shares have been under pressure the past couple of years as many of their key markets, such as energy, mining and agriculture, have struggled, said Edward Jones industrials analyst Matt Arnold.

“What we are seeing in 2017 is a significant snap back in demand. It is driving higher sales at a time when these companies have done a lot to lean themselves out and tighten their belts,” Arnold said.

”What all this means is these companies are translating the sales snap-back into significant earnings growth and it is driving the stocks,” he said.

Shares of diversified manufacturer 3M and heavy machinery maker Caterpillar led the sector’s gains, with both rising more than 5 percent after their results both easily topped Wall Street’s estimates for sales and earnings.

The two stocks also propelled the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI to a record high.

Caterpillar’s results helped boost shares of agriculture equipment maker Deere & Co (DE.N), while shares of Stanley Black & Decker (SWK.N) climbed about 4 percent after the power tool maker’s results.

General Motors Co (GM.N) shares meanwhile rose more than 1 percent after the automaker’s profit topped estimates. GM’s stock is part of the consumer discretionary sector .SPLRCD but its results are seen as an indicator of the health of industrial manufacturing.

Tuesday’s gains for the cyclical sectors signaled a potential rotation in the stock market. Shares of technology and healthcare companies, whose profits are more resistant to economic downturns, have led this year’s market rally.

Not all industrial stocks gained on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) shares fell 2 percent after the weapons supplier’s results, while United Technologies’ (UTX.N) shares were little changed after the conglomerate’s report.

Isolating North Korea further over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests is a key goal for Trump on what will be his longest foreign trip to date.

Trump will call on Xi to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions against Pyongyang and take other steps to pressure North Korea.

China, North Korea’s sole major ally, accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country.

China has said it will strictly enforce U.N. Security Council sanctions banning imports of coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the North.

But a senior White House official who briefed reporters ahead of Trump’s trip said China needs to do more to comply with two U.N. Security Council resolutions that were approved unanimously, including with China’s support.

“We would like to see China follow through on those commitments. We would like to see China do things bilaterally as well that might even go beyond things that are mandated by those U.N. Security Council resolutions,” the official said.

Though China has been angered by North Korea’s repeated nuclear and missile tests and demanded they stop, Beijing also sees the United States and South Korea sharing responsibility for rising tensions because of military drills they carry out in the region.

South Korea, the United States and Japan started a two-day missile tracking drill on Tuesday, South Korea’s military said in a statement, in preparation for any missile or nuclear threats from North Korea.

The exercises will be held in waters off the coasts of South Korea and Japan, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said, with four Aegis combat system-equipped ships from all three countries participating in the drill.

“CRITICAL” THREAT

China’s special envoy for the North Korea nuclear issue, Kong Xuanyou, met his U.S. counterpart, Joseph Yun, in Beijing on Monday, China’s Foreign Ministry said, where they had a “deep exchange of views on the Korean peninsula issue”. The ministry did not elaborate.

Trump, who has threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, has frequently asked China to help rein in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

But this strategy has so far failed to stop Pyongyang conducting nuclear bomb tests at an underground facility and firing ballistic missile tests into the Pacific Ocean over Japan.

The threat from North Korea has grown to a “critical and imminent level” and the United States, Japan and South Korea must address the matter, Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera told his U.S. and South Korean counterparts in talks on Monday.

Onodera’s remarks underscored the deep concern in Tokyo about North Korean weapons tests as Pyongyang seeks to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States.

The White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution of the North Korea standoff.

Asked by reporters whether an offer by former President Jimmy Carter to serve as a U.S. envoy to North Korea would be accepted, the official said: “There’s nothing planned.”

NO QUICK SOLUTION

Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Monday he outlined for Trump his country’s efforts to pressure North Korea over its nuclear programme but also advised the U.S. leader to use talks to help resolve the conflict.

“There is no quick and easy solution. Pressure is necessary but so is dialogue. The U.S. will need to work with others, including China, South Korea and Japan and Russia to resolve the issue,” he said.

With Xi consolidating power in the wake of a Communist Party Congress in Beijing, Trump believes the Chinese president will have a greater authority to take steps against North Korea, senior administration officials said last week.

Trump’s Nov. 3-14 trip will include visits to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Trump will also be tough on trade during talks with Xi as he seeks to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, the White House official said.

“We have huge barriers that Americans companies have to surmount to gain access to the Chinese market. The president is intent on rectifying that situation,” the official said.

Despite Trump’s fierce criticism of China’s trade practices during the presidential campaign, he has mostly held off on any major trade action while his administration works with Beijing on North Korea.

China has insisted it is doing all it can, and some Chinese diplomats say the Trump administration has overestimated how much influence Beijing has over its defiant neighbour.

Even as China has shown signs of tightening enforcement of sanctions on North Korea, it has stopped short of agreeing to U.S. demands for a fuel embargo and has urged the United States to negotiate with Pyongyang.","Trump to press China on North Korea, trade on Beijing visit",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-northkorea-missiles-usa/trump-to-press-china-on-north-korea-trade-on-beijing-visit-idUKKBN1CS1Y8

Their plan to overhaul what they call a broken tax code leaves out many key details. But one point gets hammered home: Republicans say they want to make filing taxes easier. The first principle for President Trump’s tax plan, their outline states, is to “make the tax code simple, fair and easy to understand.” There are a dozen more references to simplification throughout the rest of the document.

The Republican promise is that they want to make filing taxes as easy as mailing a postcard. But their plan doesn’t get anywhere close to that, while overlooking a straightforward reform that would. Instead of reducing complexity, the GOP plan mostly lowers and flattens rates. For example, it reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three.

However, the effort of filing taxes has nothing to do with how many brackets there are -- figuring out which bracket you fall in is the easy part. What makes doing taxes complicated is figuring out which deductions, credits, and loopholes to claim. Republicans would close some loopholes, but they would open others -- including a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses that will entice rich people with the right accounting team to get creative in order to reap the rewards. (Tycoons with family-owned businesses, such as Donald Trump, especially stand to benefit from this change, which would allow law firms, hedge funds, and real estate brokerages to file under a much lower rate.) Such loopholes make the code more complex to navigate, not less.

Simple tax filing isn’t a hopeless goal, however. There’s something Congress could do that would radically simplify the process of filing taxes for the vast majority of U.S. taxpayers.

It’s called return-free filing. In countries such as Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Spain, the government basically prepares tax returns for its citizens. It already has most of the information it needs: Employers have to tell tax authorities how much they pay their employees, while forms like W-2s and 1099s provide other necessary details. In Japan, for example, the country’s tax agency sends everyone a document with how much they earned, how much was withheld, and how much they owe or are owed in taxes.

If Washington adopted this policy, the government would fill out a return for every resident with the information it already keeps on file. Taxpayers who wanted to itemize their returns or dispute the numbers would be free to do so, but otherwise they could simply sign off on the government’s math. In some countries, merely taking no action constitutes an approval and therefore counts as doing your taxes.

Instead, in the United States it’s up to every taxpayer to gather their forms, enter all the numbers into a long document, ensure that everything has been calculated accurately, and send it all in. It takes a collective 2.6 billion hours to get this done. Americans pay an average $200 each for the pleasure of doing their taxes, or around 10 percent of the average federal tax refund.

Return-free filing, on the other hand, could save an estimated collective 225 million hours of tax filing work and $2 billion in costs. Up to 60 million households would no longer have to file any returns.

The concept is not entirely foreign to the United States. President Ronald Reagan called for something just like it in his 1985 Tax Reform Act, arguing that Americans should “not even have to fill out a return.” Since then, Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken up the crusade, introducing legislation two years in a row that would instruct the IRS to develop a free, online return-free filing option, allowing taxpayers to download their information straight from the government and into a form. The idea is even supported by conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.

But it hasn’t moved forward; last year, Warren’s bill didn’t even make it out of committee.

That’s because some deep-pocketed companies have worked tirelessly to bury it. If most Americans no longer needed help doing their taxes, business would dry up for tax preparers such as H&R Block and TurboTax. More than half of all individual tax returns filed in 2014 were prepared by a tax professional, while about 80 percent of Americans use either software or a preparer.

These companies have said as much publicly. Intuit, the software company that makes TurboTax, has said in filings that it “opposes IRS government tax preparation” and that such legislation “may present a continued competitive threat to our business in the foreseeable future.” Liberty Tax Service stated in 2015 that “demand for our products is related to the complexity of tax return preparation.”

So they’ve spent heavily to campaign against return-free filing. H&R Block, which ProPublica says spent $3 million on lobbying last year, fought hard against Warren’s bill. Intuit spent $2 million in the same year, much of it in favor of legislation that would block the government from offering return-free filing. The firm has lobbied in favor of a number of similar past bills.

Republicans have long claimed that they want to make taxes simpler, yet their proposals never live up to such promises. It’s not impossible, though; the answer is staring us right in the face. It would just require the government to put the interests of everyday taxpayers over big-spending corporate lobbyists.

The split is the latest sign of partisan feuding that current and former U.S. officials say is undercutting a House Intelligence Committee probe into Russia’s reported interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Republicans on the committee earlier this month subpoenaed an unidentified bank for the last two years of records of the accounts of Fusion GPS, the political research firm that hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to pull together the dossier on Trump.

The move was an apparent effort to find out who had paid for the work that led to the dossier. The firm assures its clients it will not disclose their identities.

Last week, Fusion GPS sued the unnamed bank in federal court in Washington, requesting a court order to block the subpoena.

In a Monday night court filing, lawyers for the House, saying they represented the Intelligence Committee, asked the court to reject Fusion’s request.

But the legal challenge was made without support from Democrats, throwing into further question a tradition of bipartisanship in Congress on intelligence issues.

Democrats, who are in the minority, and some Republicans on the House panel, want to investigate Russia’s role in the 2016 election, as well as allegations - so far unproven - that Trump’s team colluded with the Kremlin.

Representative Devin Nunes, the Intelligence Committee’s Republican chairman, and his allies have focused instead on other issues, including the activities of Fusion GPS.

Some Republicans, including Senator Charles Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, have charged that Fusion GPS took Russian money while compiling the dossier on Trump.

“Domestic American clients paid for Fusion GPS to research Donald Trump, period. No Russian was involved, in any way, in the payment to Fusion GPS for this work,” Joshua Levy, an outside attorney for the firm, said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday.

A footnote in Monday’s court filing says that House lawyers went to court to enforce the subpoena with the authorization of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the entire House.

But it adds that the House’s “Democratic Leader and Democratic Whip decline to support the Group’s position in this case.”

Representative Nancy Pelosi is the House Democratic leader, and Representative Steny Hoyer is the Democratic whip.

The top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff, was not immediately available for comment.

In their court filing, the House lawyers argue that Fusion GPS has no right to quash a valid congressional subpoena.

“The relief Plaintiff seeks is extraordinary and would directly impede an ongoing congressional investigation of the highest national importance,” they wrote in the filing.

The filing confirms Nunes retains control of the committee’s Russia probe, despite saying in April he would step aside and let fellow Republican Representative Mike Conaway take charge.

The investigation by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) - known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) - was unanimously created by the 15-member U.N. Security Council in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November.

The JIM is due to report by Oct. 26 on who was responsible for an attack on April 4 on the town of Khan Sheikhoun, held by the opposition to Syrian president Bashar Al Assad, that killed dozens of people.

Russia wanted to discuss the report before voting on the extension of the mandate, and its U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia unsuccessfully asked to postpone the vote.

“Don’t try to create the impression that the JIM will be a dead letter unless we adopt this resolution today,” Nebenzia said prior to the vote.

“We are ready to return to extending the JIM after the publication of the report and after we discuss it after the 26 of October.”

A separate OPCW fact-finding mission determined in June that the banned nerve agent sarin had been used in the Khan Sheikhoun attack, which prompted the United States to launch missiles on a Syrian air base.

Trump has asked his fellow Republicans who control Congress to pass a package of tax cuts, including a deep reduction in the corporate income tax, by year’s end.

But hours before he was to promote the tax plan at a weekly lunch for Republican senators on Capitol Hill, Trump engaged in a distracting tussle with one of those lawmakers: Bob Corker, a leading fiscal hawk and the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

“Bob Corker, who ... couldn’t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts,” Trump wrote on Twitter, later adding that the senator is “incompetent.”

Alienating any members of his own party could be costly for Trump’s legislative initiatives in the Senate because Republicans control the chamber by just a slim 52-48 margin.

Corker warned Trump in television interviews against interfering in congressional efforts to finalize the legislation to cut taxes and called the president’s visit with Senate Republicans “a photo op.”

“Hopefully, the White House will step aside and let that occur in a normal process,” the Tennessee Republican told NBC’s “Today” program. “That’s the best way for us to have success.”

Corker also described Trump in a Twitter post as “an utterly untruthful president,” and in television interviews accused Trump of debasing the United States.

‘HISTORIC CHANCE’

House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan urged reporters to ignore the Trump-Corker spat and concentrate on the tax plan.

“Put this Twitter dispute aside. The fact is we have an historic chance of fixing this tax code,” Ryan said.

Ryan added that he knows Corker well and predicted that the senator is “going to vote for tax reform.”

Ryan said he wants the House to pass the Republican tax cut bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, echoing Trump’s call to speed up the party’s efforts to get the measure approved before year’s end.

Securing congressional passage of his tax plan is critically important to Trump, who has yet to get major legislation through Congress since taking office in January, including a healthcare overhaul he promised as a candidate last year. Tax cuts were another of Trump’s campaign pledges.

The White House argues that tax cuts are needed to boost economic growth and create jobs, but has shown sensitivity in recent weeks to arguments that it is endangering America’s long-term fiscal health.

One of the key elements of the proposal is to slash the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. While the broad parameters of the tax proposal have been made public, detailed legislation has not yet been unveiled.

Democrats have painted Trump’s plan, with its $6 trillion in tax cuts, as a gift to the rich and corporate America that would balloon the federal deficit.

Auto trade associations representing General Motors Co (GM.N) Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and nearly every other major automaker, are part of the coalition dubbed “Driving American Jobs” and backing an advertising campaign to convince the White House and voters that the agreement has been crucial in boosting U.S. automotive sector production and jobs.

Trump has threatened to withdraw from the trade deal with U.S., Canada and Mexico, which is heavily utilized by automakers who have production and supply chains spread across the three countries.

In the most recent round of talks to renegotiate NAFTA last week, Trump proposed changes to the rules of origin for autos, which are used to determine how much of an auto is made in a certain place. The proposed rules were viewed as untenable for automakers, as well as Mexico and Canada.

The auto industry joins the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other large business groups that have become more vocal in recent weeks about Trump’s efforts to change the 23-year-old accord, saying they would be detrimental to American jobs.

The auto coalition, which includes the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association and American International Automobile Dealers Association, said ending NAFTA, which underpins $1.2 trillion in annual trade between the three countries, would put U.S. auto sector jobs at risk.

They pointed to $9.5 billion in new investments announced this year by the auto and auto parts sector and feature the personal stories of auto sector employees throughout America - from plant workers to auto dealership personnel.

“We need you to tell your elected officials that you don’t change the game in the middle of a comeback. We’re winning with NAFTA,” the group said on its website.

The campaign comes amid rising concern that the Trump administration could opt early next year to withdraw after giving six months notice, a move that could expose automakers to high tariffs who are building trucks in Mexico and impose new tariffs on parts and cars made throughout North America.

President Donald Trump told the Fox Business Network in an interview that aired Sunday he thinks the deal will “probably” be renegotiated, but said he will withdraw if it is not fair. “We can’t allow the world to look at us as a whipping post. Not going to happen anymore,” Trump said.

The Chamber of Commerce accused the Trump administration of trying to sabotage the talks with “poison pill proposals,” including demands for more favorable treatment for the U.S. side on car production, and a “sunset clause” to force regular negotiations.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said earlier this month the Trump administration was focused on trying to get an agreement that was fair but said he had “seen no indication that our partners are willing to make any changes that will result in a rebalancing and a reduction in these huge trade deficits.”

Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in the region must be from North America to be able to enter the marketplace tariff-free.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

Spain says it will impose direct rule on Catalonia from Friday to prevent an illegal push for independence, invoking unprecedented powers to dismiss the regional government. Madrid said an election would not change those plans.

The Catalan parliament meets on Thursday to agree on a response to Madrid, and many analysts believe the economically powerful region could formally declare independence.

Secessionists in Catalonia say their independence referendum on Oct. 1 - which attracted a 43 percent turnout and was mostly boycotted by those Catalans who want to remain in Spain - has given them a mandate for statehood.

Catalonia said on Monday it was confident that its officials, including the police, would defy attempts by Madrid to enforce direct rule.

Spanish political and business leaders, along with most Catalonian newspapers, have urged Catalan President Carles Puigdemont to call a regional election before he is stripped of his authority.

They say direct rule from Madrid would be a humiliation for Catalonia and pose a serious risk of unrest.

Puigdemont has so far remained silent on the matter of an election but an ally of his pro-independence government said he was actively considering this option.

“We have evidence this is currently on the table,” Carles Riera, a Catalan lawmaker for the anti-capitalist CUP party, told a news conference.

Calling an election would be a face-saving move for Puigdemont as it could either strengthen his mandate if pro-independence parties won or allow him a graceful exit if they did not.

DEBATE?

The Spanish government said a snap election would be a first step but Puigdemont would also have to withdraw an ambiguous declaration of independence he made earlier this month.

The government had moved to cancel Catalonia’s autonomous status because it believed there had been a “serious failure” by Puigdemont to meet his obligations, Justice Minister Rafael Catala said in a radio interview.

“Everything is not fixed just by calling an election.”

Catala said that if Puigdemont appeared before the Spanish Senate, it would help to resolve the crisis.

A top official in the Senate said that if Puigdemont decided to appear before the house, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would likely come to the chamber as well so that a proper debate could be organised between the two.

The Senate said on Tuesday it had invited Puigdemont to appear before the chamber on Thursday at 5 p.m (1500 GMT) or Friday at 10 a.m (0800 GMT).

The Madrid government has so far refused to meet the Catalan leader until he drops his call for independence and Catala said any appearance by Puigdemont had to be within a legal and constitutional framework.

“If his appearance is within the constitution and the law we’ll be delighted ... But if it’s just to ratify his position on Catalonia’s independence, sadly we will not be able to do anything else than continuing with the measures already set by the government,” Catala said.

The political uncertainty has taken its toll on Spain’s wealthiest region, with hundreds of companies moving their headquarters out of Catalonia.

Volkswagen’s Spanish unit SEAT, one of the biggest employers in the region, said it would move its registered office if it felt there was no longer legal security in Catalonia, although it had so far not made a decision.

“Relocating the registered office would respond to the need to seek legal protection, and would make sense the moment we felt it was no longer afforded in the territory where we are located,” SEAT Executive Committee Chairman Luca de Meo said in a letter to the company’s more than 14,000 employees in the region.",Catalan secessionists mull snap election as Madrid hangs tough,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia-catala/catalan-secessionists-mull-snap-election-as-madrid-hangs-tough-idUSKBN1CT0PQ

Iran is complying with the JCPOA. The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly confirmed it, as have partner intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). European leaders oppose refusing to certify Iranian compliance because it would make it likely that Congress will re-impose U.S. sanctions.

That would be only the first of two body blows to the agreement and to the alliance. The second would be an abuse of U.S. authority to re-impose United Nations sanctions.

The president has the power to force the United Nations to “snap back” the multilateral sanctions lifted under the deal – biting restrictions on Iranian banks and other businesses. If the United States re-imposes its own sanctions on Iran, it will inevitably avail itself of these UN sanctions, as well.

The Bush and Obama administrations persuaded Russia, China, and the UN Security Council to sanction Iran’s economy in order to limit its nuclear program. The JCPOA traded these sanctions for tight nuclear restrictions and inspections, but the United States and its partners worried that the Security Council might fail to re-impose the sanctions if Iran cheated, reducing Iran’s incentive for long-term compliance. A clever procedural solution was built into the JCPOA. Any participant in the deal can demand that the Security Council vote on a resolution to continue sanctions relief. The U.S. can veto that resolution, so even if the Security Council votes 14-1 all of the previous restrictions on Iran still snap back into place.

The JCPOA was built to respond to Iranian violations, even if Russia and China were no longer aligned with the United States and the EU. It was not designed to withstand a hawkish or isolationist America using its veto power outside of the terms of the deal or against the objections of its European partners.

Ironically, though, if the U.S. does choose to act alone, in the absence of Iranian violations and against the wishes of its allies, it might undermine the substantive goal of UN snapback, leaving empty sanctions on paper.

Once the UN applies – or in this case, re-applies – sanctions, the European Commission and European Union member countries are supposed to take a number of steps to make the UN sanctions part of EU law and regulation. This is serious business for Europe, which is strongly committed to the idea that, as a matter of international law, the UN can impose binding requirements on all members in the interest of international peace and security. The EU has occasionally faced legal challenges in applying UN sanctions, but it never has simply chosen to ignore a binding Security Council resolution as a matter of policy.

Europe would be sorely tempted to do exactly that on Iran. The snap back mechanism is designed for cases of Iranian non-compliance. Under the JCPOA, Washington does not need to prove that Iran has violated the deal, but Europe may decide that American bad faith justifies breaking from its own UN obligations. Certainly, Europe will categorically disagree with the U.S. policy. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, echoing the senior leadership of the UK, France, and Germany, said after Trump’s UN speech that the deal is working and must be preserved. If the U.S. withdraws, the EU has made clear it will do everything within its power to keep the agreement alive by sustaining newly established business ties with Iran.

Europe would thus be faced with a choice between a crime under international law and what it considers to be a policy mistake. In either case, Europe would be justifiably furious about being forced to choose between two important, deeply held policies – adherence to Security Council resolutions and implementation of the JCPOA.

Other countries, including Russia and China, may also prove lax in applying the restored sanctions, but this is both less uncommon and less important to Iran’s economic aspirations. U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA will hurt Iran’s economy badly, but will not achieve the kind of strangulating effect the broad international coalition had before the deal. A deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.

At the UN last week, President Trump called the Iran deal “an embarrassment to the United States.” He teased that he has made a decision about whether to certify Iranian compliance to Congress but refused to tell anyone, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, what he had decided. The weeks leading to the October 15 certification deadline may be Europe’s last, best chance to explain to President Trump and his advisors that undermining, let alone abrogating, the JCPOA would be a catastrophe not only for the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but also for the bond between the United States and Europe. The only winners would be Europe’s and America’s adversaries.",Commentary: Trump’s Iran threats risk a U.S. break with Europe,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blanc-iran-commentary/commentary-trumps-iran-threats-risk-a-u-s-break-with-europe-idUSKCN1C32E3

In an inaugural Bundestag session following the Sept. 24 federal election, lawmakers from the other parties showed their disdain for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party by overwhelmingly rejecting its candidate for deputy speaker.

Convention holds that each party represented in the Bundestag names a deputy speaker. But lawmakers spurned AfD candidate Albert Glaser in three rounds of voting.

Still, the AfD, which has become the first far-right group represented in Germany’s parliament for more than half a century, made clear its intention to shake up German politics on the national stage.

“The people have decided, now a new era begins,” AfD parliamentary leader Bernd Baumann told the chamber.

Schaeuble, who won 501 of 705 votes for the post of speaker, shot back in his maiden speech: “Nobody on their own represents the people.”

Germany’s longest serving lawmaker, 75-year-old Schaeuble is one of the country’s most respected politicians and seen as well qualified to tame recalcitrant lawmakers.

By agreeing to move to the Bundestag, Schaeuble has opened the way for the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) to take over his powerful Finance Ministry, helping to unblock talks on an expected new three-way coalition with the Greens.

The conservatives, FDP and Greens convene on Tuesday evening for coalition talks.

FDP leader Christian Lindner told broadcaster n-tv that Schaeuble was an extraordinary figure in German politics:

“He has gravitas, a clear position and a natural authority that will be good to have in a parliament that has just become more diverse, and where some manners may be called into question.”

The AfD’s Baumann shocked other lawmakers by suggesting that they had used Nazi-era tactics to prevent Glaser from taking a deputy speaker post. FDP politician Marco Buschmann said the comments were “beyond tasteless.”

The AfD can nominate an alternative candidate for deputy speaker. Although there is precedent for a party’s first choice being rejected, there is no precedent for a party failing to have any lawmaker accepted in the post.

Britain is seeking a so-called implementation period of around two years following its departure from the EU in March 2019, during which its access to the EU single market would stay largely unchanged while new arrangements are put in place.

Businesses are keen to see the details of such a deal as soon as possible to end uncertainty over the trading rules they will face after Britain leaves the bloc.

“In terms of the broad outline of an implementation period, we believe that we can agree that quickly,” May’s spokesman said. He did not provide further detail on when Britain hoped to reach such an agreement.

“We’re clear that we want to achieve this implementation period, that we believe we can do so, and that our priority is to provide certainty for business,” he said.

May left some businesses confused on Monday by saying any implementation period would not be agreed until a deal was struck on Britain’s future trading relationship with the bloc.

That countered expectations that a transitional deal would come well before any deal on trade.

It also highlighted a clear difference between Britain and the EU over when a trade deal would be agreed.

Britain is seeking an “ambitious” deal on trade with the EU to replace its existing arrangement at the end of an implementation period. It believes its current close ties with the bloc mean such a deal will be agreed by October 2018.

But the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said it would take three years to negotiate a trade deal, meaning that if talks start in December it would be ready in time for the end of a transition period running until December 2020.

In response, asked if it was Britain’s position that it could still achieve a trade deal by the end of next year under the two-year exit process, May’s spokesman said: “Yes”.

Commenting on the timeline set out by Britain, an EU official said the bloc wanted to “define a framework for our future relationship” by this time next year so that a withdrawal treaty could “take account” of that future under the terms of the ‘Article 50’ legal exit process.

However, the official said the EU will only negotiate on the details of a free trade deal after Britain has actually left in March 2019 because the EU’s own laws do not allow it to negotiate trade agreements with its own members.

“Article 50 says that the withdrawal agreement has to take into account our future relationship, so we will know the terms of our partnership with the EU by our exit,” a spokeswoman for May said when asked about the position set out by the EU official.

“But as to the details, that’s subject to negotiation and I can’t pre-empt those.”","UK sees swift deal on Brexit transition outline, still at odds with EU on trade",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-transition/uk-sees-swift-deal-on-brexit-transition-outline-still-at-odds-with-eu-on-trade-idINKBN1CT1KK?il=0

Over 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar since Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response by the Myanmar army that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.

At a meeting in Myanmar’s capital Naypyitaw, attended by Myanmar’s home affairs minister lieutenant general Kyaw Swe and his Bangladeshi counterpart Asaduzzaman Khan, the countries signed two agreements covering security and border cooperation.

The two sides have also agreed to “to halt the outflow of Myanmar residents to Bangladesh,” and “to form a joint working group,” Tin Myint, permanent secretary from Myanmar’s home affairs ministry told reporters after the meetings.

“After joint working group, the verification, (the) two countries have agreed to arrange different steps so that these people can return to their homeland safely and honourably and in secure conditions,” said Mostafa Kamal Uddin, secretary from Bangladeshi home affairs ministry.

The officials did not elaborate on the specific steps the authorities would take for the repatriation, adding that the bulk of discussions was dedicated to border and security cooperation agreements which have been long in the making.

Tin Myint said the two countries agreed “to restore normalcy in Rakhine to enable displaced Myanmar residents to return from Bangladesh at the earliest opportunity.”

He also said Myanmar had sent a list of suspects who had fled to Bangladesh and requested the authorities there to investigate and return them to Myanmar.

Thousands of refugees have continued to arrived cross the Naf river separating Myanmar’s western Rakhine state and Bangladesh in recent days, even though Myanmar says military operations ceased on Sept. 5.

The United States said on Monday it was considering a range of further actions over Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority.

While on Tuesday the officials said the talks were friendly, tensions are still high between the two countries. Bangladesh last month accused Myanmar of repeatedly violating its air space and warned that any more “provocative acts” could have “unwarranted consequences”.

On border and security, the two sides decided to establish border liaison offices, carry out regular meetings between two security forces, jointly combat drug trafficking across the border and set up a mechanism to communicate directly.

Bangladesh has for decades faced influxes of Rohingya fleeing persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where the Rohingya are seen as illegal migrants. It was already home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya before the latest crisis.

Though Rohingya families have lived in Myanmar for generations, they are denied citizenship and access to basic civil rights such as freedom of movement, decent education and healthcare.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

Months after the historic women’s march on Washington and in the midst of the “#MeToo” sexual harassment outcry, Halloween 2017 is becoming yet another platform in the United States for women and girls to show strength.

This year’s most-searched Halloween costume is Wonder Woman, according to Google’s Frightgeist search tool.

Star Wars heroine Rey, the self-reliant young woman who shines as a survivor against all odds, is among the film series’ characters who rank in the top 10 children’s costumes for 2017, according to the National Retail Federation.

And, makers of homemade costumes this year are getting online tips for re-purposing pink “pussyhats.” They were worn by many of the hundreds of thousands of women who took part in marches in Washington and other U.S. cities on Jan. 21, the day after Donald Trump’s inauguration as president, to denounce his years-ago boast about grabbing women’s genitals.

“The year or more of sexual harassment scandals has shifted people’s thinking about what they want to become on Halloween,” said Barnard College Psychology Professor Tovah Klein.

“Costumes empower children - as in ‘I can be strong, I can be invincible, I can fight for justice.' And right now, with Wonder Woman and other characters, girls are embracing this strong side,” Klein said.

Raising her light saber, 9-year-old Abby of Maplewood, New Jersey, demonstrated her warrior stance dressed as Rey, a steel-colored cloth crossed over her chest, with pants to match her tunic.

“I feel more brave when I‘m Rey,” said Abby, a fourth-grader who has celebrated Halloweens past by dressing up as princesses.

“I like Rey more than princesses. She’s very tough. She’s fighting. She’s helping a lot of other people survive,” said Abby, whose parents asked that her last name be withheld for privacy.

More than 179 million people in the United States will celebrate Halloween 2017, spending a record high of $9.1 billion, with the largest outlay on costumes, the retail federation said.

To be sure, feminist-fueled Halloween costumes are nothing new. But this year, they carry a special resonance.

Trump’s brag about assaulting women, which he later called “locker room talk,” was made public when a 2005 video surfaced during his 2016 presidential campaign. A year later, sexual abuse allegations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein sparked the “#MeToo” movement. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

A key Xi ally, top corruption fighter Wang Qishan, will not be on the new Politburo Standing Committee, the apex of power in China, to be revealed on Wednesday as he was not among those named on Tuesday to the 204-member Central Committee.

Whether or not the powerful Wang would remain on the Standing Committee, which currently has seven members, despite being beyond the customary retirement age of 69, had been among the key questions to be answered at the week-long party congress, which ended on Tuesday. Wang could still assume another senior role over the next few months.

As expected, the party unanimously passed an amendment to include “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” as one of its guiding principles.

The party will announce its new Standing Committee, headed by Xi, at around midday (0400 GMT) on Wednesday, culminating a twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle.

As expected, the amended constitution affirmed that Xi’s signature fight against corruption, which has ensnared more than 1.3 million officials, will continue.

Unexpectedly, Xi’s “Belt and Road” initiative, an ambitious program to build infrastructure linking China with its neighbors and beyond, was also included in the party constitution.

Also included was a commitment to supply-side industrial reforms, and giving play to the “decisive role” of market forces in resource allocation, a commitment Xi had made early in his first terms that many investors say he has failed to deliver on.

“The party exercises overall leadership over all areas of endeavor in every part of the country,” the party said in a statement reflecting Xi’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the party and its place in contemporary Chinese society.

If no clear successor to Xi is named to the new Politburo Standing Committee, it will further fuel speculation that Xi may look to retain power beyond the customary second five-year term.

“This is about further erasing any distinction between Xi Jinping and the party,” said Jude Blanchette, who studies the party at The Conference Board’s China Center for Economics and Business in Beijing, referring to Xi’s thought getting into the constitution.

“Add on to this having supply-side structural reform and One Belt One Road written into this, which were Xi’s signature policies, this makes questioning or non-compliance with those tantamount to betrayal of the party.”

THE MARKET AND THE PARTY

Xu Hongcai, deputy chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, a Beijing think-tank, said party control was needed to push through the market reforms key to restructuring the world’s second-largest economy.

“To build a market economic system in such a big country, it’s impossible without the leadership of the party,” he said.

Others have argued that the two are contradictory.

“When you put ‘supply-side reform’ and ‘market playing a decisive role’ in the same document, then that just shows they have to almost choose one,” said Alex Wolf, Senior Emerging Markets Economist with Aberdeen Standard Investments in Hong Kong.

China’s blue-chip shares climbed to a 26-month high on Tuesday, led by infrastructure and property stocks, as Xi wrapped up a congress that began with his three-and-a half hour speech envisioning a more prosperous, confident China. The yuan strengthened against the dollar.

CROWNING GLORY?

Xi rapidly consolidated power after assuming party leadership in late 2012 and then the presidency the next year. The party gave Xi the title of “core” leader a year ago, a significant strengthening of his position.

Whether Xi was able to have his name “crowned” in the party constitution had been seen as a key measure of his power, elevating him to a level of previous leaders exemplified by Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.

No other leader since Mao has had an eponymous ideology included in the document while in office. Deng’s name was added after his death in 1997.

A list of 133 committee members for the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection released on Tuesday included Zhao Leji, who heads the party’s Organisation Department, a strong sign that he will take over from Wang as anti-corruption chief.

China’s top banking regulator, Guo Shuqing, and veteran banker Jiang Chaoliang, front runners to succeed Zhou Xiaochuan as central bank governor, both made it to the Central Committee.

The constitutional amendment, along with Xi’s work report and a work report of the graft watchdog to the congress, were passed by a show of hands.

When Xi next asked for any “no” votes or abstentions for the amendment or two work reports, the sound of “none” echoed throughout the chamber, as officials shouted out from different sides of the hall.","China enshrines 'Xi Jinping Thought', key Xi ally to step down",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress/china-communist-party-enshrines-xi-jinping-thought-in-constitution-idUSKBN1CT0C9

Global output is expected to fall to 246.7 million hectoliters in 2017, down 8 percent from last year, the Paris-based International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) said in its first estimates for the year.

A hectoliter represents 100 liters, or the equivalent of just over 133 standard 75 cl wine bottles.

The global decline reflects a plunge in output in the European Union, where the world’s top three producers -- Italy, France and Spain -- are each projected to see a sharp drop.

The European Commission, the EU’s executive, estimates the bloc’s wine grape harvest will shrink to a 36-year low in 2017 as adverse weather from spring frosts and summer heatwaves takes its toll.

In France, the weather has affected most of the main growing regions including Bordeaux and Champagne, and the government has projected production will sink to its lowest in decades.

The OIV’s projections, which exclude juice and must (new wine), put Italian wine production down 23 percent at 39.3 million hectoliters, French output down 19 percent at 36.7 million and Spanish production down 15 percent at 33.5 million.

Reduced global production may erode a surplus over demand seen in recent years, when consumption was curbed by the effects of a world financial crisis in 2008.

The OIV said it was initially assuming a consumption range of 240.5 to 245.8 million hectoliters based on medium and longer-term trends, but did not yet have firm demand data for 2017.

However, the impact of reduced production on actual market supply and prices depends on levels of stocks from previous years and the quality of wine in landmark regions.

In France, the world’s leading exporter by value, producers have pointed to the prospect of good quality wine.

Outside Europe, the United States, the world’s fourth-largest producer and the biggest consumer, was expected to see output remain little changed at 23.3 million hectoliters, down 1 percent, the OIV said.

Production in Australia was expected to rise 6 percent to 13.9 million hectoliters while Argentina was projected to post a 25 percent jump to 11.8 million after a weather-hit 2016, the OIV said.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

The investigation by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) - known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) - was unanimously created by the 15-member U.N. Security Council in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November.

The JIM is due to report by Oct. 26 on who was responsible for an attack on April 4 on the town of Khan Sheikhoun, held by the opposition to Syrian president Bashar Al Assad, that killed dozens of people.

Russia wanted to discuss the report before voting on the extension of the mandate, and its U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia unsuccessfully asked to postpone the vote.

“Don’t try to create the impression that the JIM will be a dead letter unless we adopt this resolution today,” Nebenzia said prior to the vote.

“We are ready to return to extending the JIM after the publication of the report and after we discuss it after the 26 of October.”

A separate OPCW fact-finding mission determined in June that the banned nerve agent sarin had been used in the Khan Sheikhoun attack, which prompted the United States to launch missiles on a Syrian air base.

“Russia has once again demonstrated it will do whatever it takes to ensure the barbaric Assad regime never faces consequences for its continued use of chemicals as weapons,” U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, traveling in Africa, said in a statement.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

GM reported a net loss due to charges related to the sale of its European operations, but the automaker’s operating results beat Wall Street expectations and the company reaffirmed a forecast that 2017 financial results would be in line with last year’s record performance.

The automaker also assured investors it was on track to cut stocks of unsold vehicles in the U.S. to a manageable 70-days’ supply by the end of the year.

GM, rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI), and heavy machinery maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) all are benefiting from a strong U.S. economy, continued growth in China and a recovery in demand from Latin America.

In the case of the automakers, U.S. car and light truck sales have so far defied predictions of a significant slump. September sales hit the fastest pace in 12 years as residents of Texas and Florida rushed to replace cars damaged by storms.

The latest results sent GM shares up 2.3 percent to the highest levels since its initial public offering in 2010, amid a broad rally by U.S. manufacturing stocks.

GM over the past several months has regained its status as the largest U.S. automaker by market capitalization over electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).

Some of GM’s share price surge has come from investors betting on its investments in self-driving and electric cars. The company’s profits, however, are driven entirely by demand for its petrol-fueled trucks and SUVs in North America, and its growing sales in China.

The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it expects U.S. vehicle sales to remain stable at an annual pace of about 17 million light vehicles in 2017, “and we expect that in 2018 as well,” GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens told reporters on Tuesday.

The U.S. auto industry has been coming off a strong run of sales that culminated in a record 17.55 million units in 2016. Industry analysts have predicted a slight decline for U.S. new car sales in 2017, driven in part by a flood of nearly-new, low-mileage off-lease vehicles into the market.

GM’s share price has risen nearly 30 percent this year, in part as the company has highlighted efforts to put self-driving cars on the road. However, spending on autonomous vehicles and ride services amounted to just $150 million in the latest quarter, the company indicated in its financial report.

GM posted lower revenue for the quarter as it shuttered plants in North America to reduce production and tackle bloated inventory levels, especially of unpopular sedan models as consumers move increasingly to pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

GM had 76 days’ supply of unsold vehicles at the end of September, down from 88 days a month earlier and over 100 in the summer. The company’s wholesale volumes were down 26 percent versus the same quarter in 2016.

GM is taming its inventory problem in the United States in part by laying off about 3,100 temporary and full-time hourly workers, mainly at factories that build compact and midsize sedans. The rapid shift by U.S. consumers to SUVs and pickup trucks in response to low, stable gasoline prices has left GM with too many North American factories tooled to produce low-profit sedans, analysts said.

GM showed a pre-tax profit in North America despite the steep production cuts and heavy discounts. Stevens credited cost-cutting and a shift to higher-profit trucks and sport utility vehicles. The company cut North American production costs by $2 billion during the first nine months of 2017.

GM posted a quarterly net loss on Tuesday due to charges stemming from the sale of its Opel unit in Europe to France’s Peugeot SA (PEUP.PA).

Detroit-based GM posted a third-quarter net loss of $2.98 billion, or $2.03 per share, compared with a profit of $2.77 billion, or $1.71 per share a year earlier. Excluding discontinued operations, GM posted a net profit of 8 cents per share.

But excluding one-time charges, the company earned $1.32 a share, above analyst expectations of $1.14.

Revenue in the quarter fell to $33.6 billion from $38.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $32.72 billion.","GM's earnings beat, forecast lift shares; supply glut shrinks",https://www.reuters.com/article/gm-results/gms-earnings-beat-forecast-lift-shares-supply-glut-shrinks-idINKBN1CT1NP?il=0

The results are the first since Vishal Sikka quit as chief executive in August after a long row between the board and the company founders that frazzled investors and saw the return of Nandan Nilekani, a co-founder and a former CEO, as chairman.

Nilekani had said at the time he would prioritise finding a CEO, reconstituting the board and shaping future strategy. The company said the search for a new CEO is “progressing well” and it plans to stay the course on its future strategy.

“The management team along with the board of directors undertook a comprehensive review of our strategy ... Our current strategy continues to be relevant and we just need to accelerate the execution,” said U.B. Pravin Rao, interim CEO.

The Infosys board also reaffirmed that an internal investigation into alleged improprieties related to the acquisition of automation firm Panaya found no evidence of wrongdoing.

The company also said it would not make all findings of the investigation public. This drew criticism from some, who felt it leaves investors in the dark, especially as the founders, led by Narayana Murthy had faulted Sikka and former chair R. Seshasayee for not releasing all the findings previously.

“Investors will be left wondering as to the reasons why there was a need for a change of board in August,” said Shriram Subramanian, founder of shareholder advisory firm InGovern.

Sikka, Seshasayee and two others resigned from the board in August, ending a protracted battle with the founders, who accused the board of corporate governance lapses.

OUTLOOK CUT

Infosys cut its expected full-year revenue growth to 5.5 percent-6.5 percent in constant currency, compared with its previous guidance of a 6.5-8.5 percent increase.

Profit after tax rose 3.3 percent to 37.26 billion rupees ($573 million) in the second quarter, beating the average analysts’ estimate of 35.23 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Bengaluru-based Infosys said its revenue from operations rose 1.5 percent to 175.67 billion rupees in the second quarter. Revenue from the financial services segment rose marginally to 47.18 billion rupees.

Harit Shah, research analyst at Reliance Securities, said he had expected a trimming in the revenue growth forecast but had hoped for a smaller cut.

“The churn of top management and these board-related issues could have meant an impact in terms of clients freezing their programmes,” said Shah.

Infosys’s ADRs were trading down 3.5 percent at 1550 GMT after earlier dipping nearly 5 percent.

In an inaugural Bundestag session following the Sept. 24 federal election, lawmakers from the other parties showed their disdain for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party by overwhelmingly rejecting its candidate for deputy speaker.

Convention holds that each party represented in the Bundestag names a deputy speaker. But lawmakers spurned AfD candidate Albert Glaser in three rounds of voting.

Still, the AfD, which has become the first far-right group represented in Germany’s parliament for more than half a century, made clear its intention to shake up German politics on the national stage.

“The people have decided, now a new era begins,” AfD parliamentary leader Bernd Baumann told the chamber.

Schaeuble, who won 501 of 705 votes for the post of speaker, shot back in his maiden speech: “Nobody on their own represents the people.”

GRAVITAS

Germany’s longest serving lawmaker, 75-year-old Schaeuble is one of the country’s most respected politicians and seen as well qualified to tame recalcitrant lawmakers.

By agreeing to move to the Bundestag, Schaeuble has opened the way for the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) to take over his powerful Finance Ministry, helping to unblock talks on an expected new three-way coalition with the Greens.

The conservatives, FDP and Greens convene on Tuesday evening for coalition talks.

FDP leader Christian Lindner told broadcaster n-tv that Schaeuble was an extraordinary figure in German politics:

“He has gravitas, a clear position and a natural authority that will be good to have in a parliament that has just become more diverse, and where some manners may be called into question.”

The AfD’s Baumann shocked other lawmakers by suggesting that they had used Nazi-era tactics to prevent Glaser from taking a deputy speaker post. FDP politician Marco Buschmann said the comments were “beyond tasteless.”

The AfD can nominate an alternative candidate for deputy speaker. Although there is precedent for a party’s first choice being rejected, there is no precedent for a party failing to have any lawmaker accepted in the post.

The split is the latest sign of partisan feuding that current and former U.S. officials say is undercutting a House Intelligence Committee probe into Russia’s reported interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Republicans on the committee earlier this month subpoenaed an unidentified bank for the last two years of records of the accounts of Fusion GPS, the political research firm that hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to pull together the dossier on Trump.

The move was an apparent effort to find out who had paid for the work that led to the dossier. The firm assures its clients it will not disclose their identities.

Last week, Fusion GPS sued the unnamed bank in federal court in Washington, requesting a court order to block the subpoena.

In a Monday night court filing, lawyers for the House, saying they represented the Intelligence Committee, asked the court to reject Fusion’s request.

But the legal challenge was made without support from Democrats, throwing into further question a tradition of bipartisanship in Congress on intelligence issues.

Democrats, who are in the minority, and some Republicans on the House panel, want to investigate Russia’s role in the 2016 election, as well as allegations - so far unproven - that Trump’s team colluded with the Kremlin.

Representative Devin Nunes, the Intelligence Committee’s Republican chairman, and his allies have focused instead on other issues, including the activities of Fusion GPS.

Some Republicans, including Senator Charles Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, have charged that Fusion GPS took Russian money while compiling the dossier on Trump.

“Domestic American clients paid for Fusion GPS to research Donald Trump, period. No Russian was involved, in any way, in the payment to Fusion GPS for this work,” Joshua Levy, an outside attorney for the firm, said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday.

A footnote in Monday’s court filing says that House lawyers went to court to enforce the subpoena with the authorization of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the entire House.

But it adds that the House’s “Democratic Leader and Democratic Whip decline to support the Group’s position in this case.”

Representative Nancy Pelosi is the House Democratic leader, and Representative Steny Hoyer is the Democratic whip.

The top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff, was not immediately available for comment.

In their court filing, the House lawyers argue that Fusion GPS has no right to quash a valid congressional subpoena.

“The relief Plaintiff seeks is extraordinary and would directly impede an ongoing congressional investigation of the highest national importance,” they wrote in the filing.

The filing confirms Nunes retains control of the committee’s Russia probe, despite saying in April he would step aside and let fellow Republican Representative Mike Conaway take charge.

In an interview with German business daily Handelsblatt, Werner Hoyer also said the loss of the 16 percent of shareholder capital that Britain holds would force the bank to rein in its lending unless other member states stepped up to compensate.

The EIB, owned by the EU’s member states, uses their capital deposits as security to fund loans for research, infrastructure and environmental projects in Europe and around the world.

Hoyer said that the need to unwind positions in an orderly fashion meant that Britain would only see its cash allocation to the bank - a total of 3.5 billion euros (£3.1 billion) - in 2054, 35 years after the expected March 2019 exit date.

“As things stand, repayment will come only when the current loan portfolio, in which the British are participants, is fully recovered,” he told Handelsblatt.

A final decision on a further allocation of about 36 billion euros in capital from Britain, which was not paid in cash, has yet to be taken, but Hoyer said that under a proposal by lead Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, a British deposit could take the place of the shareholder capital, also until 2054.

A key Xi ally, top corruption fighter Wang Qishan, will not be on the new Politburo Standing Committee, the apex of power in China, to be revealed on Wednesday as he was not among those named on Tuesday to the 204-member Central Committee.

Whether or not the powerful Wang would remain on the Standing Committee, which currently has seven members, despite being beyond the customary retirement age of 69, had been among the key questions to be answered at the week-long party congress, which ended on Tuesday. Wang could still assume another senior role over the next few months.

As expected, the party unanimously passed an amendment to include “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” as one of its guiding principles.

The party will announce its new Standing Committee, headed by Xi, at around midday (0400 GMT) on Wednesday, culminating a twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle.

As expected, the amended constitution affirmed that Xi’s signature fight against corruption, which has ensnared more than 1.3 million officials, will continue.

Unexpectedly, Xi’s “Belt and Road” initiative, an ambitious program to build infrastructure linking China with its neighbors and beyond, was also included in the party constitution.

Also included was a commitment to supply-side industrial reforms, and giving play to the “decisive role” of market forces in resource allocation, a commitment Xi had made early in his first terms that many investors say he has failed to deliver on.

“The party exercises overall leadership over all areas of endeavor in every part of the country,” the party said in a statement reflecting Xi’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the party and its place in contemporary Chinese society.

If no clear successor to Xi is named to the new Politburo Standing Committee, it will further fuel speculation that Xi may look to retain power beyond the customary second five-year term.

“This is about further erasing any distinction between Xi Jinping and the party,” said Jude Blanchette, who studies the party at The Conference Board’s China Center for Economics and Business in Beijing, referring to Xi’s thought getting into the constitution.

“Add on to this having supply-side structural reform and One Belt One Road written into this, which were Xi’s signature policies, this makes questioning or non-compliance with those tantamount to betrayal of the party.”

THE MARKET AND THE PARTY

Xu Hongcai, deputy chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, a Beijing think-tank, said party control was needed to push through the market reforms key to restructuring the world’s second-largest economy.

“To build a market economic system in such a big country, it’s impossible without the leadership of the party,” he said.

Others have argued that the two are contradictory.

“When you put ‘supply-side reform’ and ‘market playing a decisive role’ in the same document, then that just shows they have to almost choose one,” said Alex Wolf, Senior Emerging Markets Economist with Aberdeen Standard Investments in Hong Kong.

China’s blue-chip shares climbed to a 26-month high on Tuesday, led by infrastructure and property stocks, as Xi wrapped up a congress that began with his three-and-a half hour speech envisioning a more prosperous, confident China. The yuan strengthened against the dollar.

CROWNING GLORY?

Xi rapidly consolidated power after assuming party leadership in late 2012 and then the presidency the next year. The party gave Xi the title of “core” leader a year ago, a significant strengthening of his position.

Whether Xi was able to have his name “crowned” in the party constitution had been seen as a key measure of his power, elevating him to a level of previous leaders exemplified by Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.

No other leader since Mao has had an eponymous ideology included in the document while in office. Deng’s name was added after his death in 1997.

A list of 133 committee members for the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection released on Tuesday included Zhao Leji, who heads the party’s Organisation Department, a strong sign that he will take over from Wang as anti-corruption chief.

China’s top banking regulator, Guo Shuqing, and veteran banker Jiang Chaoliang, front runners to succeed Zhou Xiaochuan as central bank governor, both made it to the Central Committee.

The constitutional amendment, along with Xi’s work report and a work report of the graft watchdog to the congress, were passed by a show of hands.

When Xi next asked for any “no” votes or abstentions for the amendment or two work reports, the sound of “none” echoed throughout the chamber, as officials shouted out from different sides of the hall.","China enshrines 'Xi Jinping Thought', key Xi ally to step down",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress/china-enshrines-xi-jinping-thought-key-xi-ally-to-step-down-idUSKBN1CT0C9

Corker, the only Senate Republican not seeking re-election next year, accused the president of telling falsehoods that could easily be proven wrong and of willfully damaging the country’s standing in the world, exposing deepening divisions in the Republican Party under Trump’s White House.

“The president has great difficulty with the truth on many issues,” Corker told CNN in the first of a series of interviews at the Capitol hours before Trump was due to meet with senators to seek consensus on proposed tax cuts.

“Unfortunately world leaders are very aware that much of what he says is untrue,” said Corker, in the sharpest of his bitter public exchanges with the president in recent weeks. “Certainly people here are, because these things are provably untrue. They’re just factually incorrect and people know the difference.”

Speaking later to reporters, Corker called Trump a bully.

Trump hit back on Twitter after Corker’s television interviews, calling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman “incompetent” and reprising one of his trademark derisive nicknames.

“He doesn’t have a clue as the entire World WAS laughing and taking advantage of us. People like liddle’ Bob Corker have set the U.S. way back,” Trump tweeted.

Although he is a foreign policy specialist, Corker is also a key player in the tax debate. His support could be crucial as Republicans seek passage of the White House-backed tax plan in the closely divided Senate. [nL2N1MZ0SH]

The senator from Tennessee, whose recent announcement he would not seek re-election in November 2018 has freed him from the need to stick to a voter-friendly script, pulled no punches in his onslaught against Trump. He acknowledged that tensions between the two men, once allies, have been building for months.

The Trump-Corker clash is the latest to erupt in what has been a sometimes fraught relationship between the president and the politicians who should be his partners in Congress.

Trump pilloried Senate Republicans - as a group and by name - after their failure this summer to repeal and replace the 2010 healthcare law known as Obamacare, one of his top presidential campaign promises.

While Corker’s comments were the strongest yet from a fellow Republican, Trump has also provoked the ire of another respected senior Republican, John McCain, whose war record he mocked.

McCain’s barbs prompted Trump last week to tell the 80-year-old senator, who has brain cancer, to be careful because “I fight back.”

The latest exchange began early Tuesday morning when Corker advised the White House not to interfere in lawmakers’ tax deliberations and called Trump’s lunch a “photo op.”

Later, Trump took to Twitter to belittle Corker, a national security adviser on his presidential campaign, with an early morning tweet in which he anticipated opposition for his administration’s tax plan.

“Bob Corker, who ... couldn’t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts,” Trump wrote.

That prompted a retort on Twitter from Corker, “Same untruths from an utterly untruthful president.”

With the tax plan, Trump is hoping to notch up his first major legislative win - something that has so far eluded him even though Republicans both chambers of Congress.

TWEETS CAUSE TENSIONS

Tensions with Corker erupted this month when Trump said Corker “begged” for his endorsement as he weighed running for re-election and Corker responded by calling Trump’s White House an “adult day care center.”

Trump has also blamed Corker for the Iran nuclear deal forged under Democratic President Barack Obama. Every Republican, including Corker, voted against the 2015 accord.

In his CNN interview, Corker assailed Trump for telling falsehoods that are easily disproven and questioned why he persisted in doing so.

“I don’t know why he lowers himself to such a low, low standard and debases our country in that way but he does but he does.”

“He is purposely breaking down relationships we have around the world that had been useful to our nation. ... I think the debasement of our nation is what he’ll be remembered most for.”

Corker, who was an early backer of Trump’s White House campaign at a time when many senior Republicans were expressing doubts, said he would not support him again.

“I was one of those - that hoped he would rise to the occasion as president and aspire to lead our nation instead of divide it,” he told reporters at the Capitol. “He has not risen to the occasion.”",Uncorked: senior Republican senator's ire at Trump bubbles over,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-corker/senator-corker-assails-trump-as-untruthful-inept-cnn-idINKBN1CT1YT?il=0

Building on their traditional expertise in factory automation, the conglomerates’ digital divisions are adding cutting-edge software and systems that help customers design, build and test their products faster and more cheaply.

In so doing they bring new value to companies historically linked mainly to customers in the power, energy and mining sectors that have had to slash spending in the past few years due to a precipitous drop in commodity prices.

Not only is the divisions’ growth outstripping that of legacy fossil-fuel businesses, but a trend towards breaking out their earnings separately in company reports allows investors to see value that was previously buried.

“Your industrial company today is not your dirty factory bending metals and producing simple and large objects,” said Andreas Fruschki, director of equity research, Europe at AllianzGI.

“It’s a more high-tech, nimble assembly site.” Their efforts are attracting the attention of investors looking for less obvious technology plays as the tide turns against U.S. stocks like Facebook (FB.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Google (GOOGL.O), due to their uncomfortably lofty valuations.

Meanwhile in Asia the soaring market capitalisation of a handful of companies such as China’s Alibaba (BABA.N) and Tencent (0700.HK) means investors in exchange traded funds (ETFs) who want exposure to a range of companies are finding themselves increasingly exposed to a single sector.

The growth opportunities in European industrials are still limited by legacy businesses, however, said Neil Campling, head of global TMT research at Northern Trust Capital Markets.

The oil & gas and mining sectors have cut capital expenditure to $706 billion in 2016 from $1.29 trillion in 2013, according to figures from S&P Global, which added that a slight recovery is expected in 2017.

“But you’re certainly seeing that factory automation, machine vision, automation, industry 4.0, improvements in supply chain systems, all these kinds of things ... (are) enjoying very strong growth,” Campling added.

INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE

Siemens’ Digital Factory, widely seen as the global leader in industrial software, only started reporting separate results in the German company statements in 2015.

The 13 percent of 2016 revenue it contributed is still small fry compared with the power and energy divisions’ 40 percent. But while sales in Siemens’ power and gas segment declined 11 percent in the fiscal third quarter, digital saw 11 percent growth and accounted for more than a fifth of total profits.

Swiss power grids maker ABB is also winning investors’ attention thanks to its robotics segment, although oil & gas, mining and other industries still account for more than 40 percent of company revenues.

ABB Ability, a digital software and services platform that can connect to robots for remote monitoring and diagnostics, which partners with Microsoft (MSFT.O) and IBM (IBM.N), is starting to contribute to growth, ABB CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer said in a press release after the company released results for the second quarter that ended June 30.

Robotics orders jumped 12 percent year-on-year in the quarter to more than 25 percent of the company’s total.

While some technology assets have been developed in-house or through collaboration, others have come from acquisitions.

Siemens has spent more than $5 billion in the past 18 months acquiring industrial software companies while shedding legacy businesses like hearing aids and household appliances and preparing to list its giant healthcare unit.

ABB this year bought automation software firm B&R for almost $2 billion, the biggest acquisition under its current chief executive, to better challenge Siemens.

“The more exciting themes now are themes like automation, and that is definitely one we’ve angled our portfolios towards,” said Tim Crockford, European equities portfolio manager at Hermes. Crockford added German forklift truck and robotics maker Kion Group (KGX.DE) to his portfolio in 2016 on expectations for growing demand for warehouse automation, driven by e-commerce, via its acquisition of U.S. firm Dematic last year. Bank of America Merrill Lynch singled out Swedish machinery maker Atlas Copco (ATCOa.ST) for its SmartLink data monitoring programme for air compressors, which looks to anticipate problems before they arise, an example of how the “Internet of things” is transforming the way equipment works.

“Industrial companies with big software businesses generate stronger growth and profitability than their automation peers,” BAML said in a research note last month.

While the European industrials sector has outperformed the broader MSCI Europe benchmark over the past year, the companies still haven’t reached the heights of tech stocks like semiconductor manufacturers.

U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California issued her order late on Sunday, 10 months after the U.S. Supreme Court set aside a $399 million award against Samsung, whose devices include the Galaxy.

The three Apple patents covered design elements of the iPhone such as its black rectangular front face, rounded corners, and colorful grid of icons for programs and apps.

Koh’s order is a setback for Apple, which called a retrial unnecessary and said the award should be confirmed. The Cupertino, California-based company did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment.

Silicon Valley has closely followed the 6-1/2-year-old case.

Companies such as Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google have said an Apple win would encourage owners of design patents to sue for huge, unfair awards on products containing hundreds of features that are costly to develop.

The $399 million represented profit from Samsung’s sales of infringing smartphones, though the South Korean company has said it deserved reimbursement if it prevailed in the litigation.

It was part of a $548 million payment that Samsung made to Apple in December 2015.

The legal dispute concerned whether the “article of manufacture” for which Samsung owed damages included its entire smartphones, or only parts that infringed Apple patents.

Without deciding that question, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the Supreme Court last Dec. 6 that “the term ‘article of manufacture’ is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product.”

In Sunday’s order, Koh said the jury instructions at the original 2012 trial inaccurately stated the law on that issue.

She said Samsung may have been prejudiced if jurors were prevented from considering whether any infringement covered “something other than the entire phone.”

Apple contended that the jury instructions were “not erroneous,” and said it had proved that Samsung applied its patented designs to its “entire phones.”

Jurors initially awarded $1.05 billion to Apple, which was later reduced.

Samsung, in a statement, welcomed a new trial, calling it “a historic opportunity to determine how the U.S. Supreme Court’s guidance on design patent damages will be implemented.”

While the hotel and coffee shop operator saw a rise in first-half profit, analysts were concerned around signs of an impact from last year’s Brexit vote on the business.

“We remain attracted to the long-term growth prospects for Whitbread, but acknowledge that the potential woes for UK businesses and consumers due to Brexit will make for a bumpy ride,” analysts at Berenberg said in a note.

A certificarlo i dati Istat secondo cui l‘aspettativa di vita, in base alla quale si calcola l‘età per la pensione, è aumentata di 5 mesi tra il 2013 e il 2016. Con un aumento equivalente tra il 2016 e il 2019 si passa dagli attuali 66 anni e 7 mesi richiesti oggi per la pensione di vecchiaia a 67.

Nei mesi scorsi sindacati e alcune forze politiche avevano chiesto al governo di bloccare l‘aumento dell‘età pensionabile ma il governo ha risposto che non ci sono le risorse per interventi di questo tipo nella legge di Bilancio.

Nel 2016, spiega Istat, “per il totale dei residenti la speranza di vita alla nascita si attesta a 82 anni e 8 mesi (4 mesi in più sul 2015, 2 mesi in più sul 2014) e nei confronti del 2013 risulta essersi allungata di oltre sette mesi”.

Per le donne è alla nascita di 85 anni con un vantaggio nei confronti degli uomini (80 anni e 6 mesi) pari a circa 4 anni e 5 mesi di vita in più.

“La speranza di vita aumenta in ogni classe di età. A 65 anni arriva a 20,7 anni per il totale dei residenti, allungandosi di cinque mesi rispetto a quella registrata nel 2013. A tale età la prospettiva di vita ulteriore presenta una differenza meno marcata tra uomini e donne (rispettivamente 19,1 e 22,3 anni) che alla nascita”, spiega ancora l‘Istituto di statistica.

Sempre sul tema pensioni, oggi la Corte Costituzionale deciderà sulla legittimità del decreto Poletti che prevede una rivalutazione parziale degli assegni al tasso di inflazione.

L‘adeguamento delle pensioni al tasso di inflazione è stato bloccato dalla riforma Fornero del 2012 per ragioni di bilancio, misura poi ammorbidita dal governo Letta che ne prevedeva la durata fino al 2016.

L‘esecutivo Renzi l‘ha però prolungata fino al 2018 stabilendo che ci sarà una rivalutazione in base all‘inflazione del 100% per gli assegni fino a tre volte il minimo Inps (circa 1.500 euro al mese), con un graduale calo fino al 45% per quelli oltre sei volte il minimo.

At 10:28 a.m. ET, the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was up 46.82 points, or 0.3 percent, to 15,902.58.

The index, which notched its sixth straight week of gains last week, rose as high as 15,922.19 earlier in the session, putting it within striking distance of the index’s record of 15,943.09, reached on Feb. 21.

Of the index’s 10 main groups, eight were on positive ground, with utilities and healthcare the only declining groups.

CN, Canada’s largest rail operator, added 1.4 percent to C$104.89 ahead of its earnings, due after markets close. The overall industrials sector added 0.7 percent.

Canadian Natural Resources rose 1.6 percent to C$41.79, while the broader energy group climbed 0.4 percent. Oil prices were higher after top exporter Saudi Arabia said it was determined to end a supply glut and forecasters were expecting a further drop in U.S. crude inventories.

U.S. crude prices were up 0.6 percent to $52.23 a barrel, while Brent crude added 0.5 percent to $57.63.

Banks and other financial services was up 0.4 percent, with some Canada’s top banks marking influential, but modest gains.

The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 0.1 percent. Fertilizer maker, Potash Corp rose 1.7 percent to C$24.825, while Agrium Inc also advanced 1.7 percent to C$138.55.

First Quantum Minerals Ltd was up 1 percent to C$15.07 after Barclays raised its target price on the company.

Hudson’s Bay Co shares, which surged as much as 8.7 percent after the company announced an investment deal and the sale of a 5th Ave property, pared earlier gains to trade up 2.1 percent at C$12.00.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the TSX by 135 to 108, for a 1.25-to-1 ratio on the upside.

The company also raised its full-year forecasts for sales and earnings, expecting revenue in its construction business to surge about 20 percent and mining business to jump 30 percent.

The construction industry in North America is turning around after years of slow demand, fueled by a steady housing recovery, an improving labor market and higher spending by oil and gas companies.

Sales in North America, Caterpillar’s biggest market, jumped 27 percent in the third quarter ended Sept 30. Construction revenue from the region rose 31 percent to $2.17 billion and revenue from resources, including mining, rose 28 percent to $581 million.

Some analysts, however, questioned if the company could sustain such high growth rates.

“Sustainability of the scorching pace of growth Caterpillar set in the latest quarter is in question because construction spending in the country has not yet hit an inflection point,” said Jefferies analyst Steve Volkmann.

In the Asia Pacific region, Caterpillar’s third-biggest, sales jumped 57 percent to $1.29 billion, boosted by demand from China.

While China has been the bright spot for Caterpillar in the past few quarters, the pace of growth in the country’s property sector cooled in the third quarter, potentially hurting demand for the company’s iconic yellow earth-moving equipment in the near future.

Caterpillar's shares rose to an all-time high of $140.44, but pared some gains to trade up 5 percent at $138.37. The stock has risen 42 pct this year, compared with an 18 percent increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI.

Excluding restructuring costs, Caterpillar earned $1.95 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.27 per shares, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The earnings beat was even more remarkable as analysts had raised their third-quarter estimates by nearly 30 percent in the past three months.

Net profit rose nearly four-fold to $1.06 billion.

Total revenue rose to $11.41 billion, ahead of market estimates of $10.65 billion.

The company said it now expects 2017 sales and revenue of $44 billion, up from its previous forecast of $42 billion to $44 billion.

Microsoft filed the lawsuit in April 2016 arguing that the U.S. government was violating the constitution by preventing the company from informing its customers about government requests for their emails and other documents. reut.rs/2zLIjv0

The annual inflation rate rose to 1.6 percent last month from 1.4 percent in August, the highest since April and matching economists’ forecasts.

Underlying measures of inflation watched by the Bank of Canada also firmed, with CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, rising to 1.5 percent.

CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, held at 1.8 percent after the previous month was revised higher, while CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy’s underperformance, was unchanged at 1.5 percent.

The Bank of Canada, which is largely expected to hold interest rates at 1 percent next week after two back-to-back increases, has an inflation target of 2 percent.

Overall, prices were up in six of the eight major components of the consumer price index, led by a 3.8 percent annual increase in transportation costs. That was driven by higher gasoline prices amid supply disruptions due to Hurricane Harvey.

“Direi assolutamennte no, l‘intenzione non è certo quella di considerare un break up, ma di rilanciare l‘azienda compatibilmete con il recupero del mercato”, ha spiegato il manager.

Quanto all‘arbitrato in corso con Gazprom sulla mancata commessa per il gasdotto South Stream, ha detto: “L‘arbitrato è un processo lungo che vede una serie di passaggi progressivi, entro il 2017 non ci aspettiamo nessuna risoluzione, da come vanno le cose si puo immaginare la fine del prossimo anno. Siamo aperti a trovare soluzioni di compromesso”.

Cao ha citato poi anche l‘accordo appena siglato di cooperazione con Rosneft a latere dell‘incontro di Verona della scorsa settimana “nel complesso la situazione è in evoluzione che può vedere aggiornamenti”.

Infine sul ritorno alla cedola, “il dividendo viene proposto dal Cda all‘assemblea. Al momento non stiamo ancora trattando il tema”.

The U.S.-North Korea situation is becoming more fraught as both sides attempt to pile on pressure, pushing prospects for talks further away.

Just two months ago, I argued that Americans needed to put North Korea’s missile tests in perspective. (“Yes, they’re worrying. But the U.S. mainland is not in imminent danger.”) Now I’m slightly less sanguine: either side could make a catastrophic miscalculation while tensions persist. Even before Trump’s decision on Iran, the prospects for negotiations were diminishing.

Paul Wallace: How money will divide Europe after Brexit

For one, things got personal. Following an incendiary Sept. 19 speech at the U.N. General Assembly in which Trump called Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man” and threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, Kim wrote a personal letter, carried by Pyongyang’s main newspaper, calling Trump a “dotard,” among other things.

Insults and mudslinging have become part of the currency in U.S. domestic politics, but what works on the campaign trail won’t work with North Korea. There, the dignity and image of the leader is near-sacred and name-calling will be counterproductive. Elite politicking in Pyongyang is in no small part about competing to show loyalty to the supreme leader. Debate does take place at very senior levels, but only before Kim announces a position — never in contradiction to it. Any North Korean voices promoting a softer line will have been further hushed by the personal offense Kim has taken and by his forceful rhetorical pushback.

Second, the U.N. Security Council tightened sanctions against Pyongyang in August and September. These have banned all North Korea’s major exports, including textiles, seafood and coal as well as joint ventures with foreign companies and new contracts hiring North Koreans as laborers abroad. China’s agreement to these measures was key and some degree of enforcement seems to be taking place.

This reinforces Pyongyang’s bunker mentality. The zero-sum game it sees with Washington is now compounded by China’s “betrayal” in supporting these sanctions. North Korea feels it is in a life-or-death struggle and cannot be seen to flinch at this, its most difficult strategic moment in the 21st century. Given the extreme level of state control over its citizens, North Korea is also well positioned to endure suffering and tolerate a severe economic contraction.

This brings us to Iran, where the political system is partially democratic and where sanctions did indeed contribute to voices of compromise in Tehran’s government. This led to negotiations and, finally, in 2015 the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), usually referred to as the Iran nuclear deal.

The agreement is not perfect. After many years of talks, however, European and U.S. negotiators thought the deal was the best they could get. The deal does make it extremely difficult for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Iran’s uranium stockpiles have been reduced by over 95 percent, its centrifuges by over 60 percent and its ability to enrich uranium has been capped far below the threshold for nuclear weapons. Inspections verify this at all points in the supply and production chains.

The agreement’s limitations include having expiration dates on these restrictions. It also does not include curbs on Tehran’s missile programs. But Trump’s refusal to re-certify Iran’s compliance last week seems largely because of Iran’s other moves in the Middle East, including support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Trump’s Oct. 13 speech has not killed the deal – at least not yet – but it does kick the ball over to Congress, which now has to determine whether to pull out or remain. It’s not clear what Congress will do but the deal will be in jeopardy if Congress decides to resurrect pre-deal sanctions or introduce new ones.

Crucially, International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and all the other parties to the Iran agreement, including the European Union, Germany and U.N. Security Council members China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom say Iran is in compliance and that the deal should remain in place. In various statements they have all said the deal should continue to be adhered to.

Trump laid out a broader policy in which he wants to pressure U.S. allies into redoing the deal, while also trying to contain Iran’s other activities in the region more actively. But blowing up the deal would only further isolate Washington on the world stage.

This is important in terms of taking the high ground in the tensions with North Korea. Many countries in the international community, especially China, have been trying to coax North Korea back to negotiations, but they have been consistently rebuffed. Pyongyang officials argue that their country has a right to have nuclear weapons and that they are a necessity as deterrence against their old enemy.

On top of that, the North Korean authorities now can say: “See? Even if we come back to talks and make a deal with the United States, how can we trust them? Why would we ever give up our nuclear weapons for an agreement with this country?” To be fair, the regime already doesn’t trust the U.S. for its own reasons, but now it can justify it to the international community and make it harder for America’s allies to credibly argue against it.

Moreover, will China and Russia sign on to further U.N. Security Council resolutions against North Korea when the United States has shown itself to be so reticent to abide by complicated, negotiated solutions? These two countries may even lose patience with enforcing U.N. sanctions if they perceive the Trump administration to be only focused on pressure as a punitive measure rather than an attempt to find constructive solutions.

A negotiated solution to the North Korea crisis now seems well beyond the horizon. Trump’s jeopardizing of the Iran deal nudges it even further away. Until it comes into view, we all need to hope that neither side makes a mistake as they try to project toughness during this fraught period.",Commentary: Trump’s Iran decision hurts chance of a North Korea deal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abrahamian-northkorea-commentary/commentary-trumps-iran-decision-hurts-chance-of-a-north-korea-deal-idUSKBN1CO2CY

The latest exchange between the two Republicans was triggered by Trump in a salvo on Twitter in which he anticipated opposition from Corker for his administration’s tax reform plan.

“Bob Corker, who ... couldn’t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts,” Trump wrote on Twitter.

That prompted a retort on Twitter from Corker, “Same untruths from an utterly untruthful president.”

Halawa, who was born and raised in Dublin and is a son of the most senior Muslim cleric in Ireland, was 17 when he was arrested along with hundreds of others in 2013 as part of a crackdown on protests in Egypt.

“It still feels like a dream, it’s a moment I’ve waited for four years. I‘m a free man. I‘m hoping I can get my life back, get back to college and get my career,” a smiling Halawa, draped in an Irish flag, told reporters upon his arrival home.

Halawa thanked the Irish people, the government and his family for working hard to secure his release. A member of the Irish government, which had lobbied for his return, was among the well-wishers.

Halawa and three of his sisters were charged along with nearly 500 others with crimes including breaking into a mosque, killing 44 people, and illegal possession of firearms in violence that followed the military’s overthrow of Egypt’s Islamist president, Mohamed Mursi, in 2013.

The Halawas said they were on vacation visiting extended family in Egypt and joined a protest against the military’s ouster of Mursi while they were there.

The defendants had all faced the death penalty and though none received it, hundreds were given hefty jail sentences. Halawa’s sisters were released shortly after their arrests.

“This case has been one of the most complex, sensitive and difficult consular cases to which the Irish Government has ever responded. I and all of my colleagues are very pleased Ibrahim’s ordeal is now at an end,” Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said in a statement.

Halawa has said he was regularly tortured during his period in detention. The Egyptian authorities have repeatedly denied allegations of abuses from rights groups.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State from the Bureau Of Population, Refugees and Migration said at a Senate hearing, when pressed to say whether he viewed the situation as ethnic cleansing.

Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar’s Rakhine state since security forces responded to Rohingya militants’ attacks on Aug. 25 by launching a crackdown the United Nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing.

Myanmar, also known as Burma, rejects that accusation, insisting action was needed to combat “terrorists” who killed civilians.

But it has left the world community counting the cost as international organizations and the government of Bangladesh, which has taken in the vast majority of the refugees, race to provide food, water and medical care.

Many U.S. lawmakers have clamoured for a strong U.S. response to the crisis and criticized government leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace laureate once hugely popular in Washington, for failing to do more.

“She’s an impressive person, but she’s not taking on the challenge,” said Senator Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

The bemused bovine and camera-wielding humans stared at each other through a chain-link fence for several minutes, according to live news video.

At other times the beast wandered curiously around the 526-acre (212-acre) Prospect Park, the largest in the borough of Brooklyn, and the artificial turf field normally used for human sporting events.

Officers used soccer goals to fence the animal in on a baseball diamond, but the cow barreled through one of the nets, knocking down a police officer.

Police eventually trapped the cow between two vehicles parked on either side of baseball field’s bench area after an officer appeared to fire a tranquilizer dart at it.

Officers then seemed content to let the cow roam between cars, waiting for the drug to take effect before they were able to rope the beast and load it into an NYPD horse trailer.

It was not clear where the beast came from or how it got lost. Police said they would turn it over to the animal control department after they caught it.

The chase drew torrents of posts on social media, many featuring groan-inducing puns.

In the western city of Kisumu, around 2,000 demonstrators marched on the election board offices, witnesses said, responding to Raila Odinga’s appeal for protests against Thursday’s repeat presidential ballot. They dispersed peacefully.

Odinga is boycotting the contest against incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta. He says it will not be free and fair because the election board has not made sufficient progress in carrying out reforms he demanded after the original election held in August was annulled.

Odinga had urged his supporters to ensure Thursday’s vote did not take place, repeatedly saying there would be “no elections”.

But on Tuesday he told the BBC he was not calling for protests on polling day itself. “We have not told people to protest on polling day. We have not said that at all. We have told people to stay away,” he said in a radio interview.

When called for clarification, Odinga’s spokesman said he was saying “peaceful protests” would still take place and that the opposition would fully explain their plans on Wednesday.

The country’s Supreme Court is still hearing several cases challenging the legality of Thursday’s poll or Odinga’s withdrawal.

At least 49 people have died in political violence since the August ballot, evoking unwelcome memories of the aftermath of a disputed 2007 poll, when more than 1,200 people were killed.

The political stand-off has also blunted growth in East Africa’s richest economy, a nation valued for its stability and relative freedom in a region roiled by conflict.

Last week Odinga supporters disrupted at least three official pre-polling events. Police said some election board staff were seriously injured.

POLL DELAY?

The head of the election board said last week it was not clear a free and fair poll could take place due to intimidation and political interference.

His comments followed the resignation of an election commissioner, who fled the country and released a statement saying she had been threatened, although she did not say who had done so.

A day before the Aug. 8 poll, another member of the election board had been found tortured and murdered.

On Monday, the International Crisis Group, a global thinktank, called for a delay in the election, saying “proceeding under current conditions would deepen Kenya’s ethnic cleavages and prolong a stalemate that has already claimed dozens of lives and come at a high economic cost.”

Both the election board and the government have said the vote will go ahead, irrespective of whether Odinga contests it, and only a court ruling could legally delay the re-run ballot beyond the end of October.

On Tuesday, police fired tear gas and bullets into the air to disperse protesters in the capital Nairobi.

In Kisumu, an Odinga stronghold, demonstrators said that the polls should not take place, but were unclear on how they should be stopped.

“All we know is that there will be no elections. As to how this will be done, we are waiting for the big announcement by Baba (Odinga) tomorrow,” said one demonstrator, market trader James Ouma.

Around him protesters waved branches and blew whistles as they marched.

Kenyatta officially won the first election, on Aug. 8, by 1.4 million votes, but the Supreme Court annulled that vote on Sept. 1 over procedural irregularities.

After the Supreme Court ruling, Odinga’s team presented a list of demands to the election board.

Some have been met - opposition monitors will now have access to the board’s computers as results come in, a key official has gone on an extended holiday, and results will not be transmitted without a copy of a paper form from tallying centres.

The board said it was impossible to meet other demands - such as changing the technology provider - in the short time frame allotted for new elections.

The split is the latest sign of partisan feuding that current and former U.S. officials say is undercutting a House Intelligence Committee probe into Russia’s reported interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Republicans on the committee earlier this month subpoenaed an unidentified bank for the last two years of records of the accounts of Fusion GPS, the political research firm that hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to pull together the dossier on Trump.

The move was an apparent effort to find out who had paid for the work that led to the dossier. The firm assures its clients it will not disclose their identities.

Last week, Fusion GPS sued the unnamed bank in federal court in Washington, requesting a court order to block the subpoena.

In a Monday night court filing, lawyers for the House, saying they represented the Intelligence Committee, asked the court to reject Fusion’s request.

But the legal challenge was made without support from Democrats, throwing into further question a tradition of bipartisanship in Congress on intelligence issues.

Democrats, who are in the minority, and some Republicans on the House panel, want to investigate Russia’s role in the 2016 election, as well as allegations - so far unproven - that Trump’s team colluded with the Kremlin.

Representative Devin Nunes, the Intelligence Committee’s Republican chairman, and his allies have focused instead on other issues, including the activities of Fusion GPS.

Some Republicans, including Senator Charles Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, have charged that Fusion GPS took Russian money while compiling the dossier on Trump.

“Domestic American clients paid for Fusion GPS to research Donald Trump, period. No Russian was involved, in any way, in the payment to Fusion GPS for this work,” Joshua Levy, an outside attorney for the firm, said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday.

A footnote in Monday’s court filing says that House lawyers went to court to enforce the subpoena with the authorization of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the entire House.

But it adds that the House’s “Democratic Leader and Democratic Whip decline to support the Group’s position in this case.”

Representative Nancy Pelosi is the House Democratic leader, and Representative Steny Hoyer is the Democratic whip.

The top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff, was not immediately available for comment.

In their court filing, the House lawyers argue that Fusion GPS has no right to quash a valid congressional subpoena.

“The relief Plaintiff seeks is extraordinary and would directly impede an ongoing congressional investigation of the highest national importance,” they wrote in the filing.

The filing confirms Nunes retains control of the committee’s Russia probe, despite saying in April he would step aside and let fellow Republican Representative Mike Conaway take charge.

Over 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar since Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response by the Myanmar army that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.

At a meeting in Myanmar’s capital Naypyitaw, attended by Myanmar’s home affairs minister lieutenant general Kyaw Swe and his Bangladeshi counterpart Asaduzzaman Khan, the countries signed two agreements covering security and border cooperation.

The two sides have also agreed to “to halt the outflow of Myanmar residents to Bangladesh,” and “to form a joint working group,” Tin Myint, permanent secretary from Myanmar’s home affairs ministry told reporters after the meetings.

“After joint working group, the verification, (the) two countries have agreed to arrange different steps so that these people can return to their homeland safely and honourably and in secure conditions,” said Mostafa Kamal Uddin, secretary from Bangladeshi home affairs ministry.

The officials did not elaborate on the specific steps the authorities would take for the repatriation, adding that the bulk of discussions was dedicated to border and security cooperation agreements which have been long in the making.

Tin Myint said the two countries agreed “to restore normalcy in Rakhine to enable displaced Myanmar residents to return from Bangladesh at the earliest opportunity.”

He also said Myanmar had sent a list of suspects who had fled to Bangladesh and requested the authorities there to investigate and return them to Myanmar.

Thousands of refugees have continued to arrived cross the Naf river separating Myanmar’s western Rakhine state and Bangladesh in recent days, even though Myanmar says military operations ceased on Sept. 5.

The United States said on Monday it was considering a range of further actions over Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority.

While on Tuesday the officials said the talks were friendly, tensions are still high between the two countries. Bangladesh last month accused Myanmar of repeatedly violating its air space and warned that any more “provocative acts” could have “unwarranted consequences”.

On border and security, the two sides decided to establish border liaison offices, carry out regular meetings between two security forces, jointly combat drug trafficking across the border and set up a mechanism to communicate directly.

Bangladesh has for decades faced influxes of Rohingya fleeing persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where the Rohingya are seen as illegal migrants. It was already home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya before the latest crisis.

Though Rohingya families have lived in Myanmar for generations, they are denied citizenship and access to basic civil rights such as freedom of movement, decent education and healthcare.

But in a profanity-laced appearance on the Howard Stern radio show he scoffed at the idea of him as a senator, saying it was obvious he was never serious.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, a Vietnamese, are charged with murdering Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a chemical nerve agent, at Kuala Lumpur’s budget international terminal on Feb. 13.

Defense lawyers say the women thought they were involved in a prank for a reality TV show when they encountered a man at the airport and did not know they were handling poison.

The two women were brought back to the scene as part of an entourage of court officials, led by trial judge Azmi Ariffin and accompanied by over 200 police officers and dozens of journalists, on a visit to retrace the events that unfolded before, during and after Kim Jong Nam’s death.

Defense lawyers requested the visit after video recordings of the women on airport closed-circuit television were screened in court.

Gooi Soon Seng, Siti Aisyah’s lawyer, said the visit was necessary to verify the surroundings and locations where the prosecution say the murder took place.

“The CCTV footages were taken from various cameras and various places, so from there we couldn’t get a complete picture on how (the incident) took place,” Gooi told a news conference after the visit.

The site visit covered various locations in the terminal shown in the videos, such as a restaurant where Siti Aisyah was seen meeting an unidentified man, the toilets where police witnesses said both women had gone to after the attack on Kim Jong Nam, the clinic where the victim sought medical aid and the taxi stands where both suspects were seen after the attack.

Huong appeared unwell midway through the three-hour site visit, while Siti Aisyah broke down in tears. Both women were then provided wheelchairs.

Defense lawyers later said both Huong and Siti Aisyah were exhausted from being weighed down by their bulletproof vests.

Recordings on Feb. 13 show Huong approaching Kim and grasping his face from behind near the airport’s check-in counters before quickly leaving. Siti Aisyah could not be seen but was identified by a police witness as a figure running in another direction. The videos also show the women heading to separate bathrooms to wash their hands.

Both women were seen meeting with two men, identified only as Mr. Chang and Mr. Y, before Kim Jong Nam’s death. According to police, the men had applied liquid on the women’s hands, and were among four suspects-at-large charged together with the women for the murder.

‘CLOSELY-WATCHED TRIAL’

The airport visit comes as the high-profile trial entered its third week. Twelve witnesses have testified so far.

Forensic and chemical weapons experts said Kim Jong Nam had died of nerve agent poisoning, and that VX had been found on Siti Aisyah and Huong’s clothes. Traces of the poison were also found under Huong’s fingernails.

Prosecutors say Siti Aisyah and Huong conspired with four others who are still at large to kill Kim Jong Nam.

South Korean and U.S. officials have said that Kim Jong Un’s regime was behind his half-brother’s death.

Kim Jong Nam, who was living in exile in Macau, had criticized his family’s dynastic rule of North Korea and his brother had ordered his execution, according to some South Korean lawmakers.

The stickers of the Holocaust victim wearing the jersey of Lazio’s city rivals AS Roma were found on walls and bathrooms in a section of Rome’s Olympic Stadium used by Lazio supporters during their Serie A match against Cagliari on Sunday.

The episode drew widespread criticism from Italian politicians and media, with President Sergio Mattarella calling it “inhuman and alarming for our country”.

GM reported a net loss due to charges related to the sale of its European operations, but the automaker’s operating results beat Wall Street expectations and the company reaffirmed a forecast that 2017 financial results would be in line with last year’s record performance.

The automaker also assured investors it was on track to cut stocks of unsold vehicles in the U.S. to a manageable 70-days’ supply by the end of the year.

GM, rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI), and heavy machinery maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) all are benefiting from a strong U.S. economy, continued growth in China and a recovery in demand from Latin America.

In the case of the automakers, U.S. car and light truck sales have so far defied predictions of a significant slump. September sales hit the fastest pace in 12 years as residents of Texas and Florida rushed to replace cars damaged by storms.

The latest results sent GM shares up 2.3 percent to the highest levels since its initial public offering in 2010, amid a broad rally by U.S. manufacturing stocks.

GM over the past several months has regained its status as the largest U.S. automaker by market capitalization over electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).

Some of GM’s share price surge has come from investors betting on its investments in self-driving and electric cars. The company’s profits, however, are driven entirely by demand for its petrol-fueled trucks and SUVs in North America, and its growing sales in China.

The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it expects U.S. vehicle sales to remain stable at an annual pace of about 17 million light vehicles in 2017, “and we expect that in 2018 as well,” GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens told reporters on Tuesday.

The U.S. auto industry has been coming off a strong run of sales that culminated in a record 17.55 million units in 2016. Industry analysts have predicted a slight decline for U.S. new car sales in 2017, driven in part by a flood of nearly-new, low-mileage off-lease vehicles into the market.

GM’s share price has risen nearly 30 percent this year, in part as the company has highlighted efforts to put self-driving cars on the road. However, spending on autonomous vehicles and ride services amounted to just $150 million in the latest quarter, the company indicated in its financial report.

GM posted lower revenue for the quarter as it shuttered plants in North America to reduce production and tackle bloated inventory levels, especially of unpopular sedan models as consumers move increasingly to pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

GM had 76 days’ supply of unsold vehicles at the end of September, down from 88 days a month earlier and over 100 in the summer. The company’s wholesale volumes were down 26 percent versus the same quarter in 2016.

GM is taming its inventory problem in the United States in part by laying off about 3,100 temporary and full-time hourly workers, mainly at factories that build compact and midsize sedans. The rapid shift by U.S. consumers to SUVs and pickup trucks in response to low, stable gasoline prices has left GM with too many North American factories tooled to produce low-profit sedans, analysts said.

GM showed a pre-tax profit in North America despite the steep production cuts and heavy discounts. Stevens credited cost-cutting and a shift to higher-profit trucks and sport utility vehicles. The company cut North American production costs by $2 billion during the first nine months of 2017.

GM posted a quarterly net loss on Tuesday due to charges stemming from the sale of its Opel unit in Europe to France’s Peugeot SA (PEUP.PA).

But excluding one-time charges, the company earned $1.32 a share, above analyst expectations of $1.14.

The fiscal update will show a sharp improvement in the nation’s balance sheet since the March budget, as stronger economic growth boosted revenues, but is unlikely to project balanced budgets anywhere on the horizon, economists said.

“It basically boils down to the fact that the economy looks like it’s going to grow by more than 3 percent this year, when they were basing their assumptions on growth of less than 2 percent back in March,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.

In March, the government projected a budget deficit of C$28.5 billion in the 2017-2018 fiscal year, which ends in March, up from the C$17.8 billion shortfall the previous year. At the time, economists said their economic assumptions looked easy to beat, all but guaranteeing they could boast of an improvement later.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has been badly shaken by a conflict-of-interest controversy surrounding Morneau, but hopes the fiscal update will reset pubic focus on the strong economy.

The Liberals won a surprise majority in 2015 pledging to run C$10 billion annual deficits to spur the economy, and the Bank of Canada has said the fiscal stimulus, which included a family tax credit, boosted growth in recent quarters.

The fiscal update will include a pledge to boost payments made to families under the Canada child benefit program, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp reported, citing multiple sources.

A spokesman for Finance Minister Morneau declined to confirm the report, but hinted at further spending rather than fiscal restraint, and said there will be “good news” for the middle class.

“We will not only update on how well (our policy has) been working, but giving back as well, by re-investing in the people who are creating jobs and growing the economy - the small business tax cut is a good example of that,” Dan Lauzon said in an email.

Morneau, seeking to counter a backlash against a tax reform that targeted wealthy individuals and family businesses, said last week the government will cut the small business tax rate to 9 percent from 10.5 percent.","Canada to unveil smaller budget deficit, hopes will shift focus",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CT21L-OCATP

At 10:28 a.m. ET, the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was up 46.82 points, or 0.3 percent, to 15,902.58.

The index, which notched its sixth straight week of gains last week, rose as high as 15,922.19 earlier in the session, putting it within striking distance of the index’s record of 15,943.09, reached on Feb. 21.

Of the index’s 10 main groups, eight were on positive ground, with utilities and healthcare the only declining groups.

The Mumbai-based bank, which was recently added to the central bank’s list of lenders it considers “too big to fail”, posted a net profit of 41.51 billion rupees ($634 million) for its second quarter to Sept. 30, up 20 percent from a year ago, and in line with analysts’ estimates of 41.61 billion rupees.

With its focus on retail clients and relatively smaller exposure to segments such as infrastructure financing, HDFC Bank has the lowest bad loan ratio among top Indian lenders. That has made it an investor favourite in a sector marred by $146 billion of soured loans, which have choked fresh lending.

HDFC Bank has seen its loans grow at a faster pace than the sector average, and Deputy Managing Director Paresh Sukthankar said it was adding new clients as well as gaining market share with existing corporate borrowers, especially in the mid-sized segment which it brands as “emerging corporates”.

“It tends to be much more of working capital, medium-term, loans, not much of long-term loans although there are a few. And it’s essentially on the back of having gained market share,” he told a news conference after the results.

“On the retail side we’ve seen pretty strong growth across products.”

Wholesale loans grew 23.6 percent in the quarter, while retail loans grew 21.6 percent. That helped net interest income rise 22 percent. Non-interest revenue rose 24.3 percent, helping a steady core net interest margin of 4.3 percent, it said.

The bank’s gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans were largely stable at 1.26 percent at end-September compared with 1.24 percent at end-June, although higher than 1.02 percent a year earlier. Provisions, including for loan losses, fell sequentially.

HDFC Bank said the regulator had made “certain observations” about a loan exposure to an unnamed borrower, which it had made as part of a consortium and was being restructured, adding it had made sufficient provisions even as discussions continue.

Shares in HDFC Bank closed 0.2 percent higher in a Mumbai market that gained 0.22 percent.

The stock has rallied 54.8 percent this year, outperforming the sector index that has risen 33.3 percent and the main market index that has added 24.7 percent.

Britain’s EU departure in 2019 “certainly won’t be a piece of cake” and given that five rounds of divorce talks have not made enough progress, regulators must assume a “cliff edge situation”, Felix Hufeld, president of BaFin, said.

Regulators will need temporary solutions to avoid dangerous “distortions” in markets while entering the post-Brexit world, Hufeld said at an event in London.

Frankfurt is emerging among the winners in a battle between EU financial centres to attract banks in London who want to open new hubs in the bloc to continue serving customers there.

Goldman Sachs (GS.N) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said last week that he will be spending “a lot more time” in Germany’s financial centre.

New hubs being set up by UK-based lenders must not be empty shells, Hufeld said.

“Banks that are planning a comprehensive division of work between offices in London and the EU need to transplant and split up their entire ecosystem established over the years – that means IT infrastructures, knowledge, processes and people.”

But they will be allowed to continue using capital models approved by UK regulators “for a limited time period”.

Banks that want to save costs by managing in London risks from trades undertaken at new EU hubs, known as back-to-back, must have “adequately” trained risk management staff in case this model is no longer possible.

There was also a need to find the right balance for outsourcing hub activities to London, he added.

“What is not allowed is for the subsidiary in the EU not to have an adequate control system on-site, and to therefore be dependent on the sister or parent company in London in order to fulfil the necessary control functions,” Hufeld said.

Over 95 percent of euro denominated interest rate swaps, widely used by companies to insure themselves against adverse moves in borrowing costs, are cleared by the London Stock Exchange’s (LSE.L) LCH arm.

The EU has proposed a law that would, as a last resort, force a UK clearing house handled large amounts of euro swaps, to move to the EU if it still wanted to serve customers based there after Brexit.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

Under billionaire investor Kjell Inge Roekke, who controls a 40 percent stake, the Norwegian company has made eight acquisitions since 2014 including a merger with BP’s Norway operations in mid-2016.

To help fund the deal Aker said it would raise $500 million in new equity in a share issue fully underwritten by its top shareholders, investment firm Aker ASA (AKER.OL) which holds a 40 percent stake, and BP (BP.L), which owns 30 percent.

The price per share will be determined via a book building auction, with the minimum set at 155 Norwegian crowns, slightly above Monday’s close of 154.8 crowns in Oslo.

Following the deal, Aker BP plans to raise its dividend payout to $350 million per year from $250 million, with the first increase planned for its fourth-quarter dividend.

Aker shares were up 6.85 percent at 165.4 Norwegian crowns.

The transaction raises Aker BP’s stakes to 100 percent in Norway’s Valhall and Hod fields, where it sees significant value creation potential through increased oil recovery and developing adjacent resources, it said.

The company plans to submit a development plan for the Valhall Flank West expansion project by the end of this year.

“Aker BP will subsequently seek to sell or swap a minority interest in the fields to partners who want to work together with Aker BP to proactively target the upside potential in the area,” it said.

“Aker BP will also assume Hess Norge’s tax positions, which include a tax loss carry forward with a net nominal after-tax value of $1.5 billion, as booked in Hess Norge’s 2016 annual accounts,” the company said.

Hess is the latest global oil company to abandon or scale back its presence in Norway, following partial divestment by BP (BP.L) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

Exxon Mobil and BP decided to no longer be field operators in Norway, though Exxon retains direct stakes in several fields and BP remains involved via its stake in Aker BP.

Hess separately announced a cost cutting program and said it also plans to sell its 61.5 percent stake in Denmark’s South Arne field.

“With the continued success of our asset sale program, we are focusing on higher return assets and reducing our breakeven oil price,” Chief Executive John Hess said in a statement.",Aker BP buys Hess' Norway unit for $2 billion,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hess-m-a-aker-bp/aker-bp-buys-hess-norway-unit-for-2-billion-idUSKBN1CT0J3

HBC also reaffirmed a commitment to its European operations despite opposition from activist investor Jonathan Litt, who is considering seeking the removal of some directors.

HBC shares jumped as much as 8.7 percent in Toronto, their biggest intraday gain in two months.

Hudson’s Bay also said private equity firm Rhone Capital will invest $500 million in HBC, with the transactions reducing its debt by C$1.6 billion ($1.3 billion) and increasing liquidity by C$1.1 billion.

“As we’ve said and done in the past multiple times, if there’s an opportunity for someone to give us a very high valuation on one of our assets, we’d be willing to sell it,” Richard Baker, HBC executive chairman and interim chief executive officer, told Reuters.

He added that WeWork, which provides shared workspace for entrepreneurs and startups, is paying a 30 percent premium to the Lord & Taylor building’s last appraised value.

The Lord & Taylor store in New York will operate through the 2018 holiday season, then be reduced in size to 150,000 square feet from the current 650,000 square feet, with the building converted to WeWorks’ headquarters.

HBC, which also owns the Saks Fifth Avenue chain, faces pressure to extract more value from its real estate assets at a time when brick-and-mortar retailers lose market share to more nimble online operators.

Litt, founder of hedge fund Land & Buildings, has valued HBC’s real estate at C$35 a share, and has called for HBC to sell some stores, convert them to alternate uses or go private.

He said on Monday he would call a special shareholder meeting to potentially remove directors. The abrupt departure of CEO Gerald Storch, announced on Friday, was an attempt by the board to “buy time and placate investors to address underperformance and undervaluation,” he said.

Land & Buildings holds about 5 percent of HBC shares.

Following the CEO announcement, Baker sought to ease concerns about potential cuts at its struggling German department store chain Kaufhof.

“We’re very committed to our HBC Europe enterprise, we’ve no interest, no discussion, no need of changing our strategy in any way, or selling the business to anybody,” he said on Tuesday.

WeWork will also lease space at Hudson’s Bay stores in Toronto and Vancouver and Galeria Kaufhof in Frankfurt. It could also add 20 WeWork locations in HBC businesses around the world, Baker said.

WeWork Cos said on Aug. 24 it received an additional $3 billion investment from Japan’s SoftBank Group and its Vision Fund to ramp up its expansion globally. SoftBank had already invested $1.4 billion to fund expansion in China, Japan, South Korea and elsewhere in southeast Asia.","Hudson's Bay to sell Lord & Taylor Fifth Ave building, shares jump",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CT1LC-OCATP

The Saudi energy minister said the focus remained on reducing oil stocks in industrialized countries to their five-year average and raised the prospect of prolonged output restraint once an OPEC-led supply-cutting pact ends.

The oil market has been concerned that, once the supply deal expires, producers will ramp up shipments again and cause prices to fall.

“When we get closer to that (five-year average) we will decide how we smoothly exit the current arrangement, maybe go to a different arrangement to keep supply and demand closely balanced so we don’t have a return to higher inventories,” the minister, Khalid al-Falih, told Reuters.

Brent crude, the global benchmark, was up 22 cents at $57.59 a barrel at 1324 GMT. It reached $59.49 on Sept. 26, its highest since July 2015. U.S. crude gained 34 cents to $52.24.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and nine other producers, have cut oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) since January. The pact runs to March 2018 and they are considering extending it.

Prices also drew support from expectations that U.S. crude inventories will show a drop of 2.5 million barrels in the latest weekly supply reports, which would be the fifth straight week of decline and a sign the OPEC-led cut is working.

The American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, releases its data at 2030 GMT on Tuesday. The U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration reports on Wednesday.

Oil was down earlier in the session as crude flows through Iraq’s northern pipeline to Ceyhan in Turkey rose further.

Pumping along the pipeline rose to 300,000 bpd on Tuesday, a shipping source said. Output fell from 600,000 bpd last week when Iraqi forces retook control of oilfields from Kurdish fighters.

Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, speaking during an investment conference in Riyadh, said on Tuesday the focus remained on reducing the level of oil stocks in OECD industrialized countries to their five-year average.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and nine other producers, have cut oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) since January. The pact runs to March 2018, but they are considering extending it.

“We are very flexible, we are keeping our options open. We are determined to do whatever it takes to bring global inventories down to the normal level which we say is the five-year average,” Falih told Reuters.

The market has been concerned that, once the supply cut deal comes to an end, producers will ramp up supplies again, causing prices to fall. But Falih raised the prospect of continued output restraint to prevent this.

“When we get closer to that (five-year average) we will decide how we smoothly exit the current arrangement, maybe go to a different arrangement to keep supply and demand closely balanced so we don’t have a return to higher inventories.”

The oil price LCOc1 has recovered from below $30 a barrel at the start of 2016 to trade above $57 on Tuesday, and rose after Falih’s comments. Oil remains, however, at half its price in mid-2014.

Reuters reported last week, citing OPEC sources, that producers were leaning towards extending the deal for nine months, although any decision could be postponed until early next year depending on the market.

Falih did not comment on an extension but said the cuts had reduced the supply overhang in storage by half.

“We have reduced the inventories by over 180 million barrels and we still have about 160 million barrels according to numbers I have seen last,” he told Reuters.

“The intent is to keep our hands on the wheel between now and until we get to a balanced market and beyond, we are not going to do anything that is going to disrupt the path we are on,” he added.

Falih said oil investment had returned after the OPEC-led pact began at the start of the year and helped by a global economic recovery.

The minister said there was consensus to continue the cuts until targets were reached to balance the market but said shocks to the market by reducing more than needed should be avoided.","Saudi determined to end oil glut, sees smooth exit for OPEC pact",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-opec-saudi/saudi-determined-to-end-oil-glut-sees-smooth-exit-for-opec-pact-idUSKBN1CT1H2

Still, growth in the world’s second-largest economy is projected to slow to 6.4 percent in 2018, the Reuters poll of more than 65 economists showed, as the property curbs and efforts to deal with debt risks are expected to gain more traction.

China’s property investment and construction are seen slowing as more cities try to curb surging housing prices, while a government campaign against riskier lending pushes up borrowing costs and a crackdown on pollution hurts some factories.

Chinese economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 is expected to cool to 6.7 percent from a year earlier, but the full-year growth is expected at 6.8 percent, according to the poll.

In 2016, China’s economic growth slowed to a 26-year low of 6.7 percent. The growth pace has inched down every year since 2011.

China’s annual economic growth rate eased to 6.8 percent in July-September from 6.9 percent in the second quarter as the property sector cooled while a government campaign against riskier lending pushes up borrowing costs.

“As overall GDP growth still remains above the government’s target of ‘around 6.5 percent’, we expect policy makers to maintain a tightening bias,” analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note.

“Looking ahead, we expect to see weaker growth, mainly on the investment front, as the impact of tighter financial conditions start to emerge.”

The forecasts for this year and in 2018 were both more optimistic than the polling results in July.

GRADUAL SLOWDOWN

China’s economy has defied expectations of a marked slowdown this year due to a improving global demand for its goods, sustained state infrastructure spending and stronger corporate earnings boosted by soaring factory price rises, analysts said.

In the opening speech of a key, twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress this week, President Xi Jinping said China will deepen economic and financial reforms and further open its markets to foreign investors as it looks to move from high-speed to high-quality growth.

Analysts are looking to the annual Central Economic Work Conference, which is usually held in December, for signals on the 2018 growth target and policy initiatives.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects China to keep its annual growth target at around 6.5 percent in 2018.

Analysts believe the PBOC will keep benchmark lending rates unchanged at 4.35 percent through at least the second quarter of 2019, the Reuters poll showed.

They have pushed back their expectations on a cut in the amount of cash that banks are required hold as reserves, or the reserve requirement ratio (RRR).

The central bank is expected to cut the RRR for all banks by 50 basis points (bps) in the second quarter of 2018 to 16.5 percent, versus the July poll’s prediction for the 50 bps cut in the first quarter of next year.

In late September, the central bank cut the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves (RRR) for the first time since February 2016. The move, effective in January, offers an earnings boost to banks if they lend more to struggling smaller firms and the private sector.

Analysts expect annual consumer inflation to be more muted at 1.6 percent in 2017, down from last year’s 2 percent due to weak food inflation.

Many expect that the U.S. president will decertify Iranian compliance with the deal -- returning U.S.-Iran relations to a state of overt hostility.

Not all in the administration seem to agree with Trump’s harder-line approach on Iran. Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly stated that Trump “should consider staying” in the deal, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has reportedly argued against decertification. Speaking after his first meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, Tillerson also seemed to indicate a willingness to take a longer-term view when he told a media conference that the Washington-Tehran relationship had “never had a stable, happy moment in it.” ”Is this going to be the way it is for the rest of our lives and our children’s lives and our grandchildren’s lives,” he asked.



Tillerson’s remarks evoked an encounter told to me by Mohsen Rafiqdoost, a former Iranian Revolutionary Guards Commander, of a 1982 meeting he had with Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.

Rafiqdoost recalled suggesting that the U.S. embassy grounds in Tehran be converted to a Revolutionary Guards base. Ayatollah Khomeini rejected the idea, asking “Why would you go there? Are we not going to have relations with America for a thousand years?”

It’s clear that decades of estrangement have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Iran in Washington. Notwithstanding the Obama administration’s nuclear negotiations, every U.S. administration since the 1979 Iranian revolution has failed in its declared objective to contain Iran.

If Trump wishes to free future generations of anxiety over U.S.-Iran tensions, he should pay careful attention to five points in formulating his Iran policy.

Shoppers at the Grand Bazaar in the center of Tehran, Iran, August 2, 2017. Nazanin Tabatabaee Yazdi/TIMA via REUTERS

First, American officials need to stop speaking about Iran in threatening and insulting terms. The Iranian people are proud of their thousands of years of history and above all else view mutual respect as integral to their foreign relations. However, Foreign Minister Zarif told me that Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month was the “most insulting speech of any American president toward Iran since the revolution” and that it “made any potential for dialogue with the United States meaningless.”

Second, U.S. regime-change policies have been self-defeating. The principal reason for lasting Iranian distrust of the United States since the revolution has been U.S. policies aimed at undermining and overturning the Iranian political system. In June, Tillerson openly declared that U.S. policy towards Iran included regime change -- a statement not heard from a senior U.S. official in years and which marked a sharp departure from conventional U.S. rhetoric of seeking Iranian “behavior” change.

In stark contrast, Barack Obama told the UN that “we are not seeking regime change and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy.” Consequently, he was able to diplomatically engage Iran on its nuclear program, and reach the July 2015 nuclear deal. The respectful letters exchanged between Obama and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei helped set the process in motion. This would not happen today even if Trump made a similar overture, as the key to successful negotiations with Iran is to first drop regime-change policies.

Third, since the 1953 U.S.-led coup that overthrew democratically-elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, Iranians have resented U.S. interference in Iran. The political landscape of conservatives, moderates, and reformists in Iran is in many ways similar to the competition between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. As such, any agreement between Washington and Tehran must be negotiated in a way that transcends the partisan divide in each country -- or else it would be inherently fragile. The challenges the nuclear deal has been subject to in Washington by the Republican Party is testament to this need. With respect to Iran too, negotiations must be carried out in a way that respects Iran’s political makeup and hierarchies.

Fourth, the Trump administration needs to accept that Iran, as a large country with immense natural resources and an educated population, has legitimate security concerns and interests in its neighborhood. Washington must recognize that U.S. policies aimed at isolating Tehran and refusing to accept a legitimate Iranian role in the region have only seen Iranian influence grow in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon while U.S. influence wanes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. From Iran’s perspective, its post-1979 foreign policy has been driven by the aim of deterring foreign aggression and securing the country’s borders rather than the pursuit of regional hegemony. After the revolution, Iran was invaded by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and, for much of the past decade, chaos on its thousands of miles of borders with Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan – all factors that have compelled it to play a regional role. If the United States wants to avoid scenarios where regional states aggressively compete for power it must encourage the creation of a regional security system involving the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries along with Iraq and Iran.

Finally, the record of U.S.-Iran negotiations shows that “dual track” policies of pressure and diplomacy are destined to fail. While Trump appears to be trying to bring Iran to the negotiating table in a position of weakness, Iranian policymakers tend to respond to pressure by retaliating in kind.

In a recent Washington Post op-ed, former Secretary of State John Kerry highlighted how by the time he entered into negotiations with Iran, after years of sanctions, Iran had “mastered the nuclear fuel cycle” and built a uranium stockpile large enough to make 10 to 12 bombs. “In other words, Iran was already a nuclear-threshold state,” wrote Kerry.

The lesson for Washington here is that if push comes to shove, Tehran will develop its own bargaining chips --- not capitulate in the face of whatever threats are made when Trump delivers his next policy speech on Iran.",Commentary: A former Iranian diplomat on what Trump needs to know about Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mousavian-iran-commentary/commentary-a-former-iranian-diplomat-on-what-trump-needs-to-know-about-iran-idUSKBN1CE22K

Reuters analysis of federal jobs data shows that out of 656,000 new manufacturing jobs created between 2010 and 2014, two thirds can be attributed to foreign direct investment.

More recent jobs numbers are not yet available, but over $700 billion in foreign capital has poured in over the last two years bringing total foreign investment to $3.7 trillion at the end of 2016, a world record.

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

Der arbeitsrechtliche Schutz entsandter Arbeitnehmer wird damit künftig deutlich verbessert”, sagte Bundesarbeitsministerin Katarina Barley am Dienstag.

Die Arbeits- und Sozialminister der EU-Staaten hatten sich am Montagabend auf neue Regeln für den Einsatz von Arbeitern aus anderen EU-Staaten geeinigt. Kern des Streits war, ob Arbeitnehmer aus Osteuropa weiter zu heimischen Niedriglöhnen im reichen Westen arbeiten dürfen. Künftig soll dies nur noch für höchstens 18 Monate möglich sein. Insbesondere der französische Präsident Emmanuel Macron hatte die Verschärfung vorangetrieben, um die Arbeiter in seinem Land besser vor Billigkonkurrenz zu schützen. Endgültig in trockenen Tüchern ist der Kompromiss aber noch nicht.

EU-Kommissionspräsident Jean-Claude Juncker zeigt sich zufrieden. Die Vereinbarung sei ein “großer Schritt für das soziale Europa”, sagte er vor dem Europäischen Parlament.

Der deutsche Arbeitgeberverband BDA kritisierte die Einigung hingegen als Rolle rückwärts für Europa. “Dass es für europäische Unternehmen künftig faktisch einfacher sein soll, einen Beschäftigten nach Indien oder Chile zu entsenden als nach Frankreich oder Italien, wäre eine Rolle rückwärts gegen den Binnenmarkt”, sagte ein Verbandssprecher.

In the western city of Kisumu, around 2,000 demonstrators marched on the election board offices, witnesses said, responding to Raila Odinga’s appeal for protests against Thursday’s repeat presidential ballot. They dispersed peacefully.

Odinga is boycotting the contest against incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta. He says it will not be free and fair because the election board has not made sufficient progress in carrying out reforms he demanded after the original election held in August was annulled.

Odinga had urged his supporters to ensure Thursday’s vote did not take place, repeatedly saying there would be “no elections”.

But on Tuesday he told the BBC he was not calling for protests on polling day itself. “We have not told people to protest on polling day. We have not said that at all. We have told people to stay away,” he said in a radio interview.

When called for clarification, Odinga’s spokesman said he was saying “peaceful protests” would still take place and that the opposition would fully explain their plans on Wednesday.

The country’s Supreme Court is still hearing several cases challenging the legality of Thursday’s poll or Odinga’s withdrawal.

At least 49 people have died in political violence since the August ballot, evoking unwelcome memories of the aftermath of a disputed 2007 poll, when more than 1,200 people were killed.

The political stand-off has also blunted growth in East Africa’s richest economy, a nation valued for its stability and relative freedom in a region roiled by conflict.

Last week Odinga supporters disrupted at least three official pre-polling events. Police said some election board staff were seriously injured.

POLL DELAY?

The head of the election board said last week it was not clear a free and fair poll could take place due to intimidation and political interference.

His comments followed the resignation of an election commissioner, who fled the country and released a statement saying she had been threatened, although she did not say who had done so.

A day before the Aug. 8 poll, another member of the election board had been found tortured and murdered.

On Monday, the International Crisis Group, a global thinktank, called for a delay in the election, saying “proceeding under current conditions would deepen Kenya’s ethnic cleavages and prolong a stalemate that has already claimed dozens of lives and come at a high economic cost.”

Both the election board and the government have said the vote will go ahead, irrespective of whether Odinga contests it, and only a court ruling could legally delay the re-run ballot beyond the end of October.

On Tuesday, police fired tear gas and bullets into the air to disperse protesters in the capital Nairobi.

In Kisumu, an Odinga stronghold, demonstrators said that the polls should not take place, but were unclear on how they should be stopped.

“All we know is that there will be no elections. As to how this will be done, we are waiting for the big announcement by Baba (Odinga) tomorrow,” said one demonstrator, market trader James Ouma.

Around him protesters waved branches and blew whistles as they marched.

Kenyatta officially won the first election, on Aug. 8, by 1.4 million votes, but the Supreme Court annulled that vote on Sept. 1 over procedural irregularities.

After the Supreme Court ruling, Odinga’s team presented a list of demands to the election board.

Some have been met - opposition monitors will now have access to the board’s computers as results come in, a key official has gone on an extended holiday, and results will not be transmitted without a copy of a paper form from tallying centres.

The board said it was impossible to meet other demands - such as changing the technology provider - in the short time frame allotted for new elections.

Even Whole Foods stores that do not share space with major rivals can face constraints imposed by local governments.
And a Best Buy store just north of Miami has the exclusive right in its shopping center to sell electronics.
Gabe Kadosh, vice president at real estate firm Colliers International, said Amazon and Whole Foods “want to have freedom to do whatever they want.","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market met a new foe this summer during talks to lease a top retail space in a San Francisco mall: the Target next door.

As City Center mall’s largest tenant, Target Corp had a say over changes to the property. According to people familiar with the lease discussions, Target balked at sharing the mall with Whole Foods because it feared competition from the grocery chain’s new owner, Amazon.com Inc.

Early attempts to persuade Target failed, and Whole Foods may now have to concede certain Amazon initiatives - such as lockers where customers can pick up goods ordered online - if it wants the location, the people said. Talks are ongoing.

A Reuters examination of real estate agreements and interviews with 20 retail landlords, lawyers and brokers show that the strings attached to operating in malls like City Center present an emerging and little-scrutinized challenge to Amazon’s quest to re-shape Whole Foods.

Across the United States, large retailers including Target, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc and Best Buy Co Inc have legal rights in many lease agreements that allow them to limit what Amazon can do with nearby Whole Foods stores, and where it can open new ones.

Documents reviewed by Reuters show bans on Amazon lockers and delivery operations near a Target store in Illinois and also in Florida, where a new Whole Foods is set to open. Lockers for retrieving online orders are a way for Amazon to spur sales through the grocery chain.

In Manhattan and other locations, the leases of Whole Foods’ big box neighbors bar it from selling a range of goods that Amazon has in its massive online inventory, from electronics to toys and linens.

Even Whole Foods stores that do not share space with major rivals can face constraints imposed by local governments. A city council resolution in White Plains, New York, restricted the hours when Whole Foods can use a loading dock prior to the grocer locating in the mall.

Amazon declined to answer questions about how these restrictions across the country impact its plans.

In a statement, Target said it is “focused on what’s best for the company and delivering on the reasons our guests love Target. Our more than 1,800 stores across the country are a strategic asset and a vital part of Target’s future.”

The company did not discuss details of the restrictions reported by Reuters, but said, “It’s inaccurate to characterize lease agreements as our corporate strategy.”

Reuters could not determine the full extent of limits on Whole Foods stores because lease deals vary from mall to mall, and many are not public. While restricting how neighbors operate is a standard practice in retail, Amazon is new to feeling the heat.

Some mall owners and real estate brokers say Whole Foods will still find landlords who are eager to have the high-profile tenant driving traffic in their malls, and see rivals trying to keep Whole Foods out as short-sighted.

But with nearly all of Whole Foods’ 473 stores subject to lease agreements and plans to add up to 85 stores, according to regulatory filings, Amazon has launched into brick-and-mortar with more constraints and entrenched enemies than in the online world it dominates.

“Many people assume this big, 800-pound gorilla is going to come and beat up all of these retailers,” said Terrison Quinn, a senior vice president at brokerage SRS Real Estate Partners. “I just don’t think that’s going to be the case.”

DOZENS OF RESTRICTIONS

Amazon wasted no time in making changes when the $13.7 billion Whole Foods deal closed in August. The world’s largest online retailer cut grocery prices, started selling its Echo home speaker in stores and disclosed plans to add lockers to some locations and Whole Foods items to Prime Now, its two-hour delivery program.

Analysts expect such moves will boost online orders and revenue for Amazon. But big box rivals have a number of ways to fight back.

Retailers routinely negotiate guarantees that their landlords will not alter malls in a way that hurts sales, whether leasing to a strip club or starting construction projects without approval, real estate lawyers said.

These leases, which often last 10 to 20 years with options to renew, may even name competitors barred from opening a store.

A 16-page memo in July detailing the lease restrictions governing Miami’s Pinecrest Place mall, obtained by Reuters, offers a glimpse of the legal protections retailers are securing.

Target required an affiliate of national landlord Regency Centers Corp to bar “Any lockers, lock-boxes or other type of storage system that is used to receive or store merchandise from a catalog or online retailer.”

The document then specifies more than a dozen other restrictions for the mall, from leasing space to a pet shop or toy store to operating “a fulfillment center in connection with receiving, storing or distributing merchandise from a catalog or online retailer.”

Regency announced in April that Whole Foods will open in the center, meaning the store cannot have Amazon lockers or fulfill orders for Prime Now.

A May memo of lease for a Target in Evanston, Illinois, obtained by Reuters, contains similar prohibitions against lockers and online fulfillment.

In another case, Target raised similar concerns about Amazon for a prospective Whole Foods location at the Stonestown Galleria in San Francisco, people familiar with the matter said.

A Reuters analysis showed that 7 percent of existing Whole Foods' U.S. stores are within a quarter mile, or roughly five-minute walk, of a Target.

OPPOSITION ABOUNDS

Target is not alone in placing limits on Amazon.

Lidl, a German grocery chain expanding in the United States, said in a deal this year it would “prohibit the operation of pickup facilities” by rivals such as “Wal-Mart and Amazon... that sell grocery items” near a planned store on Long Island in New York, according to a person familiar with the matter. The language is becoming common, the person said.

Will Harwood, a spokesman for Lidl, said, “We adhere to industry norms and standard real estate practices when securing sites.”

A Bed Bath & Beyond store in lower Manhattan bars its next-door tenant - Whole Foods - from selling linens, bathroom items, housewares and frames, its memo of lease said. The company declined to comment.

And a Best Buy store just north of Miami has the exclusive right in its shopping center to sell electronics. A lease carve-out, which states other tenants can sell gadgets on less than 250 square feet of floor space, allowed for the mall’s Whole Foods to display the Echo speaker, according to a memo seen by Reuters and a reporter who visited the location.

“It is pretty standard for anchor tenants of a shopping center to reserve the right in their leases to prohibit improvements to a center - including the addition of new tenants - without approval and consent,” said Jeff Shelman, spokesman for Best Buy.

Gabe Kadosh, vice president at real estate firm Colliers International, said Amazon and Whole Foods “want to have freedom to do whatever they want. The challenge is in brick and mortar, and in multi-tenant shopping centers, you can’t just do that.”",Amazon rivals turn to legal fine print to stem Whole Foods strategy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-realestate/amazon-rivals-turn-to-legal-fine-print-to-stem-whole-foods-strategy-idUKKBN1CT0ES

Auto trade associations representing General Motors Co (GM.N) Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and nearly every other major automaker, are part of the coalition dubbed “Driving American Jobs” and backing an advertising campaign to convince the White House and voters that the agreement has been crucial in boosting U.S. automotive sector production and jobs.

Trump has threatened to withdraw from the trade deal with U.S., Canada and Mexico, which is heavily utilized by automakers who have production and supply chains spread across the three countries.

In the most recent round of talks to renegotiate NAFTA last week, Trump proposed changes to the rules of origin for autos, which are used to determine how much of an auto is made in a certain place. The proposed rules were viewed as untenable for automakers, as well as Mexico and Canada.

The auto industry joins the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other large business groups that have become more vocal in recent weeks about Trump’s efforts to change the 23-year-old accord, saying they would be detrimental to American jobs.

The auto coalition, which includes the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association and American International Automobile Dealers Association, said ending NAFTA, which underpins $1.2 trillion in annual trade between the three countries, would put U.S. auto sector jobs at risk.

They pointed to $9.5 billion in new investments announced this year by the auto and auto parts sector and feature the personal stories of auto sector employees throughout America - from plant workers to auto dealership personnel.

“We need you to tell your elected officials that you don’t change the game in the middle of a comeback. We’re winning with NAFTA,” the group said on its website.

The campaign comes amid rising concern that the Trump administration could opt early next year to withdraw after giving six months notice, a move that could expose automakers to high tariffs who are building trucks in Mexico and impose new tariffs on parts and cars made throughout North America.

President Donald Trump told the Fox Business Network in an interview that aired Sunday he thinks the deal will “probably” be renegotiated, but said he will withdraw if it is not fair. “We can’t allow the world to look at us as a whipping post. Not going to happen anymore,” Trump said.

The Chamber of Commerce accused the Trump administration of trying to sabotage the talks with “poison pill proposals,” including demands for more favorable treatment for the U.S. side on car production, and a “sunset clause” to force regular negotiations.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said earlier this month the Trump administration was focused on trying to get an agreement that was fair but said he had “seen no indication that our partners are willing to make any changes that will result in a rebalancing and a reduction in these huge trade deficits.”

Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in the region must be from North America to be able to enter the marketplace tariff-free.

Trump has asked his fellow Republicans who control Congress to pass a package of tax cuts, including a deep reduction in the corporate income tax, by year’s end.

But hours before he was to promote the tax plan at a weekly lunch for Republican senators on Capitol Hill, Trump engaged in a distracting tussle with one of those lawmakers: Bob Corker, a leading fiscal hawk and the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

“Bob Corker, who ... couldn’t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts,” Trump wrote on Twitter, later adding that the senator is “incompetent.”

Alienating any members of his own party could be costly for Trump’s legislative initiatives in the Senate because Republicans control the chamber by just a slim 52-48 margin.

Corker warned Trump in television interviews against interfering in congressional efforts to finalize the legislation to cut taxes and called the president’s visit with Senate Republicans “a photo op.”

“Hopefully, the White House will step aside and let that occur in a normal process,” the Tennessee Republican told NBC’s “Today” program. “That’s the best way for us to have success.”

Corker also described Trump in a Twitter post as “an utterly untruthful president,” and in television interviews accused Trump of debasing the United States.

‘HISTORIC CHANCE’

House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan urged reporters to ignore the Trump-Corker spat and concentrate on the tax plan.

“Put this Twitter dispute aside. The fact is we have an historic chance of fixing this tax code,” Ryan said.

Ryan added that he knows Corker well and predicted that the senator is “going to vote for tax reform.”

Ryan said he wants the House to pass the Republican tax cut bill by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, echoing Trump’s call to speed up the party’s efforts to get the measure approved before year’s end.

Securing congressional passage of his tax plan is critically important to Trump, who has yet to get major legislation through Congress since taking office in January, including a healthcare overhaul he promised as a candidate last year. Tax cuts were another of Trump’s campaign pledges.

The White House argues that tax cuts are needed to boost economic growth and create jobs, but has shown sensitivity in recent weeks to arguments that it is endangering America’s long-term fiscal health.

One of the key elements of the proposal is to slash the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. While the broad parameters of the tax proposal have been made public, detailed legislation has not yet been unveiled.

Democrats have painted Trump’s plan, with its $6 trillion in tax cuts, as a gift to the rich and corporate America that would balloon the federal deficit.

After-hours television was built around the set-piece interview and guest appearance when Letterman’s “Late Night” broke the mold in 1982 with absurd pranks and send-ups.

Everyday viewers went on his show to present “stupid pet tricks.” Behind his desk, Letterman could be serious, dry and cerebral. But he often volunteered for oddball pranks. In one well-known stunt, he worked a shift at a Taco Bell in suburban New Jersey, taking pickup orders.

In another sketch, Letterman was dunked in water while covered in Alka Seltzer tablets.

Many younger comedians, including current late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, have described Letterman as a major influence.

“Dave brought this doorknob out. And he put it on a table. And he said ‘It’s just plain big.’ That was it.”

Letterman hosted more than 6,000 episodes of his original “Late Night with David Letterman” on NBC and its successor on CBS, “Late Show with David Letterman,” which ended its run in May 2015.

He won multiple Emmy Awards, U.S. television’s highest honor, for his work as a writer, performer and producer.

The Indiana native made his first of 22 appearances on “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson” in 1978. After hosting “Late Night” for 11 years, he moved to CBS in 1993 after losing out to longtime rival Jay Leno to succeed Carson at “The Tonight Show”.

On Sunday, comic friends teased Letterman about his late-night wars with Leno and retirement but the honoree struck a poignant note in his acceptance speech.

“Mark Twain’s definition of patriotism is this: Patriotism is supporting your country all the time and your government when it deserves it.”

In 2012, Letterman was recognized for his contributions to the arts and American culture at the Kennedy Center Honors, a lifetime achievement awards for performing artists.

3M (MMM.N), another Dow component, which makes products such as autoparts and office supplies, reported upbeat results as well. Its stock was up 6.9 percent.

Corporate earnings have gotten off to a strong start, with 73.2 percent of the 97 S&P companies beating profit expectations as of Monday versus a 72-percent beat rate over the past four quarters.

Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR were last down 9/32 in price to yield 2.4081 percent, from 2.375 percent late on Monday.

The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond US30YT=RR were last down 21/32 in price to yield 2.9226 percent, from 2.89 percent late on Monday.

Higher treasury yields are a result of the Federal Reserve’s plan to reduce its bond portfolio as well as the expectation of a December interest rate hike, said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.

“The bond reduction program will affect the long end of the bond curve, so the longer-term yields, like the 5-years and 10-years, have been going up as a result of that,” he said.

U.S. Treasury yields tracked European government bond yields higher. German Bund yields hit two-week peaks. Strong business and bank lending surveys backed a growing view the European Central Bank will announce a reduction of its monthly bond purchases on Thursday.

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid.
The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play.
The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.
From 2009-2011, he led the Department of Justice’s disability rights enforcement as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.","On September 7, on a straight party-line vote, the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee moved forward a bill that would gut key protections for people with disabilities. Although versions of this legislation had been introduced in prior years, the bill did not go anywhere while President Barack Obama stood ready to veto it. But now that President Donald Trump, whose actions have demonstrated hostility to civil rights, occupies the White House, the proposal presents a real risk of passage. If Republicans in Congress do eviscerate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it will be the culmination of their recent abandonment of the bipartisan consensus in favor of inclusion and equality for disabled persons.

Although the partisan divide in Washington has often seemed unbridgeable, disability rights long united lawmakers. Republican President George H.W. Bush referred to the ADA, which he signed in 1990, as one of his “proudest achievements.” The law guaranteed that people with disabilities would have access to, and be free from discrimination by, employers, businesses, and government agencies. In 2008, after a series of court decisions that gave a narrow reading to the ADA, a Democratic Congress passed amendments to the ADA reasserting the statute’s broad coverage - and President George W. Bush signed it.

The Trump administration is hacking away at disability rights online and in the workplace, while Trump and congressional Republicans work to gut funding for programs people with disabilities rely on such as Medicaid. The partial ADA-repeal bill is only the most overt assault on disability rights - the culmination of a shift that began when, in December 2012, 38 Republican senators denied the two-thirds vote needed for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was modeled on the ADA and ardently supported by disabled GOP luminaries such as former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But while that action was merely symbolic red meat for their base – conservatives worried it would inhibit homeschooling and infringe U.S. sovereignty - this new proposal could cause tangible and long-lasting harm.

The current bill, misleadingly titled the “ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017,” would render largely unenforceable key ADA requirements that businesses be accessible to disabled consumers – requirements that they provide ramps instead of stairs where possible, that doorways be wide enough for wheelchairs and so forth.

For wheelchair users, a single step – or a door that is a bit too narrow – can be the barrier that prevents them from patronizing a store. A few inches can make the difference between being full participants in civic and economic life and being dependent on others and shut off from the community.

Businesses have had 27 years to learn about and conform to the ADA’s requirements. But too many still fail to comply with the law, because enforcement relies principally on suits by disabled individuals. Wheelchair users, blind persons, and other people with disabilities encounter inaccessible businesses on a daily basis. According to 2016 Department of Labor statistics, only 31.2 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities had jobs, compared to 76.4 percent of working-age nondisabled Americans. The failure of employers, including stores and restaurants, to provide required accommodations is one of the key reasons for this persistent gap. Surveys show inaccessibility also causes people with disabilities to eat out less often.

The ADA does not give a disabled customer the right to receive damages for a denial of service, just an injunction that requires the owner to remove the barrier. This limitation already creates an incentive for inaccessible businesses to wait until they are sued before complying. Under the bill that recently passed the judiciary committee, the incentive to wait and see will be even greater. The proposal would prevent a disabled person from suing a business that violates the ADA as long as the business makes “substantial progress in removing the barrier,” within six months of being notified. A business might be able to avoid ever complying with the ADA or facing a lawsuit. It’s a system designed to allow businesses to delay until the victim runs out of energy or money to keep pursuing them.

Sponsors of the “ADA Education and Reform Act,” such as Texas Republican Ted Poe, say that the bill is necessary to stop unscrupulous lawyers from bringing frivolous or abusive ADA cases against small businesses. But state bars, and individual judges, already have ample authority to sanction attorneys who engage in such unprofessional conduct. And the ADA itself protects the interests of business owners by providing that an existing facility need not remove accessibility barriers unless doing so is easy to accomplish without significant expense.

Rather than protecting legitimate business interests, the bill pending in Congress would give a reprieve to enterprises that have had 27 years to comply with the law but have not yet done so. That is a betrayal of the basic promise of the ADA – that people with disabilities would be treated as equal citizens, with full access to America’s civic and economic life.

It is just the latest Republican betrayal of the historic bipartisan support for disability rights. In the Trump administration, attacks on disability rights have accelerated. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department has already reversed course in a key lawsuit, prosecuted by the Obama administration, involving the rights of disabled workers to retain their jobs. The White House has also signaled a halt to the Obama-era efforts to adopt regulations ensuring that the Internet is accessible to blind people and others with disabilities.

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid. If they succeed Republicans would remove benefits that allow people with disabilities to access health insurance and home health services. Instead of staying in their communities and possibly working, many would be institutionalized. Trump has also proposed in his budget to cut drastically into Social Security Disability Insurance, the only source of income for millions of Americans unable to work.

The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play. The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.

Lo riferiscono alcune fonti vicine al dossier.

La società di recente ha sondato le banche per l‘operazione che dovrebbe avvenire già a giugno o luglio 2018 per consentire l‘uscita di uno degli azionisti, secondo le fonti.

SpringerNature è una joint venture controllata al 53% dall‘editore tedesco Holtzbrinck e per il resto dall‘operatore di private equity BC Partners.

E’ nata nel 2015 dalla fusione della divisione Macmillan Science and Education di Holtzbrinck con il business Springer di BC Partners, che pubblica libri e riviste scientifici, tecnici e medici. All‘epoca la società venne valutata più di 5 miliardi di euro incluso il debito.

BC Partners non ha voluto commentare, mentre Holtzbrinck non è stata raggiungibile per un commento nell‘immediato.

Secondo una delle fonti, Holtzbrinck potrebbe voler tenere la maggioranza dopo la quotazione.

SpringerNature, che pubblica circa 3.000 riviste scientifiche e circa 12.000 nuovi libri ogni anno, dovrebbe realizzare l‘anno prossimo un Ebitda di 480 milioni di euro e potrebbe essere valutata, secondo una fonte, fino a 6,5-7 miliardi incluso il debito per 3 miliardi.

In an inaugural Bundestag session following the Sept. 24 federal election, lawmakers from the other parties showed their disdain for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party by overwhelmingly rejecting its candidate for deputy speaker.

Convention holds that each party represented in the Bundestag names a deputy speaker. But lawmakers spurned AfD candidate Albert Glaser in three rounds of voting.

Still, the AfD, which has become the first far-right group represented in Germany’s parliament for more than half a century, made clear its intention to shake up German politics on the national stage.

“The people have decided, now a new era begins,” AfD parliamentary leader Bernd Baumann told the chamber.

Schaeuble, who won 501 of 705 votes for the post of speaker, shot back in his maiden speech: “Nobody on their own represents the people.”

Germany’s longest serving lawmaker, 75-year-old Schaeuble is one of the country’s most respected politicians and seen as well qualified to tame recalcitrant lawmakers.

By agreeing to move to the Bundestag, Schaeuble has opened the way for the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) to take over his powerful Finance Ministry, helping to unblock talks on an expected new three-way coalition with the Greens.

The conservatives, FDP and Greens convene on Tuesday evening for coalition talks.

FDP leader Christian Lindner told broadcaster n-tv that Schaeuble was an extraordinary figure in German politics:

“He has gravitas, a clear position and a natural authority that will be good to have in a parliament that has just become more diverse, and where some manners may be called into question.”

The AfD’s Baumann shocked other lawmakers by suggesting that they had used Nazi-era tactics to prevent Glaser from taking a deputy speaker post. FDP politician Marco Buschmann said the comments were “beyond tasteless.”

The AfD can nominate an alternative candidate for deputy speaker. Although there is precedent for a party’s first choice being rejected, there is no precedent for a party failing to have any lawmaker accepted in the post.

The bank, whose fixed-income trading revenue slumped last quarter, has signed a multi-year deal to use Mosaic Smart Data’s technology division globally, the companies said in a joint statement released on Sunday.

The London-based start-up has developed technology that aggregates and analyzes vast amounts of data from the fixed-income trading division of investment banks to help them make more informed decisions and gain a competitive edge.

That includes helping traders decide which clients to focus on in a given day or enabling management to assess which trader, or trading desk has been performing better.

The partnership underscores the growing demand by banks for technology that can help them gain greater insight from the large quantity of data they produce and store.

“One of the key things the banks are starting to realize is that some of their biggest competitive advantages are locked within their data,” said Matthew Hodgson, Mosaic Smart Data’s founder and chief executive.

Banks are seeking solutions to deal with a liquidity crunch in fixed-income markets. Stricter capital requirements imposed after the 2008 financial crisis have made it more expensive for banks to act as market makers in corporate bonds, leading their fixed-income divisions to slump.

JP Morgan’s fixed-income markets revenue fell 27 percent in the three months ended in September, compared with the same period last year.

Troy Rohrbaugh, global head of macro at JPMorgan, said in a statement that Mosaic Smart Data’s technology could make the bank’s teams “quickly make better informed decisions.”

Mosaic Smart Data is the first company to complete JPMorgan’s “In-Residence” program for fintech start-ups, which was launched in 2016. The program gives young fintech companies support in helping commercialize their products and services.

Hodgson said the idea for the company came from his own experience heading trading at large banks.

Cleber Rene Rizerio Rocha, who prosecutors said tried to help get money out of the United States that a co-founder of TelexFree Inc left behind when he fled the country, entered his plea in federal court in Boston.

Rocha, who pled guilty to conspiracy and money laundering charges, is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 7. While the charges each carry up to 20 years in prison, prosecutors have agreed to recommend a 40-month term based on his cooperation.

The 28-year-old’s case stemmed from an investigation of TelexFree, a Massachusetts-based company that sold voice-over-internet telephone service and was founded by James Merrill, a U.S. citizen, and Carlos Wanzeler, a Brazilian.

Prosecutors said TelexFree was a pyramid scheme, making little to no money selling its service while taking in millions of dollars from thousands of people who paid to sign up to be “promoters” and post ads online for it.

TelexFree collapsed in 2014, inflicting more than $3 billion in losses on nearly 1.89 million people worldwide, prosecutors said.

Merrill was arrested in 2014. He was sentenced in March to six years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges.

Wanzeler in 2014 fled to Brazil, where he cannot be extradited from, leaving behind tens of millions of dollars he laundered from TelexFree accounts, prosecutors said.

In 2015, Leonardo Casula Francisco, Wanzeler’s nephew, asked someone who became a cooperating witness to help transfer cash generated from the scheme that Wanzeler had hidden in the greater Boston area out of the United States, prosecutors said.

The pair agreed someone would be sent to the United States to deliver the money in increments to the witness, who would send it to accounts in Hong Kong where it would be transferred to Brazil, prosecutors said.

In December, Casula sent Rocha to the United States to deliver money to the witness, an indictment said.

After a Jan. 4 meeting in a parking lot where Rocha gave the witness $2.2 million in a suitcase, federal agents followed Rocha to a Westborough, Massachusetts, apartment complex, prosecutors said.

They said that after Rocha was arrested, he helped agents locate the apartment, where they found $17 million hidden under a mattress.",Brazilian who led U.S. to $17 million under mattress pleads guilty,https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKBN1CO2I1

>> China my produce the most electric cars in the world but there's a looming problem. Just where do the piles of exhausted lithium batteries used to power them go? It's why the country's recycling plants are bracing themselves. Upgrading facilities to cope with the fast growing mountains of new waste.

But as Reuters David Stanway explains, there's another hurdle.>> As it comes a time when the country is trying to crack down on street level recyclers responsible for a huge amounts of pollution. It also comes as well as millions of old fashioned LED batteries which China has traditionally struggled to deal with.

So this is just one more challenge to pile on top of the rest when it comes to recycling in China. If China is going to be producing seven million electric vehicles per year by 2025, you have to consider that each vehicle has thousands and thousands of batteries in it to power it.

So this is going to be a huge problem.>> With more electric cars now being made in China the production of lithium batteries has also soared. About 7 billion were pumped out by Chinese manufacturers this year alone, which despite the challenges could mean a big opportunity for the country's growing recycling industry.

>> They're hoping that it will be easier when it comes to electric batteries because these are higher quality products. It's not lead, it's not acid, and there is a certain recycling value to come out of this battery. Each one weighs about 50 grams, and something like 70% of that material can be recycled and sold on.",China eyes looming electric vehicle battery mountain,https://www.reuters.tv/v/aDG/2017/10/24/china-eyes-looming-electric-vehicle-battery-mountain

Among Italy’s 20 regions, Lombardy and Veneto account for just under a third of its economic output and are home to around 25 percent of its population.

Unlike a recent referendum on independence in Catalonia, which sparked a political crisis in Spain, the Italian votes this weekend were legal, but not binding on Rome.

Making clear he had no intention of making a drama out of the twin ballots, Gentiloni said he was ready to discuss how Lombardy and Veneto wanted to proceed.

“Here we are talking about how to make Italy work better. We are not calling into question Italy and its unity,” Gentiloni said during a visit to an oil refinery close to Venice, the capital of the northeastern Veneto region.

“The government is ready to look into the merits of this ... it will be a complex discussion that can’t be done in five minutes,” he added.

Regional governments have the right to ask for greater oversight in 23 policy areas, including the environment, infrastructure, health and education.

The most delicate negotiations are likely to be over tax returns, with Veneto demanding that it be allowed to spend 90 percent of all the taxes raised on its own territory.

Among Italy’s 20 regions, Lombardy and Veneto account for just under a third of its economic output and are home to around 25 percent of its population.

Italy’s poorer, less developed southern regions are worried that they will receive less funding in future if Lombardy and Veneto get to keep more of their own tax take.

Five regions in Italy -- the islands of Sicily and Sardinia and three relatively small border areas with linguistic minorities -- already have special autonomous status under the constitution. Veneto wants to join them.

However, this would need a change to the constitution, which the government seems unwilling to accept.

“We are ready (to grant greater powers) within the limits fixed by our laws and by our constitution,” Gentiloni said.

Negotiations are likely to take many months and look certain to be interrupted by national elections due by next May. Any deal between the government and the regions will have to be approved by parliament.

The latest opinion polls suggest a hung parliament will emerge from the forthcoming election, making it impossible to predict the government formation that will carry on the negotiations.

Nuclear-armed Pakistan, a staunch U.S. Cold War ally and key player in the U.S.-backed invasion of Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, has watched warily as Washington has in recent years pivoted towards its arch-foe.

Islamabad views its much-bigger neighbor as an existential threat and the two nations have fought three wars since their violent separation at the end of colonial rule in 1947.

Tillerson, due to meet Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Pakistan’s powerful military chiefs in a one-day visit, is expected to urge Pakistan to do more to root out Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network militants operating on its soil.

But he is also expected to hear Pakistani officials warn him that drawing nuclear-armed India deeper into Afghanistan would destabilise the region and do little to end the 16-year war that is now America’s longest military conflict.

“Bringing India into the mix is like adding kerosene to fire,” said Miftah Ismail, a state minister and close ally of Prime Minister Abbasi.

“It’s a complete red line. India has no political role to play in Afghanistan as far as we are concerned.”

Many Pakistanis feel betrayed that its traditional ally is now cosying up to India over Afghanistan.

But the anger runs both ways.

The United States accuses Pakistan of playing a double game since 2001, offering public backing to Washington while turning a blind eye, or even at times assisting, the Afghan Taliban and other militants who carry out deadly attacks against U.S. forces and their allies in Afghanistan.

LAST CHANCE

Pakistan supported the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s as a hedge to Indian influence in Afghanistan, and analysts say its military and security services maintained ties long after the Taliban regime was toppled in 2001.

Pakistan denies providing a safe haven for Afghan Taliban and other militant fighters.

Tillerson, during a visit to Afghanistan on Monday, said Washington has made some “very specific requests of Pakistan in order for them to take action to undermine the support the Taliban receives and other terrorist organizations receive”.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis earlier this month said the United States would try “one more time” to work with Pakistan in Afghanistan, before opting for more punitive measures. President Donald Trump has vowed to be tougher on Pakistan than his predecessors.

The United States has threatened further military aid cuts and U.S. officials have mooted targeted sanctions against Pakistani military figures, but in the past two weeks there have been hints of a slight thawing in ties.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Tillerson last week called Abbasi to thank Pakistan after its army rescued a U.S.-Canadian couple who were held hostage by the Taliban-allied Haqqani network for nearly five years, along with their three children born in captivity.

Relations were further boosted when Omar Khalid Khorasani, leader of the lethal Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) group who Islamabad had been trying to catch for years, was killed by a U.S. drone strike last week.

HOSTILE NEIGHBORS

India has increased aid to Afghanistan in recent years and last year promised to ship more arms. Such moves have aggravating fears in Pakistan that it will find itself wedged between two hostile neighbors.

Islamabad bristles at the idea that India holds the key to ending the Afghanistan conflict, and fears U.S. meddling could unsettle a delicate balance of power in South Asia.

“Promoting a higher involvement of India in Afghanistan will only worsen the historic strategic rivalries playing out in the region,” said Sherry Rehman, Pakistan’s former ambassador to United States and a senior member of the opposition Pakistan People’s Party.

Pakistan points to the 3.5 million Afghan refugees it hosts as proof that it has more than anyone else to lose from chaos in Afghanistan, and has emphasized the need for greater cooperation and intelligence sharing with United States and Afghanistan.

But while Pakistan may not like it, India looks set to continue playing a role in Afghanistan, according to Sushant Sareen, a foreign policy analyst at the Vivekananda International Foundation, a think-tank with ties to the government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“The message is very clear that India is an important player when it comes to coordinating policies between Afghanistan and Washington,” said Sareen.","As Tillerson heads to Pakistan, Islamabad wary of deepening U.S.-India ties",https://www.reuters.com/article/pakistan-usa-india/as-tillerson-heads-to-pakistan-islamabad-wary-of-deepening-u-s-india-ties-idINKBN1CS21D

Relations between uneasy allies United States and Pakistan have frayed in recent years, with Washington accusing Islamabad of turning a blind eye or helping Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network militants who stage attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan denies doing so.

President Donald Trump has vowed to get tough with Pakistan unless it changed its behaviour, with U.S. officials threatening further reductions in aid and mooting targeted sanctions against Pakistani officials.

Tillerson, on a tour of Asia and the Middle East, arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday afternoon and met with Abbasi, as well as Pakistan’s powerful army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa.

“We are committed in the war against terror,” Abbasi told Tillerson, as the two men sat facing each other on a long table.

“We have produced results. And we are looking forward to moving ahead with the U.S. and building a tremendous relationship,” added Abbasi, who sat next to Bajwa.

During a short part of the meeting available to media, Tillerson told the Pakistani delegation that the nuclear-armed nation was an important U.S. ally in the region.

“(Pakistan is) important regionally to our joint goals of providing peace and security to the region and providing opportunity for greater economic relationship as well,” Tillerson said.

U.S officials say they are frustrated that Afghan Taliban and Haqqani militants are afforded freedom of movement and are able to transport weapons and raise funds inside Pakistan, something their Islamabad counterparts staunchly deny.

On Monday, during a visit to Kabul, Tillerson urged Pakistan to act against safe havens on its soil.

“Pakistan needs to, I think, take a clear-eyed view of the situation that they are confronted with in terms of the number of terrorist organisations that find safe haven inside of Pakistan.”

“RED LINE”

Pakistani officials bristle at the idea that the country is not doing enough against militants and say Pakistan has suffered more than 60,000 casualties in the war on terror since the Sept. 11 attacks in United States in 2001.

In recent years Pakistan has made substantial gains against militants and the number of attacks have drastically reduced, but some militant groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and the Islamic State continue to pose a threat and have periodically staged large-scale attacks.

Pakistan recently started to fence its long and porous 2,500-km border with Afghanistan in an attempt to stop militants criss-crossing the frontier.

As well as support for the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network, another sticking point in the relationship has been growing closeness by the United States to India, Pakistan’s arch-foe and neighbour.

Tillerson said last week that the Trump administration wanted to “dramatically deepen” cooperation with New Delhi, partly to offset Chinese influence in Asia. Trump has also called for greater Indian role in Afghanistan.

But this deepening in ties has alarmed Pakistan, which has rejected a greater political role for India for Afghanistan as a “red line” for Islamabad.
